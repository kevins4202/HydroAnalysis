6020,carbonate aquifers probably constitute the most important thermal water resources in non volcanic areas and are characteristic of great energy potential and easier production as the most ideal targets for development in the future the thermal waters in the aquifers within southeast chongqing sec of china occur in an extensive region with an area of 198 000 km2 which are mainly hosted in the cambrian and ordovician carbonate evaporite rocks the thermal waters are mainly in pristine conditions and their genesis has not yet been fully understood the occurrence of thermal waters in sec is closely related to the presence of deep seated faults which constitute pathways for the hydrothermal circulation in this study an investigation of water major ions and environmental isotopes from 14 hot springs and three drilled wells was carried out to examine their hydrogeochemical evolution and to estimate reservoir temperature the thermal waters have outflow temperatures from 19 to 54 2 c they are divided into two hydrochemical groups with the yushan fault as a boundary group a located to the west of the fault are characterized by facies of chloride sodium waters with higher tds group b to the east of the fault are more complicated sulfate bicarbonate chloride alkaline earth waters with lower tds the hydrochemical processes such as dissolution of carbonate gypsum and or anhydrite and halite the common ion effect and dedolomitization are evident based on the major ions and δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 the δ18o and δd compositions of the thermal waters suggest a meteoric recharge in a relatively wetter and colder climatic condition the silica geothermometers show that the average reservoir temperatures are 63 18 c for group a and 82 15 c for group b the corresponding average reservoir depths are estimated to be 2 5 0 7 km for group a and 3 2 0 7 km for group b the corrected 14c ages of the thermal waters average at 14 8 ka bp corresponding to the late pleistocene a conceptual circulation model is proposed for the thermal waters driven by gravity of topographic gradients the percolating groundwater circulates at a specific depth reaching a higher temperature and interacting with the host carbonate with imbedded evaporitic minerals gypsum and or anhydrite and additional halite for group a to be saline deep seated thermal fluids the fluids rise along faults and emerge at the surface as thermal springs the slow renewability rate of the thermal aquifers highlights the importance of assessing the resource before groundwater exploitation and extraction keywords thermal water carbonate rocks isotopes fault paleo recharge southeast chongqing in china 1 introduction the occurrence of thermal water is associated with lithostratigraphic and structural conditions the most intensively studied thermal water systems are those associated with active volcanic areas e g dobson et al 2018 kalacheva et al 2018 kavouridis et al 1999 mcmillan et al 2018 however carbonate aquifers probably constitute the most important thermal water resources outside of volcanic areas which have received attention for their value in space heating electric power generation and recreational purposes goldscheider et al 2010 although there is no detailed and reliable global assessment of thermal water resources goldscheider et al 2010 deep carbonate aquifers characterized by great energy potential and easier production are the most ideal targets for development kong et al 2014 pang et al 2012 2014 the thermal water resources in continental carbonate rock aquifers are normally related with deep and regional flow systems and characterized by trans formational hydraulic continuity e g goldscheider et al 2010 tóth 1995 yang et al 2013 groundwater circulation in these situations can be described as a regional flow system which is generally gravity driven by topographic gradients jiang et al 2012 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 tóth 1963 yang et al 2017 the precipitation falling in the higher elevation regions percolates into the aquifer and is heated to result in deep seated thermal fluids ascending thermal fluid paths are generally controlled by faults and fracture zones which represent zones of enhanced permeability qiu et al 2018 stober et al 2016 however most of the carbonate thermal waters at great depths with deep water circulation are often poorly understood goldscheider et al 2010 geochemistry and isotopes are indispensable tools for studying the hydrogeologic structure and functioning of these systems geochemical and isotopic techniques applied during stages of exploration and evaluation of geothermal resources as well as monitoring studies are particularly important because of the information they provide relatively fast and at low cost d amore and arnórsson 2000a fournier 1977 moreover thermal waters including springs and well water potentially provide information on geochemical processes acting deep within aquifers gunn et al 2006 as such investigation of the geochemical and related isotopic characteristics of thermal waters is always one of first steps in the evaluation of the geothermal potential of an area the basic approaches of studying thermal waters are to use the major ions stable isotopes and radioisotope data to define hydrochemical characteristics the source of major ions and water groundwater residence time and other hydrodynamic features e g aquilina et al 2003 gunn et al 2006 ma et al 2011 utting et al 2013 yang et al 2017 the application of geochemical and isotopic methods in thermal exploration thus can provide very useful information on geochemical evolution water circulation and water rock interactions within the carbonate aquifers that are difficult to obtain by other techniques moreover a crucial point in the exploration of thermal water resources is to know the precise temperature at depth of a particular geothermal reservoir the most reliable temperatures are obtained by static bottom hole temperature surveys for exploratory or production wells however this way of temperature surveying although often inevitable is the most expensive approach due to the costly investment for exploratory drilling adam and jan 2009 the application of chemical and isotopic groundwater temperature indicators the so called geothermometers is based on temperature dependent water rock chemical equilibrium chemical reactions or isotope equilibrium fractionation relations from which the equilibrium temperatures can be estimated d amore and arnórsson 2000b the geothermometrical methods mainly include cation geothermometers e g fournier and truesdell 1973 giggenbach 1988 verma and santoyo 1997 silica geothermometers e g fournier 1977 verma and santoyo 1997 isotopic geothermometers e g blasco et al 2018 lloyd 1968 and the theoretical geothermometer based on chemical thermodynamic modelling e g pang and reed 1998 the estimated temperatures for the deep reservoir allow reducing the cost of geothermal exploration in china geothermal resources of the major basins are 24 964 4 1018 j which is equivalent to 8531 9 108 tons of standard coal the geothermal resources within the sichuan basin accountforthelargestportion calculated to be as much as 31 of the total geothermal resources in china wang et al 2013 located in east sichuan basin chongqing municipality has 107 areas that include thermal water resources and some of them are stored in triassic carbonate rock aquifers within the urban area e g ta et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 yang et al 2017 2019 the hydrogeochemistry of the carbonate thermal water within the urban area of chongqing were investigated in detail showing that high concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 in the thermal waters are derived from the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite xiao et al 2018 yang et al 2017 2019 and reservoir temperatures were estimated to be 64 8 93 4 c averaging at 82 c yang et al 2017 however compared to the urban area the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of the carbonate thermal waters within southeastern chongqing sec are still unknown and no literature about the hydrothermal characteristics is available which is probably attributable to the remote location and complex geology of the area moreover the social and economic development value will be elevated as the construction for the high speed rail connecting the urban area and the sec fig 1 a will be completed in 2024 the demand for thermal water resources will inevitably be increasing within sec which requires a thorough investigation of the hydrothermal aquifers for their potential and renewability for exploitation this task is impossible to achieve without knowledge of the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry within sec it is therefore highly necessary to bridge the gap of knowledge for the thermal aquifers within sec the study mainly aims to 1 characterize the hydrochemical properties of the thermal waters 2 understand the water rock interaction processes occurring at depth 3 determine the recharge times and estimate the geothermal reservoir temperatures and their corresponding depths and 4 propose a conceptual hydrogeological model for genesis of the thermal waters to achieve these objectives a combination of methods including geochemistry major ions isotopes 34sso4 18oso4 18oh2o 2hh2o 13cdic 14cdic and geothermometers were used to study the hydrothermal systems the methodological approaches utilized in this study are more relevant and useful in similar geological hydrogeological and geochemical frameworks characterized by fault controlled low temperature carbonate hydrothermal systems 2 study area 2 1 geographical settings geographically the sec is located in the southeast part of chongqing municipality fig 1a it includes the districts of qianjiang and wulong counties of shizhu youyang pengshui and xiushan the local mean annual air temperature and rainfall are approximately 16 6 c and 1300 mm respectively the landscape is dominated by hilly terraces with a relative elevation difference of 500 1000 m functioning as the local base level of erosion several rivers run through the study area such as wu river zhufo river and a peng river in this study for chemical and isotopic analysis a total of 14 hot spring sites and three geothermal drilled wells from sec were obtained during december 2017 and june 2018 all of the sample points and their sampling nos are shown in fig 1a the original set of chemical and isotopic data of thermal fluids discharge from a region with an area of 19 800 km2 which accounts for approximately 20 of chongqing municipality comprised between n 28 30 and e 107 5 109 3 as shown in fig 1a 2 2 geological and hydrogeological settings the sec is characterized by a series of parallel and trending ne sw folds with alternating anticlines and synclines fig 1b stratigraphically the outcropping formations include paleozoic to quaternary sedimentary layers lacking the upper silurian devonian carboniferous formations due to paleo erosion the lower cambrian stratum consists of siltstone and shale with a thickness of 373 m gbsp 1979 the upper and middle cambrian strata are limestone and dolomitic limestone with a thickness of 1044 1322 m which are imbedded with evaporites halite gypsum and or anhydrite indicating the transition to a paralic continental environment the lower ordovician formations are composed of limestone dolomite and bioclastic limestone with a thickness of 228 294 m the middle and upper ordovician middle and lower silurian strata mainly consist of shale and sandstone up to 2000 m thick the permian and triassic strata are composed of shale marl and limestone containing chert nodules with a thickness of 1190 2009 m the jurassic and cenozoic formations are composed of shale sandstone and breccia which were uplifted and partially eroded the quaternary formation is distributed sporadically faults are well developed with the ne sw trend and dip to the northwest at around 60 in the study area most faults are developed in limbs of the anticlines and cut through the ordovician and cambrian carbonate formations at depths more than 3 km fig 1b accounting for almost 55 of the study area the carbonate aquifers mainly consist of limestone and dolomite with resurgences via hot and shallow karst springs with an average runoff of 4 5 l s per km2 the hydrothermal systems within sec are manifested by hot springs emerging around the faults at elevations of 184 960 m a s l these hot springs are artesian and issue from cambrian and ordovician carbonate rocks mainly aligned along the faults fig 1a the deep seated faults are assumed to be major controls on groundwater flow and act as preferential pathways for thermal water ascent stratigraphically the hot springs are located at the flanks of anticlines in the context of this study the upper and middle cambrian and the lower ordovician carbonate evaporite rocks are of special interest in the study area as they constitute the potential geothermal reservoir for the thermal springs these geothermal formations are affected by a highly developed deep seated fault system which could be responsible for the regional hydrothermal activities especially where permeability is enhanced by well developed faulting fracturing and karstification processes the geothermal reservoir is highly permeable with a hydraulic conductivity of 11 5 m d calculated by the pumping test from the aquifer around sample no 12 the thermal cover layer consists of the middle and upper ordovician silurian permian and triassic strata more than 3000 m thick the lower cambrian stratum below the carbonate evaporite rocks serves as the semi confining bed underlying the thermal reservoir the regional terrestrial heat flow and average geothermal gradient are about 53 7 8 7 mw m2 jiang et al 2019 and 21 c km with depth see section 5 3 respectively the hydrogeochemistry and possible sulfate sources of the shallow karst groundwaters in the study area were investigated by pu et al 2013 most hot springs are not used and discharge into the rivers except samples nos 9 and 10 which are used for spa and therapeutic purposes by the local residents in recent years three geothermal wells samples nos 3 12 and 13 were drilled and provide thermal water for the commercial spa 3 methodology and materials 3 1 sampling and measurements water temperature ph and specific conductivity spc were directly measured in the field using a wtw multi3630 probe wtw germany with accuracies of 0 1 c 0 01ph unit and 1μs cm respectively the hco3 concentration was determined in the field by titration with an alkalinity kit merck germany with an

carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic were promptly sampled in a 1 l high density polyethylene bottle to avoid mixing with air co2 before collecting thermal water samples all sampling bottles were flushed with the same thermal water which was to be sampled later the samples for cation measurement were acidified by adding nitric acid to make the ph 2 immediately after sampling all sample bottles were carefully sealed with airtight caps and were refrigerated at 4 c to minimize bacterial growth major cations were determined by 5110 inductively coupled plasma optical

major cations and anions and saturation indices sis for the thermal water samples were calculated with a geochemical phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 2013 the results showed that all the samples have an ionic charge imbalance of 5 3 2 geothermometers the application of geothermometers is based on several assumptions that chemical equilibrium is established between the waters and rock there is an adequate supply of chemical reactants and there is no chemical re equilibrium during ascent of the hot water fournier 1977 fournier and truesdell 1974 the sulfate water δ18o pair δ18oso4 h2o geothermometer is based on the assumption that two species are in isotopic equilibrium with respect to oxygen and the isotope exchange is a function of temperature lloyd 1968 which was widely used in some thermal aquifers e g adam and jan 2009 awaleh et al 2015 pang 2001 the silica geothermometers cation geothermometers and δ18oso4 h2o geothermometer were employed in this study their equations

the thermal springs are probably ascribed to local conditions depending on the velocity of water flow and time of residence values of ph range between 6 8 and 8 table 1 averaging at 7 3 0 3 which shows a neutral to weak alkaline aquifer condition a piper triangular diagram is a useful method for plotting the results of multiple analyses in the same graph which can reveal grouping of certain samples and show different hydrochemical characteristics piper 1944 a schoeller diagram fig 2 b illustrates how the main variations appear precisely in these ions in which two different categories of the thermal waters can also be recognized on the basis of the piper plot fig 2a and schoeller diagram fig 2b and the tds values fig 2a table 1 the thermal waters of the study area are classified into two hydrochemical categories which showed strong variations in the space divided by the yushan fault group a nos 11 17 within the west of yushan fault is characterized by facies of chloride sodium waters with higher tds ranging from 766 to 23 956 mg l and averaging at 10 619 7784 mg l while group b nos 1 10 within the east of yushan fault is dominated by complex geochemical facies with sulfate bicarbonate chloride alkaline earth waters with relatively lower tds ranging between 363 and 2364 mg l and averaging at 1088 768 mg l specifically the chemical compositions of group b are highly variable including so4 ca mg nos 1 4 7 and 8 hco3 so4 ca mg nos 3 5 6 9 hco3 so4 ca no 10 and so4 cl ca na no 2 hydrogeologically the two totally different facies confirm the influence of the geological formations dominated by cambrian carbonate evaporite rocks and separate groundwater flow systems the mineral composition of the thermal waters reflects the geological formations chenaker et al 2018 for cations the ca2 concentrations are in the range of 70 7 to 680 mg l averaging at 442 234 mg l for group a and 57 8 to 500 mg l averaging at 204 6 170 mg l for group b the mg2 concentrations range from 3 0 to 201 mg l averaging at 92 74 3 mg l for group a and 2 5 to 114 mg l averaging at 44 6 35 6 mg l for group b the na concentrations vary from 842 to 8160 mg l averaging at 3722 2357 mg l for group a and from 0 14 to 180 9 mg l averaging at 21 6 56 1 mg l for group b the k concentrations range from 18 8 to 171 9 mg l averaging at 82 47 mg l for group a and from 0 68 to 18 7 mg l averaging at 6 5 5 4 mg l for group b the mean concentrations of the major cations for group a are much higher than those of group b all the major cation concentrations of the thermal waters are significantly higher than those of the shallow karst groundwaters of the study area n 11 from pu et al 2013 which reported average concentrations of 54 2 mg l for ca2 13 8 mg l for mg2 1 7 mg l for na and 1 3 mg l for k for anions the cl concentrations vary from 1343 to 12 617 mg l with an average of 5897 3607 mg l for group a and from 0 44 to 295 mg l averaging at 33 2 91 9 mg l for group b the halite dissolution causes the significantly higher cl and na concentrations of group a see section 5 1 the so4 2 concentrations range from 187 to 1953 mg l with a mean value of 1164 628 mg l and from 56 1 to 1520 mg l averaging at 536 560 mg l for group b the so4 2 concentrations in the thermal waters are remarkably higher than those of the shallow karst groundwaters of the study area measured at a mean of 19 6 mg l by pu et al 2013 this is in agreement with the high sulfate concentrations that frequently occur in thermal springs that discharge from carbonate aquifers blasco et al 2017 bouchaou et al 2017 goldscheider et al 2010 yang et al 2017 the hco3 concentrations vary between 120 and 220 mg l averaging at 176 39 mg l for group a and between 116 and 247 mg l averaging at 170 43 mg l for group b which is similar with those of the shallow karst groundwaters of the study area measured at 183 mg l averagely by pu et al 2013 the average no3 concentrations are 1 8 2 5 mg l for group a and 1 5 1 6 mg l for group b which is remarkably lower than those of the shallow karst groundwaters measured at 12 7 mg l in average by pu et al 2013 indicating that the thermal aquifers are isolated from anthropogenic contamination according the classification of water based on tds carpenter 1977 the tds values show that most thermal waters in group a can be classified into brackish or saline water except sample no 11 which indicates fresh water with a tds value of 766 mg l among group b samples nos 1 2 4 and 8 are brackish while others are characterized as fresh water generally cl and na are the major constituents that generate the overall salinity followed by so4 2 ca2 and mg2 in group a while so4 2 ca2 mg2 and hco3 are the main constitutes generating the brackish condition in group b the chemical and physical properties of water depend on the amount and compositions of dissolved materials the migration depth the residence time of the water in the migration pathway and rock water interactions in formations chenaker et al 2018 most major element concentrations and tds in the thermal waters are remarkably higher than those of shallow karst groundwaters pu et al 2013 suggesting that existence of totally different hydrogeological environments between the thermal waters and the shallow karst groundwater generally the occurrence of these thermal waters as well as their chemical characteristics seem to indicate the existence of large scale regional deep seated groundwater flow systems while the shallow karst groundwaters represent the local flow systems tóth 1963 4 2 saturation indices the calculated thermodynamic equilibrium sis of the thermal waters are presented in table 2 the sis of anhydrite gypsum and halite of the samples are undersaturated indicating that these minerals are anticipated to dissolve sis of calcite and dolomite are negative and positive showing that the solution varies between oversaturation and undersaturation samples are almost oversaturated with respect to quartz 4 3 isotopic compositions the δ18o values range from 9 2 to 7 0 a mean value of 8 1 for group a n 2 and from 9 7 to 7 9 a mean value of 9 0 0 6 for group b n 9 the δd values vary between 62 1 and 41 8 with an average of 52 0 for group a n 2 and between 65 0 and 50 0 with an average of 59 5 5 4 for group b n 9 all of the thermal waters are situated along the global meteoric water line gmwl defined by craig 1961 and the chongqing local meteoric water line clmwl δd 8 3 δ18o 15 46 carried out by li et al 2010 fig 3 without indications of evaporation or water rock interactions i e enrichment of 18o this suggests that the thermal waters originate from local meteoric water the δ34sso4 values are from 29 6 to 32 1 with an average of 30 9 for group a n 2 and from 25 3 to 37 4 with an average of 31 6 3 7 for group b n 7 table 1 the average δ34sso4 values of both group a and group b are significantly higher than those of shallow karst groundwaters reported at a mean of 6 6 by pu et al 2013 none of the thermal waters of group a were measured for δ18oso4 while the δ18oso4 values range from 9 2 to 16 2 averaging at 13 7 2 3 for group b n 7 in group a the δ13cdic values are in the range of 13 1 to 9 with an average of 11 2 n 3 for group b the δ13cdic data are in the range between 9 7 and 5 6 with an average of 7 2 1 6 n 9 the a14cdic concentrations of sample no 16 sample is 83 9 pmc in group a and values range from 4 4 to 20 4 pmc with an average of 11 6 7 8 pmc for group b n 4 table 1 the uncorrected ages of the thermal water range from 13 to 25 ka bp except for sample no 16 with a value of 1 4 ka bp table 1 except for sample no 16 thermal waters n 4 are characterized by low a14cdic and high δ13cdic values suggesting a deep seated fluid flow path and generally longer residence time or dilution with dead carbon produced by carbonate dissolution clark and fritz 1997 where a consequent isotopic exchange with the cambrian carbonate matrix has occurred it is worth mentioning that sample no 16 has high a14cdic and low δ13cdic values 13 1 reflecting a mixture of high fraction modern water and an important modern recharge with arrival of very young 14cdic even related to the nuclear epoch normally tritium bearing groundwater which is verified by the relatively lower values of water temperature and cl concentration and a relatively higher no3 concentration table 1 4 4 geothermometry the estimated temperatures of the thermal waters from the study area use the following geothermometers table 3 and

a and 57 115 c averaging at 82 15 c for group b the estimated temperatures measured by the improved sio2 geothermometer verma and santoyo 1997 are 35 90 c averaging at 63 19 c for group a and 57 116 c averaging at 83 15 c for group b the k mg geothermometer giggenbach 1988 is indicative of the temperatures ranging from 69 to 136 c with an average of 97 25 c for group a and from 9 to 68 c with an average of 39 17 c for group b the geothermometers of na k giggenbach 1988 and na k ca fournier and truesdell 1973 yield abnormal temperatures the temperatures estimated by the δ18oso4 h2o geothermometer of the seven selected thermal water samples from group b vary from 39 to 80 c fig 4 5 discussion 5 1 principal geochemical processes ionic ratios are useful in providing insight into the geochemical processes governing the water major ion chemistry e g marques et al 2013 yang et al 2017 the ionic analysis makes it possible to conduct a preliminary screening of the geochemical reactions that occur in the thermal aquifers dissolution of halite releases equal mole concentrations of na and cl in the solution and its corresponding reaction can be expressed as eq 1 in which a na cl equivalent ratio approximately equaling to 1 as a result of the halite dissolution the plot of na vs cl has been widely used to identify the mechanism of salinity dixon and chiswell 1992 the mmol l ratio of na vs cl for all thermal waters plot around the 1 1 line fig 5 a indicating that the na and cl derive their salinity from the dissolution of halite within host sedimentary formations indeed a drilling report in 1970 s showed that the middle cambrian carbonate aquifer within group a was imbedded with a 300 m salt depositing layer gbsp 1979 moreover the sis values of halite are undersaturated table 2 indicating the thermal waters could dissolve more halite the saline springs characterized by the hydrochemical facies of chloride sodium were widely found in the adjacent areas in sichuan basin as a result of dissolution of the halite formations guo et al 2019 the existence of antecedent nacl type water can also be found in the thick dominantly siliciclastic low permeability confining layer of confined carbonates mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 1 nacl na cl the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 can be employed to investigate the main geochemical processes fu et al 2018 if these ions are controlled by carbonate and gypsum equilibrium the equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 would be a 1 1 relationship all thermal water samples of the study are clustered closer to the 1 1 line fig 5b indicating that the dissolution of both carbonate and gypsum and or anhydrite is the predominant hydrochemical process influencing water quality and is the main source of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 fisher and mullican 1997 chemically the dissolution of limestone and dolomite are characterized by mmol l ratios of 1 2 and 1 4 for ca2 hco3 and mg2 hco3 respectively expressed as eqs 2 and 3 however the mmol l ratios of ca2 hco3 mg2 hco3 for most samples plot farther away from lines 1 2 fig 5c and 1 4 fig 5d respectively suggesting that the ca2 mg2 in the waters are not derived mainly from the dissolution of limestone and dolomite 2 co2 h2o caco3 ca2 2hco3 3 camg co3 2 2co2 2h2o ca2 mg2 4hco3 the mmol l ratios of ca2 so4 2 of the thermal waters plot around the 1 1 line of the theoretical slope of a gypsum and or anhydrite solution in equilibrium fig 5e as written by eq 4 which suggests that they are from the dissolution of evaporitic sulfate minerals the so4 2 concentrations of group a are two times higher than those of group b table 1 because the solubility of gypsum is boosted with the presence of nacl in solution up to three times klimchouk 2000 in addition the hco3 concentrations are not increasing with the elevating ca2 concentrations with a negative relationship between them fig 5c and negative correlation between hco3 and so4 2 fig 5f suggesting that the geochemical processes were controlled by the common ion effect as expressed by eq 5 which indicates dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite and forces calcite precipitation clark and fritz 1997 jin et al 2010 in eq 5 one mole of so4 2 is produced when gypsum and or anhydrite dissolves and two moles of hco3 are lost as one mole of caco3 forms this effect was widely found in many carbonate hydrothermal systems e g yang et al 2017 2019 4 caso4 nh2o ca2 so4 2 nh2o 5 2hco3 caso4 nh2o caco3 co2 so4 2 1 n h2o where the dissolution reaction for gypsum n 2 and anhydrite n 0 it should be noted that the mean mg2 concentrations of group a and group b are 3 2 and 6 7 times higher than those of shallow karst groundwaters with a mean value of 13 8 mg l reported by pu et al 2013 respectively when dolomite is combined with the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite in aquifers the process of dedolomitization may take place resulting in elevated concentrations of mg2 and so4 2 and calcite precipitation appelo and postma 2005 bischoff et al 1994 jacobson et al 2010 expressed as eq 6 this type of reaction was described in other carbonate aquifers imbedded with evaporitic sulfates gypsum and or anhydrite such as carbonate aquifers in taiyuan northern china ma et al 2011 northeastern spain bischoff et al 1994 southwestern oklahoma raines and dewers 1997 and southern dakota usa jacobson et al 2010 thus the high mg2 concentrations coupled with the positive relationship between mg2 and so4 2 r 0 64 n 17 not shown and no obvious relationship between mg2 and hco3 fig 5d n 17 suggests that the mg2 in the thermal waters is derived from dedolomitization driven by the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite rather than the dissolution of dolomite by co2 raines and dewers 1997 have reported that dedolomitization can occur only when gypsum approaches equilibrium under slow flow conditions when time scales of the various mineral reaction rates approach each other 6 camg co3 2 caso4 nh2o mg2 so4 2 2caco3 nh2o where the dissolution reaction for gypsum n 2 and anhydrite n 0 the relationship between na cl and 2so4 2 hco3 2 ca2 mg2 mmol l can determine whether cation sodium calcium exchange occurs carol et al 2009 chen et al 2014 if cation exchange dominates the geochemical processes the relationship between the two parameters should be linear with a slope of 1 the na cl vs 2so4 2 hco3 2 ca2 mg2 is plotted in fig 6 which shows that the samples are not distributed around the slope of 1 this suggests that the major cations do not participate in the cation exchange indeed there are no feldspar sodium bearing minerals imbedded in the host carbonate rocks since analysis of chemical compositions and ratio can only provide the concentration of sulfate and its potential source but not its definite source further analyses of isotopic 34sso4 and 18oso4 were carried out to decipher the origin of the sulfate content because so4 2 from different sources is characterized by distinct fingerprints clark and fritz 1997 the dual stable isotopes of sulfate have been widely employed to determine the origin of so4 2 in water groundwater evolution and water rock interactions occurring in groundwater thermal systems e g gonzález ramón et al 2017 grasby et al 2000 marques et al 2013 xiao et al 2018 this approach was particularly successful when both the sulfur and oxygen isotope abundance ratios in the sulfate ion were determined pu et al 2013 found that the shallow karst groundwaters in the studied region ranged from 1 3 to 14 with an average of 6 2 for δ34sso4 and 6 7 45 1 mg l with an average 19 6 mg l for so4 2 and suggested multi sulfur sources including atmospheric acid deposition dissolution of gypsum oxidation of sulfide mineral and contributions from coal containing strata or anthropogenic inputs the δ34sso4 and so4 2 in the thermal waters of this study are many times higher than that of shallow groundwaters reported by pu et al 2013 suggesting that they are governed by different sulfur sources and different controlling mechanisms the so4 2 in the thermal waters could result from isotopic exchange in the system so4 2 h2s sulfate reduction sulfide oxidation dissolution of evaporitic sulfate gypsum and or anhydrite dissolution of sedimentary sulfides i e pyrite the δ34sso4 values of the thermal waters table 1 and fig 7 are among the range of δ34sso4 values in the seawater during cambrian times around 30 strauss 1997 near the values of 34 to 53 for phosphorites and carbonates within the yangtze platform china goldberg et al 2005 and similar to the range of 28 2 to 33 7 in cambrian and ordovician carbonate thermal waters of the tangshan hydrothermal system near nanjing china lu et al 2018 the δ18oso4 values of the thermal waters from 9 2 to 16 2 averaging at 13 7 2 3 are in agreement with published δ18oso4 values of 14 from cambrian evaporitic calcium sulfates claypool et al 1980 and correspond with isotopic compositions of marine sulfate with a range of 12 to 15 throughout the period of late neoproterozoic to early cambrian in yangtze platform china goldberg et al 2005 moreover the dissolution of gypsum or anhydrite occurs without measurable isotope effects relative to the evaporitic sulfate minerals clark and fritz 1997 thus in combination with the result of ionic ratios mentioned above the so4 2 in the thermal waters are interpreted to be derived from the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite formed in the cambrian and ordovician periods which were found in the deeper regional formations within the aquifer gbsp 1979 gypsum dissolution has produced significant tertiary porosity and permeability in the aquifers which is an essential precursor to the development of karstic drainage gunn et al 2006 although there is no evidence from the ionic ratios showing the dissolution of carbonate limestone and or dolomite the hco3 existing in the thermal waters firmly suggests that the dissolution of carbonate derived by co2 occurs which is covered by the other hydrochemical processes mentioned above thus the dissolution of carbonate gypsum and or anhydrite and halite common ion effect and dedolomitization mainly control the hydrochemical processes in the carbonate evaporite thermal aquifers of sec the occurrence of these thermal waters as well as their diverse chemical characteristics seem to indicate that large scale deep seated groundwater flow systems exists in the karstic aquifers 5 2 origin of the thermal waters the potential water origin can be traced using stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes dansgaard 1964 except for sample no 16 the thermal waters have mean values of 9 0 59 8 for δ18o and δd respectively and very isotopically depleted compared to the water samples from four rivers fig 1 with a mean value of 6 3 and 38 5 for δ18o and δd respectively unpublished data suggesting a paleoclimatic signature in the thermal waters dansgaard 1964 fu et al 2018 huang et al 2017a and meaning that the recharging meteoric water was recharged at a relative wetter and colder climatic condition than present time except for sample no 16 the corrected a14cdic dating of the thermal waters show that the average age is approximately 14 8 ka bp see section 5 4 corresponding to the late pleistocene this confirms the depleted 18o and 2h characteristics of the thermal waters thus there is a positive relationship between δ18o and a14cdic fig 8 because the less a14cdic concentrations in the thermal waters the more residence time and more negative δ18o values are stute and deak 1989 dansgaard 1964 has reported that the δ18o and δd values show a positive correlation with the temperature with a slope of 0 69 per c for δ18o and 5 6 per c for δd from this information it can be inferred that the thermal waters were recharged under a paleoclimate characterized by a mean of 3 8 c colder than the present day annual average temperature this result is confirmed by many studies in china for example lower winter temperatures in the late pleistocene as compared to modern times where demonstrated during a study of the mammalian fauna from a cave in the three gorges area pang et al 2017 approximately 200 km north away from the study area and the recharge temperatures in the late pleistocene of about 2 3 c cooler than the modern mean annual air temperature within the minqin basin nw china edmunds et al 2006 among the thermal waters the isotopic enrichment of 18o and 2h of sample no 16 is associated with recent younger water recharge which is confirmed by high a14cdic as mentioned in sections 4 3 and 5 4 5 3 reservoir temperature and circulation depth the na k mg triangular plot proposed by giggenbach 1988 was introduced as a powerful tool in the interpretation of geothermal geochemistry in this plot waters are divided into three groups including fully equilibrated water partially equilibrated water and immature water allowing a clear distinction to be made between waters suitable or unsuitable for the application of cation geothermometers giggenbach 1988 the thermal waters of the study area are superposed on the na k mg giggenbach plot shown in fig 9 except for sample no 16 the thermal waters of group a are located at the partially equilibrated zone whereas the samples of group b plot near to the mg2 corner and correspond to immature waters this suggests that the ascending deep seated thermal fluids of group b along with sample no 16 are mixing with cold water and or re equilibrating along their circulation and thus unsuitable for the evaluation of cation equilibration moreover in a sedimentary environment the mineralogy of the host rocks and the low prevailing temperatures 150 c lead to slow kinetics with the result that cation solute geothermometers based on equilibrium with k feldspars and ca bearing silicates cannot be applied levet et al 2006 hence all the temperatures given by the cation solute geothermometers are baseless which are characterized by unrealistically high or negative equilibration temperatures table 3 most sis of the thermal waters are undersaturated except for the quartz values which are oversaturated table 2 which suggests that the quartz equilibrium is established between the thermal waters and host rock so the silica geothermometers may be most suitable for the thermal waters from the study area best estimated temperatures by the quartz geothermometer fournier 1977 and improved sio2 geothermometer verma and santoyo 1997 average at 63 18 c and 63 19 c for group a and average at 82 15 c and 83 15 c for group b the estimated temperatures by these two geothermometers yield similar results and are within the uncertainty range of 20 c which is generally acceptable in geothermometrical calculations tole et al 1993 and are consistent with estimated temperatures averaging at 80 c based on a chemical thermodynamic model unpublished data the classical chemical geothermometers including silica geothermometers provide good results in high temperature 180 c systems hosted in rocks with feldspars and aluminosilicates with which the waters have reached equilibrium and these geothermometers sometimes are not expected to be suitable for low temperature and or carbonate evaporite aquifers in some cases blasco et al 2018 fournier and truesdell 1973 however they can provide rational consistent and verified results in some low and medium temperature cases of carbonate systems bozdag 2016 renac et al 2009 yang et al 2017 and serve as a reliable estimation of the reservoir temperature for thermal waters with high cation concentrations shestakova and guseva 2018 as such the reservoir temperatures estimated by silica geothermometers in the study should be applicable and reliable most of the temperatures of group b estimated by δ18oso4 h2o geothermometer are between 50 and 60 c fig 4 with one up to 80 c these results seem to be a little lower than those temperatures calculated by silica geothermometers reported above probably implying an isotopic disequilibrium between δ18oso4 and δ18oh2o for low temperature reservoirs there are likely two reasons contributing to the isotopic disequilibrium the first one the ascending deep seated thermal fluids mix with the shallow groundwater characterized by lower concentration so4 2 and enriched 18oh2o the second one the exchange rates of oxygen isotope in the sulfate water system are extremely slow at earth surface conditions it requires up to 100 000 years to approach near isotopic oxygen equilibrium between dissolved sulfate and water lloyd 1968 hence the δ18oso4 h2o geothermometer probably does not reflect the real reservoir temperature moreover the water oxygen signature from the thermal springs does not show an enrichment of 18o positive δ18o shift with respect to that of the regional and global meteoric water fig 3 as meteoric water infiltrates through the ground into the geothermal reservoir isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding rock matrix and the extent of isotopic exchange are controlled by the temperature geyh 2001 isotopic exchange of oxygen isotopes between the meteoric water and the carbonate or silicate formations with unchanged hydrogen isotope in high temperature aquifers was widely documented around the world e g gat 2010 tian et al 2018 wang et al 2016 however the water rock interaction has little effect on δ18o in groundwater at reservoir temperatures 90 c mook 2000 the lack of positive δ18o shift for the thermal waters within sec implies that the reservoir temperature should be 90 c which strangely suggests that the mean temperatures estimated by silica geothermometers are rational compared to the temperatures estimated by other chemical geothermometers the maximum circulation depth of the thermal waters can be calculated by an equation shown in eq 7 the estimated reservoir temperature t is set to the average temperature estimated by the two silica geothermometers including the quartz geothermometer fournier 1977 and improved sio2 geothermometer verma and santoyo 1997 the local mean annual air temperature t0 is 16 6 c the depth of constant temperature zone d is assumed to be 0 03 km according to yang et al 2019 the geothermal gradient g is from the average value calculated by an equation as expressed by eq 8 the bottom hole temperature tb and the well depth dw in km are listed in table 4 thus the calculated g values of samples nos 3 5 and 12 drilled wells are 22 9 21 1 and 19 5 c km respectively table 4 with an average of 21 c km slightly below the average of the earth crust 30 c km these values are consistent with the thermal anomaly described in this area with an average geothermal gradient value of 25 c km chen 1994 the reservoir temperatures by silica geothermometers in conjunction with the average geothermal gradient of 21 c km indicate that the circulation depth ranges from 1 5 to 3 5 km with an average of 2 5 0 7 km for group a except for sample no 16 and 2 to 4 7 km with an average of 3 2 0 7 km for group b although these values cannot be confirmed or rejected they are the most reliable data for the study area 7 d t t 0 g d where d is the circulation depth in km t is the estimated reservoir temperature in c t0 the local mean annual air temperature in c g is the geothermal gradient in c km and d is the depth of constant temperature zone in km 8 g t b t 0 d w where g and t0 are same as in eq 7 tb is the bottom hole temperature in c dw is the well depth in km 5 4 residence time of the thermal waters estimating groundwater age is important and useful for any groundwater resource assessment because numerous studies have reported that the carbonate thermal waters are more than several thousands of years old ettayfi et al 2012 mao et al 2018 yang et al 2017 the a14cdic concentrations rather than the tritium dating of the thermal water samples were measured in this study the half life of 5730 years for a14cdic makes it highly useful for dating carbon bearing materials allowing measurement to almost 60 000 years which is considered to be a universal and reliable groundwater dating method clark and fritz 1997 and provides information and facilitates studies of archeological materials goldscheider and drew 2007 meredith et al 2016 and groundwater recharge mechanism huang et al 2017b kulongoski et al 2008 in addition to radioactive decay the a14cdic content can be affected by many geochemical and physical processes han et al 2014 which controls the isotope geochemistry of carbon during water infiltration through the unsaturated zone interactions in an open system and within the aquifer system itself interactions in a closed system kattan 2002 during transit in the aquifer these processes modify the initial a14cdic content 14c0 in groundwater because the ancient rocks are free of a14cdic dead carbon which inevitably increases the calculated groundwater ages without correction the measured a14cdic contents thus should be reassessed during the use of radiocarbon dating for thermal groundwater if additional dead carbon exists in the water aquilina et al 2003 mao et al 2018 there is a negative relationship between δ13cdic and a14cdic of the thermal waters within sec fig 10 which may suggest additional dead carbon thus it s necessary to correct the ages of the thermal water samples of the sec based on the measured a14cdic the vegetation in the study area is dominated by c3 calvin c3 photosynthesis cycle the δ13c values of most c3 range from 24 to 30 with an average of 27 vogel 1993 due to the high concentration gradient the degassing of soil co2 makes the 13cco2 fractionation as much as 4 cerling et al 1991 jin et al 2014 thus the δ13cco2 in the soil should be 23 when the soil co2 dissolved the carbonate aquifer half of the dic in aquifer is from the soil and the other half is derived from the host carbonate rocks which results in an enrichment factor ɛ of δ13cdic with an ɛ13cdic co2 g value of 9 at 15 c clark and fritz 1997 hence the δ 13cdic as a result of c3 plants in the carbonate aquifer should be 14 at 15 c on the basis of these assumptions a mixing model was proposed as shown in fig 10 in which the dic in the thermal waters is a result of mixture of the dissolution of cambrian carbonates in the thermal reservoir δ13cdic 0 a14cdic 0 pmc and co2 from soil respiration δ13cdic 14 at 15 c a14cdic 100 pmc numerous calibrated models have been employed to estimate the radiocarbon ages of dic in groundwater systems e g evans et al 1979 han et al 2014 huang et al 2017a tamers 1975 generally these models can be categorized into two types processes of chemical and isotopic mixing and chemical mixing with isotopic exchange clark and fritz 1997 however the calculated δ13cco2 values in the thermal waters range from 5 7 to 20 7 averaging at 12 7 based on a linear regression between δ13cdic and δ13cco2 as expressed by eq 9 from deines et al 1974 except for samples nos 16 20 7 and 17 19 0 most of the calculated δ13cco2 values of the thermal waters are much higher than that of the theoretical value in the soil 23 the higher δ13cco2 values together with the higher δ13cdic values of the thermal waters suggest that the solutions in the thermal aquifers occur chiefly under closed groundwater systems which is confirmed by the isolated thermal aquifers based on the lower nitrate concentrations compared with those of the shallow karst groundwaters reported by pu et al 2013 a widely used correction model alk model tamers 1975 was employed to correct the ages in this study because this model is based on initial and final carbonate dic concentrations and was proposed for groundwater in which calcite is dissolved under closed system conditions moreover this model assumes fully closed system conditions without exchange of soil co2 during calcite dissolution tamers 1975 the corrected ages by the alk model are listed in table 1 generally most of the corrected 14cdic ages n 5 are much younger than the uncorrected 14cdic ages except for sample no 16 the corrected ages are from 9 to 21 ka bp with an average of 14 8 ka bp the corrected age of sample no 16 is negative and irrational because of mixture with younger water although the corrected 14cdic ages may deviate from the real ages to some extent it is believed to be more accurate than the uncorrected ages and can indicate the age level of the thermal waters 9 δ 13 c co 2 δ 13 c dic 4 54 1 099 10 6 t 2 where t is the temperature of thermal water in kelvin degree the estimation of renewable groundwater resources and understanding of related hydrological processes are critically dependent upon determining the presence and age of modern groundwater aggarwal 2002 deep groundwater characterized by more than 1 ka ages is considered non renewable paleo water without the possibility of significant replenishment under present climatic conditions huang et al 2017a generally the depletion of δ18o and δd in the thermal waters compared to modern recharge coupled with the low a14cdic concentrations and their corresponding corrected ages suggest that the renewability rate for most of the thermal water resources in the aquifers is characterized by a hydraulic continuity on an order of 14 8 ka thus aquifer renewability needs to be fully considered and assessed before groundwater exploitation and extraction 5 5 conceptual circulation of the thermal waters according to the hydrogeochemical and geothermometrical results above a conceptual hydrogeological model was reconstructed as schematically depicted in fig 11 which is a qualitative schematic representation of or part of reality the poorly known or unknown characteristics of the hydrothermal aquifer systems of interest such as the precise location of the infiltration areas as well as the geometry of the geological bodies hosting most of the hydrogeological flow path are roughly shown in fig 11 the thermal waters originate from common meteoric water at a relative wetter and colder climate in the late pleistocene assuming a geothermal gradient of 21 c km the meteoric water infiltrates into the subsurface at maximum depth at roughly 2 5 and 3 2 km for group a and group b respectively to acquire the heat from deep rock through conductive transfer during their circulation and form the deep seated thermal fluids characterized by temperatures of approximately 63 and 83 c for group a and group b respectively the fluids are characterized by cross formational hydraulic continuity at the same time the fluids interact with evaporitic deposits composed of halite and sulfate minerals at depth which results in high salinity particularly the enrichment of na and cl in group a the fluids returning flow to the surface is mainly driven by topographic head difference tóth 1963 between the recharge area in the limestone mountains and the thermal water resurgences free thermal convection may affect the deeper part of the midline and the discharge zone of the hydrothermal systems as well szijártó et al 2019 the local tectonic setting represented by the presence of the deep seated faults in this area enhances the permeability and plays an important role in the circulation and upwelling of deep seated thermal fluids toward the surface the deep seated thermal fluids move up along the faults and mix with different proportions of colder waters to form the hot springs this mixing accounts for the variations in temperatures and chemical compositions among individual springs or drilled well waters such as sample no 16 characterized by a high mixture fraction of modern water there are possible similar hydrologic environments between group a and group b indicated by the chemical identification but there are differences in the halite imbedded in the aquifers and circulation depths between the two groups although the mechanism of the geothermal flow dynamics to some extent remains speculative the conceptual hydrogeological model is the most rational based on the analyses of hydrogeological settings and the hydrogeochemical and geothermometrical data 6 conclusions this paper is the first to present the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of the thermal waters from carbonate evaporite aquifers hosted by deep seated faults in southeast chongqing china where thermal fluids discharge from cambrian and ordovician carbonate evaporite rocks representing the main potential thermal reservoir major ions and isotopes 34sso4 18oso4 18o 2h 13cdic and a14cdic were employed to constrain the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of the thermal waters from carbonate evaporite aquifers hosted by deep seated faults in the study area the low temperature hydrothermal systems are manifested by hot springs emerging around the faults the groundwater interaction with carbonate evaporite rocks explains the two distinct chemical compositions of the thermal waters characterized by the chloride sodium waters with higher tds group a and sulfate bicarbonate chloride alkaline earth waters with relative lower tds group b in the study area the dissolution of carbonate gypsum and or anhydrite and halite common ion effect and dedolomitization control the hydrochemical processes in the carbonate evaporite thermal aquifers the thermal waters originate from meteoric water the reservoir temperature appears to be 63 18 c for group a and 82 15 c for group b as indicated by silica geothermometers the corrected 14cdic ages average at 14 8 ka bp corresponding to late pleistocene which suggests that the renewability rate of most of the thermal waters are on an order of 14 8 ka thus the slow renewability rate of thermal water resources in the study area inevitably provides a challenge to the future utilization for social and economic development monitoring the major ions and isotopic compositions of thermal waters can provide important indications as to the formational mechanisms of the carbonate evaporite hydrothermal systems indeed such monitoring provides valuable information of the thermal waters to define the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of the aquifers and lays a solid foundation for future efficient utilization management and implementation of water conservation policies for the thermal water resources in the study area the methodological approachs utilized in this research may also be applied to other fault controlled low temperature carbonate

6020,carbonate aquifers probably constitute the most important thermal water resources in non volcanic areas and are characteristic of great energy potential and easier production as the most ideal targets for development in the future the thermal waters in the aquifers within southeast chongqing sec of china occur in an extensive region with an area of 198 000 km2 which are mainly hosted in the cambrian and ordovician carbonate evaporite rocks the thermal waters are mainly in pristine conditions and their genesis has not yet been fully understood the occurrence of thermal waters in sec is closely related to the presence of deep seated faults which constitute pathways for the hydrothermal circulation in this study an investigation of water major ions and environmental isotopes from 14 hot springs and three drilled wells was carried out to examine their hydrogeochemical evolution and to estimate reservoir temperature the thermal waters have outflow temperatures from 19 to 54 2 c they are divided into two hydrochemical groups with the yushan fault as a boundary group a located to the west of the fault are characterized by facies of chloride sodium waters with higher tds group b to the east of the fault are more complicated sulfate bicarbonate chloride alkaline earth waters with lower tds the hydrochemical processes such as dissolution of carbonate gypsum and or anhydrite and halite the common ion effect and dedolomitization are evident based on the major ions and δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 the δ18o and δd compositions of the thermal waters suggest a meteoric recharge in a relatively wetter and colder climatic condition the silica geothermometers show that the average reservoir temperatures are 63 18 c for group a and 82 15 c for group b the corresponding average reservoir depths are estimated to be 2 5 0 7 km for group a and 3 2 0 7 km for group b the corrected 14c ages of the thermal waters average at 14 8 ka bp corresponding to the late pleistocene a conceptual circulation model is proposed for the thermal waters driven by gravity of topographic gradients the percolating groundwater circulates at a specific depth reaching a higher temperature and interacting with the host carbonate with imbedded evaporitic minerals gypsum and or anhydrite and additional halite for group a to be saline deep seated thermal fluids the fluids rise along faults and emerge at the surface as thermal springs the slow renewability rate of the thermal aquifers highlights the importance of assessing the resource before groundwater exploitation and extraction keywords thermal water carbonate rocks isotopes fault paleo recharge southeast chongqing in china 1 introduction the occurrence of thermal water is associated with lithostratigraphic and structural conditions the most intensively studied thermal water systems are those associated with active volcanic areas e g dobson et al 2018 kalacheva et al 2018 kavouridis et al 1999 mcmillan et al 2018 however carbonate aquifers probably constitute the most important thermal water resources outside of volcanic areas which have received attention for their value in space heating electric power generation and recreational purposes goldscheider et al 2010 although there is no detailed and reliable global assessment of thermal water resources goldscheider et al 2010 deep carbonate aquifers characterized by great energy potential and easier production are the most ideal targets for development kong et al 2014 pang et al 2012 2014 the thermal water resources in continental carbonate rock aquifers are normally related with deep and regional flow systems and characterized by trans formational hydraulic continuity e g goldscheider et al 2010 tóth 1995 yang et al 2013 groundwater circulation in these situations can be described as a regional flow system which is generally gravity driven by topographic gradients jiang et al 2012 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 tóth 1963 yang et al 2017 the precipitation falling in the higher elevation regions percolates into the aquifer and is heated to result in deep seated thermal fluids ascending thermal fluid paths are generally controlled by faults and fracture zones which represent zones of enhanced permeability qiu et al 2018 stober et al 2016 however most of the carbonate thermal waters at great depths with deep water circulation are often poorly understood goldscheider et al 2010 geochemistry and isotopes are indispensable tools for studying the hydrogeologic structure and functioning of these systems geochemical and isotopic techniques applied during stages of exploration and evaluation of geothermal resources as well as monitoring studies are particularly important because of the information they provide relatively fast and at low cost d amore and arnórsson 2000a fournier 1977 moreover thermal waters including springs and well water potentially provide information on geochemical processes acting deep within aquifers gunn et al 2006 as such investigation of the geochemical and related isotopic characteristics of thermal waters is always one of first steps in the evaluation of the geothermal potential of an area the basic approaches of studying thermal waters are to use the major ions stable isotopes and radioisotope data to define hydrochemical characteristics the source of major ions and water groundwater residence time and other hydrodynamic features e g aquilina et al 2003 gunn et al 2006 ma et al 2011 utting et al 2013 yang et al 2017 the application of geochemical and isotopic methods in thermal exploration thus can provide very useful information on geochemical evolution water circulation and water rock interactions within the carbonate aquifers that are difficult to obtain by other techniques moreover a crucial point in the exploration of thermal water resources is to know the precise temperature at depth of a particular geothermal reservoir the most reliable temperatures are obtained by static bottom hole temperature surveys for exploratory or production wells however this way of temperature surveying although often inevitable is the most expensive approach due to the costly investment for exploratory drilling adam and jan 2009 the application of chemical and isotopic groundwater temperature indicators the so called geothermometers is based on temperature dependent water rock chemical equilibrium chemical reactions or isotope equilibrium fractionation relations from which the equilibrium temperatures can be estimated d amore and arnórsson 2000b the geothermometrical methods mainly

the carbonate thermal water within the urban area of chongqing were investigated in detail showing that high concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 in the thermal waters are derived from the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite xiao et al 2018 yang et al 2017 2019 and reservoir temperatures were estimated to be 64 8 93 4 c averaging at 82 c yang et al 2017 however compared to the urban area the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of the carbonate thermal waters within southeastern chongqing sec are still unknown and no literature about the hydrothermal characteristics is available which is probably attributable to the remote location and complex geology of the area moreover the social and economic development value will be elevated as the construction for the high speed rail connecting the urban area and the sec fig 1 a will be completed in 2024 the demand for thermal water resources will inevitably be increasing within sec which requires a thorough investigation of the hydrothermal aquifers for their potential and renewability for exploitation this task is impossible to achieve without knowledge of the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry within sec it is therefore highly necessary to bridge the gap of knowledge for the thermal aquifers within sec the study mainly aims to 1 characterize the hydrochemical properties of the thermal waters 2 understand the water rock interaction processes occurring at depth 3 determine the recharge times and estimate the geothermal reservoir temperatures and their corresponding depths and 4 propose a conceptual hydrogeological model for genesis of the thermal waters to achieve these objectives a combination of methods including geochemistry major ions isotopes 34sso4 18oso4 18oh2o 2hh2o 13cdic 14cdic and geothermometers were used to study the hydrothermal systems the methodological approaches utilized in this study are more relevant and useful in similar geological hydrogeological and geochemical frameworks characterized by fault controlled low temperature carbonate hydrothermal systems 2 study area 2 1 geographical settings geographically the sec is located in the southeast part of chongqing municipality fig 1a it includes the districts of qianjiang and wulong counties of shizhu youyang pengshui and xiushan the local mean annual air temperature and rainfall are approximately 16 6 c and 1300 mm respectively the landscape is dominated by hilly terraces with a relative elevation difference of 500 1000 m functioning as the local base level of erosion several rivers run through the study area such as wu river zhufo river and a peng river in this study for chemical and isotopic analysis a total of 14 hot spring sites and three geothermal drilled wells from sec were obtained during december 2017 and june 2018 all of the sample points and their sampling nos are shown in fig 1a the original set of chemical and isotopic data of thermal fluids discharge from a region with an area of 19 800 km2 which accounts for approximately 20 of chongqing municipality comprised between n 28 30 and e 107 5 109 3 as shown in fig 1a 2 2 geological and hydrogeological settings the sec is characterized by a series of parallel and trending ne sw folds with alternating anticlines and synclines fig 1b stratigraphically the outcropping formations include paleozoic to quaternary sedimentary layers lacking the upper silurian devonian carboniferous formations due to paleo erosion the lower cambrian stratum consists of siltstone and shale with a thickness of 373 m gbsp 1979 the upper and middle cambrian strata are limestone and dolomitic limestone with a thickness of 1044 1322 m which are imbedded with evaporites halite gypsum and or anhydrite indicating the transition to a paralic continental environment the lower ordovician formations are composed of limestone dolomite and bioclastic limestone with a thickness of 228 294 m the middle and upper ordovician middle and lower silurian strata mainly consist of shale and sandstone up to 2000 m thick the permian and triassic strata are composed of shale marl and limestone containing chert nodules with a thickness of 1190 2009 m the jurassic and cenozoic formations are composed of shale sandstone and breccia which were uplifted and partially eroded the quaternary formation is distributed sporadically faults are well developed with the ne sw trend and dip to the northwest at around 60 in the study area most faults are developed in limbs of the anticlines and cut through the ordovician and cambrian carbonate formations at depths more than 3 km fig 1b accounting for almost 55 of the study area the carbonate aquifers mainly consist of limestone and dolomite with resurgences via hot and shallow karst springs with an average runoff of 4 5 l s per km2 the hydrothermal systems within sec are manifested by hot springs emerging around the faults at elevations of 184 960 m a s l these hot springs are artesian and issue from cambrian and ordovician carbonate rocks mainly aligned along the faults fig 1a the deep seated faults are assumed to be major controls on groundwater flow and act as preferential pathways for thermal water ascent stratigraphically the hot springs are located at the flanks of anticlines in the context of this study the upper and middle cambrian and the lower ordovician carbonate evaporite rocks are of special interest in the study area as they constitute the potential geothermal reservoir for the thermal springs these geothermal formations are affected by a highly developed deep seated fault system which could be responsible for the regional hydrothermal activities especially where permeability is enhanced by well developed faulting fracturing and karstification processes the geothermal reservoir is highly permeable with a hydraulic conductivity of 11 5 m d calculated by the pumping test from the aquifer around sample no 12 the thermal cover layer consists of the middle and upper ordovician silurian permian and triassic strata more than 3000 m thick the lower cambrian stratum below the carbonate evaporite rocks serves as the semi confining bed underlying the thermal reservoir the regional terrestrial heat flow and average geothermal gradient are about 53 7 8 7 mw m2 jiang et al 2019 and 21 c km with depth see section 5 3 respectively the hydrogeochemistry and possible sulfate sources of the shallow karst groundwaters in the study area were investigated by pu et al 2013 most hot springs are not used and discharge into the rivers except samples nos 9 and 10 which are used for spa and therapeutic purposes by the local residents in recent years three geothermal wells samples nos 3 12 and 13 were drilled and provide thermal water for the commercial spa 3 methodology and materials 3 1 sampling and measurements water temperature ph and specific conductivity spc were directly measured in the field using a wtw multi3630 probe wtw germany with accuracies of 0 1 c 0 01ph unit and 1μs cm respectively the hco3 concentration was determined in the field by titration with an alkalinity kit merck germany with an

carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic were promptly sampled in a 1 l high density polyethylene bottle to avoid mixing with air co2 before collecting thermal water samples all sampling bottles were flushed with the same thermal water which was to be sampled later the samples for cation measurement were acidified by adding nitric acid to make the ph 2 immediately after sampling all sample bottles were carefully sealed with airtight caps and were refrigerated at 4 c to minimize bacterial growth major cations were determined by 5110 inductively coupled plasma optical

above major ions were measured at geotechnical engineering testing center of chongqing china a total of nine thermal water samples nos 1 4 7 8 10 16 and 17 were analyzed for δ34sso4 and seven samples nos 1 4 7 8 and 10 were measured for δ18oso4 before measurement the thermal water samples were acidified to ph 4 to remove bicarbonate then the water samples were precipitated as baso4 the precipitate

the δ18oso4 values are relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the mean standard deviations were 0 2 for δ34sso4 and 0 3 for δ18oso4 respectively the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values were measured with a delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms at the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology in wuhan china the a14cdic δ13cdic and δd and δ18o of five thermal

major cations and anions and saturation indices sis for the thermal water samples were calculated with a geochemical phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 2013 the results showed that all the samples have an ionic charge imbalance of 5 3 2 geothermometers the application of geothermometers is based on several assumptions that chemical equilibrium is established between the waters and rock there is an adequate supply of chemical reactants and there is no chemical re equilibrium during ascent of the hot water fournier 1977 fournier and truesdell 1974 the sulfate water δ18o pair δ18oso4 h2o

with an average of 36 1 10 8 c which is significantly higher than the average annual local air temperature of 16 6 c and belongs to low temperature thermal water the different outlet temperatures of the thermal springs are probably ascribed to local conditions depending on the velocity of water flow and time of residence values of ph range between 6 8 and 8 table 1 averaging at 7 3 0 3 which shows a neutral to weak alkaline aquifer condition a piper triangular diagram is a useful method for plotting the results of multiple analyses in the same graph which can reveal grouping of certain samples and show different hydrochemical characteristics piper 1944 a schoeller diagram fig 2 b illustrates how the main variations appear precisely in these ions in which two different categories of the thermal waters can also be recognized on the basis of the piper plot fig 2a and schoeller diagram fig 2b and the tds values fig 2a table 1 the thermal waters of the study area are classified into two hydrochemical categories which showed strong variations in the space divided by the yushan fault group a nos 11 17 within the west of yushan fault is characterized by facies of chloride sodium waters with higher tds ranging from 766 to 23 956 mg l and averaging at 10 619 7784 mg l while group b nos 1 10 within the east of yushan fault is dominated by complex geochemical facies with sulfate bicarbonate chloride alkaline earth waters with relatively lower tds ranging between 363 and 2364 mg l and averaging at 1088 768 mg l specifically the chemical compositions of group b are highly variable including so4 ca mg nos 1 4 7 and 8 hco3 so4 ca mg nos 3 5 6 9 hco3 so4 ca no 10 and so4 cl ca na no 2 hydrogeologically the two totally different facies confirm the influence of the geological formations dominated by cambrian carbonate evaporite rocks and separate groundwater flow systems the mineral composition of the thermal waters reflects the geological formations chenaker et al 2018 for cations the ca2 concentrations are in the range of 70 7 to 680 mg l averaging at 442 234 mg l for group a and 57 8 to 500 mg l averaging at 204 6 170 mg l for group b the mg2 concentrations range from 3 0 to 201 mg l averaging at 92 74 3 mg l for group a and 2 5 to 114 mg l averaging at 44 6 35 6 mg l for group b the na concentrations vary from 842 to 8160 mg l averaging at 3722 2357 mg l for group a and from 0 14 to 180 9 mg l averaging at 21 6 56 1 mg l for group b the k concentrations range from 18 8 to 171 9 mg l averaging at 82 47 mg l for group a and from 0 68 to 18 7 mg l averaging at 6 5 5 4 mg l for group b the mean concentrations of the major cations for group a are much higher than those of group b all the major cation concentrations of the thermal waters are significantly higher than those of the shallow karst groundwaters of the study area n 11 from pu et al 2013 which reported average concentrations of 54 2 mg l for ca2 13 8 mg l for mg2 1 7 mg l for na and 1 3 mg l for k for anions the cl concentrations vary from 1343 to 12 617 mg l with an average of 5897 3607 mg l for group a and from 0 44 to 295 mg l averaging at 33 2 91 9 mg l for group b the halite dissolution causes the significantly higher cl and na concentrations of group a see section 5 1 the so4 2 concentrations range from 187 to 1953 mg l with a mean value of 1164 628 mg l and from 56 1 to 1520 mg l averaging at 536 560 mg l for group b the so4 2 concentrations in the thermal waters are remarkably higher than those of the shallow karst groundwaters of the study area measured at a mean of 19 6 mg l by pu et al 2013 this is in agreement with the high sulfate concentrations that frequently occur in thermal springs that discharge from carbonate aquifers blasco et al 2017 bouchaou et al 2017 goldscheider et al 2010 yang et al 2017 the hco3 concentrations vary between 120 and 220 mg l averaging at 176 39 mg l for group a and between 116 and 247 mg l averaging at 170 43 mg l for group b which is similar with those of the shallow karst groundwaters of the study area measured at 183 mg l averagely by pu et al 2013 the average no3 concentrations are 1 8 2 5 mg l for group a and 1 5 1 6 mg l for group b which is remarkably lower than those of the shallow karst groundwaters measured at 12 7 mg l in average by pu et al 2013 indicating that the thermal aquifers are isolated from anthropogenic contamination according the classification of water based on tds carpenter 1977 the tds values show that most thermal waters in group a can be classified into brackish or saline water except sample no 11 which indicates fresh water with a tds value of 766 mg l among group b samples nos 1 2 4 and 8 are brackish while others are characterized as fresh water generally cl and na are the major constituents that generate the overall salinity followed by so4 2 ca2 and mg2 in group a while so4 2 ca2 mg2 and hco3 are the main constitutes generating the brackish condition in group b the chemical and physical properties of water depend on the amount and compositions of dissolved materials the migration depth the residence time of the water in the migration pathway and rock water interactions in formations chenaker et al 2018 most major element concentrations and tds in the thermal waters are remarkably higher than those of shallow karst groundwaters pu et al 2013 suggesting that existence of totally different hydrogeological environments between the thermal waters and the shallow karst groundwater generally the occurrence of these thermal waters as well as their chemical characteristics seem to indicate the existence of large scale regional deep seated groundwater flow systems while the shallow karst groundwaters represent the local flow systems tóth 1963 4 2 saturation indices the calculated thermodynamic equilibrium sis of the thermal waters are presented in table 2 the sis of anhydrite gypsum and halite of the samples are undersaturated indicating that these minerals are anticipated to dissolve sis of calcite and dolomite are negative and positive showing that the solution varies between oversaturation and undersaturation samples are almost oversaturated with respect to quartz 4 3 isotopic compositions the δ18o values range from 9 2 to 7 0 a mean value of 8 1 for group a n 2 and from 9 7 to 7 9 a mean value of 9 0 0 6 for group b n 9 the δd values vary between 62 1 and 41 8 with an average of 52 0 for group a n 2 and between 65 0 and 50 0 with an average of 59 5 5 4 for group b n 9 all of the thermal waters are situated along the global meteoric water line gmwl defined by craig 1961 and the chongqing local meteoric water line clmwl δd 8 3 δ18o 15 46 carried out by li et al 2010 fig 3 without indications of evaporation or water rock interactions i e enrichment of 18o this suggests that the thermal waters originate from local meteoric water the δ34sso4 values are from 29 6 to 32 1 with an average of 30 9 for group a n 2 and from 25 3 to 37 4 with an average of 31 6 3 7 for group b n 7 table 1 the average δ34sso4 values of both group a and group b are significantly higher than those of shallow karst groundwaters reported at a mean of 6 6 by pu et al 2013 none of the thermal waters of group a were measured for δ18oso4 while the δ18oso4 values range from 9 2 to 16 2 averaging at 13 7 2 3 for group b n 7 in group a the δ13cdic values are in the range of 13 1 to 9 with an average of 11 2 n 3 for group b the δ13cdic data are in the range between 9 7 and 5 6 with an average of 7 2 1 6 n 9 the a14cdic concentrations of sample no 16 sample is 83 9 pmc in group a and values range from 4 4 to 20 4 pmc with an average of 11 6 7 8 pmc for group b n 4 table 1 the uncorrected ages of the thermal water range from 13 to 25 ka bp except for sample no 16 with a value of 1 4 ka bp table 1 except for sample no 16 thermal waters n 4 are characterized by low a14cdic and high δ13cdic values suggesting a deep seated fluid flow path and generally longer residence time or dilution with dead carbon produced by carbonate dissolution clark and fritz 1997 where a consequent isotopic exchange with the cambrian carbonate matrix has occurred it is worth mentioning that sample no 16 has high a14cdic and low δ13cdic values 13 1 reflecting a mixture of high fraction modern water and an important modern recharge with arrival of very young 14cdic even related to the nuclear epoch normally tritium bearing groundwater which is verified by the relatively lower values of water temperature and cl concentration and a relatively higher no3 concentration table 1 4 4 geothermometry the estimated temperatures of the thermal waters from the study area use the following geothermometers table 3 and

and truesdell 1973 and δ18oso4 h2o geothermometer lloyd 1968 the estimated reservoir temperatures by the quartz geothermometer fournier 1977 vary in the range of 37 90 c averaging at 63 18 c for group a and 57 115 c averaging at 82 15 c for group b the estimated temperatures measured by the improved sio2 geothermometer verma and santoyo 1997 are 35 90 c averaging at 63 19 c for group a and 57 116 c averaging at 83 15 c for group b the k mg geothermometer giggenbach 1988 is indicative of the temperatures ranging from 69 to 136 c with an average of 97 25 c for group a and from 9 to 68 c with an average of 39 17 c for group b the geothermometers of na k giggenbach 1988 and na k ca fournier and truesdell 1973 yield abnormal temperatures the temperatures estimated by the δ18oso4 h2o geothermometer of the seven selected thermal water samples from group b vary from 39 to 80 c fig 4 5 discussion 5 1 principal geochemical processes ionic ratios are useful in providing insight into the geochemical processes governing the water major ion chemistry e g marques et al 2013 yang et al 2017 the ionic analysis makes it possible to conduct a preliminary screening of the geochemical reactions that occur in the thermal aquifers dissolution of halite releases equal mole concentrations of na and cl in the solution and its corresponding reaction can be expressed as eq 1 in which a na cl equivalent ratio approximately equaling to 1 as a result of the halite dissolution the plot of na vs cl has been widely used to identify the mechanism of salinity dixon and chiswell 1992 the mmol l ratio of na vs cl for all thermal waters plot around the 1 1 line fig 5 a indicating that the na and cl derive their salinity from the dissolution of halite within host sedimentary formations indeed a drilling report in 1970 s showed that the middle cambrian carbonate aquifer within group a was imbedded with a 300 m salt depositing layer gbsp 1979 moreover the sis values of halite are undersaturated table 2 indicating the thermal waters could dissolve more halite the saline springs characterized by the hydrochemical facies of chloride sodium were widely found in the adjacent areas in sichuan basin as a result of dissolution of the halite formations guo et al 2019 the existence of antecedent nacl type water can also be found in the thick dominantly siliciclastic low permeability confining layer of confined carbonates mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 1 nacl na cl the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 can be employed to investigate the main geochemical processes fu et al 2018 if these ions are controlled by carbonate and gypsum equilibrium the equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 would be a 1 1 relationship all thermal water samples of the study are clustered closer to the 1 1 line fig 5b indicating that the dissolution of both carbonate and gypsum and or anhydrite is the predominant hydrochemical process influencing water quality and is the main source of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 fisher and mullican 1997 chemically the dissolution of limestone and dolomite are characterized by mmol l ratios of 1 2 and 1 4 for ca2 hco3 and mg2 hco3 respectively expressed as eqs 2 and 3 however the mmol l ratios of ca2 hco3 mg2 hco3 for most samples plot farther away from lines 1 2 fig 5c and 1 4 fig 5d respectively suggesting that the ca2 mg2 in the waters are not derived mainly from the dissolution of limestone and dolomite 2 co2 h2o caco3 ca2 2hco3 3 camg co3 2 2co2 2h2o ca2 mg2 4hco3 the mmol l ratios of ca2 so4 2 of the thermal waters plot around the 1 1 line of the theoretical slope of a gypsum and or anhydrite solution in equilibrium fig 5e as written by eq 4 which suggests that they are from the dissolution of evaporitic sulfate minerals the so4 2 concentrations of group a are two times higher than those of group b table 1 because the solubility of gypsum is boosted with the presence of nacl in solution up to three times klimchouk 2000 in addition the hco3 concentrations are not increasing with the elevating ca2 concentrations with a negative relationship between them fig 5c and negative correlation between hco3 and so4 2 fig 5f suggesting that the geochemical processes were controlled by the common ion effect as expressed by eq 5 which indicates dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite and forces calcite precipitation clark and fritz 1997 jin et al 2010 in eq 5 one mole of so4 2 is produced when gypsum and or anhydrite dissolves and two moles of hco3 are lost as one mole of caco3 forms this effect was widely found in many carbonate hydrothermal systems e g yang et al 2017 2019 4 caso4 nh2o ca2 so4 2 nh2o 5 2hco3 caso4 nh2o caco3 co2 so4 2 1 n h2o where the dissolution reaction for gypsum n 2 and anhydrite n 0 it should be noted that the mean mg2 concentrations of group a and group b are 3 2 and 6 7 times higher than those of shallow karst groundwaters with a mean value of 13 8 mg l reported by pu et al 2013 respectively when dolomite is combined with the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite in aquifers the process of dedolomitization may take place resulting in elevated concentrations of mg2 and so4 2 and calcite precipitation appelo and postma 2005 bischoff et al 1994 jacobson et al 2010 expressed as eq 6 this type of reaction was described in other carbonate aquifers imbedded with evaporitic sulfates gypsum and or anhydrite such as carbonate aquifers in taiyuan northern china ma et al 2011 northeastern spain bischoff et al 1994 southwestern oklahoma raines and dewers 1997 and southern dakota usa jacobson et al 2010 thus the high mg2 concentrations coupled with the positive relationship between mg2 and so4 2 r 0 64 n 17 not shown and no obvious relationship between mg2 and hco3 fig 5d n 17 suggests that the mg2 in the thermal waters is derived from dedolomitization driven by the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite rather than the dissolution of dolomite by co2 raines and dewers 1997 have reported that dedolomitization can occur only when gypsum approaches equilibrium under slow flow conditions when time scales of the various mineral reaction rates approach each other 6 camg co3 2 caso4 nh2o mg2 so4 2 2caco3 nh2o where the dissolution reaction for gypsum n 2 and anhydrite n 0 the relationship between na cl and 2so4 2 hco3 2 ca2 mg2 mmol l can determine whether cation sodium calcium exchange occurs carol et al 2009 chen et al 2014 if cation exchange dominates the geochemical processes the relationship between the two parameters should be linear with a slope of 1 the na cl vs 2so4 2 hco3 2 ca2 mg2 is plotted in fig 6 which shows that the samples are not distributed around the slope of 1 this suggests that the major cations do not participate in the cation exchange indeed there are no feldspar sodium bearing minerals imbedded in the host carbonate rocks since analysis of chemical compositions and ratio can only provide the concentration of sulfate and its potential source but not its definite source further analyses of isotopic 34sso4 and 18oso4 were carried out to decipher the origin of the sulfate content because so4 2 from different sources is characterized by distinct fingerprints clark and fritz 1997 the dual stable isotopes of sulfate have been widely employed to determine the origin of so4 2 in water groundwater evolution and water rock interactions occurring in groundwater thermal systems e g gonzález ramón et al 2017 grasby et al 2000 marques et al 2013 xiao et al 2018 this approach was particularly successful when both the sulfur and oxygen isotope abundance ratios in the sulfate ion were determined pu et al 2013 found that the shallow karst groundwaters in the studied region ranged from 1 3 to 14 with an average of 6 2 for δ34sso4 and 6 7 45 1 mg l with an average 19 6 mg l for so4 2 and suggested multi sulfur sources including atmospheric acid deposition dissolution of gypsum oxidation of sulfide mineral and contributions from coal containing strata or anthropogenic inputs the δ34sso4 and so4 2 in the thermal waters of this study are many times higher than that of shallow groundwaters reported by pu et al 2013 suggesting that they are governed by different sulfur sources and different controlling mechanisms the so4 2 in the thermal waters could result from isotopic exchange in the system so4 2 h2s sulfate reduction sulfide oxidation dissolution of evaporitic sulfate gypsum and or anhydrite dissolution of sedimentary sulfides i e pyrite the δ34sso4 values of the thermal waters table 1 and fig 7 are among the range of δ34sso4 values in the seawater during cambrian times around 30 strauss 1997 near the values of 34 to 53 for phosphorites and carbonates within the yangtze platform china goldberg et al 2005 and similar to the range of 28 2 to 33 7 in cambrian and ordovician carbonate thermal waters of the tangshan hydrothermal system near nanjing china lu et al 2018 the δ18oso4 values of the thermal waters from 9 2 to 16 2 averaging at 13 7 2 3 are in agreement with published δ18oso4 values of 14 from cambrian evaporitic calcium sulfates claypool et al 1980 and correspond with isotopic compositions of marine sulfate with a range of 12 to 15 throughout the period of late neoproterozoic to early cambrian in yangtze platform china goldberg et al 2005 moreover the dissolution of gypsum or anhydrite occurs without measurable isotope effects relative to the evaporitic sulfate minerals clark and fritz 1997 thus in combination with the result of ionic ratios mentioned above the so4 2 in the thermal waters are interpreted to be derived from the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite formed in the cambrian and ordovician periods which were found in the deeper regional formations within the aquifer gbsp 1979 gypsum dissolution has produced significant tertiary porosity and permeability in the aquifers which is an essential precursor to the development of karstic drainage gunn et al 2006 although there is no evidence from the ionic ratios showing the dissolution of carbonate limestone and or dolomite the hco3 existing in the thermal waters firmly suggests that the dissolution of carbonate derived by co2 occurs which is covered by the other hydrochemical processes mentioned above thus the dissolution of carbonate gypsum and or anhydrite and halite common ion effect and dedolomitization mainly control the hydrochemical processes in the carbonate evaporite thermal aquifers of sec the occurrence of these thermal waters as well as their diverse chemical characteristics seem to indicate that large scale deep seated groundwater flow systems exists in the karstic aquifers 5 2 origin of the thermal waters the potential water origin can be traced using stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes dansgaard 1964 except for sample no 16 the thermal waters have mean values of 9 0 59 8 for δ18o and δd respectively and very isotopically depleted compared to the water samples from four rivers fig 1 with a mean value of 6 3 and 38 5 for δ18o and δd respectively unpublished data suggesting a paleoclimatic signature in the thermal waters dansgaard 1964 fu et al 2018 huang et al 2017a and meaning that the recharging meteoric water was recharged at a relative wetter and colder climatic condition than present time except for sample no 16 the corrected a14cdic dating of the thermal waters show that the average age is approximately 14 8 ka bp see section 5 4 corresponding to the late pleistocene this confirms the depleted 18o and 2h characteristics of the thermal waters thus there is a positive relationship between δ18o and a14cdic fig 8 because the less a14cdic concentrations in the thermal waters the more residence time and more negative δ18o values are stute and deak 1989 dansgaard 1964 has reported that the δ18o and δd values show a positive correlation with the temperature with a slope of 0 69 per c for δ18o and 5 6 per c for δd from this information it can be inferred that the thermal waters were recharged under a paleoclimate characterized by a mean of 3 8 c colder than the present day annual average temperature this result is confirmed by many studies in china for example lower winter temperatures in the late pleistocene as compared to modern times where demonstrated during a study of the mammalian fauna from a cave in the three gorges area pang et al 2017 approximately 200 km north away from the study area and the recharge temperatures in the late pleistocene of about 2 3 c cooler than the modern mean annual air temperature within the minqin basin nw china edmunds et al 2006 among the thermal waters the isotopic enrichment of 18o and 2h of sample no 16 is associated with recent younger water recharge which is confirmed by high a14cdic as mentioned in sections 4 3 and 5 4 5 3 reservoir temperature and circulation depth the na k mg triangular plot proposed by giggenbach 1988 was introduced as a powerful tool in the interpretation of geothermal geochemistry in this plot waters are divided into three groups including fully equilibrated water partially equilibrated water and immature water allowing a clear distinction to be made between waters suitable or unsuitable for the application of cation geothermometers giggenbach 1988 the thermal waters of the study area are superposed on the na k mg giggenbach plot shown in fig 9 except for sample no 16 the thermal waters of group a are located at the partially equilibrated zone whereas the samples of group b plot near to the mg2 corner and correspond to immature waters this suggests that the ascending deep seated thermal fluids of group b along with sample no 16 are mixing with cold water and or re equilibrating along their circulation and thus unsuitable for the evaluation of cation equilibration moreover in a sedimentary environment the mineralogy of the host rocks and the low prevailing temperatures 150 c lead to slow kinetics with the result that cation solute geothermometers based on equilibrium with k feldspars and ca bearing silicates cannot be applied levet et al 2006 hence all the temperatures given by the cation solute geothermometers are baseless which are characterized by unrealistically high or negative equilibration temperatures table 3 most sis of the thermal waters are undersaturated except for the quartz values which are oversaturated table 2 which suggests that the quartz equilibrium is established between the thermal waters and host rock so the silica geothermometers may be most suitable for the thermal waters from the study area best estimated temperatures by the quartz geothermometer fournier 1977 and improved sio2 geothermometer verma and santoyo 1997 average at 63 18 c and 63 19 c for group a and average at 82 15 c and 83 15 c for group b the estimated temperatures by these two geothermometers yield similar results and are within the uncertainty range of 20 c which is generally acceptable in geothermometrical calculations tole et al 1993 and are consistent with estimated temperatures averaging at 80 c based on a chemical thermodynamic model unpublished data the classical chemical geothermometers including silica geothermometers provide good results in high temperature 180 c systems hosted in rocks with feldspars and aluminosilicates with which the waters have reached equilibrium and these geothermometers sometimes are not expected to be suitable for low temperature and or carbonate evaporite aquifers in some cases blasco et al 2018 fournier and truesdell 1973 however they can provide rational consistent and verified results in some low and medium temperature cases of carbonate systems bozdag 2016 renac et al 2009 yang et al 2017 and serve as a reliable estimation of the reservoir temperature for thermal waters with high cation concentrations shestakova and guseva 2018 as such the reservoir temperatures estimated by silica geothermometers in the study should be applicable and reliable most of the temperatures of group b estimated by δ18oso4 h2o geothermometer are between 50 and 60 c fig 4 with one up to 80 c these results seem to be a little lower than those temperatures calculated by silica geothermometers reported above probably implying an isotopic disequilibrium between δ18oso4 and δ18oh2o for low temperature reservoirs there are likely two reasons contributing to the isotopic disequilibrium the first one the ascending deep seated thermal fluids mix with the shallow groundwater characterized by lower concentration so4 2 and enriched 18oh2o the second one the exchange rates of oxygen isotope in the sulfate water system are extremely slow at earth surface conditions it requires up to 100 000 years to approach near isotopic oxygen equilibrium between dissolved sulfate and water lloyd 1968 hence the δ18oso4 h2o geothermometer probably does not reflect the real reservoir temperature moreover the water oxygen signature from the thermal springs does not show an enrichment of 18o positive δ18o shift with respect to that of the regional and global meteoric water fig 3 as meteoric water infiltrates through the ground into the geothermal reservoir isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding rock matrix and the extent of isotopic exchange are controlled by the temperature geyh 2001 isotopic exchange of oxygen isotopes between the meteoric water and the carbonate or silicate formations with unchanged hydrogen isotope in high temperature aquifers was widely documented around the world e g gat 2010 tian et al 2018 wang et al 2016 however the water rock interaction has little effect on δ18o in groundwater at reservoir temperatures 90 c mook 2000 the lack of positive δ18o shift for the thermal waters within sec implies that the reservoir temperature should be 90 c which strangely suggests that the mean temperatures estimated by silica geothermometers are rational compared to the temperatures estimated by other chemical geothermometers the maximum circulation depth of the thermal waters can be calculated by an equation shown in eq 7 the estimated reservoir temperature t is set to the average temperature estimated by the two silica geothermometers including the quartz geothermometer fournier 1977 and improved sio2 geothermometer verma and santoyo 1997 the local mean annual air temperature t0 is 16 6 c the depth of constant temperature zone d is assumed to be 0 03 km according to yang et al 2019 the geothermal gradient g is from the average value calculated by an equation as expressed by eq 8 the bottom hole temperature tb and the well depth dw in km are listed in table 4 thus the calculated g values of samples nos 3 5 and 12 drilled wells are 22 9 21 1 and 19 5 c km respectively table 4 with an average of 21 c km slightly below the average of the earth crust 30 c km these values are consistent with the thermal anomaly described in this area with an average geothermal gradient value of 25 c km chen 1994 the reservoir temperatures by silica geothermometers in conjunction with the average geothermal gradient of 21 c km indicate that the circulation depth ranges from 1 5 to 3 5 km with an average of 2 5 0 7 km for group a except for sample no 16 and 2 to 4 7 km with an average of 3 2 0 7 km for group b although these values cannot be confirmed or rejected they are the most reliable data for the study area 7 d t t 0 g d where d is the circulation depth in km t is the estimated reservoir temperature in c t0 the local mean annual air temperature in c g is the geothermal gradient in c km and d is the depth of constant temperature zone in km 8 g t b t 0 d w where g and t0 are same as in eq 7 tb is the bottom hole temperature in c dw is the well depth in km 5 4 residence time of the thermal waters estimating groundwater age is important and useful for any groundwater resource assessment because numerous studies have reported that the carbonate thermal waters are more than several thousands of years old ettayfi et al 2012 mao et al 2018 yang et al 2017 the a14cdic concentrations rather than the tritium dating of the thermal water samples were measured in this study the half life of 5730 years for a14cdic makes it highly useful for dating carbon bearing materials allowing measurement to almost 60 000 years which is considered to be a universal and reliable groundwater dating method clark and fritz 1997 and provides information and facilitates studies of archeological materials goldscheider and drew 2007 meredith et al 2016 and groundwater recharge mechanism huang et al 2017b kulongoski et al 2008 in addition to radioactive decay the a14cdic content can be affected by many geochemical and physical processes han et al 2014 which controls the isotope geochemistry of carbon during water infiltration through the unsaturated zone interactions in an open system and within the aquifer system itself interactions in a closed system kattan 2002 during transit in the aquifer these processes modify the initial a14cdic content 14c0 in groundwater because the ancient rocks are free of a14cdic dead carbon which inevitably increases the calculated groundwater ages without correction the measured a14cdic contents thus should be reassessed during the use of radiocarbon dating for thermal groundwater if additional dead carbon exists in the water aquilina et al 2003 mao et al 2018 there is a negative relationship between δ13cdic and a14cdic of the thermal waters within sec fig 10 which may suggest additional dead carbon thus it s necessary to correct the ages of the thermal water samples of the sec based on the measured a14cdic the vegetation in the study area is dominated by c3 calvin c3 photosynthesis cycle the δ13c values of most c3 range from 24 to 30 with an average of 27 vogel 1993 due to the high concentration gradient the degassing of soil co2 makes the 13cco2 fractionation as much as 4 cerling et al 1991 jin et al 2014 thus the δ13cco2 in the soil should be 23 when the soil co2 dissolved the carbonate aquifer half of the dic in aquifer is from the soil and the other half is derived from the host carbonate rocks which results in an enrichment factor ɛ of δ13cdic with an ɛ13cdic co2 g value of 9 at 15 c clark and fritz 1997 hence the δ 13cdic as a result of c3 plants in the carbonate aquifer should be 14 at 15 c on the basis of these assumptions a mixing model was proposed as shown in fig 10 in which the dic in the thermal waters is a result of mixture of the dissolution of cambrian carbonates in the thermal reservoir δ13cdic 0 a14cdic 0 pmc and co2 from soil respiration δ13cdic 14 at 15 c a14cdic 100 pmc numerous calibrated models have been employed to estimate the radiocarbon ages of dic in groundwater systems e g evans et al 1979 han et al 2014 huang et al 2017a tamers 1975 generally these models can be categorized into two types processes of chemical and isotopic mixing and chemical mixing with isotopic exchange clark and fritz 1997 however the calculated δ13cco2 values in the thermal waters range from 5 7 to 20 7 averaging at 12 7 based on a linear regression between δ13cdic and δ13cco2 as expressed by eq 9 from deines et al 1974 except for samples nos 16 20 7 and 17 19 0 most of the calculated δ13cco2 values of the thermal waters are much higher than that of the theoretical value in the soil 23 the higher δ13cco2 values together with the higher δ13cdic values of the thermal waters suggest that the solutions in the thermal aquifers occur chiefly under closed groundwater systems which is confirmed by the isolated thermal aquifers based on the lower nitrate concentrations compared with those of the shallow karst groundwaters reported by pu et al 2013 a widely used correction model alk model tamers 1975 was employed to correct the ages in this study because this model is based on initial and final carbonate dic concentrations and was proposed for groundwater in which calcite is dissolved under closed system conditions moreover this model assumes fully closed system conditions without exchange of soil co2 during calcite dissolution tamers 1975 the corrected ages by the alk model are listed in table 1 generally most of the corrected 14cdic ages n 5 are much younger than the uncorrected 14cdic ages except for sample no 16 the corrected ages are from 9 to 21 ka bp with an average of 14 8 ka bp the corrected age of sample no 16 is negative and irrational because of mixture with younger water although the corrected 14cdic ages may deviate from the real ages to some extent it is believed to be more accurate than the uncorrected ages and can indicate the age level of the thermal waters 9 δ 13 c co 2 δ 13 c dic 4 54 1 099 10 6 t 2 where t is the temperature of thermal water in kelvin degree the estimation of renewable groundwater resources and understanding of related hydrological processes are critically dependent upon determining the presence and age of modern groundwater aggarwal 2002 deep groundwater characterized by more than 1 ka ages is considered non renewable paleo water without the possibility of significant replenishment under present climatic conditions huang et al 2017a generally the depletion of δ18o and δd in the thermal waters compared to modern recharge coupled with the low a14cdic concentrations and their corresponding corrected ages suggest that the renewability rate for most of the thermal water resources in the aquifers is characterized by a hydraulic continuity on an order of 14 8 ka thus aquifer renewability needs to be fully considered and assessed before groundwater exploitation and extraction 5 5 conceptual circulation of the thermal waters according to the hydrogeochemical and geothermometrical results above a conceptual hydrogeological model was reconstructed as schematically depicted in fig 11 which is a qualitative schematic representation of or part of reality the poorly known or unknown characteristics of the hydrothermal aquifer systems of interest such as the precise location of the infiltration areas as well as the geometry of the geological bodies hosting most of the hydrogeological flow path are roughly shown in fig 11 the thermal waters originate from common meteoric water at a relative wetter and colder climate in the late pleistocene assuming a geothermal gradient of 21 c km the meteoric water infiltrates into the subsurface at maximum depth at roughly 2 5 and 3 2 km for group a and group b respectively to acquire the heat from deep rock through conductive transfer during their circulation and form the deep seated thermal fluids characterized by temperatures of approximately 63 and 83 c for group a and group b respectively the fluids are characterized by cross formational hydraulic continuity at the same time the fluids interact with evaporitic deposits composed of halite and sulfate minerals at depth which results in high salinity particularly the enrichment of na and cl in group a the fluids returning flow to the surface is mainly driven by topographic head difference tóth 1963 between the recharge area in the limestone mountains and the thermal water resurgences free thermal convection may affect the deeper part of the midline and the discharge zone of the hydrothermal systems as well szijártó et al 2019 the local tectonic setting represented by the presence of the deep seated faults in this area enhances the permeability and plays an important role in the circulation and upwelling of deep seated thermal fluids toward the surface the deep seated thermal fluids move up along the faults and mix with different proportions of colder waters to form the hot springs this mixing accounts for the variations in temperatures and chemical compositions among individual springs or drilled well waters such as sample no 16 characterized by a high mixture fraction of modern water there are possible similar hydrologic environments between group a and group b indicated by the chemical identification but there are differences in the halite imbedded in the aquifers and circulation depths between the two groups although the mechanism of the geothermal flow dynamics to some extent remains speculative the conceptual hydrogeological model is the most rational based on the analyses of hydrogeological settings and the hydrogeochemical and geothermometrical data 6 conclusions this paper is the first to present the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of the thermal waters from carbonate evaporite aquifers hosted by deep seated faults in southeast chongqing china where thermal fluids discharge from cambrian and ordovician carbonate evaporite rocks representing the main potential thermal reservoir major ions and isotopes 34sso4 18oso4 18o 2h 13cdic and a14cdic were employed to constrain the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of the thermal waters from carbonate evaporite aquifers hosted by deep seated faults in the study area the low temperature hydrothermal systems are manifested by hot springs emerging around the faults the groundwater interaction with carbonate evaporite rocks explains the two distinct chemical compositions of the thermal waters characterized by the chloride sodium waters with higher tds group a and sulfate bicarbonate chloride alkaline earth waters with relative lower tds group b in the study area the dissolution of carbonate gypsum and or anhydrite and halite common ion effect and dedolomitization control the hydrochemical processes in the carbonate evaporite thermal aquifers the thermal waters originate from meteoric water the reservoir temperature appears to be 63 18 c for group a and 82 15 c for group b as indicated by silica geothermometers the corrected 14cdic ages average at 14 8 ka bp corresponding to late pleistocene which suggests that the renewability rate of most of the thermal waters are on an order of 14 8 ka thus the slow renewability rate of thermal water resources in the study area inevitably provides a challenge to the future utilization for social and economic development monitoring the major ions and isotopic compositions of thermal waters can provide important indications as to the formational mechanisms of the carbonate evaporite hydrothermal systems indeed such monitoring provides valuable information of the thermal waters to define the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of the aquifers and lays a solid foundation for future efficient utilization management and implementation of water conservation policies for the thermal water resources in the study area the methodological approachs utilized in this research may also be applied to other fault controlled low temperature carbonate

6021,urban water problems e g increased runoff inhibited infiltration and groundwater recharge are becoming increasingly serious and green infrastructure gi has been demonstrated to be effective in tackling these problems and restoring the pre development hydrologic cycle however shallow groundwater limits the implementation of infiltration based gi although projects and studies have been conducted knowledge of the hydrologic performance of infiltration based gi and the impact on shallow groundwater environments has not been comprehensively summarized in this review we first identify the challenges of implementing infiltration based gi in shallow groundwater environments and then evaluate and compare the potential approaches to evaluating gi in such environments we also summarize progress in the understanding of the performance and impact of gi in shallow groundwater environments from previous and ongoing engineering projects and academic studies the main topics include the evaluation of the potential reduction in runoff control performance of gi the formation of groundwater mounds and groundwater contamination we also assess the exploration of strategies for optimally allocating and designing gi in shallow groundwater environments the distance between the bottom of the gi and the groundwater table the selection of the media soil and the design of underdrain pipes are the main considerations when implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments the review is concluded with recommendations for future studies which include conducting tracer monitoring and variably saturated modeling to track subsurface flows of gi improving existing hydrological models developing new multi scale models and utilizing more advanced data driven artificial intelligence models to predict the performance and impact of gi and to process the monitoring data for model calibration keywords green infrastructure low impact development best management practices stormwater groundwater recharge 1 introduction rapid urbanization reduces green spaces changes the water cycle and alters the way nature interacts with humans more impervious surfaces lead to increases in surface runoff i e the risk of flooding and non point source pollution loads infiltration and groundwater recharge are also reduced shuster et al 2005 these urban water problems are becoming global

approaches to urban water management have been implemented butler and parkinson 1997 brown et al 2009 marlow et al 2013 li et al 2017a green infrastructure gi is one major innovation and has gained a reputation for relieving urban water problems ahiablame et al 2012 chang et al 2018 jefferson et al 2017 li et al 2017b the natural hydrologic cycle is mimicked through enhancing infiltration chui and trinh 2016 reducing surface runoff qin et al 2013 chui et al 2016 recharging groundwater newcomer et al 2014 kidmose et al 2015 bhaskar et al 2018 mooers et al 2018 and increasing the base flow hamel et al 2013 bhaskar et al 2016 fanelli et al 2017 wright et al 2018 the approach also enhances the natural environments of urban areas tzoulas et al 2007 zhang and chui 2019 although the performance of gi may decline over time e g due to clogging and soil crusting and it has a high maintenance requirement askarizadeh et al 2015 its extensive benefits make it a broadly cost effective choice houle et al 2013 numerous objectives and functions have been included in the definition of gi ec 2013 but in this review the focus is on gi for urban stormwater management which has similarities with the terminologies of low impact development lid best management practices bmp sustainable urban drainage system suds and water sensitive urban design wsud young et al 2014 fletcher et al 2015 chang et al 2018 the focus is particularly on gi that enhances infiltration such as bioretention cells or bioswales porous pavements and infiltration trenches due to widespread urbanization and the associated water problems many cities worldwide have directed significant resources at developing and installing gi andoh and iwugo 2002 nickel et al 2014 for example the chinese government plans to spend more than 1 5 trillion usd on promoting and constructing gi in 657 cities nationwide by 2030 jia et al 2017 the city of philadelphia pennsylvania u s has also proposed a long term plan to replace 40 of the impervious infrastructure of the city with gi maimone et al 2011 however implementing infiltration based gi in shallow groundwater areas which include a large proportion of urban areas small and nicholls 2003 presents major challenges that have significantly restricted its widespread adoption usepa 2016 reported that 50 of the gi projects in the st paul area of minnesota u s was affected by shallow groundwater increased infiltration and groundwater recharge through gi can affect the groundwater dynamics göbel et al 2004 bhaskar et al 2018 zhang and chui 2018a and thus groundwater flooding may occur which damages nearby underground infrastructure zheng et al 2018 groundwater is also subject to a higher risk of contamination because the infiltrated water has less chance to be filtered due to the shorter traveling distance and hydraulic retention time hathhorn and yonge 1996 fischer et al 2003 datry et al 2004 voisin et al 2018 the performance of gi may also be affected by shallow groundwater a shallow groundwater table results in more saturated media and in situ soils which forms a smaller hydraulic gradient and impedes the infiltration into and exfiltration out of the gi guo 1998 bouwer 2002 jackisch and weiler 2017 it should be noted that the shallow groundwater mentioned in this paper refers to groundwater table shallower than 2 3 m below the bottom of gi which is a commonly adopted and recognized criterion for shallow groundwater in gi related studies göbel et al 2004 endreny and collins 2009 zhang and chui 2017 approaches for preventing or minimizing these problems have been proposed and implemented the most common approach is to establish standards or guidelines to avoid locating gi in shallow groundwater areas if possible for example the criteria of minimum distance between the bottom of gi and the seasonal high groundwater table is 0 6 m in prince george county u s 1 0 m in london u k auckland new zealand and toronto canada 1 8 m in arlington u s and 3 1 m in san diego u s zhang and chui 2017 however as stated by zhang and chui 2017 following one strict criterion without detailed and site specific assessments is ineffective because the situation changes with variations in climatic and geophysical conditions particularly in places with borderline or highly variable groundwater tables installing impermeable liners on both the lateral sides and the bottom of gi reducing the media depth and elevating the bottom are also possible solutions to isolate gi from shallow groundwater however these approaches may compromise the performance of gi in surface runoff control li et al 2009 guidelines also cover the installation of an underdrain at the bottom of gi to drain groundwater and prevent the long term submergence of gi eisenberg et al 2013 however this can waste groundwater resources which are often valuable and also increases the loading to the downstream drainage systems herrera 2013 zhang et al 2018 which goes against the original objective of implementing gi the growing demand of gi in shallow groundwater areas requires better strategies for implementing gi without affecting or being affected by shallow groundwater the effects of gi on subsurface hydrological conditions and groundwater have been reviewed by nieber et al 2014 bonneau et al 2017 jefferson et al 2017 and li et al 2017b however to the best of our knowledge no comprehensive review has been conducted thus we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the challenges approaches and progress in implementing infiltration based gi in shallow groundwater environments based on previous and ongoing engineering projects and academic studies of gi in shallow groundwater environments we identify the challenges to implementing gi in these environments evaluate and compare the research approaches assess the progress in understanding the performance and impact of gi and in exploring the strategies for optimally allocating and designing gi in shallow groundwater environments we are then able to provide recommendations for future research so the remaining issues can be better addressed the scope of this review is limited to infiltration based gi so practices such as green roofs rain barrels and other gi without a direct connection to groundwater are not covered here 2 methodology we reviewed more than 80 peer reviewed papers and various technical reports related to the implementation of gi in shallow groundwater the papers and reports were located through the databases of the university of hong kong library and google using the keywords green infrastructure low impact development groundwater recharge water table subsurface and their various combinations based on the results a four phase review was conducted the main procedures and content covered are elaborated below fig 1 1 in the first phase the challenges of implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments were identified which include the impact of gi on groundwater and vice versa 2 in the second phase a framework for evaluating gi in shallow groundwater environments was outlined and existing numerical models for evaluating gi in shallow groundwater environments were categorized and compared according to their specific capabilities and suitability to simulate gi in shallow groundwater environments 3 in the third phase previous and ongoing gi projects and academic studies reported in peer reviewed journal papers and technical reports were reviewed the progress made in understanding the performance and impact of gi and in exploring the strategies for its optimal allocation and design in shallow groundwater environments was recapped 4 in the fourth phase potential research areas for future work are proposed which can enhance the understanding of the performance and impact of gi in shallow groundwater environments and lead to better strategies for implementing gi in such environments 3 challenges in implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments under normal conditions without the severe constraint of shallow groundwater gi contributes to the restoration of the natural hydrological cycle the main hydrologic processes involved in the interaction between infiltration based gi and groundwater are shown in fig 2 for example the highly permeable surfaces and media materials in gi reduce surface runoff no 3 process in fig 2 through enhanced infiltration no 2 process in fig 2 and evapotranspiration no 4 process in fig 2 some of the infiltrated water exfiltrates to the surrounding subsurface no 6 process in fig 2 which helps to recharge the groundwater no 8 process in fig 2 bhaskar et al 2018 and increase the stream base flow no 9 process in fig 2 bhaskar et al 2016 thus the natural hydrological cycle is activated stewart et al 2017 however as mentioned the implementation of gi may lead to problems when the groundwater table is shallow these potential problems can either be due to the impact of gi on groundwater or the impact of groundwater on gi and both types are elaborated below gi can affect the quantity and quality of groundwater when the groundwater table is shallow infiltrated water can recharge groundwater more quickly due to a shorter traveling distance the local groundwater mound could then become a concern due to higher infiltration rate associated with gi thompson et al 2010 machusick et al 2011 stewart et al 2017 zhang and chui 2017 groundwater mounding can result in the groundwater table reaching the surface and causing flooding and nearby underground infrastructure may be damaged the risks of groundwater contamination may also increase due to enhanced infiltration and recharge this problem is more obvious in shallow groundwater environments due to the shorter distance between the bottom of the gi and the groundwater table and thus less hydraulic retention time this is particularly severe for right of way gi that may receive highly contaminated surface runoff from roads many studies have reported this as a noteworthy problem in gi implementation appleyard 1993 fischer et al 2003 datry et al 2004 shallow depth of groundwater also affects the water quantity and quality control performance of gi due to the shallow groundwater environment the unsaturated zone is relatively thin and the soil moisture relatively high so the exfiltration rate out of gi can be restricted given a lower hydraulic gradient guo 1998 bouwer 2002 jackisch and weiler 2017 thus the surface runoff control efficiency of gi can be affected thompson et al 2010 he and davis 2010 locatelli et al 2015 2017 d aniello et al 2019 in addition groundwater also affects the micro ecosystem and the biochemical environment inside the gi palanisamy and chui 2013 which can affect its water quality control performance brown et al 2011 4 approaches to evaluating gi in shallow groundwater environments 4 1 evaluation framework evaluating gi in shallow groundwater environments is complicated given the various hydrological and biochemical processes involved thus different approaches are required to quantify and evaluate both surface and subsurface processes fig 3 illustrates the schematic of the framework to evaluate gi in shallow groundwater environments laboratory monitoring in situ monitoring numerical modeling and remote sensing are the most widely used approaches and each has its own advantages and limitations thus before embarking on a gi project or study a pre project evaluation must be conducted to determine the project objectives understand the site conditions and then decide the suitable evaluation approaches fig 3 the considerations involved are summarized below laboratory monitoring can be conducted if 1 the project solely focuses on the evaluation and optimal design of an individual gi and 2 there is sufficient space equipment time and other resources e g labor to build physical models and carry out monitoring activities the results of laboratory monitoring are typically less realistic than in situ monitoring because of the challenge in replicating the practical site conditions this problem is more prominent when groundwater is involved and may be why very limited laboratory research related to gi and groundwater has been conducted however the results of laboratory monitoring are relatively more reliable and more factors can be examined in a controlled environment in situ monitoring can be conducted if permitted and with sufficient equipment time and other resources e g labor this is the best option if the project focuses on a very specific area it is particularly suitable if the site is too complex to be conceptualized or if the site conditions i e geologic or boundary conditions are not sufficiently known for constructing physical or numerical models numerical modeling can be conducted if the basic meteorological and geologic data of the site can be collected besides given the advantages of numerical modeling in efficiency and multi parameter analysis it is particularly a better choice over laboratory experiment and in situ monitoring 1 if the project aims to provide generic non site specific engineering guidance and 2 if the project requires a quick pre evaluation to obtain some general understanding without a full representation of the real situation before implementation remote sensing can be conducted if 1 the project focuses on higher level and larger scale gi planning and 2 if the site s spatial data are available in situ monitoring and numerical modeling have been relatively more widely utilized for evaluating the performance and impact of gi in shallow groundwater environments it should be noted that all of the approaches can supplement each other by providing supporting information for example the monitoring data obtained from laboratory and in situ monitoring is needed to calibrate and validate the numerical models and the remotely sensed data can also facilitate the construction of numerical models jayasooriya and ng 2014 the results of numerical modeling can also support the design of laboratory and in situ monitoring thus in some cases all four types of approaches can be conducted simultaneously generating a more thorough understanding of the performance and impact of gi and providing better engineering guidance for example a gi groundwater recharge project in santa cruz california u s began with a gis spatial analysis to identify the suitable locations for groundwater recharge numerical models were then used to estimate the potential effects of groundwater recharge and thus these combined methods tested the applicability and optimized the implementation plan of the project after the initiation of the project the performance of groundwater recharge over time was tracked using long term monitoring beganskas and fisher 2017 4 2 numerical models as the above section demonstrates different approaches possess different capabilities for evaluating gi in shallow groundwater environments running numerical models is typically more efficient than monitoring as it does not require physical setups and fixed time spans it is particularly efficient in tracking subsurface flows and performing multi parameter analyses which cannot be easily realized through monitoring elliott and trowsdale 2007 and is also more widely used than remote sensing techniques because gi is usually studied at the catchment level where the strengths of remote sensing cannot be fully exhibited scipal et al 2005 thus the specific numerical models that can simulate the performance and impact of gi in shallow groundwater environments are summarized and compared in this section numerical models can be generally divided into those at planning level e g multiple gi practices at catchment scale and design level e g individual gi based on their capabilities and potential applications two types of models differ in capacities of hydrologic calculation representation of spatially varied features and variables and representation of design features of gi the capacities of both types of models in the abovementioned three aspects are summarized in fig 4 apart from these temporal and spatial resolutions are also important features of numerical models and are implicitly included in the above mentioned features a finer temporal resolution supports more accurate hydrologic calculations and spatial resolution is related to the capacity of spatial representation it should be noted that the word of accurate here implies models better capacity to reflect realistic situations moreover the openness of the model structure is another important feature which determines the models flexibility to be modified and coupled to other numerical models optimization algorithms and post processing tools it should be noted that a suitable or selected numerical model may not necessarily possess all the above features the suitability of a specific numerical model depends on the objectives and details of a project furthermore numerical models can be also categorized into three types variably saturated porous media models e g vs2d hydrus comsol and feflow surface subsurface hydrological models e g shetran mike she gsflow velma and swat modflow and gi specific surface subsurface models e g sw mm gifmod swingo vfsmod and swmm lid gw to assess their suitability and as a basis for the development of new models the models are evaluated at both planning and design levels the main advantages disadvantages potential applications and improvements are discussed and compared in fig 4 and the sub sections below note that only the models most commonly used for gi are reviewed here while others are also available 4 2 1 planning level at planning level numerical models are required to have great capacity in calculating spatially varied processes and representing spatially varied features fig 4 thus some spatially distributed or semi distributed hydrological models are possible choices for gi planning they can simulate different surface and subsurface hydrological processes e g runoff generation groundwater recharge and movement evapotranspiration snowmelt and solute transport at watershed scale mike she velma and shetran all belong to this group of models and gsflow and swat modflow which were combined with surface hydrological models prms and swat respectively and modflow also possess similar functionalities however they have not been widely used for gi because as spatially distributed models they require abundant spatial data which may not always be available and more importantly their spatial and temporal resolutions are typically coarse the grid size supported in these models usually exceeds the normal size of gi thus they often cannot accurately represent the design features of gi fig 4 most models only support sub daily or daily simulation so they may not accurately simulate the time sensitive hydrological processes and benefits of gi e g peak reduction of surface runoff in addition most of them also do not support the simulation of urban drainage systems which limits their usages in urban areas some improvements have been made to these models so that they are better suited to the requirements of gi for example a sub hourly rainfall runoff simulation has been enabled in swat and a swat lid module was developed to simulate the water diversion from impervious areas to gi and from gi to pervious areas within each hydrologic response unit of swat jeong et al 2010 seo et al 2017 however this has not yet been enabled in swat modflow which limits its application for gi similar to the swat lid module a new ponded drainage feature has been developed in mike she dhi 2017 this enables the simulation of internal stormwater drainage between surface depressions and catchments which is an important function of gi if other disadvantages such as the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions mentioned above can be improved then mike she can become a very good choice in addition these models can be more suitable if being coupled with hydraulics models for example kidmose et al 2015 coupled mike she with mike urban to evaluate the influence of forced infiltration on groundwater recharge and the feedback from groundwater to urban drainage systems apart from the models mentioned above some other physically based numerical models have also been developed specifically for gi to more accurately and efficiently simulate the characteristics of gi fig 4 they are not distributed spatially models and the simulation of some processes e g solar radiation and evapotranspiration which may not be as important for gi are often simplified however they are better suited for gi at planning level because they enable finer temporal and spatial simulations and they can simulate urban drainage systems besides they are more efficient due to their simpler structures i e fewer components and lower data requirements swmm lid gw developed by zhang et al 2018 is an improved version of swmm as it considers the groundwater table depth in the calculation of the hydrological processes of gi zhang et al 2018 compared swmm lid gw with swmm in simulating gi in a shallow groundwater urban catchment swmm lid gw performed significantly better particularly when the groundwater table was very close to the ground or the bottom of gi i e around 1 0 m below ground however it does not simulate groundwater dynamics and requires groundwater monitoring data which significantly restricts its application comparatively the model developed by massoudieh et al 2017 gifmod shows a greater potential in simulating gi in shallow groundwater environments due to its capacity to simulate groundwater dynamics fig 4 4 2 2 design level different from numerical models at planning level those at design level are not required to have spatial representation capacity however they better be able to represent the design features of gi to enable a more accurate and flexible evaluation of gi performance and optimal design fig 4 variably saturated porous media models e g vs2d hydrus comsol and feflow are a group of design level models they are finite difference or finite element based models that can accurately simulate subsurface flow by solving richards equation they are good choices to design gi for a variety of reasons first they can accurately account for the variation of infiltration exfiltration of gi due to the variation of soil moisture and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with groundwater fluctuation fig 4 second they can accurately simulate the solute transport processes beneath gi and in the subsurface which makes them more suitable for right of way gi practices given greater water quality concerns third they can flexibly represent the design features of gi for example the perforated underdrain of a gi can be simulated by characterizing the holes and assigning the boundary condition of the seepage face to them however these models can be only used at design level due to relatively weak in representing the spatial variabilities of processes and they simplify or even neglect the simulation of surface runoff generation some of the studies reviewed above have adopted this group of models and have made significant contributions to the evaluation of the hydrologic performance of individual gi systems göbel et al 2004 thompson et al 2010 newcomer et al 2014 stewart et al 2017 zhang and chui 2017 the disadvantages of these models fig 4 e g simplification of surface runoff simulation can be addressed by combining them with surface hydrological models to obtain more accurate and comprehensive results some studies have made efforts in this direction such as sansalone et al 2013 who integrated swmm with vs2d using the former for the simulation of rainfall runoff generation and routing and the latter for subsurface flow simulation they quantified the impact of a bioretention cell porous pavement treatment train on the overall water balance and subsurface solute transport stewart et al 2017 conducted numerical modeling using swmm and hydrus 2d 3d synchronously based on an in situ bioretention project in cleveland ohio u s the full hydrological cycle of the bioretention cell was simulated including the surface ponding depth underdrain flow soil moisture and groundwater table depth underneath and nearby zheng et al 2018 integrated swmm with feflow to calculate the surface runoff control performance of gi and evaluated the impact of enhanced infiltration by gi on the groundwater condition models such as hydrus 2d and comsol must also in some cases be combined with rainfall runoff and overland flow models to mitigate their limitations köhne et al 2011 apart from the abovementioned variably saturated porous media models some other gi specific models have also been developed for design level evaluation of gi fig 4 they are better than variably saturated porous media models in simulating rainfall runoff generation for example swmm lid gw gifmod sw mm and swingo vfsmod are all possible choices sw mm and swingo vfsmod was combined with infiltration and groundwater models the infiltration model adjusts the infiltration rate based on the groundwater table depth obtained from the groundwater model while the groundwater model calculates the dynamics of groundwater table in response to the surface infiltration and recharge obtained from the infiltration model roldin et al 2013 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 muñoz carpena et al 2018 roldin et al 2013 compared sw mm with another 2d variably saturated porous media model the results of the two models were comparable but sw mm was on average 600 times faster however sw mm and swingo vfsmod are limited in some aspects because they cannot represent some design features of gi e g underdrain and they do not support solute transport simulation fig 4 relatively swmm lid gw and gifmod are better in these aspects particularly gifmod can simulate the detailed design features of gi flexibly through simplifying gi practices as inter connected water storage blocks massoudieh et al 2017 5 progress in understanding the performance and impact of gi in shallow groundwater environments engineering projects and academic studies have been conducted with a major focus on the challenges of implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments using the approaches summarized above these have improved our understanding of the performance and impact of gi in these environments the projects and studies are summarized separately in this section after being further categorized into those focusing on the impact of gi on groundwater on the impact of groundwater on gi and on both impacts the timeline and findings of the projects and studies are presented in fig 5 and tables 1 and 2 respectively they differ in terms of the types of gi and their major performance indicators as table 1 shows some focused more on surface runoff control while others considered groundwater recharge or multiple benefits two additional issues should be noted 1 there is not always a clear distinction between engineering projects and academic studies here we mainly distinguish them based on their original objectives projects or studies that aimed to solve local problems are classified as engineering projects which were mostly in situ monitoring works and those that aimed to analyze the performance of gi or explored the mechanisms behind it are classified as academic studies which include both monitoring and modeling works 2 the review includes only a limited number of projects that have 1 been well documented 2 monitored both surface runoff or the underdrain flow of gi and groundwater and 3 clearly listed in the project objectives evaluating gi in shallow groundwater or enhancing groundwater recharge the projects reviewed here were mainly implemented in north america the u s and canada after 2005 however projects and studies have also been conducted in other locations 5 1 engineering projects since low impact development was first proposed in the 1990s the number of gi engineering projects has rapidly increased usepa 2000 their major objectives however vary significantly from the peak reduction of large events to the volume reduction of frequent events non point source pollution control combined sewer overflow control etc although these projects may have an impact on groundwater as an intrinsic effect of gi this was less of a concern and thus typically not evaluated gi was seldom implemented in shallow groundwater areas to avoid the associated problems in recent years however gi has been increasingly applied in these areas due to its extensive implementation and the growing problem of limited urban space thus more projects have been initiated to better understand the impact of shallow groundwater on gi and of gi on the hydrologic cycle 5 1 1 impact of gi on groundwater in 2013 and 2014 a small scale porous alley project was initiated in boston massachusetts u s to reduce flooding and recharge groundwater the results of the monitoring confirmed the enhanced infiltration by the porous pavement and the higher groundwater table in all seasons table 1 city of boston 2016 in addition a gi managed aquifer recharge gi mar project was initiated in 2013 in santa cruz county california u s which aimed to enhance groundwater recharge and increase the groundwater availability and freshwater supply in the area myer et al 2015 before implementation a gis spatial analysis was conducted to identify the prioritized locations and numerical modeling was performed to evaluate the runoff response and potential groundwater recharge efficiency the project generated a significant water supply benefit during its six year operation with 5 3 105 m3 of water collected and infiltrated beganskas and fisher 2017 5 1 2 impact of groundwater on gi more studies have focused on the impact of shallow groundwater on gi than on the impact of gi on groundwater the gi project at the edison environmental center initiated in 2009 in new jersey u s was the first we reviewed the project monitored the infiltration rate exfiltration rate and the storage water level of porous pavements to evaluate the impact of shallow groundwater on the surface and subsurface hydrologic processes brown and borst 2014 another gi project was implemented in kitsap county washington u s from 2011 which aimed to evaluate the runoff control performance of bioretention cells and porous pavements in various shallow groundwater conditions the groundwater table depth ranged from 0 7 to 1 3 m during the monitoring period which sometimes may intercept the gi systems the flow in the storm sewers at the site was significantly increased after gi implementation which was found to be caused by groundwater seepage into the underdrains of gi systems herrera 2013 another gi project implemented at the imax headquarters in the city of mississauga ontario canada showed different results the bioretention cells and porous pavements at that site performed reasonably well with only minor groundwater mounds formed a relatively deeper groundwater table i e 2 7 3 5 m below ground than that of kitsap county washington u s possibly caused the differences in the observations cvc 2016 5 1 3 combined impacts some recent projects focus on evaluating both the impact of shallow groundwater on the surface runoff control efficiency of gi and on the effect of gi on groundwater recharge in addition to the whole water balance a group of large scale gi projects was implemented in detroit michigan u s covering an area of 37 5 km2 some aimed at evaluating the performance of gi while others focused more on quantifying the impact of gi on groundwater various monitoring projects were implemented around belton street detroit u s in 2016 to quantify the infiltration runoff and the extent of groundwater mounding table 1 dwsd 2017 in addition monitoring projects have recently been initiated by great lakes restoration initiatives glri which also involved the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the united states geological survey usgs glri 2014 these include but may not be limited to three monitoring projects at gary city hall gary u s recovery park detroit u s and niagara river greenway buffalo u s the surface runoff sewer flow soil moisture and groundwater level before and after gi implementation were all monitored the results and findings of these projects have not yet been made available but may be released soon 5 2 academic studies 5 2 1 impact of gi on groundwater in the 20th and early 21st century monitoring was conducted to evaluate the potential risk of groundwater contamination due to stormwater infiltration samples were taken from groundwater and soils of different depths to examine whether the soils adsorbed a significant amount of pollutants and whether there was a relationship between the change of groundwater chemistry and the infiltrated runoff appleyard 1993 monitored the groundwater quality concentrations of do salinity metals nutrients pesticides etc at 12 locations near an infiltration basin in perth australia they found that the concentration of do rapidly increased in the upper part of the aquifer due to infiltration mikkelsen et al 1997 monitored two sites with infiltration basins in switzerland and obtained the vertical concentration profiles of heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah and adsorbable organic halogens aox they found that the pollutants from infiltrated stormwater were adsorbed by surface soils without increasing the risk of groundwater contamination however different findings were obtained in other studies hathhorn and yonge 1996 performed a series of laboratory experiments to evaluate whether heavy metals from runoff can pollute the groundwater underneath gi they demonstrated the potential of heavy metal contamination to the groundwater datry et al 2004 not only measured the pollutant concentration at different depths but also tracked the dynamics of pollutant plumes underneath an infiltration basin they observed elevated concentrations of phosphate and dissolved organic carbon doc in the groundwater under the infiltration basin which was thought to be caused by mineralization of organic sediments particularly in the summer fischer et al 2003 conducted a large scale study in which the quality of the groundwater near detention and retention basins was compared with that of the background groundwater in new jersey u s they found that the load and occurrence of petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides were greater in groundwater near the basins although the pollutant concentration in the surface runoff was relatively low and that dilution should occur due to the high recharge rate a research group in villanova university pennsylvania u s measured the water quality in the vadose zone near a porous pavement in the campus increased concentrations of copper and chloride were observed but were not high enough to influence the quality of the groundwater kwiatkowski et al 2007 since 2010 more studies have focused on the impact of gi on groundwater quantity and most demonstrated that gi can greatly enhance groundwater recharge newcomer et al 2014 and the formation of groundwater mounds göbel et al 2004 but the observed effects vary machusick et al 2011 monitored the groundwater mounding heights beneath a bioretention cell in the campus of villanova university pennsylvania u s for around 10 months the results demonstrated that the groundwater mound was localized and did not extend far from the bioretention cell similar observations were provided by trinh and chui 2013 singapore chui and trinh 2016 singapore stewart et al 2017 ohio u s and tu and traver 2018 pennsylvania u s through either numerical modeling or monitoring thomas and vogel 2011 and nemirovsky et al 2014 further quantified the dissipation of groundwater mounds spatially and found that the mounding effect can extend to over 22 m away and that the height of the groundwater mound formed by the bioretention cell was inversely proportional to the distance from it comparatively the groundwater mound away from the bioretention cell was lower in height and dissipated slower with a significant time lag bhaskar et al 2018 performed a large scale study and obtained very different results they monitored the groundwater dynamics of a 1 1 km2 suburban catchment with 73 gi systems in clarksburg maryland u s and found that the maximum groundwater recharge and mounding did not show up beneath the gi systems but was located downgradient from them the differences in these results may be due to the differences in soil characteristics e g the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of soil aquifer structure and regional groundwater gradient a recent study in shenzhen china conducted by zheng et al 2018 demonstrated that gi systems i e bioretention cells and porous pavements in their study can significantly enhance groundwater recharge and aquifer storage in wet seasons but can increase aquifer release and groundwater discharge in dry seasons they also found that the groundwater table rise decreased from the recharge zones to the discharge zones the magnitude of which was determined by the location of gi systems within the catchment and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil underneath 5 2 2 impact of groundwater on gi the findings about the influence of shallow groundwater on the infiltration and runoff control performance of gi vary trinh and chui 2013 and chui and trinh 2016 evaluated the effect of different gi systems e g bioretention cells and green roofs on the water balance and groundwater table depth of the catchment using mike she they found that shallow groundwater did not show an obvious influence on surface infiltration a similar observation was made by zhang and chui 2017 who simulated an individual bioretention cell possibly due to the relatively narrow range of groundwater table depth they covered i e around 1 5 m below ground for trinh and chui 2013 and chui and trinh 2016 and 1 3 m below the bottom of the bioretention cell for zhang and chui 2017 however different findings were obtained in other studies he and davis 2010 used comsol multiphysics to simulate the surface runoff and underdrain flow of a bioretention cell with a groundwater table 1 m below its bottom although they did not consider the variation of groundwater table depth they found that shallow groundwater affected the performance of bioretention cells possibly due to its influence on the initial soil water content of in situ soils in addition studies initiated by a research group in the university of florida florida u s examined the runoff control performance of vegetative filter strips under different groundwater table depths rainfall intensities and media soil types fox et al 2018 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 muñoz carpena et al 2018 although variations were present their three studies showed that the performance of vegetative filter strips in runoff control was affected when the groundwater table was 1 0 1 2 m fox et al 2018 0 1 5 m lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 and less than 1 2 2 m muñoz carpena et al 2018 below ground respectively they also reported that the hydraulic conductivity of the media soil and the groundwater table depth were the most significant governing factors for the runoff control performance of vegetative filter strips the influence was found to be more significant when the soil was of lower permeability and for higher intensity and longer duration rainfall events muñoz carpena et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 d aniello et al 2019 utilized a self developed groundwater dynamic analysis model gdan to evaluate the impact of initial groundwater table depth on the infiltration and runoff reduction efficiency of an infiltration facility surrounded by different in situ soils they found that the infiltration rate of the facility was affected by the initial groundwater table depth except when there was a less permeable soil layer underneath the heterogeneity of the in situ soil also affected its performance and more significantly when the initial groundwater table was deeper 6 progress in exploring strategies for implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments the various challenges associated with shallow groundwater have led to strategies for allocating and designing gi systems which were identified in the aforementioned engineering practices and academic studies these are divided into those focusing on the optimal allocation of gi systems and on the optimal design of an individual gi which are described in fig 5 table 3 and in the following two sub sections it should be noted that the spatial allocations and designs of gi are always multi objective an optimal strategy can only be identified given a real context which is typically related to the objectives of the project and the environmental conditions therefore we only summarize the general considerations below we also only cover technical factors and not the socio economic or political issues that may be even more influential in some contexts 6 1 optimal allocations of gi systems identifying the appropriate locations to implement gi systems is often the very first task fry and maxwell 2017 zhang and chui 2018b among the factors to be considered e g land uses soil characteristics climatological and hydrological characteristics as well as drainage system types e g either stormwater sanitary or combined system and characteristics the distance between gi and the groundwater table is a key issue particularly when the groundwater table is shallow recommendations about the minimum distance between the bottom of gi and the groundwater table for different contexts have been provided in some studies from the perspective of reducing potential contamination to groundwater hathhorn and yonge 1996 recommended raising the criteria of the minimum distance between the bottom of gi and the groundwater table from 1 m to 3 m or more while zhang and chui 2017 recommended the groundwater table should be at least 1 5 3 m below the bottom of bioretention cells to minimize the height of groundwater mounds formed in addition from the perspective of maintaining sufficient runoff control efficiency muñoz carpena et al 2018 and lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 recommended that the bottom of vegetative filter strips should be at least 1 2 2 m and 1 5 m away from the groundwater table respectively locatelli et al 2015 further concluded that the bottom of infiltration trenches should be at least 1 5 3 m 6 5 8 m and 11 12 m away from the groundwater table for in situ sandy loam silt loam and silty clay loam soils respectively table 2 determining the suitable distance between the bottom of gi and the groundwater table depends on the objectives of the project and environmental conditions e g characteristics of in situ soils the relationships among the groundwater table depth the hydrologic performance of gi and the influence of shallow groundwater on the hydrologic performance of gi can be generalized based on the studies of locatelli et al 2015 and zhang and chui 2018a as shown in fig 6 when the groundwater table was shallower left side of the x axis in fig 6 the influence of groundwater on the hydrologic performance of gi was greater the blue shade and lines corresponding to the right y axis in fig 6 and the hydrologic performance of gi was lower the red shade and lines corresponding to the left y axis in fig 6 the relationships also vary for different in situ soils different line styles in fig 6 thus given a specific hydrologic performance target e g the 85 annual runoff reduction typically required in different gi design guides the minimum distance between the bottom of gi and the groundwater table can be determined based on the general curve and the black dashed line shown in fig 6 the curves shown here are conceptualized and both hydrologic performance and influence of shallow groundwater could be of different patterns depending on the geophysical conditions and climatic characteristics etc thus for the spatial allocation of multiple gi practices the geophysical conditions and climatic characteristics of the area should be considered as a whole and the long term instead of event based hydrologic performance of gi practices should be targeted at other studies have proposed recommendations for the spatial allocation of gi systems table 3 endreny and collins 2009 modeled the event based and long term groundwater mounding in a catchment with multiple bioretention cells they found that distributedly allocated gi systems may be preferred because bioretention cells allocated closer to each other formed overlapping groundwater mounds maimone et al 2011 modeled the groundwater dynamics beneath gi systems and found that the groundwater mounding height dropped sharply from the center of gi to the surrounding areas thus they recommended locating gi at least 3 m apart from the surrounding infrastructures to prevent basement flooding based on the understandings of the impact of groundwater on gi some studies obtained the planning schemes of gi systems for specific areas based on spatial data analysis johnson and sample 2017 identified the optimal planning scheme of gi around the city of virginia beach virginia u s based on a gi siting tool they developed they took the criterion of groundwater table depth into consideration by filtering out locations where the groundwater table was intercepted by gi i e around 1 8 2 1 m in the area martin mikle et al 2015 obtained the prioritized locations of gi systems at the lake thunderbird watershed of oklahoma city u s through a different approach they calculated a topographic index considering the depth to the restrictive layer e g the groundwater table from which they identified the prioritized locations for gi in different areas 6 2 optimal design of an individual gi system once the spatial allocation of gi systems is determined the next task is to design each individual gi the selection of surface and media materials e g paver for a porous pavement and media soil for a bioretention cell is an important design consideration of gi materials of different permeability lead to different surface infiltration and groundwater recharge rates which correspond to different surface runoff control performance and groundwater impact less permeable surface and media materials lead to a lower surface runoff control rate than those more permeable but also reduce the possibility of forming a groundwater mound zhang and chui 2017 thus a trade off should be struck between surface runoff control and groundwater protection through a suitable design of surface infiltration rate zhang and chui 2017 recommended more permeable e g loamy sand and less permeable soils e g clay loam for bioretention cells when surface runoff control and groundwater protection are the main concerns respectively it should be noted that apart from soil type maintenance approach and frequency also affect the infiltration rate of media soil proper maintenance can minimize surface clogging and soil crusting and thus maintain the surface runoff control performance and groundwater recharge rate over time thus maintenance should be considered at the design level of gi in shallow groundwater environment the media depth of gi is also an important design feature which should be determined when considering the balance between surface runoff control and groundwater protection specifically when the groundwater table is very shallow a shallower gi system can be built to reduce the impact of shallow groundwater however this may decrease the efficiency of gi in terms of surface runoff control and pollutant treatment given a thinner media and less hydraulic retention time to compensate for the impact a larger spatial area of gi may be required the design of an underdrain is also important but controversial for gi in shallow groundwater environments with an underdrain the groundwater inside or near the gi can more quickly dissipate when the groundwater table intercepts the gi the infiltration performance of gi can then recover more quickly thus some gi design guides recommend implementing underdrains when the groundwater table is close to gi eisenberg et al 2013 however draining groundwater to underdrains and then stormwater sewers may not be a good solution as it wastes groundwater resources that can be valuable in some locations as reported by herrera 2013 and zhang et al 2018 groundwater drained by an underdrain significantly affected the performance of gi and increased the hydraulic load of the catchment adding an impermeable liner to envelop gi in the lateral and bottom sides is a commonly used and recommended measure to prevent direct contact between gi and the groundwater however with this design the performance of gi in delaying peak runoff and reducing the volume of runoff can be greatly degraded maintaining its full impermeability in the long run is also challenging as it requires high grade construction work and ongoing maintenance 7 areas for future research although numerous studies have been conducted more are required to better understand the hydrologic performance of gi in shallow groundwater environments the impact of gi on groundwater dynamics and quality and the optimal allocation and design of gi to maximize the performance of gi while minimizing the impact on groundwater more advanced research approaches in terms of monitoring and modeling should also be developed and applied given the highly complicated subsurface geophysical conditions and processes some potential research areas are briefly summarized below further research is needed to understand the detailed flow and solute transport patterns inside and beneath gi in shallow groundwater environments this can help to evaluate the proportion of infiltrated water that exfiltrates and recharges the groundwater to quantify the amount of groundwater that seeps back to gi and to address the question of whether groundwater is mainly contaminated by contaminants in surface runoff or those accumulating inside the media soils using environmental tracers e g isotopes and variably saturated porous media models to track 1 the infiltrated water and recharged groundwater and 2 the groundwater that seeps into gi are possible approaches for further investigation bonneau et al 2017 recommended similar approaches further research is needed to remedy the limitations of current numerical models identified in this paper for example swat modflow can be better utilized for large scale gi planning in shallow groundwater if the newly developed functionalities in swat i e the swat lid module can be enabled swmm lid gw can become a good choice if it can be combined with a groundwater model improving other urban stormwater drainage models and optimization tools e g mouse music and sustain elliott and trowsdale 2007 lerer et al 2015 kuller et al 2017 can also be beneficial further research is needed to better understand the performance of gi and its impact on groundwater dynamics at different spatial scales this is essential as processes affecting the performance of gi such as the climatic and groundwater conditions are on larger scales e g watershed or regional and are thus different from other hydrological processes e g runoff and underdrain flow of gi therefore multi scale hydrological models should be developed pioneering work has been conducted in this direction for example joyce et al 2018 developed a multi scale modeling platform to assess the performance of a gi sewer integrated system under climate change and rising sea levels they considered the potential impact of gi on groundwater flow but the impact of groundwater on the performance of gi was not assessed in detail the urbanbeats model recently developed by the research group at monash university may be a more practical choice as it considers groundwater table depth in the multi scale assessment and planning of gi from lot to city scales bach et al 2015 further research is needed to extend the use of data driven artificial intelligence ai models e g artificial neural networks and support vector machines in the hydrologic simulation of gi in shallow groundwater environments first ai models can predict the hydrologic performance of gi and the groundwater dynamics based on historic data such models can be more easily used than physically based models when the study area is too complex to be conceptualized or the site conditions are not sufficiently known for constructing physically based models second ai models can also be used to classify filter and cluster monitoring data shigidi and garcia 2003 which can increase the efficiency and accuracy of model calibration yang and chui 2018 the quality of the monitoring data of gi projects e g quantity and quality of surface runoff is a major limitation of the accuracy of the models kleidorfer et al 2009 and this problem is more prominent when groundwater hydrology must be simulated 8 conclusions there are great challenges to implement infiltration based gi in shallow groundwater environments which can be divided into the impact of gi on groundwater and the impact of shallow groundwater on the hydrologic performance of gi laboratory monitoring in situ monitoring numerical models and remote sensing are the major approaches to evaluate gi in shallow groundwater environments among them numerical modeling is typically more efficient particularly in tracking subsurface flows and performing multi parameter analyses which cannot be easily realized through other approaches among different numerical models variably saturated porous media models are more suitable for the optimal design of an individual gi while surface subsurface hydrological models are more suitable for large scale gi planning although they vary significantly some gi specific surface subsurface models are overall more suitable for gi planning and design due to their capabilities of hydrological calculation and spatial analysis and as they have significantly better capacity in representing the specific design features of gi engineering projects and academic studies have been conducted with a major focus on the challenges of implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments using different approaches they boosted our understanding of the performance and impact of gi and of the strategies for optimally allocating and designing gi in shallow groundwater environments the distance between the bottom of gi and the groundwater table the selection of media soil and the design of underdrain pipe are the main issues that should be considered when implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments finally we proposed potential research areas for future studies more tracer studies and variably saturated modeling could be conducted to better understand the flow and solute transport paths inside and beneath gi current hydrological models could be improved and multi scale hydrological models could be developed and utilized to better evaluate the performance of gi and its impact on groundwater dynamics at different spatial scales in addition more advanced data driven artificial intelligence models could be used to predict the performance and impact of gi and to process the monitoring data for model

6021,urban water problems e g increased runoff inhibited infiltration and groundwater recharge are becoming increasingly serious and green infrastructure gi has been demonstrated to be effective in tackling these problems and restoring the pre development hydrologic cycle however shallow groundwater limits the implementation of infiltration based gi although projects and studies have been conducted knowledge of the hydrologic performance of infiltration based gi and the impact on shallow groundwater environments has not been comprehensively summarized in this review we first identify the challenges of implementing infiltration based gi in shallow groundwater environments and then evaluate and compare the potential approaches to evaluating gi in such environments we also summarize progress in the understanding of the performance and impact of gi in shallow groundwater environments from previous and ongoing engineering projects and academic studies the main topics include the evaluation of the potential reduction in runoff control performance of gi the formation of groundwater mounds and groundwater contamination we also assess the exploration of strategies for optimally allocating and designing gi in shallow groundwater environments the distance between the bottom of the gi and the groundwater table the selection of the media soil and the design of underdrain pipes are the main considerations when implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments the review is concluded with recommendations for future studies which include conducting tracer monitoring and variably saturated modeling to track subsurface flows of gi improving existing hydrological models developing new multi scale models and utilizing more advanced data driven artificial intelligence models to predict the performance and impact of gi and to process the monitoring data for model calibration keywords green infrastructure low impact development best management practices stormwater groundwater recharge 1 introduction rapid urbanization reduces green spaces changes the water cycle and alters the way nature interacts with humans more impervious surfaces lead to increases in surface runoff i e the risk of flooding and non point source pollution loads infiltration and groundwater recharge are also reduced shuster et al 2005 these urban water problems are becoming global issues brown et al 2009 chang et al 2018 that hinder the sustainable development of cities and endanger the health and safety of residents moore et al 2003 in view of these problems innovative approaches to urban water management have been implemented butler and parkinson 1997 brown et al 2009 marlow et al 2013 li et al 2017a green infrastructure gi is one major innovation and has gained a reputation for relieving urban water problems ahiablame et al 2012 chang et al 2018 jefferson et al 2017 li et al 2017b the natural hydrologic cycle is mimicked through enhancing infiltration chui and trinh 2016 reducing surface runoff qin et al 2013 chui et al 2016 recharging groundwater newcomer et al 2014 kidmose et al 2015 bhaskar et al 2018 mooers et al 2018 and increasing the base flow hamel et al 2013 bhaskar et al 2016 fanelli et al 2017 wright et al 2018 the approach also enhances the natural environments of urban areas tzoulas et al 2007 zhang and chui 2019 although the performance of gi may decline over time e g due to clogging and soil crusting and it has a high maintenance requirement askarizadeh et al 2015 its extensive benefits make it a broadly cost effective choice houle et al 2013 numerous objectives and functions have been included in the definition of gi ec 2013 but in this review the focus is on gi for urban stormwater management which has similarities with the terminologies of low impact development lid best management practices bmp sustainable urban drainage system suds and water sensitive urban design wsud young et al 2014 fletcher et al 2015 chang et al 2018 the focus is particularly on gi that enhances infiltration such as bioretention cells or bioswales porous pavements and infiltration trenches due to widespread urbanization and the associated water problems many cities worldwide have directed significant resources at developing and installing gi andoh and iwugo 2002 nickel et al 2014 for example the chinese government plans to spend more than 1 5 trillion usd on promoting and constructing gi in 657 cities nationwide by 2030 jia et al 2017 the city of philadelphia pennsylvania u s has also proposed a long term plan to replace 40 of the impervious infrastructure of the city with gi maimone et al 2011 however implementing infiltration based gi in shallow groundwater areas which include a large proportion of urban areas small and nicholls 2003 presents major challenges that have significantly restricted its widespread adoption usepa 2016 reported that 50 of the gi projects in the st paul area of minnesota u s was affected by shallow groundwater increased infiltration and groundwater recharge through gi can affect the groundwater dynamics göbel et al 2004 bhaskar et al 2018 zhang and chui 2018a and thus groundwater flooding may occur which damages nearby underground infrastructure zheng et al 2018 groundwater is also subject to a higher risk of contamination because the infiltrated water has less chance to be filtered due to the shorter traveling distance and hydraulic retention time hathhorn and yonge 1996 fischer et al 2003 datry et al 2004 voisin et al 2018 the performance of gi may also be affected by shallow groundwater a shallow groundwater table results in more saturated media and in situ soils which forms a smaller hydraulic gradient and impedes the infiltration into and exfiltration out of the gi guo 1998 bouwer 2002 jackisch and weiler 2017 it should be noted that the shallow groundwater mentioned in this paper refers to groundwater table shallower than 2 3 m below the bottom of gi which is a commonly adopted and recognized criterion for shallow groundwater in gi related studies göbel et al 2004 endreny and collins 2009 zhang and chui 2017 approaches for preventing or minimizing these problems have been proposed and implemented the most common approach is to establish standards or guidelines to avoid locating gi in shallow groundwater areas if possible for example the criteria of minimum distance between the bottom of gi and the seasonal high groundwater table is 0 6 m in prince george county u s 1 0 m in london u k auckland new zealand and toronto canada 1 8 m in arlington u s and 3 1 m in san diego u s zhang and chui 2017 however as stated by zhang and chui 2017 following one strict criterion without detailed and site specific assessments is ineffective because the situation changes with variations in climatic and geophysical conditions particularly in places with borderline or highly variable groundwater tables installing impermeable liners on both the lateral sides and the bottom of gi reducing the media depth and elevating the bottom are also possible solutions to isolate gi from shallow groundwater however these approaches may compromise the performance of gi in surface runoff control li et al 2009 guidelines also cover the installation of an underdrain at the bottom of gi to drain groundwater and prevent the long term submergence of gi eisenberg et al 2013 however this can waste groundwater resources which are often valuable and also increases the loading to the downstream drainage systems herrera 2013 zhang et al 2018 which goes against the original objective of implementing gi the growing demand of gi in shallow groundwater areas requires better strategies for implementing gi without affecting or being affected by shallow groundwater the effects of gi on subsurface hydrological conditions and groundwater have been reviewed by nieber et al 2014 bonneau et al 2017 jefferson et al 2017 and li et al 2017b however to the best of our knowledge no comprehensive review has been conducted thus we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the challenges approaches and progress in implementing infiltration based gi in shallow groundwater environments based on previous and ongoing engineering projects and academic studies of gi in shallow groundwater environments we identify the challenges to implementing gi in these environments evaluate and compare the research approaches assess the progress in understanding the performance and impact of gi and in exploring the strategies for optimally allocating and designing gi in shallow groundwater environments we are then able to provide recommendations for future research so the remaining issues can be better addressed the scope of this review is limited to infiltration based gi so practices such as green roofs rain barrels and other gi without a direct connection to groundwater are not covered here 2 methodology we reviewed more than 80 peer reviewed papers and various technical reports related to the implementation of gi in shallow groundwater the papers and reports were located through the databases of the university of hong kong library and google using the keywords green infrastructure low impact development groundwater recharge water table subsurface and their various combinations based on the results a four phase review was conducted the main procedures and content covered are elaborated below fig 1 1 in the first phase the challenges of implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments were identified which include the impact of gi on groundwater and vice versa 2 in the second phase a framework for evaluating gi in shallow groundwater environments was outlined and existing numerical models for evaluating gi in shallow groundwater environments were categorized and compared according to their specific capabilities and suitability to simulate gi in shallow groundwater environments 3 in the third phase previous and ongoing gi projects and academic studies reported in peer reviewed journal papers and technical reports were reviewed the progress made in understanding the performance and impact of gi and in exploring the strategies for its optimal allocation and design in shallow groundwater environments was recapped 4 in the fourth phase potential research areas for future work are proposed which can enhance the understanding of the performance and impact of gi in shallow groundwater environments and lead to better strategies for implementing gi in such environments 3 challenges in implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments under normal conditions without the severe constraint of shallow groundwater gi contributes to the restoration of the natural hydrological cycle the main hydrologic processes involved in the interaction between infiltration based gi and groundwater are shown in fig 2 for example the highly permeable surfaces and media materials in gi reduce surface runoff no 3 process in fig 2 through enhanced infiltration no 2 process in fig 2 and evapotranspiration no 4 process in fig 2 some of the infiltrated water exfiltrates to the surrounding subsurface no 6 process in fig 2 which helps to recharge the groundwater no 8 process in fig 2 bhaskar et al 2018 and increase the stream base flow no 9 process in fig 2 bhaskar et al 2016 thus the natural hydrological cycle is activated stewart et al 2017 however as mentioned the implementation of gi may lead to problems when the groundwater table is shallow these potential problems can either be due to the impact of gi on groundwater or the impact of groundwater on gi and both types are elaborated below gi can affect the quantity and quality of groundwater when the groundwater table is shallow infiltrated water can recharge groundwater more quickly due to a shorter traveling distance the local groundwater mound could then become a concern due to higher infiltration rate associated with gi thompson et al 2010 machusick et al 2011 stewart et al 2017 zhang and chui 2017 groundwater mounding can result in the groundwater table reaching the surface and causing flooding and nearby underground infrastructure may be damaged the risks of groundwater contamination may also increase due to enhanced infiltration and recharge this problem is more obvious in shallow groundwater environments due to the shorter distance between the bottom of the gi and the groundwater table and thus less hydraulic retention time this is particularly severe for right of way gi that may receive highly contaminated surface runoff from roads many studies have reported this as a noteworthy problem in gi implementation appleyard 1993 fischer et al 2003 datry et al 2004 shallow depth of groundwater also affects the water quantity and quality control performance of gi due to the shallow groundwater environment the unsaturated zone is relatively thin and the soil moisture relatively high so the exfiltration rate out of gi can be restricted given a lower hydraulic gradient guo 1998 bouwer 2002 jackisch and weiler 2017 thus the surface runoff control efficiency of gi can be affected thompson et al 2010 he and davis 2010 locatelli et al 2015 2017 d aniello et al 2019 in addition groundwater also affects the micro ecosystem and the biochemical environment inside the gi palanisamy and chui 2013 which can affect its water quality control performance brown et al 2011 4 approaches to evaluating gi in shallow groundwater environments 4 1 evaluation framework evaluating gi in shallow groundwater environments is complicated given the various hydrological and biochemical processes involved thus different approaches are required to quantify and evaluate both surface and subsurface processes fig 3 illustrates the schematic of the framework to evaluate gi in shallow groundwater environments laboratory monitoring in situ monitoring numerical modeling and remote sensing are the most widely used approaches and each has its own advantages and limitations thus before embarking on a gi project or study a pre project evaluation must be conducted to determine the project objectives understand the site conditions and then decide the suitable evaluation approaches fig 3 the considerations involved are summarized below laboratory monitoring can be conducted if 1 the project solely focuses on the evaluation and optimal design of an individual gi and 2 there is sufficient space equipment time and other resources e g labor to build physical models and carry out monitoring activities the results of laboratory monitoring are typically less realistic than in situ monitoring because of the challenge in replicating the practical site conditions this problem is more prominent when groundwater is involved and may be why very limited laboratory research related to gi and groundwater has been conducted however the results of laboratory monitoring are relatively more reliable and more factors can be examined in a controlled environment in situ monitoring can be conducted if permitted and with sufficient equipment time and other resources e g labor this is the best option if the project focuses on a very specific area it is particularly suitable if the site is too complex to be conceptualized or if the site conditions i e geologic or boundary conditions are not sufficiently known for constructing physical or numerical models numerical modeling can be conducted if the basic meteorological and geologic data of the site can be collected besides given the advantages of numerical modeling in efficiency and multi parameter analysis it is particularly a better choice over laboratory experiment and in situ monitoring 1 if the project aims to provide generic non site specific engineering guidance and 2 if the project requires a quick pre evaluation to obtain some general understanding without a full representation of the real situation before implementation remote sensing can be conducted if 1 the project focuses on higher level and larger scale gi planning and 2 if the site s spatial data are available in situ monitoring and numerical modeling have been relatively more widely utilized for evaluating the performance and impact of gi in shallow groundwater environments it should be noted that all of the approaches can supplement each other by providing supporting information for example the monitoring data obtained from laboratory and in situ monitoring is needed to calibrate and validate the numerical models and the remotely sensed data can also facilitate the construction of numerical models jayasooriya and ng 2014 the results of numerical modeling can also support the design of laboratory and in situ monitoring thus in some cases all four types of approaches can be conducted simultaneously generating a more thorough understanding of the performance and impact of gi and providing better engineering guidance for example a gi groundwater recharge project in santa cruz california u s began with a gis spatial analysis to identify the suitable locations for groundwater recharge numerical models were then used to estimate the potential effects of groundwater recharge and thus these combined methods tested the applicability and optimized the implementation plan of the project after the initiation of the project the performance of groundwater recharge over time was tracked using long term monitoring beganskas and fisher 2017 4 2 numerical models as the above section demonstrates different approaches possess different capabilities for evaluating gi in shallow groundwater environments running numerical models is typically more efficient than monitoring as it does not require physical setups and fixed time spans it is particularly efficient in tracking subsurface flows and performing multi parameter analyses which cannot be easily realized through monitoring elliott and trowsdale 2007 and is also more widely used than remote sensing techniques because gi is usually studied at the catchment level where the strengths of remote sensing cannot be fully exhibited scipal et al 2005 thus the specific numerical models that can simulate the performance and impact of gi in shallow groundwater environments are summarized and compared in this section numerical models can be generally divided into those at planning level e g multiple gi practices at catchment scale and design level e g individual gi based on their capabilities and potential applications two types of models differ in capacities of hydrologic calculation representation of spatially varied features and variables and representation of design features of gi the capacities of both types of models in the abovementioned three aspects are summarized in fig 4 apart from these temporal and spatial resolutions are also important features of numerical models and are implicitly included in the above mentioned features a finer temporal resolution supports more accurate hydrologic calculations and spatial resolution is related to the capacity of spatial representation it should be noted that the word of accurate here implies models better capacity to reflect realistic situations moreover the openness of the model structure is another important feature which determines the models flexibility to be modified and coupled to other numerical models optimization algorithms and post processing tools it should be noted that a suitable or selected numerical model may not necessarily possess all the above features the suitability of a specific numerical model depends on the objectives and details of a project furthermore numerical models can be also categorized into three types variably saturated porous media models e g vs2d hydrus comsol and feflow surface subsurface hydrological models e g shetran mike she gsflow velma and swat modflow and gi specific surface subsurface models e g sw mm gifmod swingo vfsmod and swmm lid gw to assess their suitability and as a basis for the development of new models the models are evaluated at both planning and design levels the main advantages disadvantages potential applications and improvements are discussed and compared in fig 4 and the sub sections below note that only the models most commonly used for gi are reviewed here while others are also available 4 2 1 planning level at planning level numerical models are required to have great capacity in calculating spatially varied processes and representing spatially varied features fig 4 thus some spatially distributed or semi distributed hydrological models are possible choices for gi planning they can simulate different surface and subsurface hydrological processes e g runoff generation groundwater recharge and movement evapotranspiration snowmelt and solute transport at watershed scale mike she velma and shetran all belong to this group of models and gsflow and swat modflow which were combined with surface hydrological models prms and swat respectively and modflow also possess similar functionalities however they have not been widely used for gi because as spatially distributed models they require abundant spatial data which may not always be available and more importantly their spatial and temporal resolutions are typically coarse the grid size supported in these models usually exceeds the normal size of gi thus they often cannot accurately represent the design features of gi fig 4 most models only support sub daily or daily simulation so they may not accurately simulate the time sensitive hydrological processes and benefits of gi e g peak reduction of surface runoff in addition most of them also do not support the simulation of urban drainage systems which limits their usages in urban areas some improvements have been made to these models so that they are better suited to the requirements of gi for example a sub hourly rainfall runoff simulation has been enabled in swat and a swat lid module was developed to simulate the water diversion from impervious areas to gi and from gi to pervious areas within each hydrologic response unit of swat jeong et al 2010 seo et al 2017 however this has not yet been enabled in swat modflow which limits its application for gi similar to the swat lid module a new ponded drainage feature has been developed in mike she dhi 2017 this enables the simulation of internal stormwater drainage between surface depressions and catchments which is an important function of gi if other disadvantages such as the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions mentioned above can be improved then mike she can become a very good choice in addition these models can be more suitable if being coupled with hydraulics models for example kidmose et al 2015 coupled mike she with mike urban to evaluate the influence of forced infiltration on groundwater recharge and the feedback from groundwater to urban drainage systems apart from the models mentioned above some other physically based numerical models have also been developed specifically for gi to more accurately and efficiently simulate the characteristics of gi fig 4 they are not distributed spatially models and the simulation of some processes e g solar radiation and evapotranspiration which may not be as important for gi are often simplified however they are better suited for gi at planning level because they enable finer temporal and spatial simulations and they can simulate urban drainage systems besides they are more efficient due to their simpler structures i e fewer components and lower data requirements swmm lid gw developed by zhang et al 2018 is an improved version of swmm as it considers the groundwater table depth in the calculation of the hydrological processes of gi zhang et al 2018 compared swmm lid gw with swmm in simulating gi in a shallow groundwater urban catchment swmm lid gw performed significantly better particularly when the groundwater table was very close to the ground or the bottom of gi i e around 1 0 m below ground however it does not simulate groundwater dynamics and requires groundwater monitoring data which significantly restricts its application comparatively the model developed by massoudieh et al 2017 gifmod shows a greater potential in simulating gi in shallow groundwater environments due to its capacity to simulate groundwater dynamics fig 4 4 2 2 design level different from numerical models at planning level those at design level are not required to have spatial representation capacity however they better be able to represent the design features of gi to enable a more accurate and flexible evaluation of gi performance and optimal design fig 4 variably saturated porous media models e g vs2d hydrus comsol and feflow are a group of design level models they are finite difference or finite element based models that can accurately simulate subsurface flow by solving richards equation they are good choices to design gi for a variety of reasons first they can accurately account for the variation of infiltration exfiltration of gi due to the variation of soil moisture and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with groundwater fluctuation fig 4 second they can accurately simulate the solute transport processes beneath gi and in the subsurface which makes them more suitable for right of way gi practices given greater water quality concerns third they can flexibly represent the design features of gi for example the perforated underdrain of a gi can be simulated by characterizing the holes and assigning the boundary condition of the seepage face to them however these models can be only used at design level due to relatively weak in representing the spatial variabilities of processes and they simplify or even neglect the simulation of surface runoff generation some of the studies reviewed above have adopted this group of models and have made significant contributions to the evaluation of the hydrologic performance of individual gi systems göbel et al 2004 thompson et al 2010 newcomer et al 2014 stewart et al 2017 zhang and chui 2017 the disadvantages of these models fig 4 e g simplification of surface runoff simulation can be addressed by combining them with surface hydrological models to obtain more accurate and comprehensive results some studies have made efforts in this direction such as sansalone et al 2013 who integrated swmm with vs2d using the former for the simulation of rainfall runoff generation and routing and the latter for subsurface flow simulation they quantified the impact of a bioretention cell porous pavement treatment train on the overall water balance and subsurface solute transport stewart et al 2017 conducted numerical modeling using swmm and hydrus 2d 3d synchronously based on an in situ bioretention project in cleveland ohio u s the full hydrological cycle of the bioretention cell was simulated including the surface ponding depth underdrain flow soil moisture and groundwater table depth underneath and nearby zheng et al 2018 integrated swmm with feflow to calculate the surface runoff control performance of gi and evaluated the impact of enhanced infiltration by gi on the groundwater condition models such as hydrus 2d and comsol must also in some cases be combined with rainfall runoff and overland flow models to mitigate their limitations köhne et al 2011 apart from the abovementioned variably saturated porous media models some other gi specific models have also been developed for design level evaluation of gi fig 4 they are better than variably saturated porous media models in simulating rainfall runoff generation for example swmm lid gw gifmod sw mm and swingo vfsmod are all possible choices sw mm and swingo vfsmod was combined with infiltration and groundwater models the infiltration model adjusts the infiltration rate based on the groundwater table depth obtained from the groundwater model while the groundwater model calculates the dynamics of groundwater table in response to the surface infiltration and recharge obtained from the infiltration model roldin et al 2013 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 muñoz carpena et al 2018 roldin et al 2013 compared sw mm with another 2d variably saturated porous media model the results of the two models were comparable but sw mm was on average 600 times faster however sw mm and swingo vfsmod are limited in some aspects because they cannot represent some design features of gi e g underdrain and they do not support solute transport simulation fig 4 relatively swmm lid gw and gifmod are better in these aspects particularly gifmod can simulate the detailed design features of gi flexibly through simplifying gi practices as inter connected water storage blocks massoudieh et al 2017 5 progress in understanding the performance and impact of gi in shallow groundwater environments engineering projects and academic studies have been conducted with a major focus on the challenges of implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments using the approaches summarized above these have improved our understanding of the performance and impact of gi in these environments the projects and studies are summarized separately in this section after being further categorized into those focusing on the impact of gi on groundwater on the impact of groundwater on gi and on both impacts the timeline and findings of the projects and studies are presented in fig 5 and tables 1 and 2 respectively they differ in terms of the types of gi and their major performance indicators as table 1 shows some focused more on surface runoff control while others considered groundwater recharge or multiple benefits two additional issues should be noted 1 there is not always a clear distinction between engineering projects and academic studies here we mainly distinguish them based on their original objectives projects or studies that aimed to solve local problems are classified as engineering projects which were mostly in situ monitoring works and those that aimed to analyze the performance of gi or explored the mechanisms behind it are classified as academic studies which include both monitoring and modeling works 2 the review includes only a limited number of projects that have 1 been well documented 2 monitored both surface runoff or the underdrain flow of gi and groundwater and 3 clearly listed in the project objectives evaluating gi in shallow groundwater or enhancing groundwater recharge the projects reviewed here were mainly implemented in north america the u s and canada after 2005 however projects and studies have also been conducted in other locations 5 1 engineering projects since low impact development was first proposed in the 1990s the number of gi engineering projects has rapidly increased usepa 2000 their major objectives however vary significantly from the peak reduction of large events to the volume reduction of frequent events non point source pollution control combined sewer overflow control etc although these projects may have an impact on groundwater as an intrinsic effect of gi this was less of a concern and thus typically not evaluated gi was seldom implemented in shallow groundwater areas to avoid the associated problems in recent years however gi has been increasingly applied in these areas due to its extensive implementation and the growing problem of limited urban space thus more projects have been initiated to better understand the impact of shallow groundwater on gi and of gi on the hydrologic cycle 5 1 1 impact of gi on groundwater in 2013 and 2014 a small scale porous alley project was initiated in boston massachusetts u s to reduce flooding and recharge groundwater the results of the monitoring confirmed the enhanced infiltration by the porous pavement and the higher groundwater table in all seasons table 1 city of boston 2016 in addition a gi managed aquifer recharge gi mar project was initiated in 2013 in santa cruz county california u s which aimed to enhance groundwater recharge and increase the groundwater availability and freshwater supply in the area myer et al 2015 before implementation a gis spatial analysis was conducted to identify the prioritized locations and numerical modeling was performed to evaluate the runoff response and potential groundwater recharge efficiency the project generated a significant water supply benefit during its six year operation with 5 3 105 m3 of water collected and infiltrated beganskas and fisher 2017 5 1 2 impact of groundwater on gi more studies have focused on the impact of shallow groundwater on gi than on the impact of gi on groundwater the gi project at the edison environmental center initiated in 2009 in new jersey u s was the first we reviewed the project monitored the infiltration rate exfiltration rate and the storage water level of porous pavements to evaluate the impact of shallow groundwater on the surface and subsurface hydrologic processes brown and borst 2014 another gi project was implemented in kitsap county washington u s from 2011 which aimed to evaluate the runoff control performance of bioretention cells and porous pavements in various shallow groundwater conditions the groundwater table depth ranged from 0 7 to 1 3 m during the monitoring period which sometimes may intercept the gi systems the flow in the storm sewers at the site was significantly increased after gi implementation which was found to be caused by groundwater seepage into the underdrains of gi systems herrera 2013 another gi project implemented at the imax headquarters in the city of mississauga ontario canada showed different results the bioretention cells and porous pavements at that site performed reasonably well with only minor groundwater mounds formed a relatively deeper groundwater table i e 2 7 3 5 m below ground than that of kitsap county washington u s possibly caused the differences in the observations cvc 2016 5 1 3 combined impacts some recent projects focus on evaluating both the impact of shallow groundwater on the surface runoff control efficiency of gi and on the effect of gi on groundwater recharge in addition to the whole water balance a group of large scale gi projects was implemented in detroit michigan u s covering an area of 37 5 km2 some aimed at evaluating the performance of gi while others focused more on quantifying the impact of gi on groundwater various monitoring projects were implemented around belton street detroit u s in 2016 to quantify the infiltration runoff and the extent of groundwater mounding table 1 dwsd 2017 in addition monitoring projects have recently been initiated by great lakes restoration initiatives glri which also involved the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the united states geological survey usgs glri 2014 these include but may not be limited to three monitoring projects at gary city hall gary u s recovery park detroit u s and niagara river greenway buffalo u s the surface runoff sewer flow soil moisture and groundwater level before and after gi implementation were all monitored the results and findings of these projects have not yet been made available but may be released soon 5 2 academic studies 5 2 1 impact of gi on groundwater in the 20th and early 21st century monitoring was conducted to evaluate the potential risk of groundwater contamination due to stormwater infiltration samples were taken from groundwater and soils of different depths to examine whether the soils adsorbed a significant amount of pollutants and whether there was a relationship between the change of groundwater chemistry and the infiltrated runoff appleyard 1993 monitored the groundwater quality concentrations of do salinity metals nutrients pesticides etc at 12 locations near an infiltration basin in perth australia they found that the concentration of do rapidly increased in the upper part of the aquifer due to infiltration mikkelsen et al 1997 monitored two sites with infiltration basins in switzerland and obtained the vertical concentration profiles of heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah and adsorbable organic halogens aox they found that the pollutants from infiltrated stormwater were adsorbed by surface soils without increasing the risk of groundwater contamination however different findings were obtained in other studies hathhorn and yonge 1996 performed a series of laboratory experiments to evaluate whether heavy metals from runoff can pollute the groundwater underneath gi they demonstrated the potential of heavy metal contamination to the groundwater datry et al 2004 not only measured the pollutant concentration at different depths but also tracked the dynamics of pollutant plumes underneath an infiltration basin they observed elevated concentrations of phosphate and dissolved organic carbon doc in the groundwater under the infiltration basin which was thought to be caused by mineralization of organic sediments particularly in the summer fischer et al 2003 conducted a large scale study in which the quality of the groundwater near detention and retention basins was compared with that of the background groundwater in new jersey u s they found that the load and occurrence of petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides were greater in groundwater near the basins although the pollutant concentration in the surface runoff was relatively low and that dilution should occur due to the high recharge rate a research group in villanova university pennsylvania u s measured the water quality in the vadose zone near a porous pavement in the campus increased concentrations of copper and chloride were observed but were not high enough to influence the quality of the groundwater kwiatkowski et al 2007 since 2010 more studies have focused on the impact of gi on groundwater quantity and most demonstrated that gi can greatly enhance groundwater recharge newcomer et al 2014 and the formation of groundwater mounds göbel et al 2004 but the observed effects vary machusick et al 2011 monitored the groundwater mounding heights beneath a bioretention cell in the campus of villanova university pennsylvania u s for around 10 months the results demonstrated that the groundwater mound was localized and did not extend far from the bioretention cell similar observations were provided by trinh and chui 2013 singapore chui and trinh 2016 singapore stewart et al 2017 ohio u s and tu and traver 2018 pennsylvania u s through either numerical modeling or monitoring thomas and vogel 2011 and nemirovsky et al 2014 further quantified the dissipation of groundwater mounds spatially and found that the mounding effect can extend to over 22 m away and that the height of the groundwater mound formed by the bioretention cell was inversely proportional to the distance from it comparatively the groundwater mound away from the bioretention cell was lower in height and dissipated slower with a significant time lag bhaskar et al 2018 performed a large scale study and obtained very different results they monitored the groundwater dynamics of a 1 1 km2 suburban catchment with 73 gi systems in clarksburg maryland u s and found that the maximum groundwater recharge and mounding did not show up beneath the gi systems but was located downgradient from them the differences in these results may be due to the differences in soil characteristics e g the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of soil aquifer structure and regional groundwater gradient a recent study in shenzhen china conducted by zheng et al 2018 demonstrated that gi systems i e bioretention cells and porous pavements in their study can significantly enhance groundwater recharge and aquifer storage in wet seasons but can increase aquifer release and groundwater discharge in dry seasons they also found that the groundwater table rise decreased from the recharge zones to the discharge zones the magnitude of which was determined by the location of gi systems within the catchment and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil underneath 5 2 2 impact of groundwater on gi the findings about the influence of shallow groundwater on the infiltration and runoff control performance of gi vary trinh and chui 2013 and chui and trinh 2016 evaluated the effect of different gi systems e g bioretention cells and green roofs on the water balance and groundwater table depth of the catchment using mike she they found that shallow groundwater did not show an obvious influence on surface infiltration a similar observation was made by zhang and chui 2017 who simulated an individual bioretention cell possibly due to the relatively narrow range of groundwater table depth they covered i e around 1 5 m below ground for trinh and chui 2013 and chui and trinh 2016 and 1 3 m below the bottom of the bioretention cell for zhang and chui 2017 however different findings were obtained in other studies he and davis 2010 used comsol multiphysics to simulate the surface runoff and underdrain flow of a bioretention cell with a groundwater table 1 m below its bottom although they did not consider the variation of groundwater table depth they found that shallow groundwater affected the performance of bioretention cells possibly due to its influence on the initial soil water content of in situ soils in addition studies initiated by a research group in the university of florida florida u s examined the runoff control performance of vegetative filter strips under different groundwater table depths rainfall intensities and media soil types fox et al 2018 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 muñoz carpena et al 2018 although variations were present their three studies showed that the performance of vegetative filter strips in runoff control was affected when the groundwater table was 1 0 1 2 m fox et al 2018 0 1 5 m lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 and less than 1 2 2 m muñoz carpena et al 2018 below ground respectively they also reported that the hydraulic conductivity of the media soil and the groundwater table depth were the most significant governing factors for the runoff control performance of vegetative filter strips the influence was found to be more significant when the soil was of lower permeability and for higher intensity and longer duration rainfall events muñoz carpena et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 d aniello et al 2019 utilized a self developed groundwater dynamic analysis model gdan to evaluate the impact of initial groundwater table depth on the infiltration and runoff reduction efficiency of an infiltration facility surrounded by different in situ soils they found that the infiltration rate of the facility was affected by the initial groundwater table depth except when there was a less permeable soil layer underneath the heterogeneity of the in situ soil also affected its performance and more significantly when the initial groundwater table was deeper 6 progress in exploring strategies for implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments the various challenges associated with shallow groundwater have led to strategies for allocating and designing gi systems which were identified in the aforementioned engineering practices and academic studies these are divided into those focusing on the optimal allocation of gi systems and on the optimal design of an individual gi which are described in fig 5 table 3 and in the following two sub sections it should be noted that the spatial allocations and designs of gi are always multi objective an optimal strategy can only be identified given a real context which is typically related to the objectives of the project and the environmental conditions therefore we only summarize the general considerations below we also only cover technical factors and not the socio economic or political issues that may be even more influential in some contexts 6 1 optimal allocations of gi systems identifying the appropriate locations to implement gi systems is often the very first task fry and maxwell 2017 zhang and chui 2018b among the factors to be considered e g land uses soil characteristics climatological and hydrological characteristics as well as drainage system types e g either stormwater sanitary or combined system and characteristics the distance between gi and the groundwater table is a key issue particularly when the groundwater table is shallow recommendations about the minimum distance between the bottom of gi and the groundwater table for different contexts have been provided in some studies from the perspective of reducing potential contamination to groundwater hathhorn and yonge 1996 recommended raising the criteria of the minimum distance between the bottom of gi and the groundwater table from 1 m to 3 m or more while zhang and chui 2017 recommended the groundwater table should be at least 1 5 3 m below the bottom of bioretention cells to minimize the height of groundwater mounds formed in addition from the perspective of maintaining sufficient runoff control efficiency muñoz carpena et al 2018 and lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 recommended that the bottom of vegetative filter strips should be at least 1 2 2 m and 1 5 m away from the groundwater table respectively locatelli et al 2015 further concluded that the bottom of infiltration trenches should be at least 1 5 3 m 6 5 8 m and 11 12 m away from the groundwater table for in situ sandy loam silt loam and silty clay loam soils respectively table 2 determining the suitable distance between the bottom of gi and the groundwater table depends on the objectives of the project and environmental conditions e g characteristics of in situ soils the relationships among the groundwater table depth the hydrologic performance of gi and the influence of shallow groundwater on the hydrologic performance of gi can be generalized based on the studies of locatelli et al 2015 and zhang and chui 2018a as shown in fig 6 when the groundwater table was shallower left side of the x axis in fig 6 the influence of groundwater on the hydrologic performance of gi was greater the blue shade and lines corresponding to the right y axis in fig 6 and the hydrologic performance of gi was lower the red shade and lines corresponding to the left y axis in fig 6 the relationships also vary for different in situ soils different line styles in fig 6 thus given a specific hydrologic performance target e g the 85 annual runoff reduction typically required in different gi design guides the minimum distance between the bottom of gi and the groundwater table can be determined based on the general curve and the black dashed line shown in fig 6 the curves shown here are conceptualized and both hydrologic performance and influence of shallow groundwater could be of different patterns depending on the geophysical conditions and climatic characteristics etc thus for the spatial allocation of multiple gi practices the geophysical conditions and climatic characteristics of the area should be considered as a whole and the long term instead of event based hydrologic performance of gi practices should be targeted at other studies have proposed recommendations for the spatial allocation of gi systems table 3 endreny and collins 2009 modeled the event based and long term groundwater mounding in a catchment with multiple bioretention cells they found that distributedly allocated gi systems may be preferred because bioretention cells allocated closer to each other formed overlapping groundwater mounds maimone et al 2011 modeled the groundwater dynamics beneath gi systems and found that the groundwater mounding height dropped sharply from the center of gi to the surrounding areas thus they recommended locating gi at least 3 m apart from the surrounding infrastructures to prevent basement flooding based on the understandings of the impact of groundwater on gi some studies obtained the planning schemes of gi systems for specific areas based on spatial data analysis johnson and sample 2017 identified the optimal planning scheme of gi around the city of virginia beach virginia u s based on a gi siting tool they developed they took the criterion of groundwater table depth into consideration by filtering out locations where the groundwater table was intercepted by gi i e around 1 8 2 1 m in the area martin mikle et al 2015 obtained the prioritized locations of gi systems at the lake thunderbird watershed of oklahoma city u s through a different approach they calculated a topographic index considering the depth to the restrictive layer e g the groundwater table from which they identified the prioritized locations for gi in different areas 6 2 optimal design of an individual gi system once the spatial allocation of gi systems is determined the next task is to design each individual gi the selection of surface and media materials e g paver for a porous pavement and media soil for a bioretention cell is an important design consideration of gi materials of different permeability lead to different surface infiltration and groundwater recharge rates which correspond to different surface runoff control performance and groundwater impact less permeable surface and media materials lead to a lower surface runoff control rate than those more permeable but also reduce the possibility of forming a groundwater mound zhang and chui 2017 thus a trade off should be struck between surface runoff control and groundwater protection through a suitable design of surface infiltration rate zhang and chui 2017 recommended more permeable e g loamy sand and less permeable soils e g clay loam for bioretention cells when surface runoff control and groundwater protection are the main concerns respectively it should be noted that apart from soil type maintenance approach and frequency also affect the infiltration rate of media soil proper maintenance can minimize surface clogging and soil crusting and thus maintain the surface runoff control performance and groundwater recharge rate over time thus maintenance should be considered at the design level of gi in shallow groundwater environment the media depth of gi is also an important design feature which should be determined when considering the balance between surface runoff control and groundwater protection specifically when the groundwater table is very shallow a shallower gi system can be built to reduce the impact of shallow groundwater however this may decrease the efficiency of gi in terms of surface runoff control and pollutant treatment given a thinner media and less hydraulic retention time to compensate for the impact a larger spatial area of gi may be required the design of an underdrain is also important but controversial for gi in shallow groundwater environments with an underdrain the groundwater inside or near the gi can more quickly dissipate when the groundwater table intercepts the gi the infiltration performance of gi can then recover more quickly thus some gi design guides recommend implementing underdrains when the groundwater table is close to gi eisenberg et al 2013 however draining groundwater to underdrains and then stormwater sewers may not be a good solution as it wastes groundwater resources that can be valuable in some locations as reported by herrera 2013 and zhang et al 2018 groundwater drained by an underdrain significantly affected the performance of gi and increased the hydraulic load of the catchment adding an impermeable liner to envelop gi in the lateral and bottom sides is a commonly used and recommended measure to prevent direct contact between gi and the groundwater however with this design the performance of gi in delaying peak runoff and reducing the volume of runoff can be greatly degraded maintaining its full impermeability in the long run is also challenging as it requires high grade construction work and ongoing maintenance 7 areas for future research although numerous studies have been conducted more are required to better understand the hydrologic performance of gi in shallow groundwater environments the impact of gi on groundwater dynamics and quality and the optimal allocation and design of gi to maximize the performance of gi while minimizing the impact on groundwater more advanced research approaches in terms of monitoring and modeling should also be developed and applied given the highly complicated subsurface geophysical conditions and processes some potential research areas are briefly summarized below further research is needed to understand the detailed flow and solute transport patterns inside and beneath gi in shallow groundwater environments this can help to evaluate the proportion of infiltrated water that exfiltrates and recharges the groundwater to quantify the amount of groundwater that seeps back to gi and to address the question of whether groundwater is mainly contaminated by contaminants in surface runoff or those accumulating inside the media soils using environmental tracers e g isotopes and variably saturated porous media models to track 1 the infiltrated water and recharged groundwater and 2 the groundwater that seeps into gi are possible approaches for further investigation bonneau et al 2017 recommended similar approaches further research is needed to remedy the limitations of current numerical models identified in this paper for example swat modflow can be better utilized for large scale gi planning in shallow groundwater if the newly developed functionalities in swat i e the swat lid module can be enabled swmm lid gw can become a good choice if it can be combined with a groundwater model improving other urban stormwater drainage models and optimization tools e g mouse music and sustain elliott and trowsdale 2007 lerer et al 2015 kuller et al 2017 can also be beneficial further research is needed to better understand the performance of gi and its impact on groundwater dynamics at different spatial scales this is essential as processes affecting the performance of gi such as the climatic and groundwater conditions are on larger scales e g watershed or regional and are thus different from other hydrological processes e g runoff and underdrain flow of gi therefore multi scale hydrological models should be developed pioneering work has been conducted in this direction for example joyce et al 2018 developed a multi scale modeling platform to assess the performance of a gi sewer integrated system under climate change and rising sea levels they considered the potential impact of gi on groundwater flow but the impact of groundwater on the performance of gi was not assessed in detail the urbanbeats model recently developed by the research group at monash university may be a more practical choice as it considers groundwater table depth in the multi scale assessment and planning of gi from lot to city scales bach et al 2015 further research is needed to extend the use of data driven artificial intelligence ai models e g artificial neural networks and support vector machines in the hydrologic simulation of gi in shallow groundwater environments first ai models can predict the hydrologic performance of gi and the groundwater dynamics based on historic data such models can be more easily used than physically based models when the study area is too complex to be conceptualized or the site conditions are not sufficiently known for constructing physically based models second ai models can also be used to classify filter and cluster monitoring data shigidi and garcia 2003 which can increase the efficiency and accuracy of model calibration yang and chui 2018 the quality of the monitoring data of gi projects e g quantity and quality of surface runoff is a major limitation of the accuracy of the models kleidorfer et al 2009 and this problem is more prominent when groundwater hydrology must be simulated 8 conclusions there are great challenges to implement infiltration based gi in shallow groundwater environments which can be divided into the impact of gi on groundwater and the impact of shallow groundwater on the hydrologic performance of gi laboratory monitoring in situ monitoring numerical models and remote sensing are the major approaches to evaluate gi in shallow groundwater environments among them numerical modeling is typically more efficient particularly in tracking subsurface flows and performing multi parameter analyses which cannot be easily realized through other approaches among different numerical models variably saturated porous media models are more suitable for the optimal design of an individual gi while surface subsurface hydrological models are more suitable for large scale gi planning although they vary significantly some gi specific surface subsurface models are overall more suitable for gi planning and design due to their capabilities of hydrological calculation and spatial analysis and as they have significantly better capacity in representing the specific design features of gi engineering projects and academic studies have been conducted with a major focus on the challenges of implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments using different approaches they boosted our understanding of the performance and impact of gi and of the strategies for optimally allocating and designing gi in shallow groundwater environments the distance between the bottom of gi and the groundwater table the selection of media soil and the design of underdrain pipe are the main issues that should be considered when implementing gi in shallow groundwater environments finally we proposed potential research areas for future studies more tracer studies and variably saturated modeling could be conducted to better understand the flow and solute transport paths inside and beneath gi current hydrological models could be improved and multi scale hydrological models could be developed and utilized to better evaluate the performance of gi and its impact on groundwater dynamics at different spatial scales in addition more advanced data driven artificial intelligence models could be used to predict the performance and impact of gi and to process the monitoring data for model

6022,the dynamic of surface water connectivity along floodplains can be complex and is of great significance to such ecological functions as flood protection sediment transportation nutrient retention and the provision of wildlife habitats however connectivity quantification is currently incipient due to the scarcity of high spatial temporal resolution observations and suitable connectivity metrics this study generated a 30 m and 8 day surface water series of the poyang lake national natural reserve plnnr in china by fusing landsat and modis imagery a geostatistical analysis was applied to quantify the surface water connectivity based on wet dry binary state data derived from the fused images the results demonstrate that the geostatistical method based on remote sensing is reliable and objective for quantifying the surface water connectivity in a complex lake floodplain system the highest connectivity function occurred around the flood peak and lasted longest in the typical flood year the seasonal isolated lakes rivers and main lake were interconnected via channelized and overbank flow paths at different stage thresholds under the combined effect of flood pulse and surface water connectivity a seasonal isolated lake expanded more quickly after connection than before during the rising period and shrank more slowly after isolation than before during the receding period this study provides a novel insight into quantifying surface water connectivity which helps policymakers understand floodplain behavior both for this particular event and in general keywords surface water connectivity seasonal isolated lake lake floodplain system remote sensing geostatistical analysis 1 introduction as an aspect of hydrological connectivity surface water connectivity is a concept referring to the movement of surface water flow from one region of the landscape to another bracken and croke 2007 in this study surface water connectivity refers to the dynamic flow interactions between among lakes rivers and their floodplains connectivity is important to floodplain functions including runoff generation pavelsky and smith 2008 sediment movement long and pavelsky 2013 pollutant transport covino 2017 li et al 2019 and flood control cammeraat 2002 but defining and quantifying the surface water connectivity of many systems in particular that of floodplains remains an intractable problem therefore a comprehensive understanding of the complex network that occasionally cover a vast amount of floodplains is critical to assessing their ecological and social effects there are three popular approaches to understanding surface water connectivity in floodplains numerical modeling field surveying and remote sensing passalacqua 2017 physically based numerical models that use long term existing data contribute to potential insights about quantifying the connectivity of surface water and its hydrologic effects given current characterizations available modeling techniques that are capable of being adapted to study hydrological connectivity can be divided into three classifications watershed models such as the hydrological simulation programs fortran hspf bicknell et al 2001 the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2005 and topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 groundwater models such as modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1984 and coupled surface subsurface models such as mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 and parflow ashby and falgout 1996 each model focused on specific aspects of hydrologic process such as surface runoff subsurface groundwater transport and surface water groundwater interactions the coupled surface subsurface flow models have been proved to be the most powerful in the greatest number of cases golden et al 2014 however these models call for a wider array of data and a high level of modeling expertise to produce meaningful results on the other hand the capability of modeling approach relies on topographic estimation lane et al 2004 2009 nonetheless topography is not the only driver for watershed response but merely reflects the significance of structural features mcnamara et al 2011 moreover deltas also continually develop under the influences of channel avulsions which essentially rewire the system by abandoning previous path ways and favoring new ones slingerland and smith 2004 kleinhans et al 2013 as a consequence limited number of modeling based studies have assessed the influences of seasonal isolated lakes on hydrologic processes in a complex lake floodplain system while any numerical and physical model goes through some level of simplification the field surveying approach can possibly capture processes over their whole range of scales shaw and mohrig 2014 deng et al 2018 however most knowledge of hydrological and ecological processes derived from in situ measurements provide only partial information on surface water connectivity due to regular and temporary access park and latrubesse 2017 the spatial temporal extent of field surveys depends on the availability of resources even in systems with reasonable size most researches have focused on a particular part of the system without providing the quantification of their connectivity hiatt and passalacqua 2015 under this background the satellite remote sensing technology provides an effective approach with which to overcome the abovementioned limitations it allows more continuous monitoring of inundation dynamics on which the assessment of surface water connectivity relies mertes and magadzire 2008 park and latrubesse 2017 for example the synthetic aperture radar sar has been utilized to measure floodplain hydrological variables e g hess et al 2003 jung and alsdorf 2010 passalacqua et al 2015 unfortunately in order to preserve interferometric phase coherence through double bounce of the radar signal the sar methodology is constrained by the demand of inundated woody vegetation alsdorf et al 2007 pavelsky and smith 2008 optical sensors with moderate resolution just like the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis provide an attractive alternative for studying lake water variations feng et al 2012 wang et al 2014 lu et al 2017 and inundation dynamics in floodplains lacking flooded forest islam et al 2010 heimhuber et al 2018 due to their broad spatial coverage and near daily availability nonetheless the spatial resolution 250 500 m of modis is incapable of accurately extracting fragmented water bodies chen et al 2013 characteristically landsat sensors with a 30 m resolution provide a means to accurately capture fine scaled water bodies pekel et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 jones et al 2017 klein et al 2017 however the revisit intervals 16 day of landsat is generally not qualified to detect dynamic hydrological processes due to frequent cloud contamination especially during flood periods frazier and page 2009 jung et al 2011 zhao and gao 2018 yao et al 2019 despite recent developments a trade off exists between spatial and temporal resolution for most current surface water records no matter which approach is employed to capture the change in land surface information surface water connectivity must be supported by a quantitative index that can be measured and estimated in the field to be as useful as possible bracken and croke 2007 the common existing indices can be divided into three types the first approach is to derive path ways through topography at a large scale lane et al 2009 lesschen et al 2009 the second approach is to acquire knowledge derived from water transfer and infiltration at a smaller scale gomi et al 2008 antoine et al 2009 the third approach is to combine those two abovementioned ones jencso et al 2009 surface water connectivity indices are critical for reflecting storage discharge capacity flow paths and water transfer patterns but researchers to date have suffered from a location and or scale specific bias indeed the comprehensive understanding of floodplain functions is constrained by a lack of universal quantifying index of surface water connectivity gallardo et al 2009 on low relief floodplains small water level increases cause significant changes in inundated areas the high correlation between inundation areas and water level fluctuations indicates a highly dynamic hydrologic connectivity among river main stem seasonal isolated lake and their surrounding floodplains zhang and werner 2015 as china s largest freshwater lake poyang lake typically forms a wide and complex lake floodplain system which provides an ideal setting for exploring this issue the permanently inundated regions e g main channels and deep rivers periodically flooded regions e g seasonal isolated lakes swamps and riparian banks consist the morphological floodplain features of poyang lake passalacqua 2017 called these objects connectomes how these connectomes interact under the influence of flood pulses is important for wetland vegetation and water quality in particular the water quality of seasonal isolated lakes responds to surface water connectivity variations in a more sensitive manner due to their significant lower water storage yu et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge no research has been conducted that attempts to specifically quantify the surface water connectivity as an objectively measurable characteristic in this complex system motivated by this fact a surface water series of the poyang lake national natural reserve plnnr with a 30 m resolution and an 8 day interval was constructed from 2000 to 2016 by fusing modis and landsat images on this basis a geostatistical connectivity function designed by trigg et al 2013 was used to quantify the probability that any two separate points at a specified distance were connected this study aims to 1 confirm the preferred surface flow paths of main connectomes during drought normal and flood years 2 quantify the time and duration of connection between among the main lakes rivers and seasonal isolated lakes 3 reveal the impact of surface water connectivity on the rising and receding rate of typical seasonal isolated lakes this study is expected to meet the substantial needs for quantifying the surface water connectivity in a highly dynamic lake floodplain system while also calling for more concern about wetland regulations regarding the protection of small seasonal wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake n28 24 29 46 e115 49 116 46 located in the middle reach of the yangtze river is recharged by five upstream tributaries namely the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe fig 1 a the lake empties into yangtze river via an outlet at its northern extremity influenced by catchment inflow and interactions with yangtze river the lake level varies by nearly 10 m an extensive floodplain approximately 3 000 km2 was created by the considerable seasonal variations in the lake level feng et al 2013 the plnnr covering more than 200 km2 is located on the northwestern side of poyang lake it consists of the most important part of the poyang lake floodplain and provides critical habitat to a variety of winterbirds most notably some threatened species zhang et al 2012 there are 12 seasonal isolated lakes in and nearby the plnnr fig 1b these seasonal lakes usually hold water for only 3 5 months per year as a result of continuous recharge of the main lake and inflow of five upstream rivers the lower water channels gradually connect to unvegetated bars in late spring and early summer may and june a great amount of bankfull discharge slows down the rate of stage rise in most channels and promotes more rapid floodplain filling by overbank spilling from july after which most seasonal isolated lakes connect to each other via inundated floodplain floodplain filling continues while seasonal isolated lakes still deepen rather than extend prior to early september during late september the main lake and rivers stages begin to fall this is followed by the recession of yangtze river which allows for overbank returns once below the bankfull stage the efficiency of transfer process and ebb channels to empty floodplain become the main factors control the rate of recession the total return of floodwaters to river channels signifies the end of a flood event throughout the winter from december to february disconnected lakes are left at their topographic low points to dry through infiltration and evaporation the complex network comprising the main lake rivers and seasonal isolated lakes over floodplains experiences spatial temporal heterogeneous patterns of inundations through channelized flow and overbank diffusion processes thus the plnnr provides a unique site for studying surface water connectivity tan et al 2019 2 2 remote sensing data the 250 m resolution 8 day composite normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data spanned from february 2000 to december 2016 were acquired from the nasa goddard space flight center url https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov a constrained view angle maximum value composite cv mvc has been applied to remove the spuriously low value caused by atmospheric effects and cloud contamination michishita et al 2014 in addition in order to reconstruct a high quality ndvi time series the residual noise of the ndvi data was eliminated by applying the running median mean value maximum operation end point processing and hanning rmmeh smoothing method jin and xu 2013 meanwhile contemporaneous observations of available landsat tm etm oli images with a spatial resolution of 30 m were acquired from the united states geological survey usgs url https glovis usgs gov after inspection cloud removal and destriping 129 scenes of reasonable landsat images were ultimately retrieved at first all landsat images with digital number nd value were converted to top of atmosphere toa radiance then the surface reflectance data was generated with the fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes flaash atmospheric correction algorithm cooley et al 2002 and the ndvi value of landsat were calculated based on the reflectance data finally the processed modis ndvi was integrated with landsat ndvi to generate a new ndvi dataset with high temporal and fine spatial resolutions 2 3 modis and landsat data fusion in order to better monitoring surface water features at the study site this study applied a hierarchical spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model hstafm to fuse modis and landsat images chen et al 2017 in comparison the traditional image fusion methods such as starfm gao et al 2006 staarrch hilker et al 2009 estarfm zhu et al 2010 and fsdaf zhu et al 2016 often enforce an assumption that the predicted image shares the same pixels this assumption is invalid for ecosystems undergoing dynamic changes chen et al 2015 the remarkable improvement of hstafm is the introduction of a hierarchical strategy for selecting similar pixels in the initial prediction the accuracy assessment demonstrates that the hstafm can evidently detect the land surface changes between prior posterior and predicted dates chen et al 2018 compared with the starfm and fsdaf fusion the predicted ndvi from hstafm achieved a better consistency of landscape ndvi to the actual landsat we recommend two previous papers by chen et al 2017 2018 for more details about the hstafm algorithm in order to better capture the general change within the limited available image pair and targeted modis image a modification of the hstafm was conducted in this study that is selecting a contemporary landsat image with the most similar land surface information e g hydrological phase vegetation phenology to pair up with the modis image in each predicting procedure the vegetation dynamics and water level fluctuations served as references i e the landsat image having the most similar water level and phenological features to the prior image was selected and those two images made a pair if the contemporary landsat image observed in the same year was invalid usually contaminated by clouds another landsat image in the most recent year was selected as an alternative in view of the high vegetation coverage on poyang lake s floodplain the former fused ndvis were classified into water wet cells and non water dry cells using the jenks natural breaks method jenks 1977 the area and spatial distribution of surface water derived from fused ndvis well agree with those derived from landsat ndwis r2 0 92 more detailed information of accuracy assessment can be found in our previous studies tan et al 2019 2 4 geostatistical connectivity function the geostatistical connectivity function developed by trigg et al 2013 was applied in this study to evaluate the magnitude extent and duration of a connection this function quantifies the probability that any two separate points pixel with a specific distance are connected based on the wet dry binary state data derived from fused ndvis it enables mapping of the frequency of the connection between points to a specific location on the other hand this function can quantify subtle changes in connectedness and spatial organization and hence interpret transitions and thresholds in flow processes by characterizing the spatial and temporal patterns of data fields pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2003 the probability p expressed in the connectivity function can be calculated by the flowing algorithm p n z c p r j 1 n i u j z c 1 where an is the product operator if the variable z u j at location u j exceeds the threshold value z c it was calculated by i u j z c 1 if z u j z c zero if not it was operated when u 1 takes all possible positions within the study site the probability p n z c decrease to zero faster with greater spatial entropy of the field at any given distance the value of the connectivity function refers to a fraction of points with specific distance along the given direction as we know along the flow direction of the main river the number of tributaries decrease from upstream to downstream and the main river becomes deeper and narrower leading to a gradually weakening of surface water connectivity comparing results of annual averaged connectivity function indicated that w e flow connectivity extends over a longer distance than ne sw connectivity and is most likely to reflect the orientation of the main river fig 2 thus the connectivity function in the w e direction was analyzed using a matlab program assuming 8 way connectivity 8d additionally the program created an image on which each connected component was distinguished by an integer number that ranges from one to the number of connected components 3 results and discussions 3 1 connectivity function in the w e direction based on wet dry binary state raster derived from fused ndvis the application of the geostatistical connectivity analysis creates a series of connectivity function curves that depict the continually changing surface water connectivity throughout a flood event for comparison the connectivity function curves for a typical drought year from 1 january 2006 to 1 january 2007 a normal year from 17 january 2009 to 9 january 2010 and a typical flood year from 9 january 2010 to 18 february 2011 were illustrated in fig 3 these hydrological years and their beginning ending times were decided according to the published literatures dai et al 2008 li et al 2017 and the conversion time between the rising and receding periods accordingly the highest surface water connectivity occurred around the flood peak in every hydrological year the minimum connectivity function around the flood peak was 0 50 during the typical drought year 0 65 during the normal year and 0 89 during the typical flood year in addition the sharp drop of the connectivity function curve for the low water period indicated a poorly connected water body within the studied floodplain the maximum distance of connection for dry periods was about 10 15 km during the typical drought and normal year and about 15 20 km during the typical flood year more high connectivity function curves for the rising and receding periods can be found in fig 3c which indicates a long lasting period approximately 176 days of high water levels during the typical flood year in contrast to the typical drought or normal year the surface water connectivity appeared to be separated by some important thresholds in every flood event these thresholds were evident from the clustering of the connectivity function curves for periods of time the clustering around the event peak was particularly noticeable our earlier study confirmed that most isolated lakes merged into one single water body when the water level at xingzi station reached 14 m tan and jiang 2016 consequently we determined that the connectivity characteristics will not change much in two cases one is the filling of lower lying depressions and deep channels during the rising period the other is the reducing of the flood depth as the seasonal isolated lakes gradually drain during the receding period when the flood spatial extent remain static surface water connectivity transitions when the water level rise beyond or decline below 14 m at xingzi station due to such casual mechanisms as the flood overtops riparian banks and natural levees or returns back to the topographic lows 3 2 spatial temporal distribution of connectomes and connectivity processes the function of hydrological connectivity refers to how connectomes interact with flood pulses to generate runoff linked flow and therefore transfer water in floodplains in order to obtain further evidence of flow paths and water transfer patterns an 8 day spatial distribution of connectomes during the typical drought year the normal year and the typical flood year are illustrated in figs 4 5 and 6 respectively during the typical drought year fig 4 the lower located dachahu first reconnected to the other connectome through diffusive overbank flow on february 10 doy 41 when the water level of the main lake reached 9 05 m refer to the 16 day averaged water level at xingzi station which is hereinafter inclusive in contrast to dachahu meixihu connected to the main lake body through a floodplain channel on may 25 doy 145 at a water level of 14 58 m the connection between banghu and the confluence of ganjiang and xiushui hereinafter river confluence caused the fill rate of the upper located lakes such as zhoubianhu and shahu to increase the flood peak of the typical drought year occurred on june 18 doy 169 at a water level of 15 81 m all isolated lakes were inundated by floodwater except changhu which is located on a higher portion of the floodplain contrary to the connection sequence during the rising period zhushihu first disconnected from xiushui at the initial stage of floodwater reduction about half a month later on july 12 doy 193 dahuchi and xianghu became isolated with the abrupt recession of flow on the floodplain it is noteworthy that meixihu discharged through another path during the receding period different from the recharge path following the isolation of dachahu all seasonal isolated lakes ended surface connection on december 17 doy 321 when the water level dropped below 9 15 m during the normal year fig 5 the gradual rise of the water level appeared on february 10 doy 41 at a water level of 7 61 m in contrast to the connectivity pattern in the typical drought year the upper located zhonghuchi connected to another connectome at almost the same time as dachahu notably zhonghuchi connected to xiushui but disconnected from the main lake until june 26 doy 177 changhu remained isolated throughout the normal year as well as during the typical drought year however other connectomes such as zhonghuchi and zhushihu experienced a longer period of surface water connection during the normal year there was no obvious change in the surface water coverage of shahu after it disconnected from banghu due to the blocking effect of high soil ridges but banghu almost disappeared from the map from october 8 doy 281 to november 9 doy 313 as a result of the emptying effect of the river confluence the expansion of banghu after november 17 doy 321 might contribute to the recharge of the local precipitation and or underground water during the typical flood year fig 6 dachahu connected to a part of the main lake which is depicted in the first scene of the flood event the narrow gap which separated dachahu and the main lake body might be generated from an interpretation error banghu began to expand before it connected to the rivers or the main lake and recharged shahu with overbank diffusion on april 23 doy 113 meixihu was filled with the floodwater of the main lake and the river confluence at almost the same time via two floodplain channels coming from different directions from may 1 doy 121 to october 16 doy 289 periods of high water levels within the typical flood year lasted more than 160 days periods of high water levels started much earlier and ended later during the typical flood year than during the typical drought or normal year another noticeable difference is that changhu appeared to be inundated by floodwater around the event peak with water levels ranging from 15 87 m to 20 02 m although banghu disconnected from the river confluence and the main lake on october 24 doy 297 its surface area continued to shrink afterward this decrease in size may have built upon the influences of evaporation and infiltration however the connection between xianghu and dongjiahu existed during the receding period and their surface water range did not change significantly this difference might well be a result of the spatial variation in water permeability on the lake bottom or human disturbance whether or when a seasonal isolated lake may have flow paths that connect it to a nearby landscape or water body mainly depends on its spatial distribution and flood levels the transfer patterns and flow paths between seasonal isolated lakes differ by geomorphic features in general filling processes happen from lower lying lakes to upper lying ones during the expansion stage and vice versa in addition the timing and duration of surface water connectivity varies among lakes and different hydrological years 3 3 duration and frequency of hydrological connection the duration of the surface water connection among the 12 main seasonal isolated lakes rivers ganjiang xiushui and their confluence and the main lake are exhibited in fig 7 the longest duration of connection was always found between dachahu and the main lake during the typical drought year 288 days the normal year 288 days and the typical flood year 344 days there was no surface water connection between changhu and other connectomes throughout the typical drought year or normal year changhu also was the seasonal isolated lake with the shortest inundation duration 120 days in the typical flood year in the typical drought and normal year the duration of the connection between the main lake and seasonal isolated lakes located in lower floodplain e g dachahu and meixihu were much longer than those between the main lake and upper lying lakes e g dahuchi and zhushihu due to the different inundation times in comparison in the typical flood year there were minor differences in duration of the connection between the main lake and other seasonal isolated lakes except for dachahu and changhu in response to the rapid rising and receding process the flow path is very important for the transport of sediments and pollutants in floodplains in order to identify the potential flow paths among important water bodies the frequency of the connection between the four largest seasonal isolated lakes banghu dachahu dahuchi and shahu within the study site and other pixels is presented in fig 8 banghu most likely connects with rivers through an outlet channel in the northeast portion of the lake a narrow deep channel in the northwest area of banghu promotes the surface water connectivity between it and zhoubianhu moreover the hydrological and or chemical processes of banghu and changhuchi might be linked with the rising river levels different from expected the connection between banghu and shahu is not much more frequent than that between banghu and other lower lying lakes such as dachahu meixihu and zhushihu the connection between dachahu and the main lake is noticeably the most frequent fig 8b even during low water level periods dachahu could connect to the deep channel of the main lake through a part of overbank diffusion dachahu usually connects to rivers via two paths the first is downstream water body of the main lake the second is meixihu that means water sediments and pollutants in changhuchi and rivers may flow into meixihu and dachahu via the narrow channels between them the other two seasonal isolated lakes dahuchi fig 8c and shahu fig 8d are both located in a higher portion of the floodplain overbank flow in the north and southeast of dahuchi may occur at different times depending on whether xiushui or ganjiang is filled first overbank flow may occur simultaneously in two directions as floodwater rapidly fills the lower lying seasonal isolated lakes in addition shahu seldom connects to changhu dahuchi or xianghu due to the barrier effect of the river banks shahu may be connected to changhuchi zhonghuchi and zhushihu once the floodwaters of the rivers overtop the high soil ridges between shahu and banghu however the surface water of upper lying lakes can hardly recharge shahu during the receding and low water level periods because of geographical locations and receding directions the erosional and depositional effects of overbank and channelized flows dominate the floodplain sedimentary environments in response geomorphic processes determine the flow paths and patterns among connectomes if two water bodies are connected the wide deep and numerous overbank flows can promote the expansion process during the rising period otherwise the narrow shallow and single channelized flow will restrict the shrinkage process during the receding period 3 4 variations in surface water area related to surface water connectivity temporal variations in surface water area of four seasonal isolated lakes with long lasting connections during the typical years are illustrated in figs 9 10 and 11 that the expansion rates of almost all seasonal isolated lakes were higher after the surface water connection than before during rising periods is a remarkable discovery meanwhile almost all lakes shrank slower after isolation than before during the receding periods as an example the expansion rate of the connected dachahu 1 45 km2 8 days was much higher than the expansion rate of the isolated dachahu 0 04 km2 8 days during the rising period of a typical drought year fig 9a moreover banghu shrank much slower after isolation 0 16 km2 8 days than before 10 28 km2 8 days during the receding period during the normal year the draining effect of surface water connectivity was much stronger than the filling effect in particular the shrinkage rate of banghu during the receding period reached 21 64 km2 8 days fig 10c in comparison the surface water areas of dachahu and banghu experienced a short period increase after being disconnected from other water bodies in addition a rapid expansion of dachahu dongjiahu banghu and shahu occurred when they first connected to the surrounding water bodies during the rising period of the typical flood year fig 11 however the expansion rates of the connected lakes during the whole rising period were not much higher due to the prolonged flood peak likewise the surface water areas of connected lakes were stable during the initial period of recession and decreased dramatically afterwards besides the primary factor of a considerable water level fluctuation in the studied floodplain the connectivity characteristics are affected by the geomorphic features climate condition local recharge intricate paths and human intervention park and latrubesse 2017 seasonal isolated lakes experience gradual expansion during the initial rising period as a result of precipitation and groundwater recharge the continuous rising of groundwater and river stage accelerates the process of channel filling some large and deep lakes expand at a lower rate even though they are connected to another water body via a narrow channel a rapid increase in surface water area occurs when floodwaters overtop channel banks once the whole bank is flooded further increments will result in greater depths and higher flow velocities during high water level periods especially in flood years the initial fall of floodwaters causes changes in water depth but not surface area some large and low gradient lakes undergo a quick decline in response to the rapid and thick overbank flow shrinkage rates slow down when surface water connectivity is dominated by channelized flow at the end of a flood event the changes in stagnant water left in isolated lakes are controlled by meteorological conditions groundwater fluctuations and human manipulations 4 conclusions a number of small seasonal isolated lakes appear in the floodplains of plnnr with short hydroperiod and shallow depth these lakes harbor a great many wintering birds for which there are selective pressures to breed in more ephemeral sites furthermore due to the stagnant nature of seasonal isolated lakes they provide more time for microbes to convert excess nutrients thus prevent algal blooms in the lower reaches this study yielded new insight into the quantification of surface water connectivity which will help policymakers determine how water bodies may be connected and understand the implications of those connections for wildlife protection and water purification this study demonstrated that the fused ndvis integrated from modis and landsat are valuable datasets for assessing the surface water dynamics of spatially and temporally large scale events a remarkable advance of the dataset is maintaining the spatial continuity of the narrow channels which is an important aspect of evaluating the surface water connectivity on the other hand the 8 day interval enables us to explore these dynamics in detail revealing new insights into the flood inundation processes the geostatistical method applied in this study was shown to be reliable and objective the connectivity function derived from this method changed continually throughout the flood event surface water connectivity is mainly determined by specific water level the threshold of which varies among different lakes and different hydrological years lower lying lakes tend to be connected earlier and disconnected later than upper lying lakes for most connectomes the duration of hydrological connections between among them during the typical flood year is much longer than it is during the typical drought year or normal year due to the long lasting periods of high water levels the patterns of surface water connectivity can promote or restrict the filling processes of seasonal isolated lakes during the rising period as well as the draining processes during the receding period under the combined effects of flood pulse and surface water connectivity the expansion rate of a seasonal isolated lake is larger after connection lakes shrink slower after isolation these results demonstrate a novel insight into inundation dynamics in complex floodplains and present the prospect that geostatistical analysis that is based on fused remote sensing images may provide a reliable method for quantifying surface water connectivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

6022,the dynamic of surface water connectivity along floodplains can be complex and is of great significance to such ecological functions as flood protection sediment transportation nutrient retention and the provision of wildlife habitats however connectivity quantification is currently incipient due to the scarcity of high spatial temporal resolution observations and suitable connectivity metrics this study generated a 30 m and 8 day surface water series of the poyang lake national natural reserve plnnr in china by fusing landsat and modis imagery a geostatistical analysis was applied to quantify the surface water connectivity based on wet dry binary state data derived from the fused images the results demonstrate that the geostatistical method based on remote sensing is reliable and objective for quantifying the surface water connectivity in a complex lake floodplain system the highest connectivity function occurred around the flood peak and lasted longest in the typical flood year the seasonal isolated lakes rivers and main lake were interconnected via channelized and overbank flow paths at different stage thresholds under the combined effect of flood pulse and surface water connectivity a seasonal isolated lake expanded more quickly after connection than before during the rising period and shrank more slowly after isolation than before during the receding period this study provides a novel insight into quantifying surface water connectivity which helps policymakers understand floodplain behavior both for this particular event and in general keywords surface water connectivity seasonal isolated lake lake floodplain system remote sensing geostatistical analysis 1 introduction as an aspect of hydrological connectivity surface water connectivity is a concept referring to the movement of surface water flow from one region of the landscape to another bracken and croke 2007 in this study surface water connectivity refers to the dynamic flow interactions between among lakes rivers and their floodplains connectivity is important to floodplain functions including runoff generation pavelsky and smith 2008 sediment movement long and pavelsky 2013 pollutant transport covino 2017 li et al 2019 and flood control cammeraat 2002 but defining and quantifying the surface water connectivity of many systems in particular that of floodplains remains an intractable problem therefore a comprehensive understanding of the complex network that occasionally cover a vast amount of floodplains is critical to assessing their ecological and social effects there are three popular approaches to understanding surface water connectivity in floodplains numerical modeling field surveying and remote sensing passalacqua 2017 physically based numerical models that use long term existing data contribute to potential insights about quantifying the connectivity of surface water and its hydrologic effects given current characterizations available modeling techniques that are capable of being adapted to study hydrological connectivity can be divided into three classifications watershed models such as the hydrological simulation programs fortran hspf bicknell et al 2001 the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2005 and topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 groundwater models such as modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1984 and coupled surface subsurface models such as mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 and parflow ashby and falgout 1996 each model focused on specific aspects of hydrologic process such as surface runoff subsurface groundwater transport and surface water groundwater interactions the coupled surface subsurface flow models have been proved to be the most powerful in the greatest number of cases golden et al 2014 however these models call for a wider array of data and a high level of modeling expertise to produce meaningful results on the other hand the capability of modeling approach relies on topographic estimation lane et al 2004 2009 nonetheless topography is not the only driver for watershed response but merely reflects the significance of structural features mcnamara et al 2011 moreover deltas also continually develop under the influences of channel avulsions which essentially rewire the system by abandoning previous path ways and favoring new ones slingerland and smith 2004 kleinhans et al 2013 as a consequence limited number of modeling based studies have assessed the influences of seasonal isolated lakes on hydrologic processes in a complex lake floodplain system while any numerical and physical model goes through some level of simplification the field surveying approach can possibly capture processes over their whole range of scales shaw and mohrig 2014 deng et al 2018 however most knowledge of hydrological and ecological processes derived from in situ measurements provide only partial information on surface water connectivity due to regular and temporary access park and latrubesse 2017 the spatial temporal extent of field surveys depends on the availability of resources even in systems with reasonable size most researches have focused on a particular part of the system without providing the quantification of their connectivity hiatt and passalacqua 2015 under this background the satellite remote sensing technology provides an effective approach with which to overcome the abovementioned limitations it allows more continuous monitoring of inundation dynamics on which the assessment of surface water connectivity relies mertes and magadzire 2008 park and latrubesse 2017 for example the synthetic aperture radar sar has been utilized to measure floodplain hydrological variables e g hess et al 2003 jung and alsdorf 2010 passalacqua et al 2015 unfortunately in order to preserve interferometric phase coherence through double bounce of the radar signal the sar methodology is constrained by the demand of inundated woody vegetation alsdorf et al 2007 pavelsky and smith 2008 optical sensors with moderate resolution just like the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis provide an attractive alternative for studying lake water variations feng et al 2012 wang et al 2014 lu et al 2017 and inundation dynamics in floodplains lacking flooded forest islam et al 2010 heimhuber et al 2018 due to their broad spatial coverage and near daily availability nonetheless the spatial resolution 250 500 m of modis is incapable of accurately extracting fragmented water bodies chen et al 2013 characteristically landsat sensors with a 30 m resolution provide a means to accurately capture fine scaled water bodies pekel et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 jones et al 2017 klein et al 2017 however the revisit intervals 16 day of landsat is generally not qualified to detect dynamic hydrological processes due to frequent cloud contamination especially during flood periods frazier and page 2009 jung et al 2011 zhao and gao 2018 yao et al 2019 despite recent developments a trade off exists between spatial and temporal resolution for most current surface water records no matter which approach is employed to capture the change in land surface information surface water connectivity must be supported by a quantitative index that can be measured and estimated in the field to be as useful as possible bracken and croke 2007 the common existing indices can be divided into three types the first approach is to derive path ways through topography at a large scale lane et al 2009 lesschen et al 2009 the second approach is to acquire knowledge derived from water transfer and infiltration at a smaller scale gomi et al 2008 antoine et al 2009 the third approach is to combine those two abovementioned ones jencso et al 2009 surface water connectivity indices are critical for reflecting storage discharge capacity flow paths and water transfer patterns but researchers to date have suffered from a location and or scale specific bias indeed the comprehensive understanding of floodplain functions is constrained by a lack of universal quantifying index of surface water connectivity gallardo et al 2009 on low relief floodplains small water level increases cause significant changes in inundated areas the high correlation between inundation areas and water level fluctuations indicates a highly dynamic hydrologic connectivity among river main stem seasonal isolated lake and their surrounding floodplains zhang and werner 2015 as china s largest freshwater lake poyang lake typically forms a wide and complex lake floodplain system which provides an ideal setting for exploring this issue the permanently inundated regions e g main channels and deep rivers periodically flooded regions e g seasonal isolated lakes swamps and riparian banks consist the morphological floodplain features of poyang lake passalacqua 2017 called these objects connectomes how these connectomes interact under the influence of flood pulses is important for wetland vegetation and water quality in particular the water quality of seasonal isolated lakes responds to surface water connectivity variations in a more sensitive manner due to their significant lower water storage yu et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge no research has been conducted that attempts to specifically quantify the surface water connectivity as an objectively measurable characteristic in this complex system motivated by this fact a surface water series of the poyang lake national natural reserve plnnr with a 30 m resolution and an 8 day interval was constructed from 2000 to 2016 by fusing modis and landsat images on this basis a geostatistical connectivity function designed by trigg et al 2013 was used to quantify the probability that any two separate points at a specified distance were connected this study aims to 1 confirm the preferred surface flow paths of main connectomes during drought normal and flood years 2 quantify the time and duration of connection between among the main lakes rivers and seasonal isolated lakes 3 reveal the impact of surface water connectivity on the rising and receding rate of typical seasonal isolated lakes this study is expected to meet the substantial needs for quantifying the surface water connectivity in a highly dynamic lake floodplain system while also calling for more concern about wetland regulations regarding the protection of small seasonal wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake n28 24 29 46 e115 49 116 46 located in the middle reach of the yangtze river is recharged by five upstream tributaries namely the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe fig 1 a the lake empties into yangtze river via an outlet at its northern extremity influenced by catchment inflow and interactions with yangtze river the lake level varies by nearly 10 m an extensive floodplain approximately 3 000 km2 was created by the considerable seasonal variations in the lake level feng et al 2013 the plnnr covering more than 200 km2 is located on the northwestern side of poyang lake it consists of the most important part of the poyang lake floodplain and provides critical habitat to a variety of winterbirds most notably some threatened species zhang et al 2012 there are 12 seasonal isolated lakes in and nearby the plnnr fig 1b these seasonal lakes usually hold water for only 3 5 months per year as a result of continuous recharge of the main lake and inflow of five upstream rivers the lower water channels gradually connect to unvegetated bars in late spring and early summer may and june a great amount of bankfull discharge slows down the rate of stage rise in most channels and promotes more rapid floodplain filling by overbank spilling from july after which most seasonal isolated lakes connect to each other via inundated floodplain floodplain filling continues while seasonal isolated lakes still deepen rather than extend prior to early september during late september the main lake and rivers stages begin to fall this is followed by the recession of yangtze river which allows for overbank returns once below the bankfull stage the efficiency of transfer process and ebb channels to empty floodplain become the main factors control the rate of recession the total return of floodwaters to river channels signifies the end of a flood event throughout the winter from december to february disconnected lakes are left at their topographic low points to dry through infiltration and evaporation the complex network comprising the main lake rivers and seasonal isolated lakes over floodplains experiences spatial temporal heterogeneous patterns of inundations through channelized flow and overbank diffusion processes thus the plnnr provides a unique site for studying surface water connectivity tan et al 2019 2 2 remote sensing data the 250 m resolution 8 day composite normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data spanned from february 2000 to december 2016 were acquired from the nasa goddard space flight center url https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov a constrained view angle maximum value composite cv mvc has been applied to remove the spuriously low value caused by atmospheric effects and cloud contamination michishita et al 2014 in addition in order to reconstruct a high quality ndvi time series the residual noise of the ndvi data was eliminated by applying the running median mean value maximum operation end point processing and hanning rmmeh smoothing method jin and xu 2013 meanwhile contemporaneous observations of available landsat tm etm oli images with a spatial resolution of 30 m were acquired from the united states geological survey usgs url https glovis usgs gov after inspection cloud removal and destriping 129 scenes of reasonable landsat images were ultimately retrieved at first all landsat images with digital number nd value were converted to top of atmosphere toa radiance then the surface reflectance data was generated with the fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes flaash atmospheric correction algorithm cooley et al 2002 and the ndvi value of landsat were calculated based on the reflectance data finally the processed modis ndvi was integrated with landsat ndvi to generate a new ndvi dataset with high temporal and fine spatial resolutions 2 3 modis and landsat data fusion in order to better monitoring surface water features at the study site this study applied a hierarchical spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model hstafm to fuse modis and landsat images chen et al 2017 in comparison the traditional image fusion methods such as starfm gao et al 2006 staarrch hilker et al 2009 estarfm zhu et al 2010 and fsdaf zhu et al 2016 often enforce an assumption that the predicted image shares the same pixels this assumption is invalid for ecosystems undergoing dynamic changes chen et al 2015 the remarkable improvement of hstafm is the introduction of a hierarchical strategy for selecting similar pixels in the initial prediction the accuracy assessment demonstrates that the hstafm can evidently detect the land surface changes between prior posterior and predicted dates chen et al 2018 compared with the starfm and fsdaf fusion the predicted ndvi from hstafm achieved a better consistency of landscape ndvi to the actual landsat we recommend two previous papers by chen et al 2017 2018 for more details about the hstafm algorithm in order to better capture the general change within the limited available image pair and targeted modis image a modification of the hstafm was conducted in this study that is selecting a contemporary landsat image with the most similar land surface information e g hydrological phase vegetation phenology to pair up with the modis image in each predicting procedure the vegetation dynamics and water level fluctuations served as references i e the landsat image having the most similar water level and phenological features to the prior image was selected and those two images made a pair if the contemporary landsat image observed in the same year was invalid usually contaminated by clouds another landsat image in the most recent year was selected as an alternative in view of the high vegetation coverage on poyang lake s floodplain the former fused ndvis were classified into water wet cells and non water dry cells using the jenks natural breaks method jenks 1977 the area and spatial distribution of surface water derived from fused ndvis well agree with those derived from landsat ndwis r2 0 92 more detailed information of accuracy assessment can be found in our previous studies tan et al 2019 2 4 geostatistical connectivity function the geostatistical connectivity function developed by trigg et al 2013 was applied in this study to evaluate the magnitude extent and duration of a connection this function quantifies the probability that any two separate points pixel with a specific distance are connected based on the wet dry binary state data derived from fused ndvis it enables mapping of the frequency of the connection between points to a specific location on the other hand this function can quantify subtle changes in connectedness and spatial organization and hence interpret transitions and thresholds in flow processes by characterizing the spatial and temporal patterns of data fields pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2003 the probability p expressed in the connectivity function can be calculated by the flowing algorithm p n z c p r j 1 n i u j z c 1 where an is the product operator if the variable z u j at location u j exceeds the threshold value z c it was calculated by i u j z c 1 if z u j z c zero if not it was operated when u 1 takes all possible positions within the study site the probability p n z c decrease to zero faster with greater spatial entropy of the field at any given distance the value of the connectivity function refers to a fraction of points with specific distance along the given direction as we know along the flow direction of the main river the number of tributaries decrease from upstream to downstream and the main river becomes deeper and narrower leading to a gradually weakening of surface water connectivity comparing results of annual averaged connectivity function indicated that w e flow connectivity extends over a longer distance than ne sw connectivity and is most likely to reflect the orientation of the main river fig 2 thus the connectivity function in the w e direction was analyzed using a matlab program assuming 8 way connectivity 8d additionally the program created an image on which each connected component was distinguished by an integer number that ranges from one to the number of connected components 3 results and discussions 3 1 connectivity function in the w e direction based on wet dry binary state raster derived from fused ndvis the application of the geostatistical connectivity analysis creates a series of connectivity function curves that depict the continually changing surface water connectivity throughout a flood event for comparison the connectivity function curves for a typical drought year from 1 january 2006 to 1 january 2007 a normal year from 17 january 2009 to 9 january 2010 and a typical flood year from 9 january 2010 to 18 february 2011 were illustrated in fig 3 these hydrological years and their beginning ending times were decided according to the published literatures dai et al 2008 li et al 2017 and the conversion time between the rising and receding periods accordingly the highest surface water connectivity occurred around the flood peak in every hydrological year the minimum connectivity function around the flood peak was 0 50 during the typical drought year 0 65 during the normal year and 0 89 during the typical flood year in addition the sharp drop of the connectivity function curve for the low water period indicated a poorly connected water body within the studied floodplain the maximum distance of connection for dry periods was about 10 15 km during the typical drought and normal year and about 15 20 km during the typical flood year more high connectivity function curves for the rising and receding periods can be found in fig 3c which indicates a long lasting period approximately 176 days of high water levels during the typical flood year in contrast to the typical drought or normal year the surface water connectivity appeared to be separated by some important thresholds in every flood event these thresholds were evident from the clustering of the connectivity function curves for periods of time the clustering around the event peak was particularly noticeable our earlier study confirmed that most isolated lakes merged into one single water body when the water level at xingzi station reached 14 m tan and jiang 2016 consequently we determined that the connectivity characteristics will not change much in two cases one is the filling of lower lying depressions and deep channels during the rising period the other is the reducing of the flood depth as the seasonal isolated lakes gradually drain during the receding period when the flood spatial extent remain static surface water connectivity transitions when the water level rise beyond or decline below 14 m at xingzi station due to such casual mechanisms as the flood overtops riparian banks and natural levees or returns back to the topographic lows 3 2 spatial temporal distribution of connectomes and connectivity processes the function of hydrological connectivity refers to how connectomes interact with flood pulses to generate runoff linked flow and therefore transfer water in floodplains in order to obtain further evidence of flow paths and water transfer patterns an 8 day spatial distribution of connectomes during the typical drought year the normal year and the typical flood year are illustrated in figs 4 5 and 6 respectively during the typical drought year fig 4 the lower located dachahu first reconnected to the other connectome through diffusive overbank flow on february 10 doy 41 when the water level of the main lake reached 9 05 m refer to the 16 day averaged water level at xingzi station which is hereinafter inclusive in contrast to dachahu meixihu connected to the main lake body through a floodplain channel on may 25 doy 145 at a water level of 14 58 m the connection between banghu and the confluence of ganjiang and xiushui hereinafter river confluence caused the fill rate of the upper located lakes such as zhoubianhu and shahu to increase the flood peak of the typical drought year occurred on june 18 doy 169 at a water level of 15 81 m all isolated lakes were inundated by floodwater except changhu which is located on a higher portion of the floodplain contrary to the connection sequence during the rising period zhushihu first disconnected from xiushui at the initial stage of floodwater reduction about half a month later on july 12 doy 193 dahuchi and xianghu became isolated with the abrupt recession of flow on the floodplain it is noteworthy that meixihu discharged through another path during the receding period different from the recharge path following the isolation of dachahu all seasonal isolated lakes ended surface connection on december 17 doy 321 when the water level dropped below 9 15 m during the normal year fig 5 the gradual rise of the water level appeared on february 10 doy 41 at a water level of 7 61 m in contrast to the connectivity pattern in the typical drought year the upper located zhonghuchi connected to another connectome at almost the same time as dachahu notably zhonghuchi connected to xiushui but disconnected from the main lake until june 26 doy 177 changhu remained isolated throughout the normal year as well as during the typical drought year however other connectomes such as zhonghuchi and zhushihu experienced a longer period of surface water connection during the normal year there was no obvious change in the surface water coverage of shahu after it disconnected from banghu due to the blocking effect of high soil ridges but banghu almost disappeared from the map from october 8 doy 281 to november 9 doy 313 as a result of the emptying effect of the river confluence the expansion of banghu after november 17 doy 321 might contribute to the recharge of the local precipitation and or underground water during the typical flood year fig 6 dachahu connected to a part of the main lake which is depicted in the first scene of the flood event the narrow gap which separated dachahu and the main lake body might be generated from an interpretation error banghu began to expand before it connected to the rivers or the main lake and recharged shahu with overbank diffusion on april 23 doy 113 meixihu was filled with the floodwater of the main lake and the river confluence at almost the same time via two floodplain channels coming from different directions from may 1 doy 121 to october 16 doy 289 periods of high water levels within the typical flood year lasted more than 160 days periods of high water levels started much earlier and ended later during the typical flood year than during the typical drought or normal year another noticeable difference is that changhu appeared to be inundated by floodwater around the event peak with water levels ranging from 15 87 m to 20 02 m although banghu disconnected from the river confluence and the main lake on october 24 doy 297 its surface area continued to shrink afterward this decrease in size may have built upon the influences of evaporation and infiltration however the connection between xianghu and dongjiahu existed during the receding period and their surface water range did not change significantly this difference might well be a result of the spatial variation in water permeability on the lake bottom or human disturbance whether or when a seasonal isolated lake may have flow paths that connect it to a nearby landscape or water body mainly depends on its spatial distribution and flood levels the transfer patterns and flow paths between seasonal isolated lakes differ by geomorphic features in general filling processes happen from lower lying lakes to upper lying ones during the expansion stage and vice versa in addition the timing and duration of surface water connectivity varies among lakes and different hydrological years 3 3 duration and frequency of hydrological connection the duration of the surface water connection among the 12 main seasonal isolated lakes rivers ganjiang xiushui and their confluence and the main lake are exhibited in fig 7 the longest duration of connection was always found between dachahu and the main lake during the typical drought year 288 days the normal year 288 days and the typical flood year 344 days there was no surface water connection between changhu and other connectomes throughout the typical drought year or normal year changhu also was the seasonal isolated lake with the shortest inundation duration 120 days in the typical flood year in the typical drought and normal year the duration of the connection between the main lake and seasonal isolated lakes located in lower floodplain e g dachahu and meixihu were much longer than those between the main lake and upper lying lakes e g dahuchi and zhushihu due to the different inundation times in comparison in the typical flood year there were minor differences in duration of the connection between the main lake and other seasonal isolated lakes except for dachahu and changhu in response to the rapid rising and receding process the flow path is very important for the transport of sediments and pollutants in floodplains in order to identify the potential flow paths among important water bodies the frequency of the connection between the four largest seasonal isolated lakes banghu dachahu dahuchi and shahu within the study site and other pixels is presented in fig 8 banghu most likely connects with rivers through an outlet channel in the northeast portion of the lake a narrow deep channel in the northwest area of banghu promotes the surface water connectivity between it and zhoubianhu moreover the hydrological and or chemical processes of banghu and changhuchi might be linked with the rising river levels different from expected the connection between banghu and shahu is not much more frequent than that between banghu and other lower lying lakes such as dachahu meixihu and zhushihu the connection between dachahu and the main lake is noticeably the most frequent fig 8b even during low water level periods dachahu could connect to the deep channel of the main lake through a part of overbank diffusion dachahu usually connects to rivers via two paths the first is downstream water body of the main lake the second is meixihu that means water sediments and pollutants in changhuchi and rivers may flow into meixihu and dachahu via the narrow channels between them the other two seasonal isolated lakes dahuchi fig 8c and shahu fig 8d are both located in a higher portion of the floodplain overbank flow in the north and southeast of dahuchi may occur at different times depending on whether xiushui or ganjiang is filled first overbank flow may occur simultaneously in two directions as floodwater rapidly fills the lower lying seasonal isolated lakes in addition shahu seldom connects to changhu dahuchi or xianghu due to the barrier effect of the river banks shahu may be connected to changhuchi zhonghuchi and zhushihu once the floodwaters of the rivers overtop the high soil ridges between shahu and banghu however the surface water of upper lying lakes can hardly recharge shahu during the receding and low water level periods because of geographical locations and receding directions the erosional and depositional effects of overbank and channelized flows dominate the floodplain sedimentary environments in response geomorphic processes determine the flow paths and patterns among connectomes if two water bodies are connected the wide deep and numerous overbank flows can promote the expansion process during the rising period otherwise the narrow shallow and single channelized flow will restrict the shrinkage process during the receding period 3 4 variations in surface water area related to surface water connectivity temporal variations in surface water area of four seasonal isolated lakes with long lasting connections during the typical years are illustrated in figs 9 10 and 11 that the expansion rates of almost all seasonal isolated lakes were higher after the surface water connection than before during rising periods is a remarkable discovery meanwhile almost all lakes shrank slower after isolation than before during the receding periods as an example the expansion rate of the connected dachahu 1 45 km2 8 days was much higher than the expansion rate of the isolated dachahu 0 04 km2 8 days during the rising period of a typical drought year fig 9a moreover banghu shrank much slower after isolation 0 16 km2 8 days than before 10 28 km2 8 days during the receding period during the normal year the draining effect of surface water connectivity was much stronger than the filling effect in particular the shrinkage rate of banghu during the receding period reached 21 64 km2 8 days fig 10c in comparison the surface water areas of dachahu and banghu experienced a short period increase after being disconnected from other water bodies in addition a rapid expansion of dachahu dongjiahu banghu and shahu occurred when they first connected to the surrounding water bodies during the rising period of the typical flood year fig 11 however the expansion rates of the connected lakes during the whole rising period were not much higher due to the prolonged flood peak likewise the surface water areas of connected lakes were stable during the initial period of recession and decreased dramatically afterwards besides the primary factor of a considerable water level fluctuation in the studied floodplain the connectivity characteristics are affected by the geomorphic features climate condition local recharge intricate paths and human intervention park and latrubesse 2017 seasonal isolated lakes experience gradual expansion during the initial rising period as a result of precipitation and groundwater recharge the continuous rising of groundwater and river stage accelerates the process of channel filling some large and deep lakes expand at a lower rate even though they are connected to another water body via a narrow channel a rapid increase in surface water area occurs when floodwaters overtop channel banks once the whole bank is flooded further increments will result in greater depths and higher flow velocities during high water level periods especially in flood years the initial fall of floodwaters causes changes in water depth but not surface area some large and low gradient lakes undergo a quick decline in response to the rapid and thick overbank flow shrinkage rates slow down when surface water connectivity is dominated by channelized flow at the end of a flood event the changes in stagnant water left in isolated lakes are controlled by meteorological conditions groundwater fluctuations and human manipulations 4 conclusions a number of small seasonal isolated lakes appear in the floodplains of plnnr with short hydroperiod and shallow depth these lakes harbor a great many wintering birds for which there are selective pressures to breed in more ephemeral sites furthermore due to the stagnant nature of seasonal isolated lakes they provide more time for microbes to convert excess nutrients thus prevent algal blooms in the lower reaches this study yielded new insight into the quantification of surface water connectivity which will help policymakers determine how water bodies may be connected and understand the implications of those connections for wildlife protection and water purification this study demonstrated that the fused ndvis integrated from modis and landsat are valuable datasets for assessing the surface water dynamics of spatially and temporally large scale events a remarkable advance of the dataset is maintaining the spatial continuity of the narrow channels which is an important aspect of evaluating the surface water connectivity on the other hand the 8 day interval enables us to explore these dynamics in detail revealing new insights into the flood inundation processes the geostatistical method applied in this study was shown to be reliable and objective the connectivity function derived from this method changed continually throughout the flood event surface water connectivity is mainly determined by specific water level the threshold of which varies among different lakes and different hydrological years lower lying lakes tend to be connected earlier and disconnected later than upper lying lakes for most connectomes the duration of hydrological connections between among them during the typical flood year is much longer than it is during the typical drought year or normal year due to the long lasting periods of high water levels the patterns of surface water connectivity can promote or restrict the filling processes of seasonal isolated lakes during the rising period as well as the draining processes during the receding period under the combined effects of flood pulse and surface water connectivity the expansion rate of a seasonal isolated lake is larger after connection lakes shrink slower after isolation these results demonstrate a novel insight into inundation dynamics in complex floodplains and present the prospect that geostatistical analysis that is based on fused remote sensing images may provide a reliable method for quantifying surface water connectivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

6023,errors in hydrometeorological forcings for hydrologic modeling lead to considerable prediction uncertainty of hydrologic variables analyses of quantitative precipitation estimate qpe and quantitative precipitation forecast qpf errors over the ohio river valley were made to quantify qpe and qpf errors and identify hydrologic impacts of forcing errors and possible improvements resulting from advancements in precipitation estimation and forecasting monthly seasonal and annual bias analyses of ohio river forecast center ohrfc next generation radar nexrad based stage iii and multisensor precipitation estimator mpe precipitation estimates for the period 1997 2016 were made with respect to parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism precipitation estimates verification of qpf from nws river forecast centers from the noaa nws national precipitation verification unit npvu was compared to qpf verification measures from several numerical weather prediction models and the noaa nws weather prediction center wpc improvements in nexrad based qpe over the ohrfc area have been dramatic from 1997 to present however from the perspective of meeting hydrologic forecasting needs qpf shows marginal improvement a hydrologic simulation experiment illustrates the sensitivity of hydrologic forecasts to qpf errors indicated by qpf threat score ts values a monte carlo experiment shows there can be considerable hydrologic forecast error associated with qpf at expected wpc ts levels and importantly that higher ts values do not necessarily translate into improved hydrologic forecasts these results have significant implications for real time hydrologic forecasting first experimental results demonstrate the value gained in terms of improvements in hydrologic modeling accuracy from long term radar based precipitation bias reductions second experimental results show that improvements made in terms of qpf have marginal effect on hydrologic prediction and that even with significant improvement in qpf accuracy we should expect large hydrologic prediction uncertainty these issues are discussed more fully as they relate to the future of operational hydrology and ensemble hydrologic forecasting keywords hydrologic modeling qpe qpf forecast error bias 1 introduction hydrologic forecast accuracy is largely dependent on the magnitude of measurement and prediction errors of hydrometeorological forcings used as model inputs where both the spatial placement of hydrometeorological quantities over watersheds and temporal distribution can affect watershed response significantly maurer and lettenmaier 2003 tetzlaff and uhlenbrook 2005 gourley and vieux 2005 benke et al 2008 wood and lettenmaier 2008 mascaro et al 2010 schröter et al 2011 newman et al 2015 the need for improvements in forecast accuracy and the quantification of forecast uncertainty are central recommendations by the national research council nrc to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws found in national research council 2006 key to meeting these recommendations by the nrc was the development and implementation of the advanced hydrologic prediction services ahps where nrc 2006 identifies the need to strengthen quantitative precipitation estimation qpe and quantitative precipitation forecasts qpf for hydrologic prediction through an end to end evaluation that assesses qpe qpf quality and impacts on flood and streamflow products for basins thus improvements in the measurement of observed and prediction of future hydrometeorological forcings are critical to improving hydrological forecast accuracy in operational settings hydrologic model forcings usually take the form of quantitative estimates of observed and forecasted precipitation and temperature adams and pagano 2016 the quantification of precipitation errors in watershed runoff prediction errors has a significant research history as early as 1969 research by fogel 1969 quantified differences in watershed runoff due to rainfall variability using a dense raingauge network more recently using distributed precipitation inputs wilson et al 1979 and faurès et al dec 1995 demonstrated that large variations in modeled watershed runoff can result from spatially variable rainfall utilizing dense raingauge networks jones and wendland 1984 goodrich et al 1995 and zhang et al 2007 report the occurrence of significant rainfall variability over short distances 100 1000 m which with gridded precipitation fields would be considered the subgrid scale 1 1 qpe errors past studies have shown that accurate quantification of observed precipitation known as quantitative precipitation estimate qpe is problematic for both raingauge based and radar derived estimates raingauge based estimation errors arise largely due to insufficient gauge density of raingauge networks huff 1970 sungmin et al 2016 cecinati et al 2017 and low catch biases of individual raingauges humphrey et al 1997 ciach and krajewski 1999 ciach 2003 it has been shown that the highest quality radar based estimates of precipitation depend on raingauge based bias adjustments and other corrections within precipitation processing algorithms anagnostou et al 1998 young et al 2000 such corrections are needed to account for a range of systematic detection and measurement errors associated with beam attenuation full partial beam blockage ground clutter beam overshooting curvature of the earth anomalous propagation brightband contamination conversion from reflectivity to rainfall rates i e non unique r z relationships beam attenuation and range effects including sampling and averaging errors significant research by the u s noaa nws began in the 1980s related to the development of radar precipitation processing system algorithms principally aimed at improving precipitation estimation for hydrologic forecasting this research lead to the development of the 3 stage precipitation processing system comprised of stage i ii and iii for nws s band weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler wsr 88d radars fulton et al 1998 young et al 2000 stage i processing occurs at the radar location itself addressing the fundamental conversion of the radar reflectivity signal to precipitation estimates including corrections for partial beam blockage ground clutter anomalous propagation hail range degradation etc fulton 1998 an output from stage i is the hourly digital precipitation array product which is transmitted to nws river forecast center rfc and weather forecast office wfo field offices stage ii processing at nws rfcs and wfos generates an optimal hourly rainfall field estimate for each radar independently using a multivariate objective analysis scheme that incorporates radar and raingauge observations this multisensor rainfall field estimate utilizing all available rain gauge data is produced hourly for each radar on the nws hydrologic rainfall analysis project hrap fulton 1998 reed and maidment 1999 grid using as input the hourly digital precipitation array product from stage i because nws rfcs have large regional hydrologic forecast areas of responsibility stage iii is designed to mosaic stage ii multisensor estimates from multiple radars on the national hrap grid bounding the forecast area of each rfc independently with the availability of several mosaicking algorithms stage iii was subsequently superseded by improvements found in the muti sensor precipitation estimator mpe seo 1998 seo et al 1999 breidenbach et al 1999 breidenbach and bradberry 2001 kitzmiller et al 2013 eldardiry et al 2017 gridded mpe and previously stage iii precipitation radar rainfall fields are used by most nws rfcs which are responsible for flood forecasting in the united states as observed precipitation forcings for hydrologic modeling fread et al 1995 national research council 2012 adams 2016 national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv lin and mitchell 2005 products are a nationwide mosaick of stage iii or mpe products generated by rfcs a recent study by nelson et al 2016 made an assessment of ncep stage iv qpe many rfcs have utilized hourly gridded multi radar multi sensor mrms zhang et al 2016 radar rainfall field estimates within their qpe workflows for operational hydrologic forecasting since the data became available in 2011 with the availability of q2 vasiloff et al 2007 which was a precursor to mrms where the mrms qpe system is refered to as q3 martinaitis et al 2014 the mrms originally called the national mosaic and qpe nmq algorithm package was developed at the noaa national severe storms laboratory and subsequently moved to the noaa ncep for operational support of nws rfcs and wfos in western regions of the u s where radar beam blockage is problematic in mountainous areas nws estimation methods rely on data from raingauge and natural resources conservation service snow telemetry snotel networks for precipitation estimation gauge data are processed at rfcs using spatial interpolation algorithms and historical data such as parameter elevation

precipitation utilizing mountain mapper and data qc schaake et al 2004 1 2 qpf errors difficulties with the prediction of future precipitation referred to as quantitative precipitation forecast qpf are compounded by the need to accurately predict occurrences of heavy precipitation accumulations spatially that is the location of flood producing rainfall matters significantly which is demonstrably evident with flash flood scale events where the occurrence of excessive rainfall accompanied by flooding can be hit or miss over very short distances with devastating outcomes smith et al 1996 baeck and smith 1998 smith et al 2000 borga et al 2010 alfieri et al 2011 broxton et al 2014 1 3 temperature errors we have purposefully omitted any consideration of wintertime effects which can be considerable to limit the scope of this study with winter time storms errors in temperature estimation and prediction can incorrectly identify the physical state of hydrometeors suggesting the occurrence of rainfall rather than snowfall or the reverse wayand et al 2017 mizukami et al 2013 and hunter and holroyd 2002 discuss the implications of mis typing the physical state of precipitation rain snow ice hail etc and how such errors lead directly to hydrologic forecast error moine et al 2013 rössler et al 2014 and wayand 2016 show that errors in the estimation of snow accumulation and snow water equivalent become especially problematic during rain on snow and significant temperature driven snowmelt events with temperature index based snow models such as the nws snow accumulation and ablation model snow 17 anderson 1973 used by nws rfcs erroneous temperature estimates can lead to inaccurate snowmelt rates the effects of wind terrain and vegetation on snow estimation winstral et al 2002 essery and pomeroy 2004 and modeling essery et al 1999 xiao et al 2000 bowling et al 2004 liston and elder 2006 are significant as well 1 4 study goals thiboult et al 2016 identify three broad sources of total hydrologic forecast uncertainty namely 1 model structure 2 initial conditions and 3 forcing uncertainties this study focuses on the latter two sources of hydrologic forecast uncertainty qpe and qpf errors over the noaa nws ohio river forecast center ohrfc area of responsibility shown in fig 1 are analyzed to identify improvements in qpe and qpf accuracy since 1997 and earlier with qpf the central question is how qpe and qpf advancements through ahps implementation have impacted ohrfc hydrologic forecast accuracy we address the efficacy of ahps improvements through hydrologic simulation experiments where hydrologic forecast errors are evaluated with respect to changes in qpe and qpf forcing errors over the periods of record within the ohrfc area of responsibility qpe and qpf errors are independent of each other and have independent but similar effects on hydrologic forecast accuracy we assess the effect of qpe and qpf errors on hydrologic modeling or forecast uncertainty separately consequently in section 2 we examine the spatial bias patterns of stage iii mpe precipitation estimates and changes over time for the ohrfc area a demonstrable improvement in qpe should be reflected in improvements in hydrologic simulations over the period of record a historical simulation for a representative watershed using stage iii mpe precipitation estimates as the principal model forcing is utilized to investigate possible improvements in hydrologic model simulation resulting solely from changes in precipitation estimation improvements in qpe are important for both hydrologic model state initialization and near term forecasting related to the lag in basin response for most watersheds which is independent of qpf section 3 addresses qpf skill and implications to hydrologic forecasting lack et al 2010 and rempel et al 2017 and gilleland 2019 propose the use of object based metrics for verification which includes error measures of 1 magnitude 2 spatial placement and 3 spatial pattern of forecasted meteorological fields including future precipitation we present results of noaa nws weather prediction center wpc and national precipitation verification unit npvu qpf verification to establish a baseline of qpf accuracy spanning the verification period of record our principal aim however is to quantify expected improvements in hydrologic prediction error that follow directly from qpf accuracy improvements consequently we constructed a controlled monte carlo experiment to address a single issue how should changes in hydrologic response reflect improvements in wpc qpf on the basis spatial placement accurate placement of qpf over a watershed is critical in hydrologic forecasting the results of the monte carlo simulation experiment should demonstrate the range in hydrologic forecast uncertainty associated with past and current expected levels of qpf accuracy the monte carlo experiment utilizes observed precipitation from a major rainfall event as a surrogate for possible qpf realizations in order to control confounding factors that contribute to qpf error a summary and discussion of the limitations of the work as well as implications to hydrologic forecasting and final conclusions are presented in section 4 2 qpe biases the ohrfc shown in fig 1 has produced radar based precipitation estimates derived from the nexrad network of weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler wsr 88d radars crum and alberty 1993 since 1996 nexrad radars utilized by the ohrfc are shown in fig 1 and are listed in table 1 however use of nexrad data as model forcings for operational hydrologic forecasting did not begin immediately due to significant changes in the ohrfc operational hydrological environment which included operational implementation of the awips nrc 1997 and the nws river forecast system u s department of commerce 1972 adams 2016 2 1 qpe timeline although stage ii iii products were generated beginning in 1996 at the ohrfc these data were not used in hydrologic forecast operations until 1998 a timeline of the period of use of stage ii iii and mpe by the ohrfc is shown in fig 2 an early significant mpe improvement identified in fig 2 was the correction of an algorithmic error that produced truncated rain rate values leading to precipitation under estimation fulton et al 2003 this error was corrected by the development and field deployment of the open radar product generator orpg primarily builds 1 3 and 4 software build 1 was deployed primarily over the period april july 2002 build 3 was deployed during the months april july 2003 and build 4 was delivered during the october december 2003 period fulton et al 2003 orpg build 1 contained the most significant improvements to precipitation estimation of the three oprg software builds additional enhancements to nexrad precipitation processing have followed kitzmiller et al 2011 kitzmiller et al 2013 including the deployment of nexrad dual polarization in 2011 which was completed for the ohrfc region before june 2013 fig 2 also shows the addition of the kvwx and khpx nexrad radars to those used by the ohrfc shown in fig 1 2 2 data analysis we analyze qpe biases over annual seasonal and monthly time scales with respect to spatial bias patterns and mean field bias the emphasis is to identify long term spatial and temporal trends over the ohrfc area which has implications for hydrologic forecasting accuracy improvement shorter hourly or sub hourly biases have been analyzed previously by many authors for example krajewski et al 2003 and peleg et al 2013 the hrap grid is nominally an 4 7 km resolution polar stereographic grid prism estimates are developed at a 30 arcsec resolution in geographic latitude longitude coordinates consequently re projection evenden 1990 and spatial interpolation of monthly prism grids to the hrap coordinate system is necessary for prism mpe stage iii comparisons and analysis re projection of the prism grids employing a bi linear interpolation algorithm and bias analyses of the gridded fields use the geographic resource analysis support system grass geographic information system gis grass development team 2016 the magnitude and spatial patterns of estimation error from stage iii and mpe precipitation estimates are calculated on a pixel by pixel basis with respect to gridded prism estimates over the ohrfc area mpe stage iii bias with respect to prism for the masked ohrfc region using eq 1 1 bias stage iii or mpe prism where bias 1 is perfect agreement gridded hrap monthly seasonal and annual precipitation totals are derived from ohrfc hourly xmrg refer to fulton 1998 format files 2 2 1 annual variability making use of eq 1 we obtain table 2 and fig 3 which shows the spatial bias pattern of ohrfc stage iii and mpe precipitation estimates on an annual basis from january 1 1997 through december 31 2016 two features should be evident namely that 1 stage iii and mpe precipitation estimates are significantly under estimated with respect to the prism estimates beginning in 1997 but improve significantly by 2002 and 2 the character of the spatial bias pattern changes from an apparent random variation 1997 2001 to one that exhibits distinct polygonal artifacts 2002 2011 to a pattern showing more of a random character 2012 2016 the changes to the bias patterns can be directly attributed to changes in the method used for bias correction initially in stage iii 1997 2001 then mpe 2002 2011 and finally with mpe utilizing initial mrms estimates 2012 2016 there are also clear indications of persistent beam blockage within the ohrfc area for mpe estimates 2002 2011 which were greatly reduced when mrms was introduced to ohrfc mpe precipitation processing late in 2012 shown in fig 3 bias variations viewed as an annual series in fig 4 a using boxplots see eqs 2 4 in appendix a show marked bias reduction from 1997 to 2005 with the introduction of the use of mrms in late 2012 the variance in bias is substantially reduced over previous years and by 2015 2016 median biases are close to 1 mpe bias results are presented in fig 4 b for the greenbrier river basin wv identified in fig 1 temporal bias patterns over the greenbrier river basin are presented specifically to aid in the discussion of hydrologic modeling gains that result from mpe estimation improvements which is discussed in section 2 2 2 2 2 4 on hydrologic modeling impacts 2 2 2 seasonal variability seasonal variability of mpe biases is presented for the years 2015 and 2016 only because these years reflect current best estimates and precipitation processing performance summer months are defined as june july august jja and winter months as december january february djf seasonal bias values are calculated as monthly jja and djf averages using eq 1 which are shown in fig 5 a bias patterns during the summer months exhibit more of a random pattern compared to the winter months for 2015 2016 these differences are expected due to the prevalence of more isolated convective rainfall during the summer months and wide spread stratiform and synoptic scale precipitation during the winter months also evident during the 2015 and 2016 winter seasons is widespread mpe over estimation in central and east central regions of the ohrfc forecast area quite possibly due to brightband influences gourley and calvert 2003 cunha et al 2013 martinaitis et al 2015 examine difficulties with verification and calibration of winter time radar derived qpe such as mrms from gauge based observations related to below freezing surface wet bulb temperatures such influences could potentially affect winter time bias estimated in the ohrfc area clear differences are seen between winter and summer season biases for the 2015 2016 period with bias density shown in fig 5 b summer biases are very close to 1 and while the winter season mean bias in not much different from 1 with slight over estimation the spread in bias values is much greater during the winter season compared to summer 2 2 3 monthly variability the analysis of monthly mpe biases using eq 1 is based on monthly accumulations of hourly xmrg hrap gridded fields the bias analysis is restricted to the years 2015 and 2016 which best reflects the current state of mpe measurement accuracy fig 6 shows significant month to month bias variability monthly median biases are very close to unity interquartile 25 75 percentile differences are generally small but large outliers are evident this points to the complex nature of both precipitation processes and difficulty in removing estimation biases at short time scales suggesting continued challenges with correcting estimation biases in real time 2 2 4 hydrologic modeling impacts our central interest is knowing what benefits if any to hydrologic modeling and forecasting is evident from improvements in stage iii and mpe precipitation estimation we address this issue by using hourly stage iii mpe precipitation estimates and hourly temperature data obtained from the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 xia et al 2012a xia et al 2012b as the primary hydrologic model forcings for a continuous hydrologic simulation spanning the stage iii mpe historical period of record 1997 2016 historical simulation to illustrate the benefits gained from precipitation estimation improvements a retrospective hydrologic simulation is made using the noaa nws hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm koren et al 2004 koren 2006 koren et al 2010 the historical simulation spans the full period 1997 2016 of available stage iii mpe nexrad radar derived precipitation estimates rdhm simulations are made for the greenbrier river basin in west virginia shown in fig 1 with the model defined at the hrap grid resolution using an hourly time step the greenbrier river basin defined at alderson wv u s geological survey usgs 05050003 located in the valley and ridge physiographic province of the appalachian mountains has an area of 3533 km2 and ranges in elevation from 466 to 1433 m retrospective rdhm simulations are made without prior calibration to avoid biasing model performance to any model period in this way model results will best reflect precipitation processing improvements implemented at the ohrfc without confounding influences from other factors initial a priori estimation of rdhm sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma burnash et al 1973 burnash 1995 model parameters is described by koren et al 2000 parameter estimation includes 12 sac sma parameters and several channel routing parameters rdhm simulations also include use of the snow 17 snow accumulation and ablation model to account for wintertime precipitation and snowmelt snow 17 model parameters are also estimated and the model is used uncalibrated rdhm model simulations begin june 1 1996 from a cold state that is without prior model state initialization that reflect existing basin conditions using hourly nldas 2 precipitation and temperature model inputs ohrfc stage iii and mpe are used for the full period january 1 1997 to december 31 2016 verification of rdhm simulations is restricted to the january 1998 to december 2016 period to allow sufficient rdhm sac sma model warm up nearly 18 months simulation results using usgs measured discharges and rdhm historical simulation goodness of fit statistics such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge me rmse r 2 mae normalized root mean square error nrmse and percent bias pbias are calculated using eqs 5 14 see appendix a to assess hydrologic modeling improvement based on mpe improvements analyses of the historical flows simulation for the 1998 2016 period compared to usgs measured flows are summarized graphically in fig 7 with the exception of mean absolute error mae which is relatively unchanged at about 25 m 3 s 1 and root mean square error rmse at about 55 m 3 s 1 all other measures indicate improvement between observed and simulated flow values over the 1998 2016 retrospective simulation period improvements in values for mean error me from 30 02 to 6 34 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse from 0 44 to 0 84 kling gupta efficiency kge from 0 01 to 0 82 coefficient of determination r2 from 0 61 to 0 84 and percent bias pbias from 48 60 to 10 00 are notable consequently the results demonstrate that improvements in qpe estimation has lead to significantly improved hydrologic simulations for the greenbrier river basin in the ohrfc area of forecast responsibility a comparison of figs 4 and 7 shows the association of reduced stage iii mpe bias to improved hydrologic simulation goodness of fit statistical measures for individual years also clear is that for years when stage iii mpe biases are greatest hydrologic simulation goodness of fit statistics worsen qpf is another major model forcing used in hydrologic forecasting in section 3 we examine qpf error and the magnitude of hydrologic forecast error in response to qpf uncertainty 3 qpf errors independent qpf verification is not attempted in this study instead we report results from two sources namely the noaa nws weather prediction center and national precipitation verification unit npvu to identify trends in qpf accuracy npvu verification results provide additional verification measures beyond threat score often referred to as critical success index csi and bias available from wpc including mean absolute error root mean square error and correlation coefficient additionally npvu verification results are presented for several different sources including several numerical weather prediction nwp model forecasts and rfcs which serve as a useful baseline for comparison against wpc qpf qpf verification comparing rfc wpc and nwp model results demonstrate added value from forecaster contributions novak et al 2014 report improved wpc qpf performance from 1960 through 2012 for days 1 2 and 3 lead time 24 h 1 in 25 4 mm forecasts methods used for forecaster generation of wpc qpf and comparisons relative to various nwp models are also presented in novak et al 2014 wpc qpf improvement is measured in terms of threat score ts ts a a b c from table 3 wilks 2006 both wpc and npvu report qpf verification statistics for a range of precipitation categories including a maximum of 1 0 in 25 4 mm for npvu and categories of 1 0 in 25 4 mm to 2 0 in 50 8 mm and 2 0 in 50 8 mm for wpc since the authors study is focused on flood producing precipitation events it is argued that 24 h 1 0 in 25 4 mm precipitation threshold is in most instances too low to identify flood producing events consequently the authors believe that an analysis restricted to higher intensity flood producing rainfall events 2 0 in 50 8 mm is warranted and that wpc monthly qpf verification ts data for accumulations 2 0 in 50 8 mm is likely to be more relevant to addressing qpf performance relative to meeting hydrologic flood forecasting needs further justification for the use of 2 0 in 50 8 mm threshold to identify flood producing rainfall events is made on the basis of the association of rainfall frequency and peak runoff frequency that is larson and reich 1972 found that while there was high variability for individual years the rank and recurrence interval of storm rainfall and peak runoff do have a central tendency of equality so by looking at rainfall frequency estimates from the noaa nws hydrometeorological design studies center bonnin et al 2006 in the ohio river valley we find that a 1 yr recurrence 24 h rainfall accumulation generally exceeds 2 0 in 50 8 mm and ranges between 50 8 mm to 76 2 mm about 2 3 inches for a 2 yr recurrence by comparison for shorter duration higher intensity precipitation events the 2 yr 6 h rainfall accumulation is 50 8 mm 2 in in the ohio river valley bankfull conditions the river stage level for incipient flooding for small streams and rivers occur with a 1 5 yr recurrence leopold 1994 while the mean annual flood is defined as a flood with a 2 33 yr recurrence dalrymple 1960 so our analysis of flood producing qpf will be restricted to events with a 24 h qpf threshold of 2 0 in 50 8 mm two important issues are 1 the degree to which errors in operational qpf influence hydrologic prediction and 2 how these influences can be quantified in an attempt to address these concerns results from a hydrologic modeling study are presented noting that 1 we present qpf verification statistics taken from the noaa nws national precipitation verification unit npvu covering the 12 conterminous u s conus rfcs the highest precipitation interval used by npvu is 1 0 in 25 4 mm and is reported here to serve as a relative basis for comparison against the wpc 1 0 in 25 4 mm qpf category range which is available athttp www wpc ncep noaa

hydrologic errors in response to expected wpc qpf accuracy 3 threat score ts a commonly used statistical measure of forecast accuracy in meteorology will serve as the basis for evaluating qpf accuracy in the rdhm hydrologic experiments 3 1 wpc monthly mean bias and ts data for precipitation accumulations 2 0 in 50 8 mm obtained from wpc rausch 2016 are summarized in fig 8 for the period 1970 2015 for day 1 and 1991 2015 for day 2 lead times day 2 data were not collected before 1991 by wpc annual averages are also shown based on monthly averaged values the large variability of monthly bias and ts values is evident we note that expected day 1 2 0 in 50 8 mm ts values are about 0 06 in 1970 and 0 22 by 2015 3 2 npvu charba et al 2003 describe a methodology for evaluating qpf forecast accuracy relative to rfc produced stage iii and mpe qpe at wpc rfcs and weather forecast offices wfos compared against national guidance produced by operational nwp models run at the ncep also described is the implementation of the national precipitation verification unit npvu to carry out national qpf verification from the various sources wpc wfos rfcs nwp models npvu qpf verification data was produced for

model ngm north american model nam hydrometeorological prediction center hpc now wpc global forecast system gfs eta model eta and aviation model avn for the period june 2001 to december 2009 the gap in data from late 2003 to mid 2004 was due to an npvu data processing failure several points are notable 1 seasonal variability for all the qpf sources is clear 2 while there are differences between qpf sources there is relatively little discernible mae or rmse improvement over the june 2001 to december 2009 analysis period displayed by any of the qpf sources and 3 errors for the larger intervals 1 0 in 25 4 mm are approximately equal to 1 0 in 25 4 mm for all qpf sources the latter point shows that qpf errors are approximately equal in magnitude to the qpf forcings closest to levels that are most impactful for forecasting flood events fig 10 shows the correlation coefficient r of qpf versus qpe aggregated across the june 2001 to december 2009 npvu analysis period grouped by qpf source and precipitation interval it is evident as reported by charba et al 2003 that forecasters add value over nwp modeled qpf based on hpc wpc and rfc results compared to nwp model results also apparent is that for 24 h accumulations especially for the larger precipitation intervals 1 0 in 25 4 mm qpf is poorly correlated with observed qpe and that there is considerable correlation spread within the precipitation intervals little difference is apparent between hpc and rfc qpf on the basis of r values and spread 3 2 1 implications we can see that deterministic qpf can be quite erroneous based on a range of statistical verification measures demonstrated by both nwp model generated qpf and qpf produced with the aid of forecaster input it has been reported novak et al 2014 correctly that by some statistical measures specifically threat score qpf accuracy has improved since the beginning of systematic record keeping to the present nevertheless the question must be asked what benefits have accrued to hydrologic forecasting from qpf improvements this question is addressed with a hydrologic simulation experiment using the near record greenbrier river basin defined at alderson wv usgs 05050003 flooding event in west virginia june 22 24 2016 the greenbrier river basin was selected for study due to the significance of the june 2016 event its basin area which is large enough to reflect variability in watershed response from spatially variable precipitation forcings and its location within the ohrfc area of responsibility 3 3 hyrdrologic simulation experiments a hydrologic simulation experiment is used to assess how qpf improvements have impacted hydrologic prediction we use the observed rainfall field from the june 2016 event as if it were qpf so that if the qpf were to exactly coincide with the observed precipitation qpf ts would equal 1 0 and the simulated peak flow would match the observed peak flow since the rdhm had been calibrated to this event an underlying assumption is that the observed mpe rainfall perfectly estimates the actual rainfall which is of course unknown simulations take the form of a monte carlo experiment using a storm transposition methodology foufoula georgiou 1989 england et al 2014 wright et al 2014 the aim of the experiment is to illustrate the inadequacy of current deterministic qpf for hydrologic forecasting purposes the experiment first produces 1000 randomly located storm centers relative to the location of the maximum 24 h mpe grid cell precipitation accumulation for the period beginning june 23 2016 0600 utc within the region shown in fig 11 a an example transposed storm is shown in fig 12 which shows that all details of the observed mpe field are retained the june 23 2016 0600 utc to june 24 2016 0600 utc period was selected because this was the greatest mpe precipitation accumulation for a 24 h synoptic period during the flooding event the transposed individual hourly grids of the 24 h mpe precipitation serve as qpf for the rdhm simulations fig 11 b shows the location of the maximum 24 h mpe grid cell precipitation accumulation as well as some of the 1000 randomly transposed storm centers closest to the storm center maximum only precipitation grid cells with mpe accumulations 50 8 mm 2 0 in are shown in fig 11 a and b ts values are calculated for each of the randomly transposed 24 h storms based on precipitation amounts 50 8 mm 2 0 in from these only storms with ts 0 06 are used in the rdhm monte carlo simulations because we are interested in identifying improvement in the prediction of hydrologic peak flows resulting from wpc qpf improvements since 1970 when wpc ts 0 06 at the beginning of wpc verification of precipitation accumulation for amounts 50 8 mm 2 0 in consequently 88 randomly transposed storms shown in figs 11 a and b were identified meeting the ts 0 06 threshold and are used in the rdhm monte carlo simulation experiment the rdhm was initialized from model warm states that is model states generated from the 1996 2016 historical simulation discussed previously however for the purpose of the monte carlo simulation experiment only the rdhm was calibrated using a simple trial and error process for a few key model parameters against u s geological survey observed discharge values for the greenbrier river at alderson wv usgs 05050003 for the june 22 24 2016 event the aim of the rdhm calibration was simply to produce good agreement between observed and simulated peak flows using the observed mpe precipitation for the june 22 24 2016 event not comprehensive model calibration which is an optimization process that would not necessarily produce good agreement between observed and simulated values for this event rdhm model calibration here helps to provide hydrological context for the experimental results relative to usgs observed flows for the june 22 24 2016 event 3 3 1 monte carlo experiment results fig 13 shows the usgs observed flows simulated rdhm flow hydrograph from the calibration and simulated flows from the transposed storms with ts values ranging 0 06 0 15 and 0 15 0 25 these ts ranges were used to identify reasonable ts value ranges 0 06 0 15 and 0 15 0 25 that reflect wpc qpf skill for day 1 50 8 mm 2 0 in precipitation accumulations in 1970 and 2016 respectively by doing this we believe we can assess in relative terms the gain in hydrologic forecast accuracy reflected by improvements in wpc qpf it is evident from the fig 13 simulations that hydrograph peaks are in general greater for storms with ts values ranging 0 15 0 25 than for storms with ts values 0 06 0 15 however none of the simulated hydrographs exceed the major flood level and none approach the observed near record flood peak level moreover there is considerable variability between the simulated hydrographs within the separate 0 06 0 15 and 0 15 0 25 ts categories a better perspective on the problem inherent with using deterministic qpf in hydrologic forecasting is found by looking at simulation results from all 88 storms used in the rdhm monte carlo experiment with ts 0 06 fig 14 shows peak flow and storm ts relative to distance from the reference storm center maximum of the observed 24 h mpe with points identified by color reflecting storm ts value ranges point size indicates the peak flow magnitude the high degree of peak flow variability within ts categories is illustrated in fig 15 which is greatest for the 0 30 0 49 ts interval also quite evident is that smaller distances of the transposed storm from the reference storm center does not guarantee either higher ts values or peak flows in fact the storm with the highest ts and closest to the reference storm center produced a peak flow approximately the same as other transposed storms with significantly lower ts values and at distances much further from the reference storm center the monte carlo experimental results show that a large range in hydrologic prediction errors result from qpf with ts values at current expected wpc ts levels ts 0 22 much greater hydrologic prediction errors are found with ts 0 50 consequently these results suggest that deterministic qpf is far too uncertain to be used in operational flood forecasting the large variability of hydrograph response and peak flow relative to the magnitude of the transposed storm ts values underscores the complex nature of hydrologic response to spatially and temporally variable precipitation forcings as discussed in section 1 previous studies have shown that hydrologic response to differences in the location of heavy cores of observed precipitation within a watershed can produce significantly different peak flows consequently large differences in the prediction of flood peak magnitudes using deterministic qpf should be expected simply due to errors in qpf placement relative to a watershed of interest the consequence of qpf spatial placement errors is reflected in errors in the prediction of hydrograph peaks in the monte carlo experiment this is reflected in the findings by rezacova et al 2009 and mittermaier and roberts 2010 who address the difficulty of qpf verification due to the complex structure of observed precipitation fields due to embedded convection 3 3 2 wpc qpf for the june 23 2016 event as a point of reference we report results from a rdhm simulation using june 23 2016 0600 utc 24 h wpc qpf the simulated peak flow was 143 m 3 s 1 with ts 0 30 for wpc qpf for this event readers are referred to fig 13 for reference importantly no 24 h wpc qpf 50 8 mm 2 0 in for the june 23 2016 0700 utc to june 24 2016 0600 utc period fell within the greenbrier river basin shown in fig 16 the usgs observed peak flow value 2285 2 m 3 s 1 at alderson wv occurred june 24 2016 0930 utc the ohrfc forecast from june 23 2016 1423 utc was 180 7 m 3 s 1 corresponding to a peak river stage 5 70 feet 1 74 m which was forecasted to occur june 24 2016 0600 utc corrigan 2016 4 summary and conclusions results presented demonstrate that 1 noaa nws next generation radar nexrad derived qpe has improved dramatically from 1997 present for the ohrfc area which is reflected in significantly improved hydrologic simulations over the 1997 2016 hindcast period and that 2 from the perspective of meeting the needs of hydrologic forecasting qpf improvements have been marginal over the same period the monte carlo hydrologic simulation experiment illustrates the sensitivity of hydrologic forecasts to qpf errors resulting in large peak flow differences within narrow ranges of qpf ts differences results from these experiments show that greater qpf ts values do not necessarily produce improved hydrologic forecasts and that considerable variability in hydrologic response should be expected with qpf ts values the same or nearly so independent of antecedent basin conditions improved hydrologic simulations resulting from qpe improvements are important in several ways first in large part hydrologic forecasts are improved with better qpe because of the ability to accurately translate observed precipitation into watershed response through modeling second improved qpe improves model states that better reflect current basin conditions which reduces the need for an external data assimilation process for model state updating furthermore the need for real time ad hoc forecaster adjustments is reduced which reduces hydrologic forecaster workloads to make model adjustments and decreases the possibility that model adjustments could be made for inappropriate reasons that is an observed difference between simulated and observed flows stage could simply reflect random model error and not indicate divergence between model states and actual basin conditions thus not warranting curve fiiting changes to hydrologic model states finally for well calibrated models improved qpe provides greater confidence in the initial model states needed for probabilistic hydrologic forecast systems cloke and pappenberger 2009 that run automatically without direct forecaster intervention there are some indications of improved qpf accuracy shown by wpc with increased threat score values from 1970 present however wpc qpf bias statistics do not show improvement in addition for a variety of qpf sources npvu verification statistics do not reveal discernible improvement for the 2001 2009 analysis period the rdhm monte carlo experiments demonstrated significant uncertainty in hydrologic response at current expected wpc qpf threat score levels importantly significant uncertainty with deterministic qpf has been widely shown to be problematic damrath et al 2000 ebert 2001 im et al 2006 diomede et al 2008 cuo et al 2011 mascaro et al 2010 illustrate the need for reliable ensemble qpfs in the context of ensemble streamflow forecasting the central problem with deterministic qpf is that in principle the placement timing and magnitude of qpf should all be reasonable estimates for each of the basins shown for example in fig 1 the rdhm monte carlo hydrologic experiment demonstrates how far current deterministic qpf is from consistently providing the needed skill in hydrologic forecasting it is only for much larger basins where qpf errors are sufficiently masked by spatial and temporal averaging that deterministic qpf has sufficient skill to have value in hydrologic forecasting the problem is significantly more difficult for flash floods with affected areas that are considerably smaller than the ohrfc subbasins shown in fig 1 suggesting limits to predictability in real time hydrologic forecasting namely figs 14 and 15 for the greenbrier river basin which is comprised of 5 subbasins shown in fig 1 illustrate that large hydrologic prediction uncertainty can occur with the use of qpf over medium size watersheds even when qpf threat score levels are high moreover as fig 16 shows wpc qpf entirely missed the placement of 50 8 mm 2 0 in rainfall within the greenbrier river basin for the june 23 2016 0700 utc to june 24 2016 0600 utc period where near record setting flooding occurred this level of qpf error is not at all uncommon as wpc and npvu verification statistics demonstrate fig 17 showing a histogram of ohrfc subbasin areas identifies the magnitude of the qpf problem in terms of accurate spatial placement of qpf where the mean ohrfc subbasin area is 613 5 km 2 and median is 476 1 km 2 which are considerably smaller than the greenbrier river basin 3533 km2 hydrologic prediction for small basin areas makes the problem with qpf accuracy altogether more acute and points to the need for using hydrologic prediction methods that explicitly address the uncertainty in model forcing predictions companion research to the current study by adams and dymond 2019 investigates limits to the operational use of deterministic wpc qpf especially as it relates to flood forecasting utilizing real time operational experiments the authors find that for flood forecasting purposes qpf durations should not exceed about 12 h errors in hydrologic flood forecasts utilizing qpf beyond a 12 h duration grow rapidly a major source of the real time qpf based hydrologic prediction errors found by adams and dymond 2019 is identified in this study namely the spatial placement of qpf as indicated by ts values significant research and development activity cloke and pappenberger 2009 adams and ostrowski 2010 demargne et al 2014 in the hydrologic community has been directed at the implementation of probabilistic ensemble hydrologic forecast systems with a principal aim to quantify the uncertainties inherent in hydrological forecasting including uncertainties associated with model forcings in particular qpf uncertainties consequently the authors strongly encourage abandoning the use of deterministic qpf in hydrologic forecasting in favor of probabilistic ensemble methods declaration of

quantitative precipitation forecast qpf errors over the ohio river valley were made to quantify qpe and qpf errors and identify hydrologic impacts of forcing errors and possible improvements resulting

models and the noaa nws weather prediction center wpc improvements in nexrad based qpe over the ohrfc area have been dramatic from 1997 to present however from the perspective of meeting hydrologic forecasting needs qpf shows marginal improvement a hydrologic simulation experiment illustrates the sensitivity of hydrologic forecasts to qpf errors indicated by qpf threat score ts values a monte carlo experiment shows there can be considerable hydrologic forecast error associated with qpf at expected wpc ts levels and importantly that higher ts values do not necessarily translate into improved hydrologic forecasts these results have significant implications for real time hydrologic forecasting first experimental results demonstrate the value gained in terms of improvements in hydrologic modeling accuracy from long term radar based precipitation bias reductions second experimental results show that improvements made in terms of qpf have marginal effect on hydrologic prediction and that even with significant improvement in qpf accuracy we should expect large hydrologic prediction uncertainty these issues are discussed more fully as they relate to the future of operational hydrology and ensemble hydrologic forecasting keywords hydrologic modeling qpe qpf forecast error bias 1 introduction hydrologic forecast accuracy is largely dependent on the magnitude of measurement and prediction errors of hydrometeorological forcings used as model inputs where both the spatial placement of hydrometeorological quantities over watersheds and temporal distribution can affect watershed response significantly maurer and lettenmaier 2003 tetzlaff and uhlenbrook 2005 gourley and vieux 2005 benke et al 2008 wood and lettenmaier 2008 mascaro et al 2010 schröter et al 2011 newman et al 2015 the need for improvements in forecast accuracy and the quantification of forecast uncertainty are central recommendations by the national research council nrc to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws found in national research council 2006 key to meeting these recommendations by the nrc was the development and implementation of the advanced hydrologic prediction services ahps where nrc 2006 identifies the need to strengthen quantitative precipitation estimation qpe and quantitative precipitation forecasts qpf for hydrologic prediction through an end to end evaluation that assesses qpe qpf quality and impacts on flood and streamflow products for basins thus improvements in the measurement of observed and prediction of future hydrometeorological forcings are critical to improving hydrological forecast accuracy in operational settings hydrologic model forcings usually take the form of quantitative estimates of observed and forecasted precipitation and temperature adams and pagano 2016 the quantification of precipitation errors in watershed runoff prediction errors has a significant research history as early as 1969 research by fogel 1969 quantified differences in watershed runoff due to rainfall variability using a dense raingauge network more recently using distributed precipitation inputs wilson et al 1979 and faurès et al dec 1995 demonstrated that large variations in modeled watershed runoff can result from spatially variable rainfall utilizing dense raingauge networks jones and wendland 1984 goodrich et al 1995 and zhang et al 2007 report the occurrence of significant rainfall variability over short distances 100 1000 m which with gridded precipitation fields would be considered the subgrid scale 1 1 qpe errors past studies have shown that accurate quantification of observed precipitation known as quantitative precipitation estimate qpe is problematic for both raingauge based and radar derived estimates raingauge based estimation errors arise largely due to insufficient gauge density of raingauge networks huff 1970 sungmin et al 2016 cecinati et al 2017 and low catch biases of individual raingauges humphrey et al 1997 ciach and krajewski 1999 ciach 2003 it has been shown that the highest quality radar based estimates of precipitation depend on raingauge

precipitation utilizing mountain mapper and data qc schaake et al 2004 1 2 qpf errors difficulties with the prediction of future precipitation referred to as quantitative precipitation forecast qpf are compounded by the need to accurately predict occurrences of heavy precipitation accumulations spatially that is the location of flood producing rainfall matters significantly which is demonstrably evident with flash flood scale events where the occurrence of excessive rainfall accompanied by flooding can be hit or miss over very short distances with devastating outcomes smith et al 1996 baeck and smith 1998 smith et al 2000 borga et al 2010 alfieri et al 2011 broxton et al 2014 1 3 temperature errors we have purposefully omitted any consideration of wintertime effects which can be considerable to limit the scope of this study with winter time storms errors in temperature estimation and prediction can incorrectly identify the physical state of hydrometeors suggesting the occurrence of rainfall rather than snowfall or the reverse wayand et al 2017 mizukami et al 2013 and hunter and holroyd 2002 discuss the implications of mis typing the physical state of precipitation rain snow ice hail etc and how such errors lead directly to hydrologic forecast error moine et al 2013 rössler et al 2014 and wayand 2016 show that errors in the estimation of snow accumulation and snow water equivalent become especially problematic during rain on snow and significant temperature driven snowmelt events with temperature index based snow models such as the nws snow accumulation and ablation model snow 17 anderson 1973 used by nws rfcs erroneous temperature estimates can lead to inaccurate snowmelt rates the effects of wind terrain and vegetation on snow estimation winstral et al 2002 essery and pomeroy 2004 and modeling essery et al 1999 xiao et al 2000 bowling et al 2004 liston and elder 2006 are significant as well 1 4 study goals thiboult et al 2016 identify three broad sources of total hydrologic forecast uncertainty namely 1 model structure 2 initial conditions and 3 forcing uncertainties this study focuses on the latter two sources of hydrologic forecast uncertainty qpe and qpf errors over the noaa nws ohio river forecast center ohrfc area of responsibility shown in fig 1 are analyzed to identify improvements in qpe and qpf accuracy since 1997 and earlier with qpf the central question is how qpe and qpf advancements through ahps implementation have impacted ohrfc hydrologic forecast accuracy we address the efficacy of ahps improvements through hydrologic simulation experiments where hydrologic forecast errors are evaluated with respect to changes in qpe and qpf forcing errors over the periods of record within the ohrfc area of responsibility qpe and qpf errors are independent of each other and have independent but similar effects on hydrologic forecast accuracy we assess the effect of qpe and qpf errors on hydrologic modeling or forecast uncertainty separately consequently in section 2 we examine the spatial bias patterns of stage iii mpe precipitation estimates and changes over time for the ohrfc area a demonstrable improvement in qpe should be reflected in improvements in hydrologic simulations over the period of record a historical simulation for a representative watershed using stage iii mpe precipitation estimates as the principal model forcing is utilized to investigate possible improvements in hydrologic model simulation resulting solely from changes in precipitation estimation improvements in qpe are important for both hydrologic model state initialization and near term forecasting related to the lag in basin response for most watersheds which is independent of qpf section 3 addresses qpf skill and implications to hydrologic forecasting lack et al 2010 and rempel et al 2017 and gilleland 2019 propose the use of object based metrics for verification which includes error measures of 1 magnitude 2 spatial placement and 3 spatial pattern of forecasted meteorological fields including future precipitation we present results of noaa nws weather prediction center wpc and national precipitation verification unit npvu qpf verification to establish a baseline of qpf accuracy spanning the verification period of record our principal aim however is to quantify expected improvements in hydrologic prediction error that follow directly from qpf accuracy improvements consequently we constructed a controlled monte carlo experiment to address a single issue how should changes in hydrologic response reflect improvements in wpc qpf on the basis spatial placement accurate placement of qpf over a watershed is critical in hydrologic forecasting the results of the monte carlo simulation experiment should demonstrate the range in hydrologic forecast uncertainty associated with past and current expected levels of qpf accuracy the monte carlo experiment utilizes observed precipitation from a major rainfall event as a surrogate for possible qpf realizations in order to control confounding factors that contribute to qpf error a summary and discussion of the limitations of the work as well as implications to hydrologic forecasting and final conclusions are presented in section 4 2 qpe biases the ohrfc shown in fig 1 has produced radar based precipitation estimates derived from the nexrad network of weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler wsr 88d radars crum and alberty 1993 since 1996 nexrad radars utilized by the ohrfc are shown in fig 1 and are listed in table 1 however use of nexrad data as model forcings for operational hydrologic forecasting did not begin immediately due to significant changes in the ohrfc operational hydrological environment which included operational implementation of the awips nrc 1997 and the nws river forecast system u s department of commerce 1972 adams 2016 2 1 qpe timeline although stage ii iii products were generated beginning in 1996 at the ohrfc these data were not used in hydrologic forecast operations until 1998 a timeline of the period of use of stage ii iii and mpe by the ohrfc is shown in fig 2 an early significant mpe improvement identified in fig 2 was the correction of an algorithmic error that produced truncated rain rate values leading to precipitation under estimation fulton et al 2003 this error was corrected by the development and field deployment of the open radar product generator orpg primarily builds 1 3 and 4 software build 1 was deployed primarily over the period april july 2002 build 3 was deployed during the months april july 2003 and build 4 was delivered during the october december 2003 period fulton et al 2003 orpg build 1 contained the most significant improvements to precipitation estimation of the three oprg software builds additional enhancements to nexrad precipitation processing have followed kitzmiller et al 2011 kitzmiller et al 2013 including the deployment of nexrad dual polarization in 2011 which was completed for the ohrfc region before june 2013 fig 2 also shows the addition of the kvwx and khpx nexrad radars to those used by the ohrfc shown in fig 1 2 2 data analysis we analyze qpe biases over annual seasonal and monthly time scales with respect to spatial bias patterns and mean field bias the emphasis is to identify long term spatial and temporal trends over the ohrfc area which has implications for hydrologic forecasting accuracy improvement shorter hourly or sub hourly biases have been analyzed previously by many authors for example krajewski et al 2003 and peleg et al 2013 the hrap grid is nominally an 4 7 km resolution polar stereographic grid prism estimates are developed at a 30 arcsec resolution in geographic latitude longitude coordinates consequently re projection evenden 1990 and spatial interpolation of monthly prism grids to the hrap coordinate system is necessary for prism mpe stage iii comparisons and analysis re projection of the prism grids employing a bi linear interpolation algorithm and bias analyses of the gridded fields use the geographic resource analysis support system grass geographic information system gis grass development team 2016 the magnitude and spatial patterns of estimation error from stage iii and mpe precipitation estimates are calculated on a pixel by pixel basis with respect to gridded prism estimates over the ohrfc area mpe stage iii bias with respect to prism for the masked ohrfc region using eq 1 1 bias stage iii or mpe prism where bias 1 is perfect agreement gridded hrap monthly seasonal and annual precipitation totals are derived from ohrfc hourly xmrg refer to fulton 1998 format files 2 2 1 annual variability making use of eq 1 we obtain table 2 and fig 3 which shows the spatial bias pattern of ohrfc stage iii and mpe precipitation estimates on an annual basis from january 1 1997 through december 31 2016 two features should be evident namely that 1 stage iii and mpe precipitation estimates are significantly under estimated with respect to the prism estimates beginning in 1997 but improve significantly by 2002 and 2 the character of the spatial bias pattern changes from an apparent random variation 1997 2001 to one that exhibits distinct polygonal artifacts 2002 2011 to a pattern showing more of a random character 2012 2016 the changes to the bias patterns can be directly attributed to changes in the method used for bias correction initially in stage iii 1997 2001 then mpe 2002 2011 and finally with mpe utilizing initial mrms estimates 2012 2016 there are also clear indications of persistent beam blockage within the ohrfc area for mpe estimates 2002 2011 which were greatly reduced when mrms was introduced to ohrfc mpe precipitation processing late in 2012 shown in fig 3 bias variations viewed as an annual series in fig 4 a using boxplots see eqs 2 4 in appendix a show marked bias reduction from 1997 to 2005 with the introduction of the use of mrms in late 2012 the variance in bias is substantially reduced over previous years and by 2015 2016 median biases are close to 1 mpe bias results are presented in fig 4 b for the greenbrier river basin wv identified in fig 1 temporal bias patterns over the greenbrier river basin are presented specifically to aid in the discussion of hydrologic modeling gains that result from mpe estimation improvements which is discussed in section 2 2 2 2 2 4 on hydrologic modeling impacts 2 2 2 seasonal variability seasonal variability of mpe biases is presented for the years 2015 and 2016 only because these years reflect current best estimates and precipitation processing performance summer months are defined as june july august jja and winter months as december january february djf seasonal bias values are calculated as monthly jja and djf averages using eq 1 which are shown in fig 5 a bias patterns during the summer months exhibit more of a random pattern compared to the winter months for 2015 2016 these differences are expected due to the prevalence of more isolated convective rainfall during the summer months and wide spread stratiform and synoptic scale precipitation during the winter months also evident during the 2015 and 2016 winter seasons is widespread mpe over estimation in central and east central regions of the ohrfc forecast area quite possibly due to brightband influences gourley and calvert 2003 cunha et al 2013 martinaitis et al 2015 examine difficulties with verification and calibration of winter time radar derived qpe such as mrms from gauge based observations related to below freezing surface wet bulb temperatures such influences could potentially affect winter time bias estimated in the ohrfc area clear differences are seen between winter and summer season biases for the 2015 2016 period with bias density shown in fig 5 b summer biases are very close to 1 and while the winter season mean bias in not much different from 1 with slight over estimation the spread in bias values is much greater during the winter season compared to summer 2 2 3 monthly variability the analysis of monthly mpe biases using eq 1 is based on monthly accumulations of hourly xmrg hrap gridded fields the bias analysis is restricted to the years 2015 and 2016 which best reflects the current state of mpe measurement accuracy fig 6 shows significant month to month bias variability monthly median biases are very close to unity interquartile 25 75 percentile differences are generally small but large outliers are evident this points to the complex nature of both precipitation processes and difficulty in removing estimation biases at short time scales suggesting continued challenges with correcting estimation biases in real time 2 2 4 hydrologic modeling impacts our central interest is knowing what benefits if any to hydrologic modeling and forecasting is evident from improvements in stage iii and mpe precipitation estimation we address this issue by using hourly stage iii mpe precipitation estimates and hourly temperature data obtained from the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 xia et al 2012a xia et al 2012b as the primary hydrologic model forcings for a continuous hydrologic simulation spanning the stage iii mpe historical period of record 1997 2016 historical simulation to illustrate the benefits gained from precipitation estimation improvements a retrospective hydrologic simulation is made using the noaa nws hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm koren et al 2004 koren 2006 koren et al 2010 the historical simulation spans the full period 1997 2016 of available stage iii mpe nexrad radar derived precipitation estimates rdhm simulations are made for the greenbrier river basin in west virginia shown in fig 1 with the model defined at the hrap grid resolution using an hourly time step the greenbrier river basin defined at alderson wv u s geological survey usgs 05050003 located in the valley and ridge physiographic province of the appalachian mountains has an area of 3533 km2 and ranges in elevation from 466 to 1433 m retrospective rdhm simulations are made without prior calibration to avoid biasing model performance to any model period in this way model results will best reflect precipitation processing improvements implemented at the ohrfc without confounding influences from other factors initial a priori estimation of rdhm sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma burnash et al 1973 burnash 1995 model parameters is described by koren et al 2000 parameter estimation includes 12 sac sma parameters and several channel routing parameters rdhm simulations also include use of the snow 17 snow accumulation and ablation model to account for wintertime precipitation and snowmelt snow 17 model parameters are also estimated and the model is used uncalibrated rdhm model simulations begin june 1 1996 from a cold state that is without prior model state initialization that reflect existing basin conditions using hourly nldas 2 precipitation and temperature model inputs ohrfc stage iii and mpe are used for the full period january 1 1997 to december 31 2016 verification of rdhm simulations is restricted to the january 1998 to december 2016 period to allow sufficient rdhm sac sma model warm up nearly 18 months simulation results using usgs measured discharges and rdhm historical simulation goodness of fit statistics such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge me rmse r 2 mae normalized root mean square error nrmse and percent bias pbias are calculated using eqs 5 14 see appendix a to assess hydrologic modeling improvement based on mpe improvements analyses of the historical flows simulation for the 1998 2016 period compared to usgs measured flows are summarized graphically in fig 7 with the exception of mean absolute error mae which is relatively unchanged at about 25 m 3 s 1 and root mean square error rmse at about 55 m 3 s 1 all other measures indicate improvement between observed and simulated flow values over the 1998 2016 retrospective simulation period improvements in values for mean error me from 30 02 to 6 34 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse from 0 44 to 0 84 kling gupta efficiency kge from 0 01 to 0 82 coefficient of determination r2 from 0 61 to 0 84 and percent bias pbias from 48 60 to 10 00 are notable consequently the results demonstrate that improvements in qpe estimation has lead to significantly improved hydrologic simulations for the greenbrier river basin in the ohrfc area of forecast responsibility a comparison of figs 4 and 7 shows the association of reduced stage iii mpe bias to improved hydrologic simulation goodness of fit statistical measures for individual years also clear is that for years when stage iii mpe biases are greatest hydrologic simulation goodness of fit statistics worsen qpf is another major model forcing used in hydrologic forecasting in section 3 we examine qpf error and the magnitude of hydrologic forecast error in response to qpf uncertainty 3 qpf errors independent qpf verification is not attempted in this study instead we report results from two sources namely the noaa nws weather prediction center and national precipitation verification unit npvu to identify trends in qpf accuracy npvu verification results provide additional verification measures beyond threat score often referred to as critical success index csi and bias available from wpc including mean absolute error root mean square error and correlation coefficient additionally npvu verification results are presented for several different sources including several numerical weather prediction nwp model forecasts and rfcs which serve as a useful baseline for comparison against wpc qpf qpf verification comparing rfc wpc and nwp model results demonstrate added value from forecaster contributions novak et al 2014 report improved wpc qpf performance from 1960 through 2012 for days 1 2 and 3 lead time 24 h 1 in 25 4 mm forecasts methods used for forecaster generation of wpc qpf and comparisons relative to various nwp models are also presented in novak et al 2014 wpc qpf improvement is measured in terms of threat score ts ts a a b c from table 3 wilks 2006 both wpc and npvu report qpf verification statistics for a range of precipitation categories including a maximum of 1 0 in 25 4 mm for npvu and categories of 1 0 in 25 4 mm to 2 0 in 50 8 mm and 2 0 in 50 8 mm for wpc since the authors study is focused on flood producing precipitation events it is argued that 24 h 1 0 in 25 4 mm precipitation threshold is in most instances too low to identify flood producing events consequently the authors believe that an analysis restricted to higher intensity flood producing rainfall events 2 0 in 50 8 mm is warranted and that wpc monthly qpf verification ts data for accumulations 2 0 in 50 8 mm is likely to be more relevant to addressing qpf performance relative to meeting hydrologic flood forecasting needs further justification for the use of 2 0 in 50 8 mm threshold to identify flood producing rainfall events is made on the basis of the association of rainfall frequency and peak runoff frequency that is larson and reich 1972 found that while there was high variability for individual years the rank and recurrence interval of storm rainfall and peak runoff do have a central tendency of equality so by looking at rainfall frequency estimates from the noaa nws hydrometeorological design studies center bonnin et al 2006 in the ohio river valley we find that a 1 yr recurrence 24 h rainfall accumulation generally exceeds 2 0 in 50 8 mm and ranges between 50 8 mm to 76 2 mm about 2 3 inches for a 2 yr recurrence by comparison for shorter duration higher intensity precipitation events the 2 yr 6 h rainfall accumulation is 50 8 mm 2 in in the ohio river valley bankfull conditions the river stage level for incipient flooding for small streams and rivers occur with a 1 5 yr recurrence leopold 1994 while the mean annual flood is defined as a flood with a 2 33 yr recurrence dalrymple 1960 so our analysis of flood producing qpf will be restricted to events with a 24 h qpf threshold of 2 0 in 50 8 mm two important issues are 1 the degree to which errors in operational qpf influence hydrologic prediction and 2 how these influences can be quantified in an attempt to address these concerns results from a hydrologic modeling study are presented noting that 1 we present qpf verification statistics taken from the noaa nws national precipitation verification unit npvu covering the 12 conterminous u s conus rfcs the highest precipitation interval used by npvu is 1 0 in 25 4 mm and is reported here to serve as a relative basis for comparison against the wpc 1 0 in 25 4 mm qpf category range which is available athttp www wpc ncep noaa gov html hpcverif shtml 2 results from monte carlo simulations using the rdhm for the greenbrier river basin wv are presented spanning the june 22 24 2016 flooding episode to assess the range of hydrologic errors in response to expected wpc qpf accuracy 3 threat score ts a commonly used statistical measure of forecast accuracy in meteorology will serve as the basis for evaluating qpf accuracy in the rdhm hydrologic experiments 3 1 wpc monthly mean bias and ts data for precipitation accumulations 2 0 in 50 8 mm obtained from wpc rausch 2016 are summarized in fig 8 for the period 1970 2015 for day 1 and 1991 2015 for day 2 lead times day 2 data were not collected before 1991 by wpc annual averages are also shown based on monthly averaged values the large variability of monthly bias and ts values is evident we note that expected day 1 2 0 in 50 8 mm ts values are about 0 06 in 1970 and 0 22 by 2015 3 2 npvu charba et al 2003 describe a methodology for evaluating qpf forecast accuracy relative to rfc produced stage iii and mpe qpe at wpc rfcs and weather forecast offices wfos compared against national guidance produced by operational nwp models run at the ncep also described is the implementation of the national precipitation verification unit npvu to carry out national qpf verification from the various sources wpc wfos rfcs nwp models npvu qpf verification data was produced for the period 2001 2012 fig 9 shows a time series of npvu monthly a mean absolute error mae and b root mean square error rmse for all noaa nws conus river forecast centers rfc noaa nws nested gridded model ngm north american model nam hydrometeorological prediction center hpc now wpc global forecast system gfs eta model eta and aviation model avn for the period june 2001 to december 2009 the gap in data from late 2003 to mid 2004 was due to an npvu data processing failure several points are notable 1 seasonal variability for all the qpf sources is clear 2 while there are differences between qpf sources there is relatively little discernible mae or rmse improvement over the june 2001 to december 2009 analysis period displayed by any of the qpf sources and 3 errors for the larger intervals 1 0 in 25 4 mm are approximately equal to 1 0 in 25 4 mm for all qpf sources the latter point shows that qpf errors are approximately equal in magnitude to the qpf forcings closest to levels that are most impactful for forecasting flood events fig 10 shows the correlation coefficient r of qpf versus qpe aggregated across the june 2001 to december 2009 npvu analysis period grouped by qpf source and precipitation interval it is evident as reported by charba et al 2003 that forecasters add value over nwp modeled qpf based on hpc wpc and rfc results compared to nwp model results also apparent is that for 24 h accumulations especially for the larger precipitation intervals 1 0 in 25 4 mm qpf is poorly correlated with observed qpe and that there is considerable correlation spread within the precipitation intervals little difference is apparent between hpc and rfc qpf on the basis of r values and spread 3 2 1 implications we can see that deterministic qpf can be quite erroneous based on a range of statistical verification measures demonstrated by both nwp model generated qpf and qpf produced with the aid of forecaster input it has been reported novak et al 2014 correctly that by some statistical measures specifically threat score qpf accuracy has improved since the beginning of systematic record keeping to the present nevertheless the question must be asked what benefits have accrued to hydrologic forecasting from qpf improvements this question is addressed with a hydrologic simulation experiment using the near record greenbrier river basin defined at alderson wv usgs 05050003 flooding event in west virginia june 22 24 2016 the greenbrier river basin was selected for study due to the significance of the june 2016 event its basin area which is large enough to reflect variability in watershed response from spatially variable precipitation forcings and its location within the ohrfc area of responsibility 3 3 hyrdrologic simulation experiments a hydrologic simulation experiment is used to assess how qpf improvements have impacted hydrologic prediction we use the observed rainfall field from the june 2016 event as if it were qpf so that if the qpf were to exactly coincide with the observed precipitation qpf ts would equal 1 0 and the simulated peak flow would match the observed peak flow since the rdhm had been calibrated to this event an underlying assumption is that the observed mpe rainfall perfectly estimates the actual rainfall which is of course unknown simulations take the form of a monte carlo experiment using a storm transposition methodology foufoula georgiou 1989 england et al 2014 wright et al 2014 the aim of the experiment is to illustrate the inadequacy of current deterministic qpf for hydrologic forecasting purposes the experiment first produces 1000 randomly located storm centers relative to the location of the maximum 24 h mpe grid cell precipitation accumulation for the period beginning june 23 2016 0600 utc within the region shown in fig 11 a an example transposed storm is shown in fig 12 which shows that all details of the observed mpe field are retained the june 23 2016 0600 utc to june 24 2016 0600 utc period was selected because this was the greatest mpe precipitation accumulation for a 24 h synoptic period during the flooding event the transposed individual hourly grids of the 24 h mpe precipitation serve as qpf for the rdhm simulations fig 11 b shows the location of the maximum 24 h mpe grid cell precipitation accumulation as well as some of the 1000 randomly transposed storm centers closest to the storm center maximum only precipitation grid cells with mpe accumulations 50 8 mm 2 0 in are shown in fig 11 a and b ts values are calculated for each of the randomly transposed 24 h storms based on precipitation amounts 50 8 mm 2 0 in from these only storms with ts 0 06 are used in the rdhm monte carlo simulations because we are interested in identifying improvement in the prediction of hydrologic peak flows resulting from wpc qpf improvements since 1970 when wpc ts 0 06 at the beginning of wpc verification of precipitation accumulation for amounts 50 8 mm 2 0 in consequently 88 randomly transposed storms shown in figs 11 a and b were identified meeting the ts 0 06 threshold and are used in the rdhm monte carlo simulation experiment the rdhm was initialized from model warm states that is model states generated from the 1996 2016 historical simulation discussed previously however for the purpose of the monte carlo simulation experiment only the rdhm was calibrated using a simple trial and error process for a few key model parameters against u s geological survey observed discharge values for the greenbrier river at alderson wv usgs 05050003 for the june 22 24 2016 event the aim of the rdhm calibration was simply to produce good agreement between observed and simulated peak flows using the observed mpe precipitation for the june 22 24 2016 event not comprehensive model calibration which is an optimization process that would not necessarily produce good agreement between observed and simulated values for this event rdhm model calibration here helps to provide hydrological context for the experimental results relative to usgs observed flows for the june 22 24 2016 event 3 3 1 monte carlo experiment results fig 13 shows the usgs observed flows simulated rdhm flow hydrograph from the calibration and simulated flows from the transposed storms with ts values ranging 0 06 0 15 and 0 15 0 25 these ts ranges were used to identify reasonable ts value ranges 0 06 0 15 and 0 15 0 25 that reflect wpc qpf skill for day 1 50 8 mm 2 0 in precipitation accumulations in 1970 and 2016 respectively by doing this we believe we can assess in relative terms the gain in hydrologic forecast accuracy reflected by improvements in wpc qpf it is evident from the fig 13 simulations that hydrograph peaks are in general greater for storms with ts values ranging 0 15 0 25 than for storms with ts values 0 06 0 15 however none of the simulated hydrographs exceed the major flood level and none approach the observed near record flood peak level moreover there is considerable variability between the simulated hydrographs within the separate 0 06 0 15 and 0 15 0 25 ts categories a better perspective on the problem inherent with using deterministic qpf in hydrologic forecasting is found by looking at simulation results from all 88 storms used in the rdhm monte carlo experiment with ts 0 06 fig 14 shows peak flow and storm ts relative to distance from the reference storm center maximum of the observed 24 h mpe with points identified by color reflecting storm ts value ranges point size indicates the peak flow magnitude the high degree of peak flow variability within ts categories is illustrated in fig 15 which is greatest for the 0 30 0 49 ts interval also quite evident is that smaller distances of the transposed storm from the reference storm center does not guarantee either higher ts values or peak flows in fact the storm with the highest ts and closest to the reference storm center produced a peak flow approximately the same as other transposed storms with significantly lower ts values and at distances much further from the reference storm center the monte carlo experimental results show that a large range in hydrologic prediction errors result from qpf with ts values at current expected wpc ts levels ts 0 22 much greater hydrologic prediction errors are found with ts 0 50 consequently these results suggest that deterministic qpf is far too uncertain to be used in operational flood forecasting the large variability of hydrograph response and peak flow relative to the magnitude of the transposed storm ts values underscores the complex nature of hydrologic response to spatially and temporally variable precipitation forcings as discussed in section 1 previous studies have shown that hydrologic response to differences in the location of heavy cores of observed precipitation within a watershed can produce significantly different peak flows consequently large differences in the prediction of flood peak magnitudes using deterministic qpf should be expected simply due to errors in qpf placement relative to a watershed of interest the consequence of qpf spatial placement errors is reflected in errors in the prediction of hydrograph peaks in the monte carlo experiment this is reflected in the findings by rezacova et al 2009 and mittermaier and roberts 2010 who address the difficulty of qpf verification due to the complex structure of observed precipitation fields due to embedded convection 3 3 2 wpc qpf for the june 23 2016 event as a point of reference we report results from a rdhm simulation using june 23 2016 0600 utc 24 h wpc qpf the simulated peak flow was 143 m 3 s 1 with ts 0 30 for wpc qpf for this event readers are referred to fig 13 for reference importantly no 24 h wpc qpf 50 8 mm 2 0 in for the june 23 2016 0700 utc to june 24 2016 0600 utc period fell within the greenbrier river basin shown in fig 16 the usgs observed peak flow value 2285 2 m 3 s 1 at alderson wv occurred june 24 2016 0930 utc the ohrfc forecast from june 23 2016 1423 utc was 180 7 m 3 s 1 corresponding to a peak river stage 5 70 feet 1 74 m which was forecasted to occur june 24 2016 0600 utc corrigan 2016 4 summary and conclusions results presented demonstrate that 1 noaa nws next generation radar nexrad derived qpe has improved dramatically from 1997 present for the ohrfc area which is reflected in significantly improved hydrologic simulations over the 1997 2016 hindcast period and that 2 from the perspective of meeting the needs of hydrologic forecasting qpf improvements have been marginal over the same period the monte carlo hydrologic simulation experiment illustrates the sensitivity of hydrologic forecasts to qpf errors resulting in large peak flow differences within narrow ranges of qpf ts differences results from these experiments show that greater qpf ts values do not necessarily produce improved hydrologic forecasts and that considerable variability in hydrologic response should be expected with qpf ts values the same or nearly so independent of antecedent basin conditions improved hydrologic simulations resulting from qpe improvements are important in several ways first in large part hydrologic forecasts are improved with better qpe because of the ability to accurately translate observed precipitation into watershed response through modeling second improved qpe improves model states that better reflect current basin conditions which reduces the need for an external data assimilation process for model state updating furthermore the need for real time ad hoc forecaster adjustments is reduced which reduces hydrologic forecaster workloads to make model adjustments and decreases the possibility that model adjustments could be made for inappropriate reasons that is an observed difference between simulated and observed flows stage could simply reflect random model error and not indicate divergence between model states and actual basin conditions thus not warranting curve fiiting changes to hydrologic model states finally for well calibrated models improved qpe provides greater confidence in the initial model states needed for probabilistic hydrologic forecast systems cloke and pappenberger 2009 that run automatically without direct forecaster intervention there are some indications of improved qpf accuracy shown by wpc with increased threat score values from 1970 present however wpc qpf bias statistics do not show improvement in addition for a variety of qpf sources npvu verification statistics do not reveal discernible improvement for the 2001 2009 analysis period the rdhm monte carlo experiments demonstrated significant uncertainty in hydrologic response at current expected wpc qpf threat score levels importantly significant uncertainty with deterministic qpf has been widely shown to be problematic damrath et al 2000 ebert 2001 im et al 2006 diomede et al 2008 cuo et al 2011 mascaro et al 2010 illustrate the need for reliable ensemble qpfs in the context of ensemble streamflow forecasting the central problem with deterministic qpf is that in principle the placement timing and magnitude of qpf should all be reasonable estimates for each of the basins shown for example in fig 1 the rdhm monte carlo hydrologic experiment demonstrates how far current deterministic qpf is from consistently providing the needed skill in hydrologic forecasting it is only for much larger basins where qpf errors are sufficiently masked by spatial and temporal averaging that deterministic qpf has sufficient skill to have value in hydrologic forecasting the problem is significantly more difficult for flash floods with affected areas that are considerably smaller than the ohrfc subbasins shown in fig 1 suggesting limits to predictability in real time hydrologic forecasting namely figs 14 and 15 for the greenbrier river basin which is comprised of 5 subbasins shown in fig 1 illustrate that large hydrologic prediction uncertainty can occur with the use of qpf over medium size watersheds even when qpf threat score levels are high moreover as fig 16 shows wpc qpf entirely missed the placement of 50 8 mm 2 0 in rainfall within the greenbrier river basin for the june 23 2016 0700 utc to june 24 2016 0600 utc period where near record setting flooding occurred this level of qpf error is not at all uncommon as wpc and npvu verification statistics demonstrate fig 17 showing a histogram of ohrfc subbasin areas identifies the magnitude of the qpf problem in terms of accurate spatial placement of qpf where the mean ohrfc subbasin area is 613 5 km 2 and median is 476 1 km 2 which are considerably smaller than the greenbrier river basin 3533 km2 hydrologic prediction for small basin areas makes the problem with qpf accuracy altogether more acute and points to the need for using hydrologic prediction methods that explicitly address the uncertainty in model forcing predictions companion research to the current study by adams and dymond 2019 investigates limits to the operational use of deterministic wpc qpf especially as it relates to flood forecasting utilizing real time operational experiments the authors find that for flood forecasting purposes qpf durations should not exceed about 12 h errors in hydrologic flood forecasts utilizing qpf beyond a 12 h duration grow rapidly a major source of the real time qpf based hydrologic prediction errors found by adams and dymond 2019 is identified in this study namely the spatial placement of qpf as indicated by ts values significant research and development activity cloke and pappenberger 2009 adams and ostrowski 2010 demargne et al 2014 in the hydrologic community has been directed at the implementation of probabilistic ensemble hydrologic forecast systems with a principal aim to quantify the uncertainties inherent in hydrological forecasting including uncertainties associated with model forcings in particular qpf uncertainties consequently the authors strongly encourage abandoning the use of deterministic qpf in hydrologic forecasting in favor of probabilistic ensemble methods declaration of

6024,bed absorption and vegetation in natural wetlands exert considerable influence on contaminant transport a three scale perturbation method is extended in this work to present an exact analytical solution for the spatial concentration distributions affected by vegetation distribution and bed absorption compared with concentration moments based analytical methods that were adopted previously to solve vertical concentration distribution in wetland flows the multi scale method used in this study is more concise without complicate integrated operations the analytical solution is explicit and applicable without complicated integral form moreover by comparing with the analytical solution obtained by the moments method the analytical solution given in this work is accurate particularly after the initial stage this study focuses on a large time scale in investigating spatial concentration distribution results show that concentration distribution is not uniform in the vertical direction hence this study recommends the accurate two dimensional spatial distribution rather than the cross section averaged concentration distribution to achieve accurate concentration predictions keywords wetland dispersion bed absorption vertical concentration distribution 1 introduction wetlands provide many services in the ecosystem including wild life protection coastal protection flood mitigation and wastewater treatment mitra et al 2005 kivaisi 2001 vymazal 2011 moreover wetlands offer a natural environment for storage of atmospheric carbon mitsch et al 2013 which would help mitigate the global climate change however wetland habitats are threatened by pollution issues thus analysis of contaminant transport in wetland flows is essential to ecological risk assessment sewage treatment ecological restoration fischer 1972 1973 costanza et al 1989 1997 us epa 1999 nepf 2012 shao et al 2014 wang and huai 2018 wang et al 2018 physical chemical and biological processes significantly influence solute transport in natural wetland flows fereidouni et al 2009 chiban et al 2011 mburu et al 2013 and the process of contaminant transport in wetland flows becomes complicated with vegetation shear and bed absorption previous studies over environmental dispersion in wetland flows mostly focused on mean longitudinal concentration distributions with averaged vertical cross sections rather than on accurate spatial concentration distributions however spatial concentration distribution is essential to analyzing the contaminant transport process because great variations can exist in vertical cross sections wang et al 2018 wang and chen 2017a as a result of ecological factors such as vegetation shear and bed absorption sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 wang and chen 2017a b barik and dalal 2018 the existence of vegetation in wetland flows changes the flow velocity profile and thus the concentration distribution is changed indirectly by aquatic vegetation in wetlands nepf 1999 shucksmith et al 2010 lightbody and nepf 2006 additionally the preserved bed absorption depletes the quantity of solute therefore the concentration distribution is more concentrated around the free surface region than in the bottom layer and the rate of bed absorption can affect the dispersion coefficient and alter the process of contaminant transport wang and chen 2017b given vegetation shear and bed absorption the variations of concentration distributions within vertical cross sections are significant in the transport process and accurate solute concentrations at exact vertical positions should be evaluated hence this work extends the study of vertical concentration at accurate vertical positions in wetland flows according to taylor s theory of dispersion 1953 several experimental methods and analytical methods have been employed to study environmental dispersion distributions field tests have been conducted to explore the dispersion in wetland flows with submerged vegetation and emergent vegetation lightbody and nepf 2006 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 nepf 2012 several analytical methods have been applied to study the dispersion problem on the basis of the moments method aris 1956 1960 zeng et al 2012 studied the vertically averaged concentration distribution in wetland flows with wind chen and wu 2012 divided a wetland into multiple layers according to heterogeneity in the vertical direction to study the vertically averaged concentration distributions within different layers by employing gill s concentration expansions gill 1967 gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 wang et al 2013 studied environmental dispersion in three layer wetland flows and obtained the vertically averaged concentration distributions within different layers wang and chen 2016b combined the aris moments method and gill s expansion method to study the transverse concentration distribution in lamina flow within a tube jiang et al 2017 used this method to study accurate vertical concentration distributions in wetland flows wang and chen 2016a extend the aris moments method with hermite polynomials to study concentration distributions with bed absorption with the method focused on the initial timescale however the initial timescale is unnecessary as the studied vertical cross section is far from the position of the source with the aid of multi scale theory proposed by mei et al 1996 wu et al 2011 analyzed the transversely averaged mean concentration wang et al 2015 divided the wetland into three zones to study the velocity profile and transversely averaged concentration distribution within different zones given that vertical concentration becomes non uniform with bed absorption and vegetation distribution the vertically averaged concentration is never accurate to obtain the accurate spatial concentration distribution in vertical and streamwise directions including both upstream and downstream directions from the source of contaminant the current study extends the three scale perturbation analysis by deriving the solution of concentration at different scales and each scale solution is solved by determining the coefficient polynomials ahead different orders of solution without complex integrated operations the extended method in this work is simpler than the concentration moments method and aris gill method wang and chen 2017a adopted in previous work to study the precise vertical concentration distributions in wetland flows moreover the accurate analytical solution of spatial concentration distribution in this work is an explicit expression that is easy to implement without integral forms and the current study focuses on the analysis of vertical and longitudinal concentration distributions at subsequent timescales after the initial transient process of solute dispersion τ 1 what s more this work could provide suggestions for reducing pollution by using constructed wetland with irreversible bed absorption considering an instantaneous and uniform release of pollutants at a cross section x 0 this study analyzes the spatial concentration distributions in the vertical and streamwise directions in typical wetland flows with bed absorption the specific objectives are as follows i to extend a three scale perturbation model for studying the contaminant transport process in wetland flows with bed absorption ii to derive the analytical expression for spatial concentration distribution iii to obtain the spatial concentration distributions in vertical and streamwise directions and iv to discuss the effects of vegetation density and bed absorption on dispersivity 2 method 2 1 formulation for contaminant transport process the contaminant transport process is more complicated in wetland flows than in open channel flows due to the vegetation occupied in the flow channel this work focuses on the analytical exploration of hydrodynamics of solute transport in wetlands therefore the vegetation is treated as porous media which contributes to inhomogeneity in wetland flows battiato 2012 wang and zeng 2019 the treatment of porous media gets rid of the vegetation specific details in the solute transport process and it is generally applicable to wetlands of various vegetation types considering the porous characteristic of wetland flows this study adopts phase average scale theory to obtain the equation of mass transport phase averaging is a technique for smearing out the discontinuity between the two phases of water and vegetation thus derives a continuum equation for superficial water flow and superficial mass transport in the entire domain of the wetland it has been extensively used to illustrate the superficial contaminant transport process in various types of wetland flows wang et al 2013 2018 zeng et al 2011 wu et al 2015 wang and chen 2015 2017a luo et al 2016 the basic equation of contaminant transport is defined as liu and masliyah 2005 zeng et al 2011 1 ϕ c t u c κ λ ϕ

dispersivity tensor u is the velocity m s 1 and λ m2 s 1 is the molecular diffusivity regarding to different wetland locations the soil conditions would be various due to the different climate i e the highly leached soil condition near the tropical area and lacustrine soil within surajpur wetland champion and seth 1968 ansari 2015 as a result the value of porosity would be various when considering the different soil types the various wetland topography existing in nature i e plain hilly ground and valleys would lead to different slopes and complicated bed conditions champion and seth 1968 however the complicated topography condition hinders the analytical research on contaminant transport in wetland flows to theoretically explore the hydrodynamics of solute transport in wetlands and give the fundamental information some reasonable simplifications are applied to the natural wetlands it is supposed that the vegetation is homogeneously distributed and the bed topography is flat with constant depth the physical parameters in the concerned area remain unchanged and the flow is fully developed this idealized wetland configuration is adopted in the present work for possible analytical exploration from the concept of taylor dispersion and it has also been widely adopted in a series of previous works on the solute transport in wetlands wang and zeng 2019 wang and chen 2017a wu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 luo et al 2016 the sketch for a free surface wetland flow is depicted in fig 1 where h is the depth of the channel and the direction of flow velocity is along the x

apply the function of first order irreversible absorption in characterizing the absorption process at the bed the first order absorption is a ubiquitous reaction happening in the natural wetlands being applicable to various soil conditions it is also widely adopted in works of solute transport in open channel flow and wetland flow wang and chen 2016a 2017a wang and zeng 2019 the result is as follows 4 κ λ k ϕ c z z 0 β c x 0 t where β is the bed absorption parameter the non penetrative condition at the free surface is 5 c z z h 0 considering the finite amount of contaminant released we obtain the upstream and downstream conditions as 6 c x z t x 0 the governing equation can be rewritten in dimensionless coordinates as 7 c τ ε ψ p e c x ε 2 2 c x 2 2 c z 2 0 z 1 where x x l z z h τ κ

vegetation intensity and types on the flow wang and chen 2017a and is written as 8 α μ f h 2 κ μ l v where f is viscous friction and μ is the vegetation viscosity here the vegetation effect on contaminant transport within wetland flows is assumed to be homogeneous at phase average scale to study environmental dispersion in wetland flows as considering the wetland as a porous media the phase averaging operation smears out the discontinuity between vegetation and flow at phase average scale in wetland flows therefore the effect of vegetation type within the wetland model should be neglected the dimensionless velocity is given by previous work wu et al 2015 9 ψ α 1 cosh α z 1 sech α α tanh α the boundary conditions are converted into 10 c z z 0 ε β c 11 c z z 1 0 2 2 multi scale

rewritten as 15 τ τ 0 ε τ 1 ε 2 τ 2 by substituting eqs 12 and 14 into eqs 7 10 and 11 the equation and boundary conditions can be obtained as 16 c 0 τ 0 2 c 0 z 2 ε c 1 τ 0 c 0 τ 1 p e ψ c 0 x 2 c 1

defined as 19 c 0 τ 0 2 c 0 z 2 0 z 1 20 c 0 z z 0 c 0 z z 1 0 then the general solution of eq 19 is obtained as follows 21 c 0 c 00 x τ 1 τ 2 n 1 re c 0 n x τ 1 τ 2 e n π z i e n 2 π 2 τ 0 considering that a wetland channel is assumed to be shallow we accomplish vertical dispersivity on the basis of the first timescale the concentration distribution exponentially decreases with an increase in τ 0 as expressed in eq 21 thus the series part becomes insignificant as τ 0 is sufficiently large the solution of concentration distribution can be simplified as 22 c 0 c 00 x τ 1 τ 2 for the first order o ε in accordance with eqs 16 18 we can express the equation as 23 c 0 τ 1 c 1 τ 0 ψ p e c 0 x 2 c 0 z 2 0 z 1 24 c 1 z z 0 β c 0 0 25 c 1 z z 1 0 considering that timescale τ 0 is

simpler than that given by wang and chen 2017a therefore the solution is improved and easy to apply to validate the extended method and verify the accuracy of the analytical solution obtained in this work we compare the results of the mean concentration distributions with those of wang and chen 2017a in fig 2 the mean concentration distributions in the present work agrees well with those of wang and chen 2017a obtained using the method of concentration moments hence the difference between our work and that of wang and chen 2017a is minimal at τ 0 5 the two results are nearly identical when τ 1 indicating that the analytical solution obtained by the proposed method is precise for the predicting concentration distributions at large timescales τ 1 in fig 3 the mean concentration distributions under different conditions are presented the maximum concentration distributions tend to be decline with time and the concentration dispersivity is inhibited with a large α because the maximum concentration distribution increases as a result of the dense vegetation distribution that restrains the contaminant transport in wetland flows by comparing mean concentration distributions with different intensity of bed absorption the curve of mean concentration distributions becomes flatter with the increasing intensity of bed absorption β thus the bed absorption reduces the global concentration remarkably indicating that the constructed wetland with irreversible bed absorption can help reducing contaminant effectively 3 1 two dimensional concentration distribution 3 1 1 analysis of longitudinal concentration distribution the 2d concentration distribution is affected by vegetation distribution and bed absorption intensity and it varies in the evolution process therefore the streamwise concentration distribution vertical concentration distribution and 2d concentration distribution are presented under different conditions the longitudinal concentration distributions at the bed layer central surface and free surface of the wetland are illustrated in fig 4 for comparison with the depth averaged concentration distribution regarding to vegetation effect on contaminant transport various vegetation types within wetland area at different locations i e wooded grass land and tropical seasonal swamp forests are characterized around kabartal wetland ambastha et al 2007 tropical dry deciduous type vegetation are characterized within surajpur wetland ansari 2015 etc and vegetation intensity should be referred in this work the effect of vegetation intensity is focused for contaminant transport analysis with the phase average assumption in wetland flows with the effect of aquatic vegetation such as stems of emergent plants submerged plants and phytoplankton the graph shows that maximums of concentration distribution at the wetland surface are larger than those at the bottom of the wetland and concentration distributions at all three layers would be more heterogeneous with a larger vegetation density because the vegetation shear can suppress contaminant transport apart from the asymmetric distribution the concentration curve at the bed layer deflects toward the upstream the reason lies in the fact that the contaminant cloud near the bed moves at a slow velocity due to the flow velocity profile in which is dominated by the diffusion effect bed absorption further depletes the contaminant leading to a flatter concentration distribution curve at the bed layer than that at the free surface on the contrary the concentration curve at the free surface appears with a high peak concentration mainly due to the strong advection additionally strong bed absorption depletes more contaminant and thus results in flat concentration distributions with low peak values the results also show that the concentration distributions at the central layer ζ 0 5 are nearly symmetric and identical to the mean concentration distributions with various bed absorption effects and different densities of vegetation distribution we should note that the concentration distributions at different depths deviate much from the mean particularly with the strong effect of bed absorption this outcome further implies that the two dimensional concentration distribution rather than the mean should be used as basis to accurately evaluate the effect of bed absorption 3 1 2 analysis of vertical concentration distribution the vertical concentration distribution is discussed under the effect of vegetation density and bed absorption at two typical cross sections x p e 0 1 and x p e 0 1 fig 5 illustrates the vertical concentration distributions with different densities of vegetation distribution the concentration increases with the increment in vegetation density at the two cross sections similar to the vertical concentration distribution in a pure open channel flow the tendency of curves at the upstream cross section x p e 0 1 and downstream cross section x p e 0 1 appear to be different due to the different flow advection the pollutant would accumulate downstream at the surface layer as a result of advection however the maximum vertical concentration distribution is near the bed layer in the upstream as a result that the dispersivity is dominated by molecular diffusion near the bed because the velocity in this area is almost zero the bed absorption effect on vertical concentration distribution is demonstrated in fig 6 the graph indicates that the increase of bed absorption would lead the decrease of vertical concentration distribution at both upstream and downstream cross sections since the total mass of concentration decreases with increase intensity of bed absorption moreover the variation of concentration distributions between the bed and surface concentrations becomes small with the increment in bed absorption capacity the graph shows that the downstream variation in vertical concentration distribution with the effect of bed absorption is greater than that in upstream flows the map of concentration distribution at a certain cross section x 0 is illustrated in fig 7 to show the effect of bed absorption on vertical concentration distribution as shown in the fig 7 the total concentration distribution would decrease with bed absorption intensity and the concentration can even be almost zero near the bottom of wetland due to the large bed absorption intensity β 1 0 the vertical concentrations at different cross sections in the upstream and downstream flows under a certain condition α 1 0 β 0 5 τ 2 are presented in fig 8 the concentration at the upstream cross section initially increases and then decreases and it becomes increasingly low as the distance from the central cross section increases meanwhile the tendency of concentration distribution at the downstream cross section is shown to be different that is the vertical concentration distributions all increase from the bed layer to the free surface by comparing the differences between the variations of vertical concentrations in the upstream and downstream flows we find that the vertical concentration distribution in upstream flows is more uniform than that in downstream flows to clearly illustrate the vertical concentration variation we use an indicator r representing the maximum concentration variation in the cross section against the concentration at the centroid bed in analyzing the variation rate in vertical concentrations r x τ max 0 z 1 c x z τ min 0 z 1 c x z τ c x z τ 100 fig 9 illustrates the vertical concentration variation rate of the longitudinal concentration distribution in fig 9 a the curve is symmetric with the centroid without bed absorption and the variation rate is asymmetric with the effect of bed absorption furthermore the maximum variation rate becomes large with the increase in bed absorption capacity the variation becomes large at the downstream thereby demonstrating that the solute concentration distribution is irregular in the downstream flows in fig 9 b the maximum variation rates are nearly the same with different vegetation densities however the maximum variation becomes close to the centroid of a contaminant cloud with the increase in vegetation density thus indicating that the existence of vegetation can restrain contaminant transport in fig 9 c the variation rate becomes small with time and the curve of maximum variation extends with time 3 1 3 analysis of 2d concentration distribution fig 10 intuitively illustrates the 2d concentration distribution with different α and β at typical times the concentration decreases remarkably over time due to the effect of bed absorption and this depletion effect becomes obvious with strong bed absorption the effect of α i e the vegetation density of the wetland on the contaminant dispersion process is observed such effect demonstrates the increasingly non uniform concentration distribution in wetland flows with high vegetation density as analyzed above in addition the contours of the 2d concentration cloud suggest downstream deflected vertical concentration distributions mainly due to the non uniform flow velocity profile 4 conclusion in this work a multi scale method is extended to investigate the environmental dispersion in wetland flows under the effect of bed absorption this method provides an easy way to analyze the contaminant transport process by focusing on large timescales after the initial stage τ 1 without complicated integral terms the analytical solution of the spatial concentration distribution obtained by this method is simpler and more applicable than those given by previous works moreover the accuracy of the concentration distribution is satisfied after the initial transient process the accurate solution of 2d concentration distributions is ultimately achieved moreover the mean concentration distributions focused on by previous studies and the accurate vertical concentration distributions are analyzed the 2d concentration distribution is assessed by analyzing the longitudinal concentration distribution at different depths of wetland flows and accurate vertical concentration distribution at certain cross sections the longitudinal concentration distributions are asymmetric and become downstream deflected due to the non uniform flow velocity profile the vertical concentration distributions present different tendencies at the upstream and downstream cross sections due to different advection effects the vertical concentration distribution occurs near the bed at the upstream cross sections however the condition is different with regard to the downstream cross sections that is the vertical concentration increases from the bottom to the surface at the downstream cross sections the 2d analysis provides the entire contaminant transport process the effects of vegetation and bed absorption on spatial concentration distributions are discussed in this work the results indicate that vegetation shear leads to non uniformity in vertical concentration distributions the bed absorption causes a depletion of the solute concentration and as a result a large capacity of bed absorption leads to a flat concentration distribution because only homogeneous distribution of vegetation and instantaneous discharge of pollution are considered in this work and conditions would be more complicated in nature in future work the heterogeneity of vegetation distribution various vegetation types and different contaminant discharge methods would be considered in analysis of contaminant concentration distribution in wetland flows with bed absorption in addition the various locations of natural wetland can lead to diverse topography and soil conditions due to different local climate however physical parameters of natural wetlands are hard to be determined therefore in order to study the effect of complex topography on contaminant transport within specific natural wetland flows detailed physical parameters and classifications of natural wetland flows should be discussed in following

6024,bed absorption and vegetation in natural wetlands exert considerable influence on contaminant transport a three scale perturbation method is extended in this work to present an exact analytical

the initial stage this study focuses on a large time scale in investigating spatial concentration distribution results show that concentration distribution is not uniform in the vertical direction

nepf 1999 shucksmith et al 2010 lightbody and nepf 2006 additionally the preserved bed absorption depletes the quantity of solute therefore the concentration distribution is more concentrated around

the method focused on the initial timescale however the initial timescale is unnecessary as the studied vertical cross section is far from the position of the source with the aid of multi scale theory proposed by mei et al 1996 wu et al 2011 analyzed the transversely averaged mean concentration wang et al 2015 divided the wetland into three zones to study the velocity profile and transversely averaged concentration distribution within different zones given that vertical concentration becomes non uniform with bed absorption and vegetation distribution the vertically averaged concentration is never accurate to obtain the accurate spatial concentration distribution in vertical and streamwise directions including both upstream and downstream directions from the source of contaminant the current study extends the three scale perturbation analysis by deriving the solution of concentration at different scales and each scale solution is solved by determining the coefficient polynomials ahead different orders of solution without complex integrated operations the extended method in this work is simpler than the concentration moments method and aris gill method wang and chen 2017a adopted in previous work to study the precise vertical concentration distributions in wetland flows moreover the accurate analytical solution of spatial concentration distribution in this work is an explicit expression that is easy to implement without integral forms and the current study focuses on the analysis of vertical and longitudinal concentration distributions at subsequent timescales after the initial transient process of solute dispersion τ 1 what s more this work could provide suggestions for reducing pollution by using constructed wetland with irreversible bed absorption considering an instantaneous and uniform release of pollutants at a cross section x 0 this study analyzes the spatial concentration distributions in the vertical and streamwise directions in typical wetland flows with bed absorption the specific objectives are as follows i to extend a three scale perturbation model for studying the contaminant transport process in wetland flows with bed absorption ii to derive the analytical expression for spatial concentration distribution iii to obtain the spatial concentration distributions in vertical and streamwise directions and iv to discuss the effects of vegetation density and bed absorption on dispersivity 2 method 2 1 formulation for contaminant transport process the contaminant transport process is more complicated in wetland flows than in open channel flows due to the vegetation occupied in the flow channel this work focuses on the analytical exploration of hydrodynamics of solute transport in wetlands therefore the vegetation is treated as porous media which contributes to inhomogeneity in wetland flows battiato 2012 wang and zeng 2019 the treatment of porous media gets rid of the vegetation specific details in the solute transport process and it is generally applicable to wetlands of various vegetation types considering the porous characteristic of wetland flows this study adopts phase average scale theory to obtain the equation of mass transport phase averaging is a technique for smearing out the discontinuity between the two phases of water and vegetation thus derives a continuum equation for superficial water flow and superficial mass transport in the entire domain of the wetland it has been extensively used to illustrate the superficial contaminant transport process in various types of wetland flows wang et al 2013 2018 zeng et al 2011 wu et al 2015 wang and chen 2015 2017a luo et al 2016 the basic equation of contaminant transport is defined as liu and masliyah 2005 zeng et al 2011 1 ϕ c t u c κ λ ϕ

dispersivity tensor u is the velocity m s 1 and λ m2 s 1 is the molecular diffusivity regarding to different wetland locations the soil conditions would be various due to the different climate i e the highly leached soil condition near the tropical area and lacustrine soil within surajpur wetland champion and seth 1968 ansari 2015 as a result the value of porosity would be various when considering the different soil types the various wetland topography existing in nature i e plain hilly ground and valleys would lead to different slopes and complicated bed conditions champion and seth 1968 however the complicated topography condition hinders the analytical research on contaminant transport in wetland flows to theoretically explore the hydrodynamics of solute transport in wetlands and give the fundamental information some reasonable simplifications are applied to the natural wetlands it is supposed that the vegetation is homogeneously distributed and the bed topography is flat with constant depth the physical parameters in the concerned area remain unchanged and the flow is fully developed this idealized wetland configuration is adopted in the present work for possible analytical exploration from the concept of taylor dispersion and it has also been widely adopted in a series of previous works on the solute transport in wetlands wang and zeng 2019 wang and chen 2017a wu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 luo et al 2016 the sketch for a free surface wetland flow is depicted in fig 1 where h is the depth of the channel and the direction of flow velocity is along the x

apply the function of first order irreversible absorption in characterizing the absorption process at the bed the first order absorption is a ubiquitous reaction happening in the natural wetlands being applicable to various soil conditions it is also widely adopted in works of solute transport in open channel flow and wetland flow wang and chen 2016a 2017a wang and zeng 2019 the result is as follows 4 κ λ k ϕ c z z 0 β c x 0 t where β is the bed absorption parameter the non penetrative condition at the free surface is 5 c z z h 0 considering the finite amount of contaminant released we obtain the upstream and downstream conditions as 6 c x z t x 0 the governing equation can be rewritten in dimensionless coordinates as 7 c τ ε ψ p e c x ε 2 2 c x 2 2 c z 2 0 z 1 where x x l z z h τ κ

vegetation intensity and types on the flow wang and chen 2017a and is written as 8 α μ f h 2 κ μ l v where f is viscous friction and μ is the vegetation viscosity here the vegetation effect on contaminant transport within wetland flows is assumed to be homogeneous at phase average scale to study environmental dispersion in wetland flows as considering the wetland as a porous media the phase averaging operation smears out the discontinuity between vegetation and flow at phase average scale in wetland flows therefore the effect of vegetation type within the wetland model should be neglected the dimensionless velocity is given by previous work wu et al 2015 9 ψ α 1 cosh α z 1 sech α α tanh α the boundary conditions are converted into 10 c z z 0 ε β c 11 c z z 1 0 2 2 multi scale

transport process are given as 13 t 0 t 1 t 2 1 1 ε 1 ε 2 where t 0 h 2 κ λ k ϕ is the diffusion time through the depth of the wetland t 1 l u is the advection time and t 3 l 2 κ λ k ϕ is the diffusion time through the characteristic length on the basis of these timescales three time variables can be obtained as 14 τ 0 τ τ 1 ε τ τ 2 ε 2 τ the time derivative based on a chain rule can be rewritten as 15 τ τ 0 ε τ 1 ε 2 τ 2 by substituting eqs 12 and 14 into eqs 7 10 and 11 the equation and boundary conditions can be obtained as 16 c 0 τ 0 2 c 0 z 2 ε c 1 τ 0 c 0 τ 1 p e ψ c 0 x 2 c 1

defined as 19 c 0 τ 0 2 c 0 z 2 0 z 1 20 c 0 z z 0 c 0 z z 1 0 then the general solution of eq 19 is obtained as follows 21 c 0 c 00 x τ 1 τ 2 n 1 re c 0 n x τ 1 τ 2 e n π z i e n 2 π 2 τ 0 considering that a wetland channel is assumed to be shallow we accomplish vertical dispersivity on the basis of the first timescale the concentration distribution exponentially decreases with an increase in τ 0 as expressed in eq 21 thus the series part becomes insignificant as τ 0 is sufficiently large the solution of concentration distribution can be simplified as 22 c 0 c 00 x τ 1 τ 2 for the first order o ε in accordance with eqs 16 18 we can express the equation as 23 c 0 τ 1 c 1 τ 0 ψ p e c 0 x 2 c 0 z 2 0 z 1 24 c 1 z z 0 β c 0 0 25 c 1 z z 1 0 considering that timescale τ 0 is

simpler than that given by wang and chen 2017a therefore the solution is improved and easy to apply to validate the extended method and verify the accuracy of the analytical solution obtained in this work we compare the results of the mean concentration distributions with those of wang and chen 2017a in fig 2 the mean concentration distributions in the present work agrees well with those of wang and chen 2017a obtained using the method of concentration moments hence the difference between our work and that of wang and chen 2017a is minimal at τ 0 5 the two results are nearly identical when τ 1 indicating that the analytical solution obtained by the proposed method is precise for the predicting concentration distributions at large timescales τ 1 in fig 3 the mean concentration distributions under different conditions are presented the maximum concentration distributions tend to be decline with time and the concentration dispersivity is inhibited with a large α because the maximum concentration distribution increases as a result of the dense vegetation distribution that restrains the contaminant transport in wetland flows by comparing mean concentration distributions with different intensity of bed absorption the curve of mean concentration distributions becomes flatter with the increasing intensity of bed absorption β thus the bed absorption reduces the global concentration remarkably indicating that the constructed wetland with irreversible bed absorption can help reducing contaminant effectively 3 1 two dimensional concentration distribution 3 1 1 analysis of longitudinal concentration distribution the 2d concentration distribution is affected by vegetation distribution and bed absorption intensity and it varies in the evolution process therefore the streamwise concentration distribution vertical concentration distribution and 2d concentration distribution are presented under different conditions the longitudinal concentration distributions at the bed layer central surface and free surface of the wetland are illustrated in fig 4 for comparison with the depth averaged concentration distribution regarding to vegetation effect on contaminant transport various vegetation types within wetland area at different locations i e wooded grass land and tropical seasonal swamp forests are characterized around kabartal wetland ambastha et al 2007 tropical dry deciduous type vegetation are characterized within surajpur wetland ansari 2015 etc and vegetation intensity should be referred in this work the effect of vegetation intensity is focused for contaminant transport analysis with the phase average assumption in wetland flows with the effect of aquatic vegetation such as stems of emergent plants submerged plants and phytoplankton the graph shows that maximums of concentration distribution at the wetland surface are larger than those at the bottom of the wetland and concentration distributions at all three layers would be more heterogeneous with a larger vegetation density because the vegetation shear can suppress contaminant transport apart from the asymmetric distribution the concentration curve at the bed layer deflects toward the upstream the reason lies in the fact that the contaminant cloud near the bed moves at a slow velocity due to the flow velocity profile in which is dominated by the diffusion effect bed absorption further depletes the contaminant leading to a flatter concentration distribution curve at the bed layer than that at the free surface on the contrary the concentration curve at the free surface appears with a high peak concentration mainly due to the strong advection additionally strong bed absorption depletes more contaminant and thus results in flat concentration distributions with low peak values the results also show that the concentration distributions at the central layer ζ 0 5 are nearly symmetric and identical to the mean concentration distributions with various bed absorption effects and different densities of vegetation distribution we should note that the concentration distributions at different depths deviate much from the mean particularly with the strong effect of bed absorption this outcome further implies that the two dimensional concentration distribution rather than the mean should be used as basis to accurately evaluate the effect of bed absorption 3 1 2 analysis of vertical concentration distribution the vertical concentration distribution is discussed under the effect of vegetation density and bed absorption at two typical cross sections x p e 0 1 and x p e 0 1 fig 5 illustrates the vertical concentration distributions with different densities of vegetation distribution the concentration increases with the increment in vegetation density at the two cross sections similar to the vertical concentration distribution in a pure open channel flow the tendency of curves at the upstream cross section x p e 0 1 and downstream cross section x p e 0 1 appear to be different due to the different flow advection the pollutant would accumulate downstream at the surface layer as a result of advection however the maximum vertical concentration distribution is near the bed layer in the upstream as a result that the dispersivity is dominated by molecular diffusion near the bed because the velocity in this area is almost zero the bed absorption effect on vertical concentration distribution is demonstrated in fig 6 the graph indicates that the increase of bed absorption would lead the decrease of vertical concentration distribution at both upstream and downstream cross sections since the total mass of concentration decreases with increase intensity of bed absorption moreover the variation of concentration distributions between the bed and surface concentrations becomes small with the increment in bed absorption capacity the graph shows that the downstream variation in vertical concentration distribution with the effect of bed absorption is greater than that in upstream flows the map of concentration distribution at a certain cross section x 0 is illustrated in fig 7 to show the effect of bed absorption on vertical concentration distribution as shown in the fig 7 the total concentration distribution would decrease with bed absorption intensity and the concentration can even be almost zero near the bottom of wetland due to the large bed absorption intensity β 1 0 the vertical concentrations at different cross sections in the upstream and downstream flows under a certain condition α 1 0 β 0 5 τ 2 are presented in fig 8 the concentration at the upstream cross section initially increases and then decreases and it becomes increasingly low as the distance from the central cross section increases meanwhile the tendency of concentration distribution at the downstream cross section is shown to be different that is the vertical concentration distributions all increase from the bed layer to the free surface by comparing the differences between the variations of vertical concentrations in the upstream and downstream flows we find that the vertical concentration distribution in upstream flows is more uniform than that in downstream flows to clearly illustrate the vertical concentration variation we use an indicator r representing the maximum concentration variation in the cross section against the concentration at the centroid bed in analyzing the variation rate in vertical concentrations r x τ max 0 z 1 c x z τ min 0 z 1 c x z τ c x z τ 100 fig 9 illustrates the vertical concentration variation rate of the longitudinal concentration distribution in fig 9 a the curve is symmetric with the centroid without bed absorption and the variation rate is asymmetric with the effect of bed absorption furthermore the maximum variation rate becomes large with the increase in bed absorption capacity the variation becomes large at the downstream thereby demonstrating that the solute concentration distribution is irregular in the downstream flows in fig 9 b the maximum variation rates are nearly the same with different vegetation densities however the maximum variation becomes close to the centroid of a contaminant cloud with the increase in vegetation density thus indicating that the existence of vegetation can restrain contaminant transport in fig 9 c the variation rate becomes small with time and the curve of maximum variation extends with time 3 1 3 analysis of 2d concentration distribution fig 10 intuitively illustrates the 2d concentration distribution with different α and β at typical times the concentration decreases remarkably over time due to the effect of bed absorption and this depletion effect becomes obvious with strong bed absorption the effect of α i e the vegetation density of the wetland on the contaminant dispersion process is observed such effect demonstrates the increasingly non uniform concentration distribution in wetland flows with high vegetation density as analyzed above in addition the contours of the 2d concentration cloud suggest downstream deflected vertical concentration distributions mainly due to the non uniform flow velocity profile 4 conclusion in this work a multi scale method is extended to investigate the environmental dispersion in wetland flows under the effect of bed absorption this method provides an easy way to analyze the contaminant transport process by focusing on large timescales after the initial stage τ 1 without complicated integral terms the analytical solution of the spatial concentration distribution obtained by this method is simpler and more applicable than those given by previous works moreover the accuracy of the concentration distribution is satisfied after the initial transient process the accurate solution of 2d concentration distributions is ultimately achieved moreover the mean concentration distributions focused on by previous studies and the accurate vertical concentration distributions are analyzed the 2d concentration distribution is assessed by analyzing the longitudinal concentration distribution at different depths of wetland flows and accurate vertical concentration distribution at certain cross sections the longitudinal concentration distributions are asymmetric and become downstream deflected due to the non uniform flow velocity profile the vertical concentration distributions present different tendencies at the upstream and downstream cross sections due to different advection effects the vertical concentration distribution occurs near the bed at the upstream cross sections however the condition is different with regard to the downstream cross sections that is the vertical concentration increases from the bottom to the surface at the downstream cross sections the 2d analysis provides the entire contaminant transport process the effects of vegetation and bed absorption on spatial concentration distributions are discussed in this work the results indicate that vegetation shear leads to non uniformity in vertical concentration distributions the bed absorption causes a depletion of the solute concentration and as a result a large capacity of bed absorption leads to a flat concentration distribution because only homogeneous distribution of vegetation and instantaneous discharge of pollution are considered in this work and conditions would be more complicated in nature in future work the heterogeneity of vegetation distribution various vegetation types and different contaminant discharge methods would be considered in analysis of contaminant concentration distribution in wetland flows with bed absorption in addition the various locations of natural wetland can lead to diverse topography and soil conditions due to different local climate however physical parameters of natural wetlands are hard to be determined therefore in order to study the effect of complex topography on contaminant transport within specific natural wetland flows detailed physical parameters and classifications of natural wetland flows should be discussed in following
