3235,the accurate estimation of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is of great significance to improve agricultural water use efficiency and optimize regional water resources management at present the applicability evaluation system of et0 models is still lacking in several climate regions in china leading to the confusion in application of the et0 model in some specific regions in this study the daily meteorological data of 84 representative stations in four climate regions of china during the past 30 years 1991 2019 were selected to evaluate the et0 simulation results of twelve empirical models four temperature models five radiation models and three hybrid models on the daily scale and the optimal models suitable for each climate region were screened whale optimization algorithm woa was used to optimize the optimal model to improve the simulation accuracy and the et0 results were compared with those predicted by extreme learning machine elm the results showed that the estimation accuracy of the hybrid model was the best throughout china followed by the radiation model and the temperature model was relatively poor with r2 ranges of 0 77 0 88 0 60 0 86 and 0 58 0 82 respectively among the temperature based models hargreaves samani and improve baier robertson model had the highest accuracy with r2 of 0 80 and 0 79 among the radiation based models priestley taylor and jensen haise models had the best accuracy with r2 of 0 82 and 0 79 among the hybrid models penman model had the highest accuracy with r2 of 0 84 the accuracy of hargreaves samani and improve baier robertson model in smz climate region was higher than tcz tmz and mpz and the accuracy of jensen haise model in tcz was the highest the estimation accuracy of priestley taylor and penman models was similar in smz tcz tmz and mpz using woa to optimize the optimal temperature radiation and hybrid models the prediction accuracy was improved by 12 05 11 06 and 10 46 which were higher than the result of elm model with r2 of 0 90 0 91 0 95 and 0 90 respectively therefore it is recommended to adopt woa to optimize the empirical model to estimate the et0 all over china keywords reference crop evapotranspiration whale optimization algorithm extreme learning machine model hybrid model temperature model radiation model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is one of the basic elements of regional climate change and hydrological cycle as well as an important indicator to realize accurate irrigation decision making optimal design of irrigation system and efficient management of water resources jung et al 2010 sorensson and ruscica 2018 however it is still impossible to directly observe et in many parts of the world liu et al 2019 thus it is particularly necessary to reasonably simulate et using models with different input factors the calculation of et mainly depends on the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 et0 refers to the evapotranspiration rate of hypothetical crops with uniform height of 0 12 m fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 zheng et al 2017 et0 can characterize the atmospheric evapotranspiration capacity of a certain region therefore the estimation accuracy of et0 plays a vital role in et calculation in recent decades relevant scholars in china and abroad have proposed more than 60 et0 estimation models such as empirical models based on temperature radiation humidity water pressure and hybrid model methods bormann 2011 li et al 2016 yang et al 2021 gharbia et al 2018 due to the different assumptions and input data of different models the accuracy of et0 calculation also varies to some extent maes et al 2019 fan and thomas 2018 previous studies have shown that the hybrid model had the highest accuracy followed by the radiation and temperature models song et al 2017 valipour et al 2017 maes et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 however the hybrid model requires standard air pump stations and more meteorological parameters which makes et0 calculation expensive and application difficult in many areas therefore the simplification of et0 empirical model with fewer meteorological variables input is particularly important song et al 2011 djaman et al 2015 had evaluated 16 empirical models for estimating et0 and found that the results of the empirical model were overestimated or underestimated djaman et al 2015 found that some empirical models can accurately reflect the et in a certain region but the accuracy varies greatly between different areas in addition some researchers have compared the estimation accuracy of the empirical model of a certain region and determined the best model of that however due to the lack of a generalization rule for spatial utilization these works still need to be duplicated zhang et al 2015 luo et al 2016 bai et al 2016 mehdizadeh et al 2017 there are many empirical models of et0 at present lu et al 2005 liu et al 2017 how to select suitable empirical models to estimate daily et0 in different climate regions needs to be further explored therefore it is necessary to evaluate et0 models in different climate regions of china to determine the best model appropriate to varied areas the calculation of et0 is an extremely complex nonlinear regression process that depends on a large number of meteorological variables and the extreme learning machine elm model has strong nonlinear processing capabilities and can simulate et0 more accurately abdullah et al 2015 predicted the daily et0 of iraq using elm indicating that the model was superior to the feed forward back propagation ffbp model with strong calculation speed and good generalization performance gocic et al 2016 used the elm hargreaves priestley taylor and turc models to predict monthly et0 based on meteorological data from 1980 to 2010 of serbia showed that the accuracy of et0 predicted by elm model was better than that by empirical models on the monthly scale feng et al 2017b used elm and support vector regression svr models to predict et0 based on the maximum and minimum temperature data of sichuan basin in southwest china found that the elm model can simulate et0 more accurately than svr and hargreaves models fan et al 2018c predicted daily et0 of china based on svm elm and four tree based machine learning models showed that the accuracy of elm model was better than that of svm and both were superior to four tree based model in accuracy and stability since the estimation accuracy of empirical models vary in different regions it is necessary to optimize empirical models and use then to estimate et0 in different regions in recent years researchers have developed many optimization algorithms including least square algorithm lsa artificial fish swarm algorithm afsa genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso and firefly algorithm ffa etc mirjalili and lewis 2016 proposed a new algorithm namely whale optimization algorithm woa yang et al 2021 adopted lsa to optimize rohwer romanenko turc hargreaves and penman models to calculate daily et0 and found that the accuracy of the empirical model after calibration was better than that before calibration zhang et al 2018 estimated et0 based on the makkink model in northwest china employed lsa to optimize the empirical parameters of the model and found that the accuracy of the improved makkink model was higher than that before calibration eslamian et al 2012 predicted the monthly et0 of esfahan province in iran by coupling artificial neural network model ann and genetic algorithm ga and pointed out that the monthly et0 predicted by ann ga model was superior to the original ann model petkoviÄ‡ et al 2016 used the pso algorithm to optimize radial basis function rbf neural network model and the back propagation neural network model bp to predict monthly et0 of serbia and reported that the et0 prediction accuracy of the pso rbf model was better than pso bp and both accuracies were significantly better than ann and svm yaseen et al 2017 established a hyberid model for river flow prediction anfis ffa based on anfis model and ffa algorithm which implied that the accuracy of anfis ffa model was higher than the independent anfis model zheng et al 2021 simulated maize transpiration under different mulching using support vector machine svm optimized by woa and found the accuracy of the optimized svm woa model increased by 47 57 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 predicted the daily et0 in arid semi arid and extremely arid areas of iran based on svr model optimized by woa showing that the et0 prediction accuracy of optimized svr was higher than that of the original svr model mirjalili et al 2016 tested woa based on the nonlinear problem of radial basis optimization and found that woa has stronger convergence than other algorithms in this study the daily meteorological data from 84 representative stations in four climate regions in china during the past 30 years 1989 2019 were selected to estimate the daily et0 based on empirical models of temperature radiation and mixed methods the main research objectives were as follows 1 three kinds of empirical models were used to estimate the daily et0 in different climatic regions of china and the optimal et0 model corresponding to four climatic zones was sought 2 the woa was used to optimize the optimal et0 models of four climate regions and compared with the prediction results of the elm model the best et0 estimation models were recommended for different climate regions in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description according to the difference in climate and rainfall we divided china into 5 climate regions namely mountain plateau zone mpz temperate monsoon zone tmz temperate continental zone tcz subtropical monsoon zone smz and tropical monsoon zone tpmz given the limitation of the land area and the meteorological data of tropical monsoon climate the tpmz was incorporated into the adjacent smz for research fan et al 2016 feng et al 2018 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2021 the specific zoning is shown in fig 1 in this study mpz smz tmz and tcz were defined as semi humid humid semi arid and arid climate zones the average altitude of each climate zone were 4236 611 288 and 912 km and the aridity index ai was 0 69 1 42 0 65 and 0 23 respectively 2 2 data analysis in this study the daily meteorological data from 84 representative meteorological stations in four climate regions of china in recent 30 years 1991 2019 were selected including daily mean temperature tmean relative humidity hr wind speed at 2 m height u2 precipitation p sunshine duration n and reference crop evapotranspiration et0 the daily average changes for each station are shown in fig 2 the values of tmean n u2 and et0 in tcz and mpz were greater than those in tmz and smz p in tcz and tmz was higher than that in smz and mpz while hr in mpz and tcz was larger than that in tmz and smz the data were tested and provided by the national meteorological information center nmic of china meteorological administration https data cma cn table 1 showed the daily mean value of representative meteorological stations 2 3 et0 model 2 3 1 penman monteith model the penman monteith p m model recommended by fao 56 was used as the standard value kisi 2015 fan et al 2016 to verify the estimation

et al 1998 the parameters required to calculate et0 were computed according to fao 56 including u 2 and radiation variables the wind speed at other locations was converted to u 2 by equation 2 allen et al 1998 2 u 2 u z 4 87 in 67 8 z 5 42 where u 2 and u z are the wind speed measured at 2 m and z m above the ground m s 1 z is the measured height of the ground m studies have shown that solar radiation rs plays an important role in the calculation of et0 and has a greater impact on the estimation accuracy of et0 arca et al 2004 perera et al 2014 rs can be predicted by weather type but the prediction is qualitative and cannot be directly used for et0 calculation therefore it is necessary to convert the weather forecast into quantitative data equation 3 5 showed the rs conversion process

balance water vapor diffusion and the law of air heat conduction in 1948 penman model could precisely estimate et0 only through ordinary meteorological data such as air temperature water vapor

characteristics that is empirical parameters will change with different climatic environments which will affect the accuracy of et0 simulation trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 yang et al 2019 so the model parameters need to be calibrated this study adopted daily meteorological data from 1991 to 2003 to screen out the optimal models based on temperature radiation and hybrid methods the woa was utilized to optimize the optimal empirical model based on the daily meteorological data from 2004 to 2014 and the simulation accuracy of the optimized model was verified with the data from 2015 to 2019 2 4 1 whale optimization algorithm woa the whale optimization algorithm woa was first proposed by mirjalili and lewis 2016 which is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales the algorithm finds the optimal solution to practical problems by optimizing the random search bubble net attack encirclement and predation of whales whales exhale bubbles to form a network when preying and surrounding bubbles as they swam toward the water surface to hunt small fish and other organisms watkins and schevill 1979 the target prey is considered as the best solution in woa and the possible situation of whales surrounding the prey is described as follows mirjalili and lewis 2016 19 x t 1 x t a c x t x t where t is the number of iterations x is the whale hunting vector x is the best solution vector if there is a better solution constantly update a 2 a r a and c 2 r are coefficient vectors a is a linear vector reduced from 2 to 0 r 0 1 is a random vector the method of whale exhaling bubbles to form a net and then prey mainly includes two stages 1 encirclement process it means contraction when the whale moves to the water surface the value of a reducing and a decrease with the decrease of a a 2 a r a 2 the position of the whale presents a spiral update simulating the spiral movement of the whale around the hunt by calculating the distance

learning machine elm huang et al 2006 first proposed the extreme learning machine elm model which has a strong ability to deal with nonlinear problems compared with the traditional feed forward neural network ffnn model the elm model has faster learning efficiency and stronger generalization ability since the parameters of the hidden layer of the elm model are acquired randomly without any subsequent adjustment the hidden layer nodes can be constructed in the training stage to iterate the optimal parameters the elm model is mainly composed of three layers input layer meteorological factor hidden layer neuron and output layer et0 the output function of the hidden layer is as follows 22 f r j 1 l Î² j h x t j 23 r x i t i i 1 2 n where Î² Î² 1 Î² 2 Î² 3 Î² l is the weight matrix between the hidden and the output layer and t t 1 t 2 t 3 t l is the target matrix of training data the output of hidden layer is estimated as follows 24 h g w 1 b 1 x 1 g w 1 b 1 x 2 g w l b l x 1 g

by using eq 26 26 g w i b i x i 1 1 e w x b the prediction result output of the elm by using eq 27 27 t test h Î² refer to huang et al 2006 for more details about elm model 2 5 performance evaluation the determination coefficient r2 relative root mean square error rrmse and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation results of the three kinds of empirical models shiri et al 2015 feng et al 2017c 28 r 2 i 1 m x i x y i y 2 i 1 m x i x 2 i 1 m y i y 2 29 rrmse 1 m i 1 m y i x i 2 x 100 30 mae 1 m i 1 m y i x i where xi and yi represent the calculated values of empirical model and p m model respectively x is the average value of xi subscript i is the i th value of et0 m is the number of data rrmse ranges from 0 perfect fit to worst fit mae ranges from 0 perfect fit to worst fit and r2 ranges from 1 perfect fit to worst fit the global performance indicator gpi was adopted to evaluate the comprehensive accuracy performance of each model for the sake of avoidig the difference of individual indexes the equation was as follows 31 gpi i j 1 3 Î± j g j y ij where Î± j is a constant the Î± j of rrmse and mae is 1 and the Î± j of r2 is 1 g j represents the median of evaluating indicator y ij represents the proportional value of evaluating indicator j of model i the greater the gpi value the higher the accuracy of the model 3 results 3 1 results of temperature based models the spatial distribution of china s daily et0 accuracy performance estimated by the temperature based empirical model was shown in fig 3 the accuracy of hargreaves samani schendel baier robertson and improve baier robertson models had certain spatial differences with r2 greater than 0 65 0 34 0 37 and 0 64 mae less than 2 89 151 37 4 60 and 2 68 mm d 1 rrmse less than 0 99 17 65 5 78 and 0 93 mm d 1 respectively the accuracy of the four temperature based models for calculating china s daily et0 was improve baier robertson hargreaves samani baier robertson schendel the average accuracy performance of daily et0 of china and various climatic regions tcz tmz mpz and smz calculated by the temperature based model was shown in table 4 the average value of et0 estimated by hargreaves samani schendel baier robertson and improve baier robertson models in the entire chinese region were 2 43 2 05 1 13 and 2 54 mm d 1 and the standard value calculated by the p m model was 4 37 mm d 1 it was found that the estimated values of hargreaves samani and improve baier robertson models were relatively close to those of the p m model the average values of r2 were 0 80 and 0 79 indicating that these two models can estimate china s daily et0 accurately in tcz tmz and smz the estimation accuracy of improved baier robertson model was the highest with r2 of 0 81 0 79 and 0 82 in mpz the accuracy of hargreaves samani model was the highest with r2 of 0 77 while in the whole china region the correlation between the improved baier robertson and the p m model was the highest followed by the hargreaves samani model and the accuracy of schendel and baier robertson models was relatively poor with r2 of 0 80 0 79 0 73 and 0 63 the accuracy order of different models in tcz tmz and smz was consistent with the order in the whole china region however the accuracy order of mpz was hargreaves samani improve baier robertson schendel baier robertson the results showed that the improve baier robertson and hargreaves samani models had the highest accuracy among all temperature models in china and other climate regions lu et al 2005 estimated et0 in the southeastern united states based on temperature and radiation model and declared that hargreaves samani model was the best model in temperature models xu and singh 2001 evaluated seven temperature based empirical models using meteorological data from northwestern canada and found that romanenko model had the smallest error at the two weather stations but improved baier robertson or hargreaves samani model was the best choice at other stations the reason for these differences may be that different studies have compared different models and adopted different evaluation indicators at different time or regional scales 3 2 results of radiation based models fig 4 shows the accuracy spatial distribution of daily et0 estimated by radiation based empirical model the accuracy estimated by priestley taylor makkink turc jensen haise and inmark allen models had spatial differences with r2 greater than 0 70 0 47 0 41 0 66 and 0 47 mae less than 3 78 4 69 4 99 3 83 and 3 97 mm d 1 and rrmse less than 0 96 1 71 2 75 0 99 and 5 78 mm d 1 respectively the accuracy of the 5 radiation models to calculate china s daily et0 was priestley taylor jensen haise inmark allen makkink turc the average accuracy performance of daily et0 in china and its climatic regions tcz tmz mpz and smz calculated by radiation based model was shown in table 5 the average et0 estimated by the priestley taylor makkink turc jensen haise and inmark allen models throughout the region of china were 2 40 2 18 1 39 2 31 and 2 16 mm d 1 the calculated value of p m model was 4 37 mm d 1 indicating that priestley taylor model was closest to p m model followed by jensen haise and inmark allen models makkink and turc models had poor estimation accuracy the average value of r2 also proved the conclusion which was 0 82 0 79 0 71 0 65 and 0 62 respectively the accuracy of jensen haise model was the highest in tcz and mpz with r2 of 0 86 and 0 83 and the priestley taylor model was the best in tmz and smz with r2 of 0 82 and 0 83 the accuracy order of the models in tmz mpz and smz was the same as that in the whole china region while the accuracy in tcz was jensen haise priestley taylor inmark allen makkink turc the study found that jensen haise and priestley taylor models were the best radiation based models for calculating et0 in various climate regions in china which are consistent with the results of wu et al 2016 and liu et al 2017 berengena and gavilÃ¡n 2005 evaluated the et0 model in spain and showed the estimation result of priestley taylor model was poor after analyzing the reasons it can be seen that priestley taylor was constructed in humid environment and was more suitable for humid areas 3 3 results of hybrid model fig 5 shows the accuracy spatial distribution of china s daily et0 estimated by the hybrid model there were spatial differences in the accuracy of daily et0 estimated by penman penman van bavel and brutsaert stricker models with r2 greater than 0 70 0 67 and 0 66 mae less than 2 09 3 65 and 9 26 mm d 1 and rrmse less than 0 93 1 99 and 5 88 mm d 1 respectively the above results showed that the accuracy of the three hybrid models for calculating daily et0 in china ranked as penman brutsaert stricker penman van bavel the average accuracy performance of daily et0 in china and its climatic regions tcz tmz mpz and smz calculated based on hybrid model was shown in table 6 the average value of daily et0 estimated by penman penman van bavel and brutsaert stricker models were 3 13 2 35 and 2 37 mm d 1 and the standard value of p m model was 4 37 mm d 1 it was found that the correlation between penman and p m model was relatively higher with an average r2 of 0 84 in tmz mpz and smz the accuracy of penman model was the highest with r2 of 0 83 0 86 and 0 82 the accuracy order of daily et0 estimated by hybrid model was the same as that in the whole china region in tcz brutsaert stricker model had the highest estimation accuracy with r2 of 0 86 and the accuracy order of each model was brutsaert stricker penman penman van bavel penman model had the best estimation accuracy in china and its various climatic regions among the hybrid models liu et al 2017 found that the main difference of the hybrid model was wind speed u2 while penman model was modified based on specific geographic locations rosenberry et al 2004 allen et al 1998 manifested that monteith introduced aerodynamic resistance and surface resistance factors to improve penman model and extended evapotranspiration to crop surface constructed the famous penman monteith model fao 56 pm which was set as the standard model for evaluating et0 by the united nations moges et al 2003 li et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 3 4 three types of optimal empirical model parameters based on woa algorithm optimization the results of optimizing the parameters of each empirical model based on the woa algorithm are shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure below that the parameters a and c of the hs model fluctuate greatly at the stations in the smz and mpz regions and the parameter b varies greatly at each station in the smz region but is relatively stable in other regions the parameters a c d and e of ibr model are sensitive in four different regions and the parameter c fluctuates greatly in tcz and mpz while parameter b is relatively stable and has a small fluctuation range the parameters a d and e of the jh model fluctuate greatly in the four regions while the parameters b and c are relatively stable in the pm model the parameter a fluctuates greatly in the four regions among which the parameter is the largest in the smz region while the parameter b is the most sensitive to changes in the smz region and is relatively stable in the other three regions the parameters of pt model fluctuate slightly in four regions with a fluctuation range of 1 017 2 117 fig 7 showed the spatial accuracy of the optimal empirical model elm model and p m model based on woa the prediction accuracy of the optimized temperature and radiation model was closer to that of elm model the spatial accuracy of hargreaves samani improve baier robertson priestley taylor jensen haise penman and elm models was higher with r2 all higher than 0 80 respectively mae less than 2 29 2 13 1 98 2 29 1 99 and 0 61 mm d 1 and rrmse less than 0 98 0 81 0 97 0 99 0 99 and 0 37 mm d 1 respectively the estimation accuracy of the empirical model optimized by woa has been greatly improved in all climate regions of china which was similar to the results of the elm model that had high prediction accuracy and computational efficiency gocic et al 2016 yin et al 2017 fan et al 2018c the original and calibrated values of empirical parameters of priestley taylor penman hargreaves samani improve brutsaert stricker and jensen haise models and the accuracy errors of elm model in china and its 4 climatic regions were shown in table 7 the estimation accuracy of the calibration values of the five empirical models is higher than the original value and closer to the prediction of elm model the calibrated empirical model can calculate et0 more accurately with r2 higher than 0 86 rrmse less than 0 41 mm d 1 mae less than 1 17 mm d 1 the coefficient of penman model changed the most and the estimation accuracy of the model was significantly improved after calibration shiri 2018 found that the aerodynamic model was developed for specific areas and was more suitable for areas under the same conditions in temperature based models the coefficients of priestley taylor changed little in four regions indicating that et0 can be well calculated by the original parameters the parameter c of hargreaves samani varied greatly in tcz mpz and smz but less in tmz indicating that the original parameter can accurately estimate et0 in tmz in radiation based models the parameters d and e of improve brutsaert stricker and jensen haise changed greatly and r2 of the two calibrated empirical models was greater than 0 86 in the 4 climate regions of china 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy performance based on temperature radiation and hybrid models the study found that the simulation accuracy of the hybrid model was higher than that of the radiation model and both were higher than the temperature model in four different climatic regions of china the hybrid model is a semi mechanical and semi empirical model with a certain theoretical basis and considers the direct factors affecting the crops evapotranspiration such as wind speed radiation temperature saturated water vapor pressure and sunshine which makes the model structure complex and requires meteorological data there are many types and the simulation accuracy is high liu et al 2017 yang et al 2021 yang et al 2019 the main energy of the earth s surface comes from solar radiation and the correlation between reference crop evapotranspiration and solar radiation is high fan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 while the temperature is easily affected by terrain differences and climate types resulting in poor quality of temperature data so the hybrid model simulation accuracy is higher than the radiation model and both are higher than the temperature model yang et al 2021 evaluated the temperature model radiation model and hybrid model using meteorological data from 789 meteorological stations in 4 climate regions in china and found that the hybrid model had the highest simulation accuracy followed by the radiation and temperature models samaras et al 2014 evaluated 18 reference crop evapotranspiration models in different mediterranean climate regions of greece and found that the simulation accuracy of radiation model was higher than that of temperature model djaman et al 2019 evaluated penman monteith and other 34 reference crop evapotranspiration methods in the semi arid and dry climate region of new mexico among them the mixed model has the highest accuracy while the temperature model is relatively poor the accuracy of penman model is the highest of all the hybrid models penman is a semi empirical and semi theoretical model based on the principle of aerodynamics the effects of radiation temperature sensible heat flux wind speed and saturated water vapor pressure difference on reference crop evapotranspiration are considered compared with other models penman model has higher simulation accuracy fan et al 2018 found that wind speed was the main factor affecting et0 while the wind function in penman model was modified for specific regions and more meteorological factors were added rosenberry et al 2004 liu et al 2017 in addition the radiation based priestley taylor and jensen haise models had high accuracy in simulating daily et0 over different climate regions of china compared with other radiation models priestley taylor model takes soil heat flux and saturated water vapor pressure difference into account while jensen haise model considers sunshine hours temperature and radiation including five coefficients related to meteorological factors zhang et al 2018 estimated et0 in northwest china based on improved makkink model and proposed that the accuracy of the empirical model with more parameters was higher than that of the model with fewer parameters liu et al 2017 compared 16 et0 models in semi arid regions of china and found that the results of jensen haise and makkink models had higher accuracy and jensen haise model was more accurate than makkink model ahmadi and javanbakht 2020 took the arid region of iran as the study area to evaluate the estimation accuracy of 8 et0 models on a daily scale showing that jensen haise model had the highest accuracy and could replace penman monteith model to estimate et0 in this regies at last hargreaves samani and improve baier robertson models of temperature based empirical models had higher simulation accuracy in different climate zones in china hargreaves samani model adopts temperature data to predict et0 which is the simplest model with high accuracy when the data required by p m model cannot be fully obtained hargreaves samani model can replace p m model to estimate local et0 jensen et al 1997 luo et al 2014 allen et al 1998 almorox et al 2015 evaluated 11 representative et0 models based on temperature method and found that hargreaves samani model had high estimation accuracy in arid semi arid temperate cold and polar climate zones improved baier robertson model is based on baier robertson model and the accuracy of simulating daily et0 is relatively high considering the water pressure factors however the conclusions of some researches are different from this study xu et al 2001 evaluated seven temperature models using the data of two meteorological stations in northwest canada and found that the average total error of romanenko model at the two stations was the smallest liu et al 2005 compared six temperature and radiation based models in the southeastern united states and recommended the temperature based hamon model as the best method for estimating et0 therefore this difference may be attributed to different models selected for estimating different criteria used for evaluating and different time scales for stimulating 4 2 the woa algorithm significantly improves the prediction accuracy of empirical models the study found that woa can significantly improve the estimation accuracy based on temperature radiation and hybrid models and the simulation accuracy of the optimized empirical model is higher than that of the extreme learning machine elm since the empirical model has regional defects woa can effectively solve the shortcomings of the empirical model due to its simple structure strong search ability and easy implementation there is a very complex nonlinear relationship between reference crop evapotranspiration and meteorological factors the elm model has a strong ability to deal with nonlinear problems however the simulation accuracy of the empirical model optimized by the woa algorithm is higher than that of the elm model indicating that the woa algorithm has better ability to deal with complex nonlinear problems than elm model based on the coupling of woa and svm mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 proposed a new hybrid model svr woa to predict et0 in arid semi arid and extremely arid areas of iran and found that woa had strong nonlinear searchability the prediction accuracy of the new hybrid model was better than the original svm model yan et al 2020 proposed the hybrid model woa xgb using the extreme gradient boosting xgb model optimized by woa and found that the accuracy of woa xgb model was better than that of the p m model with rmse in arid and humid areas decreased by 40 1 and 38 9 respectively 5 conclusion based on the daily meteorological data of 84 representative stations this study evaluated twelve et0 estimation models four temperature based models five radiation based models and three hybrid models in china and its 4 climatic zones on a daily scale in china and selected the optimal models suitable for each climatic region the woa was used to optimize the optimal empirical model and the result was compared with the elm model the main conclusions are as follows 1 using three kinds of models to estimate the daily et0 of the whole china region the accuracy of the hybrid model was the best followed by the radiation model and the temperature model was relatively poor with r2 ranges of 0 77 0 88 0 60 0 86 and 0 58 0 82 respectively hargreaves samani and improve baier robertsonm models had higher accuracy among the temperature based empirical models with r2 of 0 81 and 0 80 the accuracy of priestley taylor and jensen haise models was the best among the radiation based empirical models with r2 of 0 83 and 0 84 penman model had the best accuracy among the hybrid models with r2 of 0 86 2 in tcz the estimation accuracy of penman model was the best followed by hargreaves samani and improve baier robertsonm models with r2 of 0 86 0 82 and 0 82 in tmz penman and priestley taylor models had the highest accuracy followed by hargreaves samani and improve baier robertsonm models with r2 of 0 85 0 85 0 82 and 0 82 in mpz penman model had the highest accuracy followed by hargreaves samani model with r2 of 0 86 and 0 80 in smz penman model had the highest accuracy followed by the priestley taylor model with r2 of 0 85 and 0 82 respectively 3 the woa can significantly promote the accuracy of the three types of optimal empirical models the accuracy of the optimized temperature radiation and mixed models was increased by 12 05 11 06 and 10 46 which were higher than the results of the elm model with r2 of 0 90 0 91 0 95 and 0 90 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors

3235,the accurate estimation of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is of great significance to improve agricultural water use efficiency and optimize regional water resources management at present the applicability evaluation system of et0 models is still lacking in several climate regions in china leading to the confusion in application of the et0 model in some specific regions in this study the daily meteorological data of 84 representative stations in four climate regions of china during the past 30 years 1991 2019 were selected to evaluate the et0 simulation results of twelve empirical models four temperature models five radiation models and three hybrid models on the daily scale and the optimal models suitable for each climate region were screened whale optimization algorithm woa was used to optimize the optimal model to improve the simulation accuracy and the et0 results were compared with those predicted by extreme learning machine elm the results showed that the estimation accuracy of the hybrid model was the best throughout china followed by the radiation model and the temperature model was relatively poor with r2 ranges of 0 77 0 88 0 60 0 86 and 0 58 0 82 respectively among the temperature based models hargreaves samani and improve baier robertson model had the highest accuracy with r2 of 0 80 and 0 79 among the radiation based models priestley taylor and jensen haise models had the best accuracy with r2 of 0 82 and 0 79 among the hybrid models penman model had the highest accuracy with r2 of 0 84 the accuracy of hargreaves samani and improve baier robertson model in smz climate region was higher than tcz tmz and mpz and the accuracy of jensen haise model in tcz was the highest the estimation accuracy of priestley taylor and penman models was similar in smz tcz tmz and mpz using woa to optimize the optimal temperature radiation and hybrid models the prediction accuracy was improved by 12 05 11 06 and 10 46 which were higher than the result of elm model with r2 of 0 90 0 91 0 95 and 0 90 respectively therefore it is recommended to adopt woa to optimize the empirical model to estimate the et0 all over china keywords reference crop evapotranspiration whale optimization algorithm extreme learning machine model hybrid model temperature model radiation model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is one of the basic elements of regional climate change and hydrological cycle as well as an important indicator to realize accurate irrigation decision making optimal design of irrigation system and efficient management of water resources jung et al 2010 sorensson and ruscica 2018 however it is still impossible to directly observe et in many parts of the world liu et al 2019 thus it is particularly necessary to reasonably simulate et using models with different input factors the calculation of et mainly depends on the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 et0 refers to the evapotranspiration rate of hypothetical crops with uniform height of 0 12 m fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 zheng et al 2017 et0 can characterize the atmospheric evapotranspiration capacity of a certain region therefore the estimation accuracy of et0 plays a vital role in et calculation in recent decades relevant scholars in china and abroad have proposed more than 60 et0 estimation models such as empirical models based on temperature radiation humidity water pressure and hybrid model methods bormann 2011 li et al 2016 yang et al 2021 gharbia et al 2018 due to the different assumptions and input data of different models the accuracy of et0 calculation also varies to some extent maes et al 2019 fan and thomas 2018 previous studies have shown that the hybrid model had the highest accuracy followed by the radiation and temperature models song et al 2017 valipour et al 2017 maes et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 however the hybrid model requires standard air pump stations and more meteorological parameters which makes et0 calculation expensive and application difficult in many areas therefore the simplification of et0 empirical model with fewer meteorological variables input is particularly important song et al 2011 djaman et al 2015 had evaluated 16 empirical models for estimating et0 and found that the results of the empirical model were overestimated or underestimated djaman et al 2015 found that some empirical models can accurately reflect the et in a certain region but the accuracy varies greatly between different areas in addition some researchers have compared the estimation accuracy of the empirical model of a certain region and determined the best model of that however due to the lack of a generalization rule for spatial utilization these works still need to be duplicated zhang et al 2015 luo et al 2016 bai et al 2016 mehdizadeh et al 2017 there are many empirical models of et0 at present lu et al 2005 liu et al 2017 how to select suitable empirical models to estimate daily et0 in different climate regions needs to be further explored therefore it is necessary to evaluate et0 models in different climate regions of china to determine the best model appropriate to varied areas the calculation of et0 is an extremely complex nonlinear regression process that depends on a large number of meteorological variables and the extreme learning machine elm model has strong nonlinear processing capabilities and can simulate et0 more accurately abdullah et al 2015 predicted the daily et0 of iraq using elm indicating that the model was superior to the feed forward back propagation ffbp model with strong calculation speed and good generalization performance gocic et al 2016 used the elm hargreaves priestley taylor and turc models to predict monthly et0 based on meteorological data from 1980 to 2010 of serbia showed that the accuracy of et0 predicted by elm model was better than that by empirical models on the monthly scale feng et al 2017b used elm and support vector regression svr models to predict et0 based on the maximum and minimum temperature data of sichuan basin in southwest china found that the elm model can simulate et0 more accurately than svr and hargreaves models fan et al 2018c predicted daily et0 of china based on svm elm and four tree based machine learning models showed that the accuracy of elm model was better than that of svm and both were superior to four tree based model in accuracy and stability since the estimation accuracy of empirical models vary in different regions it is necessary to optimize empirical models and use then to estimate et0 in different regions in recent years researchers have developed many optimization algorithms including least square algorithm lsa artificial fish swarm algorithm afsa genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso and firefly algorithm ffa etc mirjalili and lewis 2016 proposed a new algorithm namely whale optimization algorithm woa yang et al 2021 adopted lsa to optimize rohwer romanenko turc hargreaves and penman models to calculate daily et0 and found that the accuracy of the empirical model after calibration was better than that before calibration zhang et al 2018 estimated et0 based on the makkink model in northwest china employed lsa to optimize the empirical parameters of the model and found that the accuracy of the improved makkink model was higher than that before calibration eslamian et al 2012 predicted the monthly et0 of esfahan province in iran by coupling artificial neural network model ann and genetic algorithm ga and pointed out that the monthly et0 predicted by ann ga model was superior to the original ann model petkoviÄ‡ et al 2016 used the pso algorithm to optimize radial basis function rbf neural network model and the back propagation neural network model bp to predict monthly et0 of serbia and reported that the et0 prediction accuracy of the pso rbf model was better than pso bp and both accuracies were significantly better than ann and svm yaseen et al 2017 established a hyberid model for river flow prediction anfis ffa based on anfis model and ffa algorithm which implied that the accuracy of anfis ffa model was higher than the independent anfis model zheng et al 2021 simulated maize transpiration under different mulching using support vector machine svm optimized by woa and found the accuracy of the optimized svm woa model increased by 47 57 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 predicted the daily et0 in arid semi arid and extremely arid areas of iran based on svr model optimized by woa showing that the et0 prediction accuracy of optimized svr was higher than that of the original svr model mirjalili et al 2016 tested woa based on the nonlinear problem of radial basis optimization and found that woa has stronger convergence than other algorithms in this study the daily meteorological data from 84 representative stations in four climate regions in china during the past 30 years 1989 2019 were selected to estimate the daily et0 based on empirical models of temperature radiation and mixed methods the main research objectives were as follows 1 three kinds of empirical models were used to estimate the daily et0 in different climatic regions of china and the optimal et0 model corresponding to four climatic zones was sought 2 the woa was used to optimize the optimal et0 models of four climate regions and compared with the prediction results of the elm model the best et0 estimation models were recommended for different climate regions in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description according to the difference in climate and rainfall we divided china into 5 climate regions namely mountain plateau zone mpz temperate monsoon zone tmz temperate continental zone tcz subtropical monsoon zone smz and tropical monsoon zone tpmz given the limitation of the land area and the meteorological data of tropical monsoon climate the tpmz was incorporated into the adjacent smz for research fan et al 2016 feng et al 2018 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2021 the specific zoning is shown in fig 1 in this study mpz smz tmz and tcz were defined as semi humid humid semi arid and arid climate zones the average altitude of each climate zone were 4236 611 288 and 912 km and the aridity index ai was 0 69 1 42 0 65 and 0 23 respectively 2 2 data analysis in this study the daily meteorological data from 84 representative meteorological stations in four climate regions of china in recent 30 years 1991 2019 were selected including daily mean temperature tmean relative humidity hr wind speed at 2 m height u2 precipitation p sunshine duration n and reference crop evapotranspiration et0 the daily average changes for each station are shown in fig 2 the values of tmean n u2 and et0 in tcz and mpz were greater than those in tmz and smz p in tcz and tmz was higher than that in smz and mpz while hr in mpz and tcz was larger than that in tmz and smz the data

radiation rs plays an important role in the calculation of et0 and has a greater impact on the estimation accuracy of et0 arca et al 2004 perera et al 2014 rs can be predicted by weather type but the prediction is qualitative and cannot be directly used for et0 calculation therefore it is necessary to convert the weather forecast into quantitative data equation 3 5 showed the rs conversion process

et0 model are shown in table 3 the details can refer to the corresponding literature 2 4 the method of parameter calibration studies have shown that empirical models have obvious regional characteristics that is empirical parameters will change with different climatic environments which will affect the accuracy of et0 simulation trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 yang et al 2019 so the model parameters need to be calibrated this study adopted daily meteorological data from 1991 to 2003 to screen out the optimal models based on temperature radiation and hybrid methods the woa was utilized to optimize the optimal empirical model based on the daily meteorological data from 2004 to 2014 and the simulation accuracy of the optimized model was verified with the data from 2015 to 2019 2 4 1 whale optimization algorithm woa the whale optimization algorithm woa was first proposed by mirjalili and lewis 2016 which is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales the algorithm finds the optimal solution to practical problems by optimizing the random search bubble net attack encirclement and predation of whales whales exhale bubbles to form a network when preying and surrounding bubbles as they swam toward the water surface to hunt small fish and other organisms watkins and schevill 1979 the target prey is considered as the best

network ffnn model the elm model has faster learning efficiency and stronger generalization ability since the parameters of the hidden layer of the elm model are acquired randomly without any subsequent adjustment the hidden layer nodes can be constructed in the training stage to iterate the optimal parameters the elm model is mainly composed of three layers input layer meteorological factor hidden layer neuron and output layer et0 the output function of the hidden layer is as follows 22 f r j 1 l Î² j h x t j 23 r x i t i i 1 2 n where Î² Î² 1 Î² 2 Î² 3 Î² l is the weight matrix between the hidden and the output layer and t t 1 t 2 t 3 t l is the target matrix of training data the output of hidden layer is estimated as follows 24 h g w 1 b 1 x 1 g w 1 b 1 x 2 g w l b l x 1 g

the determination coefficient r2 relative root mean square error rrmse and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation results of the three kinds of empirical models

median of evaluating indicator y ij represents the proportional value of evaluating indicator j of model i the greater the gpi value the higher the accuracy of the model 3 results 3 1 results of temperature based models the spatial distribution of china s daily et0 accuracy performance estimated by the temperature based empirical model was shown in fig 3 the accuracy of hargreaves samani schendel baier robertson and improve baier robertson models had certain spatial differences with r2 greater than 0 65 0 34 0 37 and 0 64 mae less than 2 89 151 37 4 60 and 2 68 mm d 1 rrmse less than 0 99 17 65 5 78 and 0 93 mm d 1 respectively the accuracy of the four temperature based models for calculating china s daily et0 was improve baier robertson hargreaves samani baier robertson schendel the average accuracy performance of daily et0 of china and various climatic regions tcz tmz mpz and smz calculated by the temperature based model was shown in table 4 the average value of et0 estimated by hargreaves samani schendel baier robertson and improve baier robertson models in the entire chinese region were 2 43 2 05 1 13 and 2 54 mm d 1 and the standard value calculated by the p m model was 4 37 mm d 1 it was found that the estimated values of hargreaves samani and improve baier robertson models were relatively close to those of the p m model the average values of r2 were 0 80 and 0 79 indicating that these two models can estimate china s daily et0 accurately in tcz tmz and smz the estimation accuracy of improved baier robertson model was the highest with r2 of 0 81 0 79 and 0 82 in mpz the accuracy of hargreaves samani model was the highest with r2 of 0 77 while in the whole china region the correlation between the improved baier robertson and the p m model was the highest followed by the hargreaves samani model and the accuracy of schendel and baier robertson models was relatively poor with r2 of 0 80 0 79 0 73 and 0 63 the accuracy order of different models in tcz tmz and smz was consistent with the order in the whole china region however the accuracy order of mpz was hargreaves samani improve baier robertson schendel baier robertson the results showed that the improve baier robertson and hargreaves samani models had the highest accuracy among all temperature models in china and other climate regions lu et al 2005 estimated et0 in the southeastern united states based on temperature and radiation model and declared that hargreaves samani model was the best model in temperature models xu and singh 2001 evaluated seven temperature based empirical models using meteorological data from northwestern canada and found that romanenko model had the smallest error at the two weather stations but improved baier robertson or hargreaves samani model was the best choice at other stations the reason for these differences may be that different studies have compared different models and adopted different evaluation indicators at different time or regional scales 3 2 results of radiation based models fig 4 shows the accuracy spatial distribution of daily et0 estimated by radiation based empirical model the accuracy estimated by priestley taylor makkink turc jensen haise and inmark allen models had spatial differences with r2 greater than 0 70 0 47 0 41 0 66 and 0 47 mae less than 3 78 4 69 4 99 3 83 and 3 97 mm d 1 and rrmse less than 0 96 1 71 2 75 0 99 and 5 78 mm d 1 respectively the accuracy of the 5 radiation models to calculate china s daily et0 was priestley taylor jensen haise inmark allen makkink turc the average accuracy performance of daily et0 in china and its climatic regions tcz tmz mpz and smz calculated by radiation based model was shown in table 5 the average et0 estimated by the priestley taylor makkink turc jensen haise and inmark allen models throughout the region of china were 2 40 2 18 1 39 2 31 and 2 16 mm d 1 the calculated value of p m model was 4 37 mm d 1 indicating that priestley taylor model was closest to p m model followed by jensen haise and inmark allen models makkink and turc models had poor estimation accuracy the average value of r2 also proved the conclusion which was 0 82 0 79 0 71 0 65 and 0 62 respectively the accuracy of jensen haise model was the highest in tcz and mpz with r2 of 0 86 and 0 83 and the priestley taylor model was the best in tmz and smz with r2 of 0 82 and 0 83 the accuracy order of the models in tmz mpz and smz was the same as that in the whole china region while the accuracy in tcz was jensen haise priestley taylor inmark allen makkink turc the study found that jensen haise and priestley taylor models were the best radiation based models for calculating et0 in various climate regions in china which are consistent with the results of wu et al 2016 and liu et al 2017 berengena and gavilÃ¡n 2005 evaluated the et0 model in spain and showed the estimation result of priestley taylor model was poor after analyzing the reasons it can be seen that priestley taylor was constructed in humid environment and was more suitable for humid areas 3 3 results of hybrid model fig 5 shows the accuracy spatial distribution of china s daily et0 estimated by the hybrid model there were spatial differences in the accuracy of daily et0 estimated by penman penman van bavel and brutsaert stricker models with r2 greater than 0 70 0 67 and 0 66 mae less than 2 09 3 65 and 9 26 mm d 1 and rrmse less than 0 93 1 99 and 5 88 mm d 1 respectively the above results showed that the accuracy of the three hybrid models for calculating daily et0 in china ranked as penman brutsaert stricker penman van bavel the average accuracy performance of daily et0 in china and its climatic regions tcz tmz mpz and smz calculated based on hybrid model was shown in table 6 the average value of daily et0 estimated by penman penman van bavel and brutsaert stricker models were 3 13 2 35 and 2 37 mm d 1 and the standard value of p m model was 4 37 mm d 1 it was found that the correlation between penman and p m model was relatively higher with an average r2 of 0 84 in tmz mpz and smz the accuracy of penman model was the highest with r2 of 0 83 0 86 and 0 82 the accuracy order of daily et0 estimated by hybrid model was the same as that in the whole china region in tcz brutsaert stricker model had the highest estimation accuracy with r2 of 0 86 and the accuracy order of each model was brutsaert stricker penman penman van bavel penman model had the best estimation accuracy in china and its various climatic regions among the hybrid models liu et al 2017 found that the main difference of the hybrid model was wind speed u2 while penman model was modified based on specific geographic locations rosenberry et al 2004 allen et al 1998 manifested that monteith introduced aerodynamic resistance and surface resistance factors to improve penman model and extended evapotranspiration to crop surface constructed the famous penman monteith model fao 56 pm which was set as the standard model for evaluating et0 by the united nations moges et al 2003 li et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 3 4 three types of optimal empirical model parameters based on woa algorithm optimization the results of optimizing the parameters of each empirical model based on the woa algorithm are shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure below that the parameters a and c of the hs model fluctuate greatly at the stations in the smz and mpz regions and the parameter b varies greatly at each station in the smz region but is relatively stable in other regions the parameters a c d and e of ibr model are sensitive in four different regions and the parameter c fluctuates greatly in tcz and mpz while parameter b is relatively stable and has a small fluctuation range the parameters a d and e of the jh model fluctuate greatly in the four regions while the parameters b and c are relatively stable in the pm model the parameter a fluctuates greatly in the four regions among which the parameter is the largest in the smz region while the parameter b is the most sensitive to changes in the smz region and is relatively stable in the other three regions the parameters of pt model fluctuate slightly in four regions with a fluctuation range of 1 017 2 117 fig 7 showed the spatial accuracy of the optimal empirical model elm model and p m model based on woa the prediction accuracy of the optimized temperature and radiation model was closer to that of elm model the spatial accuracy of hargreaves samani improve baier robertson priestley taylor jensen haise penman and elm models was higher with r2 all higher than 0 80 respectively mae less than 2 29 2 13 1 98 2 29 1 99 and 0 61 mm d 1 and rrmse less than 0 98 0 81 0 97 0 99 0 99 and 0 37 mm d 1 respectively the estimation accuracy of the empirical model optimized by woa has been greatly improved in all climate regions of china which was similar to the results of the elm model that had high prediction accuracy and computational efficiency gocic et al 2016 yin et al 2017 fan et al 2018c the original and calibrated values of empirical parameters of priestley taylor penman hargreaves samani improve brutsaert stricker and jensen haise models and the accuracy errors of elm model in china and its 4 climatic regions were shown in table 7 the estimation accuracy of the calibration values of the five empirical models is higher than the original value and closer to the prediction of elm model the calibrated empirical model can calculate et0 more accurately with r2 higher than 0 86 rrmse less than 0 41 mm d 1 mae less than 1 17 mm d 1 the coefficient of penman model changed the most and the estimation accuracy of the model was significantly improved after calibration shiri 2018 found that the aerodynamic model was developed for specific areas and was more suitable for areas under the same conditions in temperature based models the coefficients of priestley taylor changed little in four regions indicating that et0 can be well calculated by the original parameters the parameter c of hargreaves samani varied greatly in tcz mpz and smz but less in tmz indicating that the original parameter can accurately estimate et0 in tmz in radiation based models the parameters d and e of improve brutsaert stricker and jensen haise changed greatly and r2 of the two calibrated empirical models was greater than 0 86 in the 4 climate regions of china 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy performance based on temperature radiation and hybrid models the study found that the simulation accuracy of the hybrid model was higher than that of the radiation model and both were higher than the temperature model in four different climatic regions of china the hybrid model is a semi mechanical and semi empirical model with a certain theoretical basis and considers the direct factors affecting the crops evapotranspiration such as wind speed radiation temperature saturated water vapor pressure and sunshine which makes the model structure complex and requires meteorological data there are many types and the simulation accuracy is high liu et al 2017 yang et al 2021 yang et al 2019 the main energy of the earth s surface comes from solar radiation and the correlation between reference crop evapotranspiration and solar radiation is high fan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 while the temperature is easily affected by terrain differences and climate types resulting in poor quality of temperature data so the hybrid model simulation accuracy is higher than the radiation model and both are higher than the temperature model yang et al 2021 evaluated the temperature model radiation model and hybrid model using meteorological data from 789 meteorological stations in 4 climate regions in china and found that the hybrid model had the highest simulation accuracy followed by the radiation and temperature models samaras et al 2014 evaluated 18 reference crop evapotranspiration models in different mediterranean climate regions of greece and found that the simulation accuracy of radiation model was higher than that of temperature model djaman et al 2019 evaluated penman monteith and other 34 reference crop evapotranspiration methods in the semi arid and dry climate region of new mexico among them the mixed model has the highest accuracy while the temperature model is relatively poor the accuracy of penman model is the highest of all the hybrid models penman is a semi empirical and semi theoretical model based on the principle of aerodynamics the effects of radiation temperature sensible heat flux wind speed and saturated water vapor pressure difference on reference crop evapotranspiration are considered compared with other models penman model has higher simulation accuracy fan et al 2018 found that wind speed was the main factor affecting et0 while the wind function in penman model was modified for specific regions and more meteorological factors were added rosenberry et al 2004 liu et al 2017 in addition the radiation based priestley taylor and jensen haise models had high accuracy in simulating daily et0 over different climate regions of china compared with other radiation models priestley taylor model takes soil heat flux and saturated water vapor pressure difference into account while jensen haise model considers sunshine hours temperature and radiation including five coefficients related to meteorological factors zhang et al 2018 estimated et0 in northwest china based on improved makkink model and proposed that the accuracy of the empirical model with more parameters was higher than that of the model with fewer parameters liu et al 2017 compared 16 et0 models in semi arid regions of china and found that the results of jensen haise and makkink models had higher accuracy and jensen haise model was more accurate than makkink model ahmadi and javanbakht 2020 took the arid region of iran as the study area to evaluate the estimation accuracy of 8 et0 models on a daily scale showing that jensen haise model had the highest accuracy and could replace penman monteith model to estimate et0 in this regies at last hargreaves samani and improve baier robertson models of temperature based empirical models had higher simulation accuracy in different climate zones in china hargreaves samani model adopts temperature data to predict et0 which is the simplest model with high accuracy when the data required by p m model cannot be fully obtained hargreaves samani model can replace p m model to estimate local et0 jensen et al 1997 luo et al 2014 allen et al 1998 almorox et al 2015 evaluated 11 representative et0 models based on temperature method and found that hargreaves samani model had high estimation accuracy in arid semi arid temperate cold and polar climate zones improved baier robertson model is based on baier robertson model and the accuracy of simulating daily et0 is relatively high considering the water pressure factors however the conclusions of some researches are different from this study xu et al 2001 evaluated seven temperature models using the data of two meteorological stations in northwest canada and found that the average total error of romanenko model at the two stations was the smallest liu et al 2005 compared six temperature and radiation based models in the southeastern united states and recommended the temperature based hamon model as the best method for estimating et0 therefore this difference may be attributed to different models selected for estimating different criteria used for evaluating and different time scales for stimulating 4 2 the woa algorithm significantly improves the prediction accuracy of empirical models the study found that woa can significantly improve the estimation accuracy based on temperature radiation and hybrid models and the simulation accuracy of the optimized empirical model is higher than that of the extreme learning machine elm since the empirical model has regional defects woa can effectively solve the shortcomings of the empirical model due to its simple structure strong search ability and easy implementation there is a very complex nonlinear relationship between reference crop evapotranspiration and meteorological factors the elm model has a strong ability to deal with nonlinear problems however the simulation accuracy of the empirical model optimized by the woa algorithm is higher than that of the elm model indicating that the woa algorithm has better ability to deal with complex nonlinear problems than elm model based on the coupling of woa and svm mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 proposed a new hybrid model svr woa to predict et0 in arid semi arid and extremely arid areas of iran and found that woa had strong nonlinear searchability the prediction accuracy of the new hybrid model was better than the original svm model yan et al 2020 proposed the hybrid model woa xgb using the extreme gradient boosting xgb model optimized by woa and found that the accuracy of woa xgb model was better than that of the p m model with rmse in arid and humid areas decreased by 40 1 and 38 9 respectively 5 conclusion based on the daily meteorological data of 84 representative stations this study evaluated twelve et0 estimation models four temperature based models five radiation based models and three hybrid models in china and its 4 climatic zones on a daily scale in china and selected the optimal models suitable for each climatic region the woa was used to optimize the optimal empirical model and the result was compared with the elm model the main conclusions are as follows 1 using three kinds of models to estimate the daily et0 of the whole china region the accuracy of the hybrid model was the best followed by the radiation model and the temperature model was relatively poor with r2 ranges of 0 77 0 88 0 60 0 86 and 0 58 0 82 respectively hargreaves samani and improve baier robertsonm models had higher accuracy among the temperature based empirical models with r2 of 0 81 and 0 80 the accuracy of priestley taylor and jensen haise models was the best among the radiation based empirical models with r2 of 0 83 and 0 84 penman model had the best accuracy among the hybrid models with r2 of 0 86 2 in tcz the estimation accuracy of penman model was the best followed by hargreaves samani and improve baier robertsonm models with r2 of 0 86 0 82 and 0 82 in tmz penman and priestley taylor models had the highest accuracy followed by hargreaves samani and improve baier robertsonm models with r2 of 0 85 0 85 0 82 and 0 82 in mpz penman model had the highest accuracy followed by hargreaves samani model with r2 of 0 86 and 0 80 in smz penman model had the highest accuracy followed by the priestley taylor model with r2 of 0 85 and 0 82 respectively 3 the woa can significantly promote the accuracy of the three types of optimal empirical models the accuracy of the optimized temperature radiation and mixed models was increased by 12 05 11 06 and 10 46 which were higher than the results of the elm model with r2 of 0 90 0 91 0 95 and 0 90 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors

3236,stringent pollution control regulations and sustainable development goals have renewed the interest in finding an alternate renewable and sustainable energy resource geothermal energy is one such potential source which needs to be explored this study deals with the geochemical characteristics and reservoir parameters of the major hot springs located in four diverse terrains in india as well as their energy potential in terms of reservoir temperature the west coast springs have mostly na cl ca so4 and na hco3 water types and are likely to be influenced by seawater intrusion through deep penetrating faults and fractures whereas the odisha hot springs show immature water of na cl ca hco3 types the west bengal springs show na cl hco3 water type presumably derived from dissolution of albite at higher temperatures at depths 1 13 km the himalayan springs water are mostly of nahco3 cahco3 nacl and caso4 types and are geochemically more diversified compared to the west coast west bengal and odisha hot springs the estimated reservoir temperatures and reservoir depths are 150 10 c and 2 11 0 2 km 120 5 c and 1 71 0 17 km 100 5 c and 1 13 0 13 km 110 5 c and 1 37 0 32 km for the himalayan west coast west bengal and the odisha geothermal systems respectively keywords geothermal springs reservoir depth reservoir temperature saturation index data availability the data are available in public domain 1 introduction during the past few years there has been growing interest in exploring alternative energy resources that are relatively cleaner and more sustainable than fossil fuels geothermal energy is one such clean relatively pollution free perennial and sustainable alternate energy resource geothermal sources are identified by their surface signatures such as subsurface hot steams active hot springs geysers fumaroles etc kresic 2010 mahala 2019 harnessing geothermal energy as an alternate unconventional resource is increasingly gaining popularity worldwide primarily due to its minimal impacts on the environment and relatively lesser carbon footprints kumar et al 2010 during the last few decades the use of geothermal energy has increased many folds across the world huttrer 2001 bertani 2010 hot springs are suggested to be caused by exothermally heated water rising through fractures due to geothermal gradient and from the heat sources such as radioactive decay in the earth s crust pollack and chapman 1977 turcotte and schubert 2002 natural hot springs primarily due to their enriched mineral contents have been used since ancient times for various activities such as heating cooking drinking laundering balneology crop drying etc cataldi 1999 burgassi 1999 gupta and roy 2006 gunnlaugsson 2008 generally water temperatures above 50 c are considered more suitable for these purposes however water with a temperatures less than 40 c has also been used in absence of any other alternatives bloomquist 2003 the use of geothermal heat pumps has also increased significantly in the recent past although low in capacity lund and toth 2021 india holds the fourth position in energy consumption after the u s a china and russia tripathi et al 2016 the outflow of the foreign exchange required for importing most of the fossil fuels in india is slowly becoming unbearable for the exchequer garg 2012 in the current situation when the governments are focusing on improving the economic conditions of the public finding an alternate energy resource which can be exploited locally may prove beneficial for local economic activities rybach 2003 furthermore with the growing concern about climate change fuelled by the use of fossil fuels the international community is determined to move towards a cleaner energy alternative govt of india has set an ambitious goal of achieving 175gw of renewable energy capacity by the end of 2022 and increasing it to 500gw by 2030 this is 40 of its total installed power capacity and is probably one of the world s greatest renewable energy expansion plans geothermal energy is one of the cleanest renewable alternatives compared to the fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum the geothermal resources in india are relatively less explored and are underdeveloped primarily due to the abundant availability of hydro and thermal power renewed interests in the search for alternate resources have resulted in the identification and installation of pilot projects at a few potential places such as cambay puga valley of ladakh and tatapani chhattisgarh for subsurface geothermal energy exploitation the estimated total geothermal energy potential in india is more than 10 000 mw out of which the himalayan zone itself has the potential for more than 134 mw chandrasekharam 2005 as per lund and toth 2021 the annual geothermal energy uses have increased at a rate of 11 5 annually therefore in this work we have attempted to understand the prospects of geothermal energy in a resource hungry fast developing country of about 1 4 billion people we aim to better understand the appropriate geothermal conditions in the four major geothermal provinces i e the himalayas west coast west bengal and the odisha based on hydro geochemical analysis the characteristic similarities and differences between various geothermal provinces have been discussed with respect to their water types reservoir temperature reservoir depths and fluid circulation depths which are not very well established as discussed below 2 geologicalsettings and the geothermal provinces the geothermal springs in india fig 1 are located in a variety of tectonic terrains ranging from active subduction zone of the himalayas to the passive continental margins of the coastal regions recent studies have identified more than 340 geothermal springs distributed in seven to ten geothermal provinces gsi 1991 singh et al 2016 which are mostly of medium 125 c 200 c to low enthalpy fields less than100 c uppal 2019 strong thermal activity is observed near the indo tsangpo collision suture zone itsz in the northwest himalayas where deep seated fractures of the precambrian crystalline rocks are bounded by the crystalline axis and the central thrust and sedimentary metasedimentary sequences are intruded by ladakh granite and chumathang granite the puga panamik and chumathang hot springs and the himachal pradesh geothermal sub province hpg complex are few of the major sites out of more than 100 locations in himalayas which exhibit high temperature gradient greater than100 c km chandrasekharam 2000 chandrasekharam et al 2003 and high heat flow 150 mw m2 presumably associated with post tertiary granite intrusion and metamorphism chandrasekharam 2000 craig et al 2013 the surface discharge temperature of more than 80 c makes these systems ideal for extraction of the geothermal energy chandrasekharam et al 2003 shukla et al 2017 the foothill himalayan belt on the other hand shows a low temperature gradient 17 5 c km and low heat flow 41 10 mw m2 craig et al 2013 the aravalli province besides the north cambay and the sohana region are other promising geothermal areas located in the eastern parts of rajasthan fig 1 the geological ages in these terrains range from archean to recent a series of ne sw trending faults in the region suggest cyclic and dynamic movement of the various blocks these faults could be working as conduits for deep circulating geothermal fluids whereas the son narmada tapti lineament sonata zone fig 1 is characterized by a thin crust 33 38 km and basement depth of more than 2 5 km rao et al 1997 borehole data indicates more than 100 c temperatures at depths greater than 200 m sarolkar and sharma 2002 the deep insulated granitic igneous bodies in sonata region make this one of the best locations for enhanced geothermal activity in india chandrasekharam 2005 the west coast of india is the second largest geothermal field fig 1 in this region hot springs are distributed within a narrow 20 km 300 km high heat flow zone known as the west coast thermal anomaly negi et al 1992 inter plate tectonics rifting and flood volcanic eruptions 66 25 ma along the western coast are suggested to be the cause of the alignment of intense geothermal activity sheth and chandrasekharam 1997 minissale et al 2000 whereas most of the hot springs of the peninsular india are likely to be related to the graben structures where deep seated faults may be the acting pathways for high heat flow and geothermal fluid circulation however the east coast geothermal provinces godavari and mahanadi belong to the late tertiary to quaternary period or post gondwana stages the dominant fault orientations are mostly in the nw se direction in the gondwana graben most of the major hot springs located in the eastern ghats are confined in the mahanadi geothermal province fig 1 the study of geochemistry of the thermal water provides an indirect clue about various reservoir parameters such as reservoir depth temperature and fluid circulation depths katsanou et al 2012 gu et al 2017 shestakova et al 2018 similarly isotope geochemistry is used to estimate age of the water samples stute et al 1992 zuber et al 1995 kotowski et al 2019 the geothermometers and mineral saturation index are widely used methods for estimating reservoir parameters of the deep medium and low geothermal system fournier and truesdell 1973 na et al 2020 reservoir parameters for the indian geothermal fields are not well established e g the reservoir temperature of the himalayan hot springs is suggested to vary between 120 c and 190 c sarolkar 2018 dubey 1988 and from 150 to 250 c singh et al 2016 estimates of reservoir temperature for the west coast springs also vary widely from a minimum of 100 10 c dubey 1988 to 120 10 c razdan et al 2008 125 150 c minissale et al 2000 singh et al 2014a b and within 125 170 c sarolkar 2018 similarly the reservoir depths are also not well constrained borehole data of the cambay basin in the west coast suggests that reservoir temperature varies between 100 c and 145 c and reservoir depth within a range of 1 7 km to 1 9 km thussu 2002 the reservoir temperature and depth of the west bengal hot spring located at bakreswar has been found to be around 100 5 c and 1 km respectively majumdar et al 2009 whereas for the hot springs located in odisha the reservoir s temperature are within a range of 155 25 45 34 c to 172 63 59 80 c mahala 2019 the reservoir depths are not well constrained recent studies suggest that estimates of the reservoir temperatures determined by chemical geothermometry are unlikely to be realistic yan et al 2017 hou et al 2019 na et al 2020 however it could be better constrained by clustering of the calculated mineral saturation index si curves spycher et al 2016 thus the reservoir parameters of the geothermal springs need to be better constrained 3 data and methodology heat flow data were compiled from global heat flow databases of the internationalheat flowcommission ihfc verma et al 1966 rao and rao 1974 rao et al 1976 rao and rao 1983 gupta et al 1967 1987 1970 1991 1993 roy and rao 2000 2003 ray et al 2003 geothermal water sample data were collected from field surveys published literature and reports cinti et al 2009 craig et al 2013 chandrasekhar et al 2016 chandrasekhar et al 2018 mahala 2019 for the four major tectonic provinces i e the himalayas west coast odisha and west bengal for cross validation fieldwork was conducted in west bengal and odisha during march 2021 and thermal water samples were collected and analysed the total dissolved solids tds ph temperature of water samples c and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ with a portable instrument model

uncertainties may be reduced to a certain extent as discussed by srinivasan et al 2007 variations of several parameters such as ph the surface temperature of spring water total dissolved solids tds sio2 and major ions were studied to understand the similarity and differences in the geochemical characteristics table 1 a flow chart illustrating details of the methodology adopted is shown in fig 2 piper trilinear diagrams were used to understand the thermal water quality in various geothermal provinces from the distributions of major ions concentrations the so4 cl hco3 triangular diagram facilitated understanding of the origin of water while the na k mg trilinear equilibrium diagram giggenbach 1988 was used to indicate fluid rock equilibrium and infer deeper thermal conditions and identify the possible source of geothermal activity the langelier ludwig diagram langelier and ludwig 1942 was used to distinguish the water types based on the geochemical composition of thermal water 3 1 heat flow and thermal gradients the higher heat flow values usually observed in geothermal provinces can be attributed to multiple causes such as degeneration of lithophilic radioactive minerals presence of shallow magmatic intrusive bodies and increased mobilization of deep hydrothermal fluids rogers and callahan 1987 the global mean heat flow is estimated to be 87 mw m2 the total geothermal capacity of 12 8 gw sharma 2019 and the normal geothermal gradient below the earth s surface is 25 c km fridleifsson et al 2008 out of about 44 2tw natural heat flow that occurs through surface conduction about 30tw may be attributed to the radioactive decay of minerals such as uranium thorium potassium etc sanders 2007 variations of the heat flow values and average thermal gradient are shown in fig 3 the maximum heat flow values 100 139 mw m2 are observed in the himalayas mainly in the nw himalayas or in the jammu kashmir sector besides in parts of the sonata lineament west bengal bihar jharkhand central india the godavari graben the west coast region specifically the gujarat and cambay basins and parts of the sohana geothermal provinces where major fracture zones are observed the highest heat flow observed in the himalayas could be due to the presence of high heat producing ladakh and chumathang granites sachan 1996 to harness the geothermal energy power plants have already been installed in chhattisgarh tatapani jammu kashmir puga gujarat cambay graben himachal pradesh manikaran jharkhand and jammu kashmir chumathang the average heat flow in odisha geothermal complex varies between 50 and 70 mw m2 suggesting good potential in the region fig 3a the presence of the rifted granite gneisses and granite containing radioactive elements chandrasekharam et al 2020 such as u th and k reflects the high heat potential in thermal springs located in odisha on the other hand the deccan flood basalts and post trappean dykes may have enhanced the heat flow in the west coast region 3 2 geochemical and geothermometry one of the aims of studying the geothermal field is to estimate the reservoir temperature geothermometric measurements provide an indirect assessment of the reservoir temperature based on the equilibrium of minerals in the water estimates of reservoir temperature are often made using quartz cationic and anionic i e na k na k ca geothermometers however estimates of the reservoir temperature are often non unique because loss of the volatile components from geothermal systems may significantly influence the estimates uncertainty in estimates of reservoir temperature may also arise due to the mixing of shallow groundwater disturbing the equilibration conditions some of the important geothermometers used to determine the reservoir temperatures are listed below quartz geothermometer fournier and potter 1982 1 t c 42 198 0 29 s 3 668 10 4 4 s 2 3 167 10 7 s 3 77 034 log s where s sio2 concentration is in ppm na k ca geothermometer fournier and truesdell 1973 t c 1647 log na k Î² log c a 0 5 na 2 06 2 47 273 where Î² 4 3 for ca na greater than 1 or Î² 1 3 for ca na less than 1 na k ca concentrations are in ppm na k geothermometers truesdell 1976 t c 856 0 857 l o g na k 273 na k geothermometers giggenbach 1988 t c 1390 1 75 l o g na k 273 the most reliable estimate of reservoir temperature can be obtained from the na k mg diagram giggenbach 1988 developed a geothermometer scale by combination of na k and k m g thermometer ternary diagram fig 4 which is useful for determining extent of equilibrium between the geothermal fluid and the host rock this method is based on the differencing rates of the two cation exchange reactions where the k mg reaction responds relatively faster to temperature changes than the na k reaction the trilinear diagram classifies the thermal water type into three distinct categories i e immature partial equilibrium or semi mature and in full equilibrium conditions the hot springs of odisha west bengal and the himalayas belong to an immature equilibrium field the immature water type suggests that hot spring water is originating in unstable conditions and may be mixed with shallow subsurface water when ascending to the surface thus having a short residence period the hot springs of the west coast belong to the partial equilibrium or mature water type suggesting fluid penetrating within the rock with a high residence time none of the hot spring water belongs to the full equilibrium field 3 3 mineral saturation index the mineral saturation index is used to calculate and predict the state of equilibrium condition of mineral assemblages present in the thermal water system although this method gives approximate reservoir temperature it is especially useful when most of the water is in an immature state or an in equilibrium condition giggenbach 1988 a saturation index si value of approximately zero indicates a complete equilibrium between water and the mineral while a positive value suggests an oversaturated condition when mineral will tend to precipitate and a negative value indicates an under saturated condition when mineral may be dissolved gemici and filiz 2001 thus the temperature where most of the mineral assemblages tend to converge si 0 represents an equilibrium condition between rock water and thereby indicates the approximate reservoir temperature tole et al 1993 the mineral phases considered belong to the common lithotypes i e the carbonate rock type represented by calcite aragonite and dolomite clastic and the igneous rock types represented by feldspars anorthite albite k feldspar siliceous minerals such as quartz and chalcedony and clay mineral kaolinite evaporites such as gypsum and anhydrite these mineralogical compositions are used to predict the approximate range of reservoir temperature table 1 shows the estimated reservoir temperature utilizing mineral equilibrium phases and the saturation index estimated from a geochemical database as well as the multicomponent geothermometry approach reed and spycher 1984 spycher et al 2016 4 results and discussions 4 1 composition of thermal waters the major geochemical compositions fig 5 a depict four major groups of water types each having a distinct geochemical characteristic group a is mainly caso4 water with medium to high salinity indicating deep fluid circulation and dissolution of evaporites gypsum relatively high concentration of so4 compared to other anions may be due to oxidation of h2s rich gas originating by decomposition of organic matters at shallow depths in the sedimentary formations and or sulphates leaching from evaporitic layers tassi et al 2006 thus sulphates found in himalayan and a few springs on the west coast are probably formed by the oxidations of h2s gas or by water rock interactions sarolkar 2005 group b comprises water from the himalayan springs and is primarily ca hco3 water facies fig 5a indicating intermixing of shallow groundwater and carbonate minerals with low to high salinity water derived from the melting of snow and precipitation moving through the soil bedrock and subsurface may have mixed with the thermal water moving in the upward direction group c comprises spring samples mostly from the himalayas and a few from the west coast this group shows na hco3 water facies the water from these sites may be associated with co2 rich fluid and igneous rocks where feldspars are converted into kaolinite clay bearing minerals producing na k and hco3 rich aqueous solutions drever 1997 minissale et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 the co2 rich samples represent water discharging at the periphery of the main hydrothermal systems giggenbach 1988 group d is na cl rich water with medium to high salinity fig 5a this group may be attributed to the mixing of brine or saline seawater and dissolution of evaporite mineral phases present in marine sediment or carried by geothermal fluids the odisha springs show comparatively low na cl ratio 0 53 to 0 76 mg l and higher cl so4 2 ratio 0 5091 24 mg l the ratios of na cl and cl so4 2 are used to assess the degree of seawater contamination of thermal water pitale et al 1987 found a high level of chloride in well water near hot springs on the west coast indicating a zone where marine water and shallow groundwater interact the seawater inter mixing in the coastal areas can take place via faults and fractures pitale et al 1987 prusty and farooq 2020 rajeev et al 2021 goswami and rai 2022 and under suitable hydrodynamic conditions pacheco castro et al 2021 such as during the tides etc and enhance the concentration of na cl on the other hand the composition of the himalayan thermal springs is very diverse and only a few are of na cl water type highly saline fluids na cl type are found in ladakh granite 60 ma as inclusions which are attributed to the high volatile content in the granitic melts sachan 1996 geochemical data were plotted in the cl so4 hco3 ternary diagram fig 5b this diagram helps to distinguish between mature immature geothermal fluids and unstable water the ternary diagram indicates that water plotted in the hco3 field may be influenced by the mixing process of the oceanic saline water with the peripheral shallow water hot springs on the west coast of india and odisha show enrichment of chloride cl indicating possible intrusion of saline water as discussed earlier another group of springs appears to be affected by intermixing between the dissolution of evaporites such as gypsum or anhydrite found in the marine sediments and geothermal brines some of the hot springs fig 5b of odisha and the west coast are cl water type trending towards mature water whereas the himalayan springs which are rich in so4 2 may have derived from dissolved gypsum mixing of the ca so4 water type fig 5a or mixing of volcanic gases singh et al 2014a b better insight into the dominant water types and the relationship between various ionic concentrations can be determined using method suggested by piper 1944 fig 5c it is evident from the figure that the dominant thermal water facies of the himalayan springs are na ca cl hco3 na ca hco3 cl na so4 hco3 cl and ca na hco3 cl so4 however variances within the tds range 100 mg l to 2830 mg l of the himalayan springs reflect that the thermal water is interacting with groundwater and connate water in geologically active tectonic settings geochemically thermal water having a high hco3 concentration 9 mg l to 1610 mg l indicates dissolution carbonates or maybe of gaseous co2 migrating from a deeper bedrock or present in the soil air whereas high so4 2 concentration 9 mg l to 383 mg l indicates possible mingling with volcanic gas which is highly likely for hot springs in the himalayan zone which is tectonically very active furthermore fig 5c indicates that most of the hot spring water on the west coast are ca na cl na ca cl na ca hco3 cl na cl so4 na ca mg cl and ca na mg cl so4 types the major dominant ions ca2 cl and so4 2 in the west coast springs indicate that the zone is infiltrated with 1 5 saline intrusion possibly due to seawater and basalt interactions at elevated temperatures muthuraman 1986 the thermal water from west bengal is mostly na cl hco3 type the bakreswar hot spring of west bengal might be linked with the eastern part of the sonata lineament within peninsular india spring waters are relatively alkaline ph varies from 9 0 to 8 67 with moderate tds 340 to 350 mg l high na 112 to 118 mg l low ca2 2 4 to 3 2 mg l and k 3 2 to 3 7 mg l concentrations ion exchange process may be the dominant mechanism brady and krumhansl 2012 xie et al 2017 for high na content derived from dissolutions of albite at higher temperatures at deeper depths whereas low ca2 and k concentrations may be due to stable phases of calcite and k feldspar in the geothermal system increasing cl concentration 85 to 92 mg l might also suggest the leaching from deep bedrock the major water types of the odisha springs are na cl na hco3 ca hco3 and ca mg hco3 so4 cl fig 5c the geophysical studies show the existence of a vertically faulted margin along with the presence of granite and syenite of age ranging from archean to proterozoic at deeper levels nayak et al 1998 the existence of fractured granite terrains is likely moving hot water via shear zones deep cracks and fault planes increasing na cl and ca2 concentrations which are further amplified by interaction with pure seawater 4 2 mineral saturation states si the precipitation of minerals results from the incongruent dissolution for minerals such as calcite chalcedony quartz and anhydrite the solubility constants are well known however uncertainty may arise for other mineral phases due to the dependence of the solubility on temperature blasco et al 2018 srinivasan et al 2007 our study indicates that gypsum and anhydrite minerals are undersaturated for all thermal spring water suggesting dissolution of so4 2 in the reservoir aquifer fig 6 the himalayas west coast and the west bengal thermal waters have chalcedony and quartz at or just above the equilibrium line and strong temperature features the saturation point fig 6 the himalayan thermal springs are oversaturated with respect to dolomite and tend to precipitate at their outlet temperature removal of co2 from the solution at atmospheric pressure ultimately raises the ph of the solution resulting in calcite precipitation in the discharge region shestakova et al 2018 the springs water from odisha are undersaturated with respect to mineral anhydrite aragonite calcite dolomite and gypsum at their discharge average temperature and shows a lack of tendency to precipitate fig 6 4 3 reservoir temperature multi geothermometry was used to estimate the average values of reservoir temperature and depths the reservoir temperature for the himalayan west coast west bengal and odisha springs were estimated using various geothermometers discussed earlier eq 1 4 the quartz and na k ca geothermometer eq 1 2 are more appropriate than the cation geothermometers for immature waters and predicts reliable temperature for himalayan west coast odisha and west bengal geothermal systems compared to na k geothermometers eq 3 4 the chemical multi geothermometry for estimating reservoir temperature is not reliable due to mixing of different types of water in the thermal equilibrium system the na k mg ternary diagram indicates that all samples fall into the immature equilibrium field fig 4 which is consistent with earlier studies shestakova et al 2018 therefore cation geothermometers table 2 are unreliable for predicting accurate equilibration temperature of the reservoirs the mineral assemblages of himalayan springs converge si 0 to an average equilibrium temperature between 140 and 160 c fig 6 which is largely in agreement with values obtained with the na k ca geothermometer 145 6 39 c the mineral assemblages of west coast springs seem to cluster si 0 at an average equilibrium temperature between 115 and 125 c which is more or less similar to the reservoir temperature 133 3 13 1 c estimated with a sio2 geothermometer mineral assemblages of the west bengal seem to converge to equilibrium temperature at around 95 105 c this is in agreement with values obtained with na k ca geothermometer 95 9 2 38 c the thermal water of odisha shows lack of tendency to precipitate because its mineral assemblages anhydrite aragonite calcite dolomite and gypsum are in undersaturated conditions si convergence is not observed because mineralogical assemblages have a tendency to dissolve in the reservoir system but the mineral phases like calcite and dolomite appear to be in equilibrium si 0 at 105 115 c temperature which is in agreement with values obtained with the na k ca geothermometer 107 1 31 59 c however clustering of the saturation index curves for some of the minerals is relatively poor fig 7 therefore a multicomponent geothermometry which is a statistical saturation simulation method was used spycher et al 2016 the temperature of the reservoir is determined by clustering of log q k curves to 0 i e si 0 at a given temperature reed and spycher 1984 the clustering is considered good if minimum of log q k is less than 0 1 where k is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and q is the activity coefficients na et al 2020 fig 7 shows value of log q k statistics and the corresponding estimated reservoir temperatures which are found to be 150 10 c 120 5 c 100 5 c and 110 5 c for the himalaya west coast west bengal and odisha geothermal systems respectively 4 4 reservoir temperature reservoir depth and fluid circulation depths the chemical multi geothermometry for reservoir depth estimations may not be reliable table 2 the depth of reservoir h can be estimated using the following equation shestakova et al 2018 h t 1 t 0 Î³ 5 where h is the reservoir depth km t1 is the estimated reservoir temperature c using si t0 is the average surface discharge temperature and Î³ is the average geothermal gradient c km whereas the geothermal fluids circulation depth h in km is given by equation 6 na et al 2020 h g t 1 t 0 h 0 6 where g is the reciprocal of the geothermal degree t1 and t0 are the estimated and average reservoir temperatures in degree centigrade and h0 is the geothermal atmospheric temperature zone depth m our analysis table 3 indicates that the reservoir and geothermal fluid circulation depths of the himalaya and west coast springs are deeper compared to odisha and west bengal 5 conclusions in this paper we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the four major geothermal provinces of india to better constrain the reservoir characteristics the major water types that were identified are ca so4 ca hco3 na hco3 and na cl suggesting different mechanisms controlling the water geochemistry fig 5a analysis of langelier ludwig and cl so4 hco3 ternary diagram indicates that seawater rock interactions were the dominant mechanisms controlling the water type of the west coast and odisha thermal springs furthermore it is evident from the correlation matrix table 4 that na and cl are strongly correlated r 0 912 0 998 along with tds and cl r 0 998 0 974 for both the west coast and odisha this further supports the hypothesis that seawater rock interaction may be a dominant mechanism in the region whereas it is evident from fig 5 that the water rock interaction gaseous shallow groundwater and mixing processes may be the major factors controlling the water type of the himalayas hot springs our study revealed that the thermal water of the himalayan west coast and west bengal hot springs are oversaturated with respect to albite calcite chalcedony k feldspar kaolinite and quartz which have a tendency to precipitate at the discharge temperatures the reservoir temperatures were better constrained by clustering of the mineral saturation index si method the estimated reservoir temperature values of himalayan spring 150 10 c and the west coast springs 120 5 c are higher than the west bengal and odisha springs the region is also known for high heat flow values 100 139 mw m2 fig 3a suggesting good potential for geothermal energy extraction furthermore the reservoir depths and the geothermal fluid circulation depths for the himalayan 2 11 0 2 km 2 14 0 2 km and the west coast thermal springs 1 71 0 17 1 74 0 17 km are more than those of odisha 1 37 0 32 1 41 0 32 km and the west bengal 1 13 0 13 1 16 0 13 km schematic diagram showing various mechanisms for geothermal fluid circulations are shown in fig 8 further table 5 shows the basic swot analysis of the studied geothermal springs indicating the strength weakness and threats related development of these fields for the purpose of the geothermal energy extraction the himalayan hot springs appears to have better prospects for development of geothermal energy however other fields such as those of odisha and west bengal may also be developed with the help of suitable technologies declaration of competing

3236,stringent pollution control regulations and sustainable development goals have renewed the interest in finding an alternate renewable and sustainable energy resource geothermal energy is one such potential source which needs to be explored this study deals with the geochemical characteristics and reservoir parameters of the major hot springs located in four diverse terrains in india as well as their energy potential in terms of reservoir temperature the west coast springs have mostly na cl ca so4 and na hco3 water types and are likely to be influenced by seawater intrusion through deep penetrating faults and fractures whereas the odisha hot springs show immature water of na cl ca hco3 types the west bengal springs show na cl hco3 water type presumably derived from dissolution of albite at higher temperatures at depths 1 13 km the himalayan springs water are mostly of nahco3 cahco3 nacl and caso4 types and are geochemically more diversified compared to the west coast west bengal and odisha hot springs the estimated reservoir temperatures and reservoir depths are 150 10 c and 2 11 0 2 km 120 5 c and 1 71 0 17 km 100 5 c and 1 13 0 13 km 110 5 c and 1 37 0 32 km for the himalayan west coast west bengal and the odisha geothermal systems respectively keywords geothermal springs reservoir depth reservoir temperature saturation index data availability the data are available in public domain 1 introduction during the past few years there has been growing interest in exploring alternative energy resources that are relatively cleaner and more sustainable than fossil fuels geothermal energy is one such clean relatively pollution free perennial and sustainable alternate energy resource geothermal sources are identified by their surface signatures such as subsurface hot steams active hot springs geysers fumaroles etc kresic 2010 mahala 2019 harnessing geothermal energy as an alternate unconventional resource is increasingly gaining popularity worldwide primarily due to its minimal impacts on the environment and relatively lesser carbon footprints kumar et al 2010 during the last few decades the use of geothermal energy has increased many folds across the world huttrer 2001 bertani 2010 hot springs are suggested to be caused by exothermally heated water rising through fractures due to geothermal gradient and from the heat sources such as radioactive decay in the earth s crust pollack and chapman 1977 turcotte and schubert 2002 natural hot springs primarily due to their enriched mineral contents have been used since ancient times for various activities such as heating cooking drinking laundering balneology crop drying etc cataldi 1999 burgassi 1999 gupta and roy 2006 gunnlaugsson 2008 generally water temperatures above 50 c are considered more suitable for these purposes however water with a temperatures less than 40 c has also been used in absence of any other alternatives bloomquist 2003 the use of geothermal heat pumps has also increased significantly in the recent past although low in capacity lund and toth 2021 india holds the fourth position in energy consumption after the u s a china and russia tripathi et al 2016 the outflow of the foreign exchange required for importing most of the fossil fuels in india is slowly becoming unbearable for the exchequer garg 2012 in the current situation when the governments are focusing on improving the economic conditions of the public finding an alternate energy resource which can be exploited locally may prove beneficial for local economic activities rybach 2003 furthermore with the growing concern about climate change fuelled by the use of fossil fuels the international community is determined to move towards a cleaner energy alternative govt of india has set an ambitious goal of achieving 175gw of renewable energy capacity by the end of 2022 and increasing it to 500gw by 2030 this is 40 of its total installed power capacity and is probably one of the world s greatest renewable energy expansion plans geothermal energy is one of the cleanest renewable alternatives compared to the fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum the geothermal resources in india are relatively less explored and are underdeveloped primarily due to the abundant availability of hydro and thermal power renewed interests in the search for alternate resources have resulted in the identification and installation of pilot projects at a few potential places such as cambay puga valley of ladakh and tatapani chhattisgarh for subsurface geothermal energy exploitation the estimated total geothermal energy potential in india is more than 10 000 mw out of which the himalayan zone itself has the potential for more than 134 mw chandrasekharam 2005 as per lund and toth 2021 the annual geothermal energy uses have increased at a rate of 11 5 annually therefore in this work we have attempted to understand the prospects of geothermal energy in a resource hungry fast developing country of about 1 4 billion people we aim to better understand the appropriate geothermal conditions in the four major geothermal provinces i e the himalayas west coast west bengal and the odisha based on hydro geochemical analysis the characteristic similarities and differences between various geothermal provinces have been discussed with respect to their water types reservoir temperature reservoir depths and fluid circulation depths which are not very well established as discussed below 2 geologicalsettings and the geothermal provinces the geothermal springs in india fig 1 are located in a variety of tectonic terrains ranging from active subduction zone of the himalayas to the passive continental margins of the coastal regions recent studies have identified more than 340 geothermal springs distributed in seven to ten geothermal provinces gsi 1991 singh et al 2016 which are mostly of medium 125 c 200 c to low enthalpy fields less than100 c uppal 2019 strong thermal activity is observed near the indo tsangpo collision suture zone itsz in the northwest himalayas where deep seated fractures of the precambrian crystalline rocks are bounded by the crystalline axis and the central thrust and sedimentary metasedimentary sequences are intruded by ladakh granite and chumathang granite the puga panamik and chumathang hot springs and the himachal pradesh geothermal sub province hpg complex are few of the major sites out of more than 100 locations in himalayas which exhibit high temperature gradient greater than100 c km chandrasekharam 2000 chandrasekharam et al 2003 and high heat flow 150 mw m2 presumably associated with post tertiary granite intrusion and metamorphism chandrasekharam 2000 craig et al 2013 the surface discharge temperature of more than 80 c makes these systems ideal for extraction of the geothermal energy chandrasekharam et al 2003 shukla et al 2017 the foothill himalayan belt on the other hand shows a low temperature gradient 17 5 c km and low heat flow 41 10 mw m2 craig et al 2013 the aravalli province besides the north cambay and the sohana region are other promising geothermal areas located in the eastern parts of rajasthan fig 1 the geological ages in these terrains range from archean to recent a series of ne sw trending faults in the region suggest cyclic and dynamic movement of the various blocks these faults could be working as conduits for deep circulating geothermal fluids whereas the son narmada tapti lineament sonata zone fig 1 is characterized by a thin crust 33 38 km and basement depth of more than 2 5 km rao et al 1997 borehole data indicates more than 100 c temperatures at depths greater than 200 m sarolkar and sharma 2002 the deep insulated granitic igneous bodies in sonata region make this one of the best locations for enhanced geothermal activity in india chandrasekharam 2005 the west coast of india is the second largest geothermal field fig 1 in this region hot springs are distributed within a narrow 20 km 300 km high heat flow zone known as the west coast thermal anomaly negi et al 1992 inter plate tectonics rifting and flood volcanic eruptions 66 25 ma along the western coast are suggested to be the cause of the alignment of intense geothermal activity sheth and chandrasekharam 1997 minissale et al 2000 whereas most of the hot springs of the peninsular india are likely to be related to the graben structures where deep seated faults may be the acting pathways for high heat flow and geothermal fluid circulation however the east coast geothermal provinces godavari and mahanadi belong to the late tertiary to quaternary period or post gondwana stages the dominant fault orientations are mostly in the nw se direction in the gondwana graben most of the major hot springs located in the eastern ghats are confined in the mahanadi geothermal province fig 1 the study of geochemistry of the thermal water provides an indirect clue about various reservoir parameters such as reservoir depth temperature and fluid circulation depths katsanou et al 2012 gu et al 2017 shestakova et al 2018 similarly isotope geochemistry is used to estimate age of the water samples stute et al 1992 zuber et al 1995 kotowski et al 2019 the geothermometers and mineral saturation index are widely used methods for estimating reservoir parameters of the deep medium and low geothermal system fournier and truesdell 1973 na et al 2020 reservoir parameters for the indian geothermal fields are not well established e g the reservoir temperature of the himalayan hot springs is suggested to vary between 120 c and 190 c sarolkar 2018 dubey 1988 and from 150 to 250 c singh et al 2016 estimates of reservoir temperature for the west coast springs also vary widely from a minimum of 100 10 c dubey 1988 to 120 10 c razdan et al 2008 125 150 c minissale et al 2000 singh et al 2014a b and within 125 170 c sarolkar 2018 similarly the reservoir depths are also not well constrained borehole data of the cambay basin in the west coast suggests that reservoir temperature varies between 100 c and 145 c and reservoir depth within a range of 1 7 km to 1 9 km thussu 2002 the reservoir temperature and depth of the west bengal hot spring located at bakreswar has been found to be around 100 5 c and 1 km respectively majumdar et al 2009 whereas for the hot springs located in odisha the reservoir s temperature are within a range of 155 25 45 34 c to 172 63 59 80 c mahala 2019 the reservoir depths are not well constrained recent studies suggest that estimates of the reservoir temperatures determined by chemical geothermometry are unlikely to be realistic yan et al 2017 hou et al 2019 na et al 2020 however it could be better constrained by clustering of the calculated mineral saturation index si curves spycher et al 2016 thus the reservoir parameters of the geothermal springs need to be better constrained 3 data and methodology heat flow data were

facilitated understanding of the origin of water while the na k mg trilinear equilibrium diagram giggenbach 1988 was used to indicate fluid rock equilibrium and infer deeper thermal conditions and identify the possible source of geothermal activity the langelier ludwig diagram langelier and ludwig 1942 was used to distinguish the water types based on the geochemical composition of thermal water 3 1 heat flow and thermal gradients the higher heat flow values usually observed in geothermal provinces can be attributed to multiple causes such as degeneration of lithophilic radioactive minerals presence of shallow magmatic intrusive bodies and increased mobilization of deep hydrothermal fluids rogers and callahan 1987 the global mean heat flow is estimated to be 87 mw m2 the total geothermal capacity of 12 8 gw sharma 2019 and the normal geothermal gradient below the earth s surface is 25 c km fridleifsson et al 2008 out of about 44 2tw natural heat flow that occurs through surface conduction about 30tw may be attributed to the radioactive decay of minerals such as uranium thorium potassium etc sanders 2007 variations of the heat flow values and average thermal gradient are shown in fig 3 the maximum heat flow values 100 139 mw m2 are observed in the himalayas mainly in the nw himalayas or in the jammu kashmir sector besides in parts of the sonata lineament west bengal bihar jharkhand central india the godavari graben the west coast region specifically the gujarat and cambay basins and parts of the sohana geothermal provinces where major fracture zones are observed the highest heat flow observed in the himalayas could be due to the presence of high heat producing ladakh and chumathang granites sachan 1996 to harness the geothermal energy power plants have already been installed in chhattisgarh tatapani jammu kashmir puga gujarat cambay graben himachal pradesh manikaran jharkhand and jammu kashmir chumathang the average heat flow in odisha geothermal complex varies between 50 and 70 mw m2 suggesting good potential in the region fig 3a the presence of the rifted granite gneisses and granite containing radioactive elements chandrasekharam et al 2020 such as u th and k reflects the high heat potential in thermal springs located in odisha on the other hand the deccan flood basalts and post trappean dykes may have enhanced the heat flow in the west coast region 3 2 geochemical and geothermometry one of the aims of studying the geothermal field is to estimate the reservoir temperature geothermometric measurements provide an indirect assessment of the reservoir temperature based on the equilibrium of minerals in the water estimates of reservoir temperature are often made using quartz cationic and anionic i e na k na k ca geothermometers however estimates of the reservoir temperature are often non unique because loss of the volatile components from geothermal systems may significantly influence the estimates uncertainty in estimates of reservoir temperature may also arise due to the mixing of shallow groundwater disturbing the equilibration conditions some of the important geothermometers used to determine the reservoir temperatures are listed below quartz geothermometer fournier and potter 1982 1 t c 42 198 0 29 s 3 668 10 4 4 s 2 3 167 10 7 s 3 77 034 log s where s sio2 concentration is in ppm na k ca geothermometer fournier and truesdell 1973 t c 1647 log na k Î² log c a 0 5 na 2 06 2 47 273 where Î² 4 3 for ca na greater than 1 or Î² 1 3 for ca na less than 1 na k ca concentrations are in ppm na k geothermometers truesdell 1976 t c 856 0 857 l o g na k 273 na k geothermometers giggenbach 1988 t c 1390 1 75 l o g na k 273 the most reliable estimate of reservoir temperature can be obtained from the na k mg diagram giggenbach 1988 developed a geothermometer scale by combination of na k and k m g thermometer ternary diagram fig 4 which is useful for determining extent of equilibrium between the geothermal fluid and the host rock this method is based on the differencing rates of the two cation exchange reactions where the k mg reaction responds relatively faster to temperature changes than the na k reaction the trilinear diagram classifies the thermal water type into three distinct categories i e immature partial equilibrium or semi mature and in full equilibrium conditions the hot springs of odisha west bengal and the himalayas belong to an immature equilibrium field the immature water type suggests that hot spring water is originating in unstable conditions and may be mixed with shallow subsurface water when ascending to the surface thus having a short residence period the hot springs of the west coast belong to the partial equilibrium or mature water type suggesting fluid penetrating within the rock with a high residence time none of the hot spring water belongs to the full equilibrium field 3 3 mineral saturation index the mineral saturation index is used to calculate and predict the state of equilibrium condition of mineral assemblages present in the thermal water system although this method gives approximate reservoir temperature it is especially useful when most of the water is in an immature state or an in equilibrium condition giggenbach 1988 a saturation index si value of approximately zero indicates a complete equilibrium between water and the mineral while a positive value suggests an oversaturated condition when mineral will tend to precipitate and a negative value indicates an under saturated condition when mineral may be dissolved gemici and filiz 2001 thus the temperature where most of the mineral assemblages tend to converge si 0 represents an equilibrium condition between rock water and thereby indicates the approximate reservoir temperature tole et al 1993 the mineral phases considered belong to the common lithotypes i e the carbonate rock type represented by calcite aragonite and dolomite clastic and the igneous rock types represented by feldspars anorthite albite k feldspar siliceous minerals such as quartz and chalcedony and clay mineral kaolinite evaporites such as gypsum and anhydrite these mineralogical compositions are used to predict the approximate range of reservoir temperature table 1 shows the estimated reservoir temperature utilizing mineral equilibrium phases and the saturation index estimated from a geochemical database as well as the multicomponent geothermometry approach reed and spycher 1984 spycher et al 2016 4 results and discussions 4 1 composition of thermal waters the major geochemical compositions fig 5 a depict four major groups of water types each having a distinct geochemical characteristic group a is mainly caso4 water with medium to high salinity indicating deep fluid circulation and dissolution of evaporites gypsum relatively high concentration of so4 compared to other anions may be due to oxidation of h2s rich gas originating by decomposition of organic matters at shallow depths in the sedimentary formations and or sulphates leaching from evaporitic layers tassi et al 2006 thus sulphates found in himalayan and a few springs on the west coast are probably formed by the oxidations of h2s gas or by water rock interactions sarolkar 2005 group b comprises water from the himalayan springs and is primarily ca hco3 water facies fig 5a indicating intermixing of shallow groundwater and carbonate minerals with low to high salinity water derived from the melting of snow and precipitation moving through the soil bedrock and subsurface may have mixed with the thermal water moving in the upward direction group c comprises spring samples mostly from the himalayas and a few from the west coast this group shows na hco3 water facies the water from these sites may be associated with co2 rich fluid and igneous rocks where feldspars are converted into kaolinite clay bearing minerals producing na k and hco3 rich aqueous solutions drever 1997 minissale et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 the co2 rich samples represent water discharging at the periphery of the main hydrothermal systems giggenbach 1988 group d is na cl rich water with medium to high salinity fig 5a this group may be attributed to the mixing of brine or saline seawater and dissolution of evaporite mineral phases present in marine sediment or carried by geothermal fluids the odisha springs show comparatively low na cl ratio 0 53 to 0 76 mg l and higher cl so4 2 ratio 0 5091 24 mg l the ratios of na cl and cl so4 2 are used to assess the degree of seawater contamination of thermal water pitale et al 1987 found a high level of chloride in well water near hot springs on the west coast indicating a zone where marine water and shallow groundwater interact the seawater inter mixing in the coastal areas can take place via faults and fractures pitale et al 1987 prusty and farooq 2020 rajeev et al 2021 goswami and rai 2022 and under suitable hydrodynamic conditions pacheco castro et al 2021 such as during the tides etc and enhance the concentration of na cl on the other hand the composition of the himalayan thermal springs is very diverse and only a few are of na cl water type highly saline fluids na cl type are found in ladakh granite 60 ma as inclusions which are attributed to the high volatile content in the granitic melts sachan 1996 geochemical data were plotted in the cl so4 hco3 ternary diagram fig 5b this diagram helps to distinguish between mature immature geothermal fluids and unstable water the ternary diagram indicates that water plotted in the hco3 field may be influenced by the mixing process of the oceanic saline water with the peripheral shallow water hot springs on the west coast of india and odisha show enrichment of chloride cl indicating possible intrusion of saline water as discussed earlier another group of springs appears to be affected by intermixing between the dissolution of evaporites such as gypsum or anhydrite found in the marine sediments and geothermal brines some of the hot springs fig 5b of odisha and the west coast are cl water type trending towards mature water whereas the himalayan springs which are rich in so4 2 may have derived from dissolved gypsum mixing of the ca so4 water type fig 5a or mixing of volcanic gases singh et al 2014a b better insight into the dominant water types and the relationship between various ionic concentrations can be determined using method suggested by piper 1944 fig 5c it is evident from the figure that the dominant thermal water facies of the himalayan springs are na ca cl hco3 na ca hco3 cl na so4 hco3 cl and ca na hco3 cl so4 however variances within the tds range 100 mg l to 2830 mg l of the himalayan springs reflect that the thermal water is interacting with groundwater and connate water in geologically active tectonic settings geochemically thermal water having a high hco3 concentration 9 mg l to 1610 mg l indicates dissolution carbonates or maybe of gaseous co2 migrating from a deeper bedrock or present in the soil air whereas high so4 2 concentration 9 mg l to 383 mg l indicates possible mingling with volcanic gas which is highly likely for hot springs in the himalayan zone which is tectonically very active furthermore fig 5c indicates that most of the hot spring water on the west coast are ca na cl na ca cl na ca hco3 cl na cl so4 na ca mg cl and ca na mg cl so4 types the major dominant ions ca2 cl and so4 2 in the west coast springs indicate that the zone is infiltrated with 1 5 saline intrusion possibly due to seawater and basalt interactions at elevated temperatures muthuraman 1986 the thermal water from west bengal is mostly na cl hco3 type the bakreswar hot spring of west bengal might be linked with the eastern part of the sonata lineament within peninsular india spring waters are relatively alkaline ph varies from 9 0 to 8 67 with moderate tds 340 to 350 mg l high na 112 to 118 mg l low ca2 2 4 to 3 2 mg l and k 3 2 to 3 7 mg l concentrations ion exchange process may be the dominant mechanism brady and krumhansl 2012 xie et al 2017 for high na content derived from dissolutions of albite at higher temperatures at deeper depths whereas low ca2 and k concentrations may be due to stable phases of calcite and k feldspar in the geothermal system increasing cl concentration 85 to 92 mg l might also suggest the leaching from deep bedrock the major water types of the odisha springs are na cl na hco3 ca hco3 and ca mg hco3 so4 cl fig 5c the geophysical studies show the existence of a vertically faulted margin along with the presence of granite and syenite of age ranging from archean to proterozoic at deeper levels nayak et al 1998 the existence of fractured granite terrains is likely moving hot water via shear zones deep cracks and fault planes increasing na cl and ca2 concentrations which are further amplified by interaction with pure seawater 4 2 mineral saturation states si the precipitation of minerals results from the incongruent dissolution for minerals such as calcite chalcedony quartz and anhydrite the solubility constants are well known however uncertainty may arise for other mineral phases due to the dependence of the solubility on temperature blasco et al 2018 srinivasan et al 2007 our study indicates that gypsum and anhydrite minerals are undersaturated for all thermal spring water suggesting dissolution of so4 2 in the reservoir aquifer fig 6 the himalayas west coast and the west bengal thermal waters have chalcedony and quartz at or just above the equilibrium line and strong temperature features the saturation point fig 6 the himalayan thermal springs are oversaturated with respect to dolomite and tend to precipitate at their outlet temperature removal of co2 from the solution at atmospheric pressure ultimately raises the ph of the solution resulting in calcite precipitation in the discharge region shestakova et al 2018 the springs water from odisha are undersaturated with respect to mineral anhydrite aragonite calcite dolomite and gypsum at their discharge average temperature and shows a lack of tendency to precipitate fig 6 4 3 reservoir temperature multi geothermometry was used to estimate the average values of reservoir temperature and depths the reservoir temperature for the himalayan west coast west bengal and odisha springs were estimated using various geothermometers discussed earlier eq 1 4 the quartz and na k ca geothermometer eq 1 2 are more appropriate than the cation geothermometers for immature waters and predicts reliable temperature for himalayan west coast odisha and west bengal geothermal systems compared to na k geothermometers eq 3 4 the chemical multi geothermometry for estimating reservoir temperature is not reliable due to mixing of different types of water in the thermal equilibrium system the na k mg ternary diagram indicates that all samples fall into the immature equilibrium field fig 4 which is consistent with earlier studies shestakova et al 2018 therefore cation geothermometers table 2 are unreliable for predicting accurate equilibration temperature of the reservoirs the mineral assemblages of himalayan springs converge si 0 to an average equilibrium temperature between 140 and 160 c fig 6 which is largely in agreement with values obtained with the na k ca geothermometer 145 6 39 c the mineral assemblages of west coast springs seem to cluster si 0 at an average equilibrium temperature between 115 and 125 c which is more or less similar to the reservoir temperature 133 3 13 1 c estimated with a sio2 geothermometer mineral assemblages of the west bengal seem to converge to equilibrium temperature at around 95 105 c this is in agreement with values obtained with na k ca geothermometer 95 9 2 38 c the thermal water of odisha shows lack of tendency to precipitate because its mineral assemblages anhydrite aragonite calcite dolomite and gypsum are in undersaturated conditions si convergence is not observed because mineralogical assemblages have a tendency to dissolve in the reservoir system but the mineral phases like calcite and dolomite appear to be in equilibrium si 0 at 105 115 c temperature which is in agreement with values obtained with the na k ca geothermometer 107 1 31 59 c however clustering of the saturation index curves for some of the minerals is relatively poor fig 7 therefore a multicomponent geothermometry which is a statistical saturation simulation method was used spycher et al 2016 the temperature of the reservoir is determined by clustering of log q k curves to 0 i e si 0 at a given temperature reed and spycher 1984 the clustering is considered good if minimum of log q k is less than 0 1 where k is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and q is the activity coefficients na et al 2020 fig 7 shows value of log q k statistics and the corresponding estimated reservoir temperatures which are found to be 150 10 c 120 5 c 100 5 c and 110 5 c for the himalaya west coast west bengal and odisha geothermal systems respectively 4 4 reservoir temperature reservoir depth and fluid circulation depths the chemical multi geothermometry for reservoir depth estimations may not be reliable table 2 the depth of reservoir h can be estimated using the following equation shestakova et al 2018 h t 1 t 0 Î³ 5 where h is the reservoir depth km t1 is the estimated reservoir temperature c using si t0 is the average surface discharge temperature and Î³ is the average geothermal gradient c km whereas the geothermal fluids circulation depth h in km is given by equation 6 na et al 2020 h g t 1 t 0 h 0 6 where g is the reciprocal of the geothermal degree t1 and t0 are the estimated and average reservoir temperatures in degree centigrade and h0 is the geothermal atmospheric temperature zone depth m our analysis table 3 indicates that the reservoir and geothermal fluid circulation depths of the himalaya and west coast springs are deeper compared to odisha and west bengal 5 conclusions in this paper we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the four major geothermal provinces of india to better constrain the reservoir characteristics the major water types that were identified are ca so4 ca hco3 na hco3 and na cl suggesting different mechanisms controlling the water geochemistry fig 5a analysis of langelier ludwig and cl so4 hco3 ternary diagram indicates that seawater rock interactions were the dominant mechanisms controlling the water type of the west coast and odisha thermal springs furthermore it is evident from the correlation matrix table 4 that na and cl are strongly correlated r 0 912 0 998 along with tds and cl r 0 998 0 974 for both the west coast and odisha this further supports the hypothesis that seawater rock interaction may be a dominant mechanism in the region whereas it is evident from fig 5 that the water rock interaction gaseous shallow groundwater and mixing processes may be the major factors controlling the water type of the himalayas hot springs our study revealed that the thermal water of the himalayan west coast and west bengal hot springs are oversaturated with respect to albite calcite chalcedony k feldspar kaolinite and quartz which have a tendency to precipitate at the discharge temperatures the reservoir temperatures were better constrained by clustering of the mineral saturation index si method the estimated reservoir temperature values of himalayan spring 150 10 c and the west coast springs 120 5 c are higher than the west bengal and odisha springs the region is also known for high heat flow values 100 139 mw m2 fig 3a suggesting good potential for geothermal energy extraction furthermore the reservoir depths and the geothermal fluid circulation depths for the himalayan 2 11 0 2 km 2 14 0 2 km and the west coast thermal springs 1 71 0 17 1 74 0 17 km are more than those of odisha 1 37 0 32 1 41 0 32 km and the west bengal 1 13 0 13 1 16 0 13 km schematic diagram showing various mechanisms for geothermal fluid circulations are shown in fig 8 further table 5 shows the basic swot analysis of the studied geothermal springs indicating the strength weakness and threats related development of these fields for the purpose of the geothermal energy extraction the himalayan hot springs appears to have better prospects for development of geothermal energy however other fields such as those of odisha and west bengal may also be developed with the help of suitable technologies declaration of competing

3237,accurate baseflow separation is crucial for hydrological model calibration water resources utilization and ecological water demand calculation however the two most commonly used baseflow separation methods i e the tracer based and the non tracer based separation methods suffer from difficulty in obtaining data information high cost and lack of physical basis relatively large errors respectively to overcome the disadvantages of these two methods this study evaluated the feasibility of calibrating the parameters of eck and brm methods using conductivity mass balance cmb separation results and determined the optimal parameter calibration scheme by analyzing the data of more than 200 monitoring points in the colorado river basin and the mississippi river basin the results show that 1 the accuracy of eck and brm methods results can be significantly improved by 40 75 and 60 85 compared with the empirical method after the parameters have been calibrated 2 cmbs is the optimal and the most accurate parameter calibration scheme for the brm method because it considers the intra annual dynamic characteristics of the baseflow 3 to minimize costs and meet the accuracy requirements of parameter calibration conductivity monitoring should be conducted for no less than 6 months and cover low flow seasons in the areas lacking conductivity data the proposed calibration scheme and the minimum monitoring period determined in this study can effectively improve the calculation accuracy and reduce the cost of baseflow separation keywords baseflow separation conductivity mass balance parameter calibration sampling durations data availability i have provided the data in the supplementary materials 1 introduction baseflow is the part of groundwater that recharges to streamflow kronholm and capel 2015 miller et al 2014 and is a key factor in maintaining healthy watershed ecosystems accurate baseflow separation is important for hydrological computation groundwater characterization basin hydrological simulation dynamic monitoring of groundwater and water resources assessment and management rumsey et al 2015 stewart et al 2007 yu and schwartz 1999 because of the significance of baseflow numerous baseflow separation methods have been proposed following chemical isotopic and graphical principles hopper and shoemarker 1986 nejadhashemi et al 2009 stewart et al 2007 generally these methods can be divided into two categories non tracer based and tracer based separation methods li et al 2014 non tracer based separation methods focus on the recession curve gonzales et al 2009 and mainly include the graphical methods and low pass filter methods the recursive digital filter method represented by the eck a separation method developed by eckhardt method is a common low pass filter method with simplicity and less intensive data requirement and it is designed based on the signal processing theory chapman 1999 eckhardt 2005 nathan and mcmahon 1990 in the recursive digital filter method surface runoff is considered a high frequency signal and baseflow is considered a low frequency signal thus filtering out the high frequency signals during processing can separate the lower frequency baseflow from the higher frequency event flow nathan and mcmahon 1990 the filtering result largely depends on some watershed specific parameters these parameters can be calibrated with measured data of baseflow however measured data are rare and these parameters are often determined arbitrarily in practice nejadhashemi et al 2009 tracer based baseflow separation methods are based on mass balance methods the development of these methods assumes that streamflow consists of distinct flow components and each flow component has a characteristic concentration of one or more conservative chemical constituents such as deuterium and oxygen isotope ratios and major ions such as calcium silica sodium and specific conductance cey et al 1998 fritz et al 1976 pinder and jones 1969 xie et al 2016 where the concentration of the stable constituents depends on distinct flow paths within the basin stable isotopes are generally considered the most accurate chemical tracers for hydrograph separation kendall and caldwell 1998 yang et al 2021a however the huge analytical costs associated with these constituents often limit their use in large scale applications in a comparison of hydrograph separations using geochemical tracers caissie et al 1996 demonstrated that specific conductance is the most effective parameter for quantifying the surface runoff and groundwater components of the total streamflow because it can be measured in situ continuously this provides an approach for high frequency hydrograph separation at a relatively low cost miller et al 2014 continuous specific conductance data have been used to successfully quantify two source water end members in a variety of stream ecosystems including snowmelt dominated watersheds covino and mcglynn 2007 urban watersheds pellerin et al 2008 and some other settings stewart et al 2007 sanford et al 2012 lott and stewart 2012 comparing the two types of methods the eck method and other non tracer methods only require stream discharge data as input the required data discharge monitoring information is easy to obtain and the calculation is easy to automate based on the signal processing theory therefore the eck method is one of the most readily available methods for baseflow separation larocque et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 however the parameters of the eck method are often not determined in hydrologic processes which may cause high uncertainties in baseflow separation estimation the conductivity mass balance cmb method is more objective because it is based on basin specific physical processes the concentration of the chemical constituents monitored is related to the actual physical processes and flow paths in the basin that generate different flow components stewart et al 2007 the disadvantage of the mass balance method is that it needs to measure discharge and chemical concentrations concurrently although river conductivity can be monitored dynamically continuous conductivity records in large basins and long periods are not always available which limits the application of the cmb method for estimating baseflow zhang et al 2013 thus it is significant to combine the advantages of high precision and low cost of the two methods a linkage between the eck and the cmb methods can be established by using the baseflow data estimated with the cmb method to calibrate the parameters for the eck model then the calibrated eck model can be used for baseflow separation over a longer period when only discharge data are available lott and stewart 2016 zhang et al 2013 this combined method has more application potential because the required inputs i e stream discharge are readily available from historical measurements and short term measurements of the conductivity data can be obtained cost effectively through experiments li et al 2014 moreover the precision of separation results will be improved effectively lott and stewart 2016 okello et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 however after the calibration of parameters by conductivity data the baseflow separation results obtained by the eck method still differ from the cmb method cartwright 2022 yang et al 2021b especially in terms of whether the baseflow and streamflow processes rise simultaneously rise simultaneously or not chapman 1996 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 stewart et al 2007 wittenberg 1999 to accurately simulate the shape of tracer determined baseflow stewart 2015 proposed a brm baseflow separation method the bump and rise method which specifically simulates the shape of the baseflow by calibrating its main parameters f and k using tracer data also the brm method has been demonstrated to be more accurate than the eck method in glendhu catchment 2 18 km2 new zealand however the applicability and accuracy of this method need to be confirmed by comprehensive analysis at a large watershed scale and with long series of discharge and conductivity data stewart 2015 this study selected the colorado river basin crb and mississippi river basin mrb located on both sides of the rocky mountains in the united states and with large differences in climate and topography as the study area then discharge and conductivity monitoring data over more than 2 years were downloaded from 80 and 268 monitoring sites to conduct a statistically significant study that seeks to answer the following questions 1 can the eck and brm baseflow separation methods be calibrated by the cmb method 2 when conductivity data are available which calibration scheme is the most suitable to identify the parameters of the eck and brm methods is the rationality of the optimal parameter calibration scheme affected by climate and topography 3 when conductivity data are not available what is the minimum duration of conductivity dynamic monitoring that can guarantee the calibration accuracy of the eck and brm parameters while minimizing the cost 2 methods 2 1 study area overview in this study two large watersheds the mrb and the crb located on both sides of the rocky mountains with significantly different physical geographic conditions were selected as the study area the rocky mountains are an important watershed and climate divide for the north american continent located on the east of the rocky mountains the mrb is one of the five largest basins in the world with a total area of about 3 3 million km2 the basin can be divided into six sub basins missouri river basin upper mississippi basin ohio river basin orb arkansas white river basin lower mississippi basin and tennessee river basin the mrb has a variety of landforms including mountains relatively flat grasslands in the midwest and alluvial plains in the lower reaches the terrain is generally flat with most areas below 300 m above sea level controlled by the polar pacific air mass the precipitation in the basin is abundant and mainly concentrated in summer the southern and eastern parts of the basin have annual precipitation of up to 1700 mm while the western parts have less annual precipitation with less than 500 mm in the higher elevations near the rocky mountains the average runoff of the basin is 3603 m3 day km2 and the runoff of the orb is 1237 m3 day km2 which is three times the runoff in the rest of the sub basins the orb has a flat topography with abundant precipitation in contrast the crb on the west of the rocky mountains is a mountainous terrain with high topography lee s ferry arizona jacobs 2011 is the legal demarcation point that divides the crb into the upper crb and the lower crb with an average elevation up to 4300 m in the upper basin and an average elevation of 1310 m in the lower basin due to the influence of the canadian air mass the annual precipitation in this basin is concentrated in winter and snowmelt is the main supply of runoff the average annual precipitation in the upper reaches is 200 500 mm while that in the lower reaches is less than 100 mm the average annual runoff of the basin is 71 m3 day km2 2 2 data collection among more than 300 hydrological monitoring sites in the mrb and crb 254 sites with daily stream discharge and conductivity data for more than 2 years in the same period were screened and downloaded by this study fig 1 in the obtained data the longest time series was 37 years and the time series of 20 monitoring sites were longer than 10 years according to the correlation analysis conducted by lyu et al 2020 a total of 155 sites can be determined for cmb separation calculation the daily stream discharge and conductivity data were obtained from the united states geological survey s usgs national water information system nwis website http waterdata usgs gov nwis 2 3 baseflow separation methods 2 3 1 the eck method based on the assumption that aquifer discharge is proportional to storage the eck method is adopted to calculate the baseflow through the following equation 1 bf i 1 bfi max Î± bf i 1 1 Î± bfi max q i 1 Î± bfi max where bf is the daily baseflow m3 s q is the daily streamflow m3 s i is the time step number day Î± is recession constant and bfi max is the maximum baseflow index when eq 1 is used to calculate the baseflow the key parameters bfi max and Î± need to be determined Î± is related to the recession process of the baseflow and it can be set to 0 95 to 0 98 bfi max can be simply set to 0 80 0 50 and 0 25 according to the underlying surface features and the hydrological conditions of the watershed eckhardt 2005 2 3 2 the cmb method the cmb method is mainly based on the mass balance principle of the two end members it is assumed that both the baseflow conductivity and the surface runoff conductivity can be determined from streamflow conductivity values during extreme low flows and extreme high flows respectively then the bf of each period is calculated by using the high frequency generally daily scale conductivity data provided by the monitoring site as shown in eq 2 2 bf q sc s c ro s c bf s c ro where sc is the specific conductivity of the streamflow Âµs cm sc ro is the specific conductivity of the surface runoff and sc bf is the specific conductivity of the baseflow here q and sc are measured values for the parameter sc bf the conductivity value is significantly larger than that of the surface runoff this is because the groundwater in rivers percolates through soil and bedrock and thus accumulates higher concentrations of ions matsubayashi et al 1993 zhang et al 2013 therefore a value for baseflow conductivity sc bf is assigned by analyzing streamflow conductivity values during extreme low flow periods when it is assumed that baseflow makes up 100 of streamflow a value for surface runoff conductivity sc ro is assigned by analyzing streamflow conductivity values at hydrograph peaks during extreme high flow periods with frequent runoff events when it is assumed that runoff makes up almost all the streamflow stewart et al 2007 2 3 3 the brm method a remarkable and well accepted characteristic of tracer based baseflow separations is that the components including groundwater often respond to rainfall as rapidly as the stream itself bonell et al 1990 gonzales et al 2009 stewart et al 2007 wenninger et al 2004 in the case of groundwater the rapid response is considered partial because the rapid propagation of rainfall effects downwards by pressure waves or celerity causes a rapid rise of the water table and displacement of water stored near the stream beven 2012 mcdonnell and beven 2014 stewart et al 2007 to simulate this morphological characteristic of tracer based methods stewart 2015 proposed the brm method the principle of this method is based on an empirical method proposed by hewlett and hibbert 1967 for small watersheds in which the slope of the dividing line is described by the parameter k a special feature of the brm method is that two types of baseflow response are included namely a short term response via the bump rapid baseflow responses to storm events and a longer term response via the rise a steady rise in the sense of hewlett and hibbert stewart proposed to reflect the above variation process by using the parameters f and k where f denotes the rapid response of the baseflow to a rainfall the bump and k represents the steady rate of rising of the baseflow during a rainfall the rise the specific calculation formulas are as follows 3 b f i b f i 1 k f q i q i 1 f o r q i b f i 1 k 4 b f i q i f o r q i b f i 1 k where f is a constant fraction of the increase or decrease of streamflow during an event and k is the slope of the dividing line m3s 1km 2h 1 the parameters can be determined by fitting them to tracer separations stewart 2015 then the brm algorithm can be applied simply to the entire streamflow record 2 4 calibration of the eck and brm method with the cmb method the calculated results of the cmb method were used as the standard and the parameters bfi max Î± and f k of the eck and brm methods were adjusted to minimize the difference in the total baseflow amount between the eck brm and the cmb methods the daily baseflow separation results for different combinations of parameter values were calculated separately and the difference between the calculated results and the standard results of the cmb method was measured by the root mean square error rmse eq 5 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n q i q i cmb 2 1 2 where q i and q i cmb are the baseflow calculated by the calibrated method and the cmb method respectively and n is the length of monitoring data considering that rmse is affected by the site magnitude of discharge and data length the rmse was divided by the average baseflow of each monitoring site and the number of data items to obtain the percentage of rmse in the average baseflow eq 6 6 percentage e r r o r 100 1 n 2 i 1 n q i q i cmb 2 1 2 Î´ b where Î´b is the average baseflow of each monitoring site according to the results calculated by eq 6 the differences between the results calculated under different combinations of parameter values and the standard results calculated by the cmb method can be obtained and the optimal parameter calibration scheme can be determined more objectively and accurately 2 5 comparison of each parameter calibration scheme in the process of calibrating the parameters of the eck and brm methods using the separation results of the cmb method as the standard the following three parameter calibration schemes were considered respectively 1 an optimal set of parameter combinations is calibrated by directly using the baseflow separation results of the cmb method for the entire length of the data series following the principle of minimizing the rmse between the results of the method to be calibrated and the cmb method in the whole time period this is the parameter calibration scheme for multi years monitoring data cmbys 2 considering the annual dynamic characteristics of baseflow and separation parameters the annual optimal parameter combination is obtained by using the baseflow separation results of the cmb method determined from annual monitoring data as the standard and then the annual parameters are averaged to obtain the optimal calibrated parameter combination this is the parameter calibration scheme for year by year monitoring data cmby 3 further considering the intra annual seasonal variation characteristics of the baseflow and separation parameters and taking the baseflow separation results of the cmb method determined by the annual high flow season and low flow season monitoring data respectively as the standard the parameter combinations for different seasons each year are obtained and the parameters of different years are averaged by season to obtain the final optimal parameter combinations of the corresponding seasons after calibration this is the parameter calibration scheme for seasonal year by year monitoring data cmbs to simulate actual conditions for comparing the results of the schemes more than 20 monitoring sites in two watersheds with data lengths of more than 10 years were used to calibrate the parameters using the stream discharge and conductivity data of the first 10 years then the calibrated parameters were used to further separate the runoff in the subsequent years and to compare the differences between the calibrated results of the eck brm and cmb methods to determine the optimal calibration scheme 3 result and discussion 3 1 comparison of optimal methods to improve the accuracy of baseflow separation 3 1 1 comparison of different calibration schemes of the eck and brm methods for 20 monitoring sites with more than 10 years of stream discharge and conductivity data in the crb and mrb the accuracy of baseflow separation results was compared and analyzed the range of average percentage error calculated by the eck method of the two watersheds is respectively 0 85 1 85 and 0 73 2 16 while the range of average percentage error of the brm method is respectively 0 69 1 05 and 0 43 0 52 table 1 the results of the two methods at each monitoring site show that the parameter calibration schemes for the brm method achieve more accurate results than those of the eck method this is because the brm method considers the effect of precipitation response rate which improves the matching degree of the baseflow calculation results in terms of the time interval comparing the results of the cmbys scheme for multi years monitoring data cmby scheme for year by year monitoring data and cmbs scheme for seasonal monitoring data year by year schemes in two watersheds the average percentage error calculated by the eck method in the crb and mrb is respectively 1 25 1 01 and 0 85 1 26 0 73 and 0 62 while the average percentage error of the brm method is respectively 1 05 0 94 and 0 69 0 52 0 44 and 0 43 table 1 the baseflow separation results by eck and brm methods with the three parameter calibration schemes show that cmbs is the optimal parameter calibration scheme for eck and brm methods in both watersheds among the parameter calibration schemes for the brm method in the crb the cmby and cmbs calibration schemes have similar average percentage error and parameter value range 3 1 2 the eck method calculation results of each scheme in section 3 1 1 the results of different calibration schemes at multiple sites in two watersheds are analyzed in general for further analysis site 06 089 000 with long time series and complete data was selected among the 20 sites for in depth discussion the baseflow separation results by each parameter calibration scheme table 2 show that the bfi baseflow index of each year 1979 1999 obtained by the cmb method ranges from 0 25 to 0 73 with a mean value of 0 46 compared with the standard results of the cmb method the results of the eck method based on different schemes have the following characteristics 1 the baseflow obtained by the empirical method is significantly higher and the percentage error of the two results is 2 10 which is the largest error among the schemes 2 the bfi and percentage error obtained by the cmbys and the cmby are closer compared with the empirical method the cmb method obtains a slightly lower bfi and the percentage error is about 0 84 which is 60 better than that of the empirical method 3 the parameters determined by the cmbs scheme are respectively 0 94 0 63 and 0 98 0 23 for the low flow and high flow seasons and the parameter bfi max in the low flow season is significantly larger than that in the high flow season this situation is due to the fact that rivers are mainly recharged by groundwater in the low flow season and by rainfall in the high flow season compared with other schemes cmbs shows obvious seasonal characteristics and the bfi obtained is closest to that of the cmb method with the smallest percentage error of only 0 71 the annual baseflow obtained by the eck method for each year 1979 1999 under various parameter calibration schemes was compared with that obtained by the cmb method fig 2 a in general except for the cmbs scheme that obtains the annual baseflow results close to the cmb method all other schemes show different degrees of deviation in these schemes the calculation results of the empirical method are significantly high while the results obtained by the cmbys scheme and the cmby scheme are lower than the cmb results this is because the rivers in the study area are perennial streams with porous aquifers and the bfi max is set to 0 80 according to the empirical value proposed by eckhardt 2005 which is a relatively large value the parameter obtained from the cmbys calibration scheme is the result of a multi year data combination which is easily affected by the extreme value in a certain year the average runoff in the first 10 years of data 1969 1978 used for the parameter calibration of this monitoring site is 675 2 m3 s while the runoff in 1975 is 1230 9 m3 s which is nearly two times the average value the extremely large annual flow value leads to a small parameter bfi max and makes the final baseflow less than that obtained by the cmb method when the parameters identified by the cmby calibration scheme are used for baseflow separation the sensitivity of the parameters to seasonal changes is not considered the calculation with the stable parameter setting will lead to a larger baseflow in high flow seasons and a smaller baseflow in low flow seasons for this monitoring site most time of the year belongs to the low flow season and the high flow season accounts for a short time the total baseflow obtained by the cmby scheme in low flow seasons is 1234 2 m3 s smaller and 510 3 m3 s larger than that of the standard result obtained by the cmb method which is finally reflected as the annual baseflow is smaller than that obtained by the cmb method the above phenomenon can also be observed in the baseflow process curve fig 3 the result of the empirical method is higher than that of the cmb method in the whole period especially during the flood peak in the high flow season with the baseflow nearly 80 m3 s higher than the standard result compared with the results of the cmb calibration scheme in the whole period results of cmbys are lower and the results of cmby are lower in the low flow season but higher in the high flow season the baseflow obtained by the cmbs scheme is still the closest to the standard result according to the above results cmbs is considered the optimal eck parameter calibration scheme which improves the accuracy by about 66 compared with the empirical method 3 1 3 the brm method calculation results of each scheme the three brm calibration schemes based on different time series data take different parameter values but the overall bfi is relatively close and the percentage error ranges from 0 55 to 0 61 table 3 the bfi determined by the cmbs scheme is the closest to that of the cmb method with the smallest percentage error of 0 55 the bfi of the brm method for each year under the three calibration schemes is uniformly distributed on both sides of the standard value fig 2b and all the percentage error is lower than that of the eck method furthermore compared with the baseflow process of the eck method the results of the three brm calibration schemes based on different time series data can reflect the rapid response of the baseflow to a rainfall fig 3 among them the cmbs scheme fits the cmb results well in all periods while the cmbys scheme and the cmby scheme have relatively higher baseflow separation results in the low flow season and lower results in the high flow season than the cmb method in general the cmbs scheme achieves the highest baseflow separation accuracy for this site taking the results of the cmb method as the standard compared with the average percentage error of 1 85 and 2 16 of the empirical method in the mrb and crb basin adopting the optimal parameter calibration scheme i e cmbs for eck and brm methods can improve the accuracy of baseflow separation results by about 40 75 and 60 85 respectively also the brm method after parameter calibration can obtain better fitting effects considering the significant differences in climate and topography in the two basins the conclusions of the above analysis are universal and extensible 3 2 sampling duration for minimizing the cost of baseflow separation the baseflow separation accuracy and cost are always a contradiction it is challenging to minimize the baseflow separation cost while ensuring the accuracy of the aforementioned optimal separation method and parameter calibration scheme a common situation is that when conducting parameter calibration in areas where conductivity data are lacking the minimum duration of the conductivity data meeting the requirement of calculation accuracy should be investigated the data from 62 monitoring sites in the study area 19 sites from crb and 43 sites from mrb with data series lengths longer than 4 years were selected for the 15 sites of them with time series lengths of 10 years or more the sampling duration was set to 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 and 24 months respectively for the remaining 47 sites the sampling duration was set to 3 6 9 and 12 months respectively in each sampling duration sc bf sc ro and bfi were calculated and a several bfi values calculated based on the data for each sampling duration were tested for conformity to a normal distribution p 0 05 under the premise of normal distribution the bfi at sampling durations of 24 months or 12 months was calculated as the standard and the bfi at sampling durations of 3 6 9 12 15 18 and 21 months were subjected to student s t test at a confidence interval of 95 then the minimum duration without significant difference p 0 05 was considered the minimum acceptable sampling duration the calculation results of sc bf and sc ro by using the data of different sampling duration at 62 sites appendix a show that sc bf sc ro and bfi all gradually stabilize as the period length increases overall sc bf increases and sc ro decreases gradually before they stabilize while bfi exhibits no single significant upward or downward trend fig 4 taking the no 09180500 site as an example the p value of bfi in the t test does not show significant dynamic characteristics but its p value is below the limit of 0 05 when the sampling duration is 3 months this indicates that the bfi calculated from the 3 month data is significantly different from that calculated from the 24 month data meanwhile the bfi calculated by using the data of different sampling durations shows a significant variation at 3 months fig 5 the uncertainty w calculated from the data of more than 3 months remains in a low range 0 10 0 30 and it is as high as 0 62 at 3 months showing an abrupt increase therefore to obtain reliable sc bf sc ro and bfi the sampling duration should be at least 6 months according to the statistics of all sites appendix b there are 47 sites in the two watersheds with bfi subject to the normal distribution and 3 4 27 and 13 sites of them with a minimum sampling duration of 12 9 6 and 3 months respectively among the 17 sites in the crb and 30 sites in the mrb with bfi subject to the normal distribution 10 sites and 17 sites have a minimum sampling length of 6 months thus it is considered that a minimum sampling duration of 6 months is required to ensure the accuracy of the determined parameters and improve the accuracy of baseflow separation and the large differences in topography and climate of the two watersheds do not affect the minimum sampling duration furthermore considering that the parameter sc bf of the cmb method has a greater influence on baseflow separation results stewart et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 if the conductivity is monitored continuously for 6 months to calibrate the parameters of the baseflow separation method the period covering the low flow season should be selected as far as possible to improve the accuracy of separation results 3 3 recommended parameter values and regularity of distribution the recommended parameter values of the eck and brm methods were obtained by the cmbs calibration scheme for the 109 monitoring sites in the two watersheds during the high flow and low flow seasons appendix c for the sites where the determined parameters were obtained relatively high precision baseflow separation results can be achieved based on the recommended parameter values even if conductivity was not monitored at a later period to save costs for the brm method the parameter f is the product term of the difference in the runoff volume before and after time periods eq 3 which is a constant fraction of the streamflow increase or decrease during an event to represent the rapid baseflow responses to storm events stewart 2015 f controls the response degree and response speed of baseflow to the fluctuation of runoff processes parameter k is an independent term in eq 3 and the calculated value of k is less than 0 01 for most of the sites thus the change of parameter f has a more significant impact on the calculation results of baseflow theoretically varying the values of f and k by the same magnitude also shows that f is a more critical parameter for the brm method e g at no 06089000 site the baseflow obtained by increasing or decreasing f by 50 has 37 6 and 64 7 greater influence on the baseflow results than that by changing k at the same amplitude and similar results are obtained at other sites meanwhile the change of parameter Î± is very small in the calibration process eckhardt 2005 and it is not analyzed here therefore the analysis here focused on the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of the key parameters bfi max and f of the two methods to ensure the representativeness of the analysis results a comparative study was conducted in the orb where the topography and climate of the mrb differ greatly from that of the crb and the number of sites is similar to that of the crb the key parameters bfi max and f of both methods show significant seasonal characteristics in the two watersheds especially in the crb where the distribution of parameter f ranges from 0 001 to 0 399 and 0 001 0 692 with median values of 0 022 and 0 274 during the high flow and low flow seasons respectively the distribution of parameter bfi max ranges from 0 10 0 59 and 0 43 0 89 with median values of 0 262 and 0 637 respectively the parameter values in low flow seasons are significantly higher than those in high flow seasons fig 6 fig 7 in terms of spatial distribution the parameter bfi max in the crb is larger than that in the orb during the high flow and low flow seasons but there is no significant difference in the overall interval of the parameter f between the two watersheds besides the key parameters bfi max and f for both methods show an increasing trend from the upper basin at higher elevations to the lower basin for example the parameter f is below 0 01 in the upper basin and becomes significantly larger in the lower basin on the whole the climate in the crb is drier than that in the orb with the average annual precipitation of crb and orb less than 400 mm and more than 1000 mm and the annual evaporation is about 200 mm and 600 mm respectively milly and dunne 2001 miranda et al 2021 ziegler et al 2005 meanwhile there are differences in precipitation types between the two watersheds the main precipitation type in the crb is snowfall which accounts for more than half of the total precipitation carroll et al 2020 and the colorado river is primarily driven by the snowmelt grafton et al 2013 the orb is mostly dominated by rainfall and the temperature controlled precipitation type may lead to differences in the timing of flood peaks monteith et al 2006 snowmelt is a process of relatively low intensity but long duration which provides a pulse of water with a relatively high ratio of infiltration to runoff earman et al 2006 therefore the streamflow in the crb is dominated by snowmelt and is mainly recharged by baseflow while the rainfall in the orb has a large intensity and is concentrated in time in addition the vegetation coverage in the orb is sparse the soil water storage capacity is small and rainfall forms a quick flow and directly replenishes the river cao et al 2011 therefore the parameter bfi max in the crb in different seasons has a larger value than that in the orb following the same principle the parameters in the low flow seasons are higher than those in the high flow seasons secondly the influence of different climate conditions is also reflected in different areas of the same watershed compared to the lower reaches the temperature rises to above zero 1 to 2 months later in the upper reaches at a high altitude and the runoff and temperature rise simultaneously fig 8 when the surface of the vadose zone has not thawed completely in the upper reaches rises in this case the soil infiltration capacity could be significantly reduced snowmelt is difficult to infiltrate and form groundwater runoff and surface runoff is the main replenishment water source for rivers cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 gan et al 2015 the temperature in the middle and lower reaches rises earlier than that in the upper reaches fig 8 but the river recharge has a long path and produces flow at the same time as the upper reaches at this time the vadose zone has completely thawed and the snowmelt water can infiltrate and recharge the river as subsurface runoff so the key parameter bfi max of both watersheds gradually increases from the upper reaches of the basin at a high elevation to the lower reaches in addition from the physical meaning of the parameter the key parameter f of the brm method controls the response degree and response speed of the baseflow to the fluctuation in the runoff process which is also reflected in the proportion of the baseflow therefore parameter f has a similar spatial and temporal distribution with the parameter bfi max of the eck method this is consistent with the observations obtained by stewart 2014 in summary the main factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of the key parameters of the two methods are climatic conditions precipitation amount and type temperature etc the parameter values of the watershed with a drought climate and mainly recharged by snowmelt are higher than those of the watershed with a humid climate and mainly recharged by rainfall the temperature dynamics at different locations in the upper and lower reaches of the watershed determine the synchronous relationship between frozen soil and snowmelt and then control the way to recharge the river surface runoff or groundwater runoff as a result the parameters f and bfi max show a decreasing trend from the upper reaches to the lower reaches influenced by the combination of these factors the bfi exhibits a distribution pattern similar to that of bfi max fig 7 the distribution range of bfi in the crb is 0 19 0 76 with a median value of 0 40 about 20 8 10 48 of all monitoring sites have bfi values greater than 0 5 with baseflow as an important component of streamflow the overall bfi in the orb is smaller with a median value of only 0 30 and the bfi values of all sites are less than 0 5 4 conclusions in watersheds with a precipitation type of snowfall high elevation and complex topography or watersheds with a precipitation type of rainfall and flat topography more accurate baseflow separation results can be obtained after calibrating the parameters of the eck and brm methods with the cmb method also the brm method is more accurate than the eck method among multiple parameter calibration schemes cmbs contributes to the most accurate baseflow separation results and the accuracy of the results is improved by 40 75 and 60 85 compared to that of the empirical method indicating that parameter calibration can significantly improve the calculation accuracy the accuracy of parameter calibration is related to the length of conductivity data if the data length is less than 6 months the uncertainty of separation results will increase to minimize the cost it is recommended to conduct conductivity monitoring for not less than 6 months in areas where conductivity data are lacking then the cmb method and short term conductivity data can be used to calibrate the parameters of the eck and brm methods and the calibrated parameters can be used to perform high precision long term baseflow separation calculations based on subsequent streamflow data only noted that the monitoring duration of 6 months is preferable during the low flow season due to the greater influence of scbf on the baseflow results during the low flow period in this study the parameters f and bfi max of the two watersheds were calibrated by cmbs and the recommended parameter values of 109 monitoring sites were obtained where subsequent high precision baseflow separation can be performed using only streamflow data the spatiotemporal distribution of the key parameters f and bfi max is mainly controlled by climate due to the limited available data this study did not consider the influence of vegetation coverage and hydrogeological conditions on parameter distribution and the distribution of the parameter f was not analyzed comprehensively enough these issues will be further investigated in future studies credit authorship contribution statement rong

3237,accurate baseflow separation is crucial for hydrological model calibration water resources utilization and ecological water demand calculation however the two most commonly used baseflow separation methods i e the tracer based and the non tracer based separation methods suffer from difficulty in obtaining data information high cost and lack of physical basis relatively large errors respectively to overcome the disadvantages of these two methods this study evaluated the feasibility of calibrating the parameters of eck and brm methods using conductivity mass balance cmb separation results and determined the optimal parameter calibration scheme by analyzing the data of more than 200 monitoring points in the colorado river basin and the mississippi river basin the results show that 1 the accuracy of eck and brm methods results can be significantly improved by 40 75 and 60 85 compared with the empirical method after the parameters have been calibrated 2 cmbs is the optimal and the most accurate parameter calibration scheme for the brm method because it considers the intra annual dynamic characteristics of the baseflow 3 to minimize costs and meet the accuracy requirements of parameter calibration conductivity monitoring should be conducted for no less than 6 months and cover low flow seasons in the areas lacking conductivity data the proposed calibration scheme and the minimum monitoring period determined in this study can effectively improve the calculation accuracy and reduce the cost of baseflow separation keywords baseflow separation conductivity mass balance parameter calibration sampling durations data availability i have provided the data in the supplementary materials 1 introduction baseflow is the part of groundwater that recharges to streamflow kronholm and capel 2015 miller et al 2014 and is a key factor in maintaining healthy watershed ecosystems accurate baseflow separation is important for hydrological computation groundwater characterization basin hydrological simulation dynamic monitoring of groundwater and water resources assessment and management rumsey et al 2015 stewart et al 2007 yu and schwartz 1999 because of the significance of baseflow numerous baseflow separation methods have been proposed following chemical isotopic and graphical principles hopper and shoemarker 1986 nejadhashemi et al 2009 stewart et al 2007 generally these methods can be divided into two categories non tracer based and tracer based separation methods li et al 2014 non tracer based separation methods focus on the recession curve gonzales et al 2009 and mainly include the graphical methods and low pass filter methods the recursive digital filter method represented by the eck a separation method developed by eckhardt method is a common low pass filter method with simplicity and less intensive data requirement and it is designed based on the signal processing theory chapman 1999 eckhardt 2005 nathan and mcmahon 1990 in the recursive digital filter method surface runoff is considered a high frequency signal and baseflow is considered a low frequency signal thus filtering out the high frequency signals during processing can separate the lower frequency baseflow from the higher frequency event flow nathan and mcmahon 1990 the filtering result largely depends on some watershed specific parameters these parameters can be calibrated with measured data of baseflow however measured data are rare and these parameters are often determined arbitrarily in practice nejadhashemi et al 2009 tracer based baseflow separation methods are based on mass balance methods the development of these methods assumes that streamflow consists of distinct flow components and each flow component has a characteristic concentration of one or more conservative chemical constituents such as deuterium and oxygen isotope ratios and major ions such as calcium silica sodium and specific conductance cey et al 1998 fritz et al 1976 pinder and jones 1969 xie et al 2016 where the concentration of the stable constituents depends on distinct flow paths within the basin stable isotopes are generally considered the most accurate chemical tracers for hydrograph separation kendall and caldwell 1998 yang et al 2021a however the huge analytical costs associated with these constituents often limit their use in large scale applications in a comparison of hydrograph separations using geochemical tracers caissie et al 1996 demonstrated that specific conductance is the most effective parameter for quantifying the surface runoff and groundwater components of the total streamflow because it can be measured in situ continuously this provides an approach for high frequency hydrograph separation at a relatively low cost miller et al 2014 continuous specific conductance data have been used to successfully quantify two source water end members in a variety of stream ecosystems including snowmelt dominated watersheds covino and mcglynn 2007 urban watersheds pellerin et al 2008 and some other settings stewart et al 2007 sanford et al 2012 lott and stewart 2012 comparing the two types of methods the eck method and other non tracer methods only require stream discharge data as input the required data discharge monitoring information is easy to obtain and the calculation is easy to automate based on the signal processing theory therefore the eck method is one of the most readily available methods for baseflow separation larocque et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 however the parameters of the eck method are often not determined in hydrologic processes which may cause high uncertainties in baseflow separation estimation the conductivity mass balance cmb method is more objective because it is based on basin specific physical processes the concentration of the chemical constituents monitored is related to the actual physical processes and flow paths in the basin that generate different flow components stewart et al 2007 the disadvantage of the mass balance method is that it needs to measure discharge and chemical concentrations concurrently although river conductivity can be monitored dynamically continuous conductivity records in large basins and long periods are not always available which limits the application of the cmb method for estimating baseflow zhang et al 2013 thus it is significant to combine the advantages of high precision and low cost of the two methods a linkage between the eck and the cmb methods can be established by using the baseflow data estimated with the cmb method to calibrate the parameters for the eck model then the calibrated eck model can be used for baseflow separation over a longer period when only discharge data are available lott and stewart 2016 zhang et al 2013 this combined method has more application potential because the required inputs i e stream discharge are readily available from historical measurements and short term measurements of the conductivity data can be obtained cost effectively through experiments li et al 2014 moreover the precision of separation results will be improved effectively lott and stewart 2016 okello et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 however after the calibration of parameters by conductivity data the baseflow separation results obtained by the eck method still differ from the cmb method cartwright 2022 yang et al 2021b especially in terms of whether the baseflow and streamflow processes rise simultaneously rise simultaneously or not chapman 1996 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 stewart et al 2007 wittenberg 1999 to accurately simulate the shape of tracer determined baseflow stewart 2015 proposed a brm baseflow separation method the bump and rise method which specifically simulates the shape of the baseflow by calibrating its main parameters f and k using tracer data also the brm method has been demonstrated to be more accurate than the eck method in glendhu catchment 2 18 km2 new zealand however the applicability and accuracy of this method need to be confirmed by comprehensive analysis at a large watershed scale and with long series of discharge and conductivity data stewart 2015 this study selected the colorado river basin crb and mississippi river basin mrb located on both sides of the rocky mountains in the united states and with large differences in climate and topography as the study area then discharge and conductivity monitoring data over more than 2 years were downloaded from 80 and 268 monitoring sites to conduct a statistically significant study that seeks to answer the following questions 1 can the eck and brm baseflow separation methods be calibrated by the cmb method 2 when conductivity data are available which calibration scheme is the most suitable to identify the parameters of the eck and brm methods is the rationality of the optimal parameter calibration scheme affected by climate and topography 3 when conductivity data are not available what is the minimum duration of conductivity dynamic monitoring that can guarantee the calibration accuracy of the eck and brm parameters while minimizing the cost 2 methods 2 1 study area overview in this study two large watersheds the mrb and the crb located on both sides of the rocky mountains with significantly different physical geographic conditions were selected as the study area the rocky mountains are an important watershed and climate divide for the north american continent located on the east of the rocky mountains the mrb is one of the five largest basins in the world with a total area of about 3 3 million km2 the basin can be divided into six sub basins missouri river basin upper mississippi basin ohio river basin orb arkansas white river basin lower mississippi basin and tennessee river basin the mrb has a variety of landforms including mountains relatively flat grasslands in the midwest and alluvial plains in the lower reaches the terrain is generally flat with most areas below 300 m above sea level controlled by the polar pacific air mass the precipitation in the basin is abundant and mainly concentrated in summer the southern and eastern parts of the basin have annual precipitation of up to 1700 mm while the western parts have less annual precipitation with less than 500 mm in the higher elevations near the rocky mountains the average runoff of the basin is 3603 m3 day km2 and the runoff of the orb is 1237 m3 day km2 which is three times the runoff in the rest of the sub basins the orb has a flat topography with abundant precipitation in contrast the crb on the west of the rocky mountains is a mountainous terrain with high topography lee s ferry arizona jacobs 2011 is the legal demarcation point that divides the crb into the upper crb and the lower crb with an average elevation up to 4300 m in the upper basin and an average elevation of 1310 m in the lower basin due to the influence of the canadian air mass the annual precipitation in this basin is concentrated in winter and snowmelt is the main supply of runoff the average annual precipitation in the upper reaches is 200 500 mm while that in the lower reaches is less than 100 mm the average annual runoff of the basin is 71 m3 day km2 2 2 data collection among more than 300 hydrological monitoring sites in the mrb and crb 254 sites with daily stream discharge and conductivity data for more than 2 years in the same period were screened and downloaded by this study fig 1 in the obtained data the longest time series was 37 years and the time series of 20 monitoring sites were longer than 10 years according to the correlation analysis conducted by lyu et al 2020 a total of 155 sites can be determined for cmb separation calculation the daily stream discharge and conductivity data were obtained from the united states geological survey s usgs national water information system nwis website http waterdata usgs gov nwis 2 3 baseflow separation methods 2 3 1 the eck method based on the assumption that aquifer discharge is proportional to storage the eck method is adopted to calculate the baseflow through the following equation 1 bf i 1 bfi max Î± bf i 1 1 Î± bfi max q i 1 Î± bfi max where bf is the daily baseflow m3 s q is the daily streamflow m3 s i is the time step number day Î± is recession constant and bfi max is the maximum baseflow index when eq 1 is used to calculate the baseflow the key parameters bfi max and Î± need to be determined Î± is related to the recession process of the baseflow and it can be set to 0 95 to 0 98 bfi max can be simply set to 0 80 0 50 and 0 25 according to the underlying surface features and the hydrological conditions of the watershed eckhardt 2005 2 3 2 the cmb method the cmb method is mainly based on the mass balance principle of the two end members it is assumed that both the baseflow conductivity and the surface runoff conductivity can be determined from streamflow conductivity values during extreme low flows and extreme high flows respectively then the bf of each period is calculated by using the high frequency generally daily scale conductivity data provided by the monitoring site as shown in eq 2 2 bf q sc s c ro s c bf s c ro where sc is the specific conductivity of the streamflow Âµs cm sc ro is the specific conductivity of the surface runoff and sc bf is the specific conductivity of the baseflow here q and sc are measured values for the parameter sc bf the conductivity value is significantly larger than that of the surface runoff this is because the groundwater in rivers percolates through soil and bedrock and thus accumulates higher concentrations of ions matsubayashi et al 1993 zhang et al 2013 therefore a value for baseflow conductivity sc bf is assigned by analyzing streamflow conductivity values during extreme low flow periods when it is assumed that baseflow makes up 100 of streamflow a value for surface runoff conductivity sc ro is assigned by analyzing streamflow conductivity values at hydrograph peaks during extreme high flow periods with frequent runoff events when it is assumed that runoff makes up almost all the streamflow stewart et al 2007 2 3 3 the brm method a remarkable and well accepted characteristic of tracer based baseflow separations is that the components including groundwater often respond to rainfall as rapidly as the stream itself bonell et al 1990 gonzales et al 2009 stewart et al 2007 wenninger et al 2004 in the case of groundwater the rapid response is considered partial because the rapid propagation of rainfall effects downwards by pressure waves or celerity causes a rapid rise of the water table and displacement of water stored near the stream beven 2012 mcdonnell and beven 2014 stewart et al 2007 to simulate this morphological characteristic of tracer based methods stewart 2015 proposed the brm method the principle of this method is based on an empirical method proposed by hewlett and hibbert 1967 for small watersheds in which the slope of the dividing line is described by the parameter k a special feature of the brm method is that two types of baseflow response are included namely a short term response via the bump rapid baseflow responses to storm events and a longer term response via the rise a steady rise in the sense of hewlett and hibbert stewart proposed to reflect the above variation process by using the parameters f and k where f denotes the rapid response of the baseflow to a rainfall the bump and k represents the steady rate of rising of the baseflow during a rainfall the rise the specific calculation formulas are as follows 3 b f i b f i 1 k f q i q i 1 f o r q i b f i 1 k 4 b f i q i f o r q i b f i 1 k where f is a constant fraction of the increase or decrease of streamflow during an event and k is the slope of the dividing line m3s 1km 2h 1 the parameters can be determined by fitting them to tracer separations stewart 2015 then the brm algorithm can be applied simply to the entire streamflow record 2 4 calibration of the eck and brm method with the cmb method the calculated results of the cmb method were used as the standard and the parameters bfi max Î± and f k of the eck and brm methods were adjusted to minimize the difference in the total baseflow amount between the eck brm and the cmb methods the daily baseflow separation results for different combinations of parameter values were calculated separately and the difference between the calculated results and the standard results of the cmb method was measured by the root mean square error rmse eq 5 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n q i q i cmb 2 1 2 where q i and q i cmb are the baseflow calculated by the calibrated method and the cmb method respectively and n is the length of monitoring data considering that rmse is affected by the site magnitude of discharge and data length the rmse was divided by the average baseflow of each monitoring site and the number of data items to obtain the percentage of rmse in the average baseflow eq 6 6 percentage e r r o r 100 1 n 2 i 1 n q i q i cmb 2 1 2 Î´ b where Î´b is the average baseflow of each monitoring site according to the results calculated by eq 6 the differences between the results calculated under different combinations of parameter values and the standard results calculated by the cmb method can be obtained and the optimal parameter calibration scheme can be determined more objectively and accurately 2 5 comparison of each parameter calibration scheme in the process of calibrating the parameters of the eck and brm methods using the separation results of the cmb method as the standard the following three parameter calibration schemes were considered respectively 1 an optimal set of parameter combinations is calibrated by directly using the baseflow separation results of the cmb method for the entire length of the data series following the principle of minimizing the rmse between the results of the method to be calibrated and the cmb method in the whole time period this is the parameter calibration scheme for multi years monitoring data cmbys 2 considering the annual dynamic characteristics of baseflow and separation parameters the annual optimal parameter combination is obtained by using the baseflow separation results of the cmb method determined from annual monitoring data as the standard and then the annual parameters are averaged to obtain the optimal calibrated parameter combination this is the parameter calibration scheme for year by year monitoring data cmby 3 further considering the intra annual seasonal variation characteristics of the baseflow and separation parameters and taking the baseflow separation results of the cmb method determined by the annual high flow season and low flow season monitoring data respectively as the standard the parameter combinations for different seasons each year are obtained and the parameters of different years are averaged by season to obtain the final optimal parameter combinations of the corresponding seasons after calibration this is the parameter calibration scheme for seasonal year by year monitoring data cmbs to simulate actual conditions for comparing the results of the schemes more than 20 monitoring sites in two watersheds with data lengths of more than 10 years were used to calibrate the parameters using the stream discharge and conductivity data of the first 10 years then the calibrated parameters were used to further separate the runoff in the subsequent years and to compare the differences between the calibrated results of the eck brm and cmb methods to determine the optimal calibration scheme 3 result and discussion 3 1 comparison of optimal methods to improve the accuracy of baseflow separation 3 1 1 comparison of different calibration schemes of the eck and brm methods for 20 monitoring sites with more than 10 years of stream discharge and conductivity data in the crb and mrb the accuracy of baseflow separation results was compared and analyzed the range of average percentage error calculated by the eck method of the two watersheds is respectively 0 85 1 85 and 0 73 2 16 while the range of average percentage error of the brm method is respectively 0 69 1 05 and 0 43 0 52 table 1 the results of the two methods at each monitoring site show that the parameter calibration schemes for the brm method achieve more accurate results than those of the eck method this is because the brm method considers the effect of precipitation response rate which improves the matching degree of the baseflow calculation results in terms of the time interval comparing the results of the cmbys scheme for multi years monitoring data cmby scheme for year by year monitoring data and cmbs scheme for seasonal monitoring data year by year schemes in two watersheds the average percentage error calculated by the eck method in the crb and mrb is respectively 1 25 1 01 and 0 85 1 26 0 73 and 0 62 while the average percentage error of the brm method is respectively 1 05 0 94 and 0 69 0 52 0 44 and 0 43 table 1 the baseflow separation results by eck and brm methods with the three parameter calibration schemes show that cmbs is the optimal parameter calibration scheme for eck and brm methods in both watersheds among the parameter calibration schemes for the brm method in the crb the cmby and cmbs calibration schemes have similar average percentage error and parameter value range 3 1 2 the eck method calculation results of each scheme in section 3 1 1 the results of different calibration schemes at multiple sites in two watersheds are analyzed in general for further analysis site 06 089 000 with long time series and complete data was selected among the 20 sites for in depth discussion the baseflow separation results by each parameter calibration scheme table 2 show that the bfi baseflow index of each year 1979 1999 obtained by the cmb method ranges from 0 25 to 0 73 with a mean value of 0 46 compared with the standard results of the cmb method the results of the eck method based on different schemes have the following characteristics 1 the baseflow obtained by the empirical method is significantly higher and the percentage error of the two results is 2 10 which is the largest error among the schemes 2 the bfi and percentage error obtained by the cmbys and the cmby are closer compared with the empirical method the cmb method obtains a slightly lower bfi and the percentage error is about 0 84 which is 60 better than that of the empirical method 3 the parameters determined by the cmbs scheme are respectively 0 94 0 63 and 0 98 0 23 for the low flow and high flow seasons and the parameter bfi max in the low flow season is significantly larger than that in the high flow season this situation is due to the fact that rivers are mainly recharged by groundwater in the low flow season and by rainfall in the high flow season compared with other schemes cmbs shows obvious seasonal characteristics and the bfi obtained is closest to that of the cmb method with the smallest percentage error of only 0 71 the annual baseflow obtained by the eck method for each year 1979 1999 under various parameter calibration schemes was compared with that obtained by the cmb method fig 2 a in general except for the cmbs scheme that obtains the annual baseflow results close to the cmb method all other schemes show different degrees of deviation in these schemes the calculation results of the empirical method are significantly high while the results obtained by the cmbys scheme and the cmby scheme are lower than the cmb results this is because the rivers in the study area are perennial streams with porous aquifers and the bfi max is set to 0 80 according to the empirical value proposed by eckhardt 2005 which is a relatively large value the parameter obtained from the cmbys calibration scheme is the result of a multi year data combination which is easily affected by the extreme value in a certain year the average runoff in the first 10 years of data 1969 1978 used for the parameter calibration of this monitoring site is 675 2 m3 s while the runoff in 1975 is 1230 9 m3 s which is nearly two times the average value the extremely large annual flow value leads to a small parameter bfi max and makes the final baseflow less than that obtained by the cmb method when the parameters identified by the cmby calibration scheme are used for baseflow separation the sensitivity of the parameters to seasonal changes is not considered the calculation with the stable parameter setting will lead to a larger baseflow in high flow seasons and a smaller baseflow in low flow seasons for this monitoring site most time of the year belongs to the low flow season and the high flow season accounts for a short time the total baseflow obtained by the cmby scheme in low flow seasons is 1234 2 m3 s smaller and 510 3 m3 s larger than that of the standard result obtained by the cmb method which is finally reflected as the annual baseflow is smaller than that obtained by the cmb method the above phenomenon can also be observed in the baseflow process curve fig 3 the result of the empirical method is higher than that of the cmb method in the whole period especially during the flood peak in the high flow season with the baseflow nearly 80 m3 s higher than the standard result compared with the results of the cmb calibration scheme in the whole period results of cmbys are lower and the results of cmby are lower in the low flow season but higher in the high flow season the baseflow obtained by the cmbs scheme is still the closest to the standard result according to the above results cmbs is considered the optimal eck parameter calibration scheme which improves the accuracy by about 66 compared with the empirical method 3 1 3 the brm method calculation results of each scheme the three brm calibration schemes based on different time series data take different parameter values but the overall bfi is relatively close and the percentage error ranges from 0 55 to 0 61 table 3 the bfi determined by the cmbs scheme is the closest to that of the cmb method with the smallest percentage error of 0 55 the bfi of the brm method for each year under the three calibration schemes is uniformly distributed on both sides of the standard value fig 2b and all the percentage error is lower than that of the eck method furthermore compared with the baseflow process of the eck method the results of the three brm calibration schemes based on different time series data can reflect the rapid response of the baseflow to a rainfall fig 3 among them the cmbs scheme fits the cmb results well in all periods while the cmbys scheme and the cmby scheme have relatively higher baseflow separation results in the low flow season and lower results in the high flow season than the cmb method in general the cmbs scheme achieves the highest baseflow separation accuracy for this site taking the results of the cmb method as the standard compared with the average percentage error of 1 85 and 2 16 of the empirical method in the mrb and crb basin adopting the optimal parameter calibration scheme i e cmbs for eck and brm methods can improve the accuracy of baseflow separation results by about 40 75 and 60 85 respectively also the brm method after parameter calibration can obtain better fitting effects considering the significant differences in climate and topography in the two basins the conclusions of the above analysis are universal and extensible 3 2 sampling duration for minimizing the cost of baseflow separation the baseflow separation accuracy and cost are always a contradiction it is challenging to minimize the baseflow separation cost while ensuring the accuracy of the aforementioned optimal separation method and parameter calibration scheme a common situation is that when conducting parameter calibration in areas where conductivity data are lacking the minimum duration of the conductivity data meeting the requirement of calculation accuracy should be investigated the data from 62 monitoring sites in the study area 19 sites from crb and 43 sites from mrb with data series lengths longer than 4 years were selected for the 15 sites of them with time series lengths of 10 years or more the sampling duration was set to 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 and 24 months respectively for the remaining 47 sites the sampling duration was set to 3 6 9 and 12 months respectively in each sampling duration sc bf sc ro and bfi were calculated and a several bfi values calculated based on the data for each sampling duration were tested for conformity to a normal distribution p 0 05 under the premise of normal distribution the bfi at sampling durations of 24 months or 12 months was calculated as the standard and the bfi at sampling durations of 3 6 9 12 15 18 and 21 months were subjected to student s t test at a confidence interval of 95 then the minimum duration without significant difference p 0 05 was considered the minimum acceptable sampling duration the calculation results of sc bf and sc ro by using the data of different sampling duration at 62 sites appendix a show that sc bf sc ro and bfi all gradually stabilize as the period length increases overall sc bf increases and sc ro decreases gradually before they stabilize while bfi exhibits no single significant upward or downward trend fig 4 taking the no 09180500 site as an example the p value of bfi in the t test does not show significant dynamic characteristics but its p value is below the limit of 0 05 when the sampling duration is 3 months this indicates that the bfi calculated from the 3 month data is significantly different from that calculated from the 24 month data meanwhile the bfi calculated by using the data of different sampling durations shows a significant variation at 3 months fig 5 the uncertainty w calculated from the data of more than 3 months remains in a low range 0 10 0 30 and it is as high as 0 62 at 3 months showing an abrupt increase therefore to obtain reliable sc bf sc ro and bfi the sampling duration should be at least 6 months according to the statistics of all sites appendix b there are 47 sites in the two watersheds with bfi subject to the normal distribution and 3 4 27 and 13 sites of them with a minimum sampling duration of 12 9 6 and 3 months respectively among the 17 sites in the crb and 30 sites in the mrb with bfi subject to the normal distribution 10 sites and 17 sites have a minimum sampling length of 6 months thus it is considered that a minimum sampling duration of 6 months is required to ensure the accuracy of the determined parameters and improve the accuracy of baseflow separation and the large differences in topography and climate of the two watersheds do not affect the minimum sampling duration furthermore considering that the parameter sc bf of the cmb method has a greater influence on baseflow separation results stewart et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 if the conductivity is monitored continuously for 6 months to calibrate the parameters of the baseflow separation method the period covering the low flow season should be selected as far as possible to improve the accuracy of separation results 3 3 recommended parameter values and regularity of distribution the recommended parameter values of the eck and brm methods were obtained by the cmbs calibration scheme for the 109 monitoring sites in the two watersheds during the high flow and low flow seasons appendix c for the sites where the determined parameters were obtained relatively high precision baseflow separation results can be achieved based on the recommended parameter values even if conductivity was not monitored at a later period to save costs for the brm method the parameter f is the product term of the difference in the runoff volume before and after time periods eq 3 which is a constant fraction of the streamflow increase or decrease during an event to represent the rapid baseflow responses to storm events stewart 2015 f controls the response degree and response speed of baseflow to the fluctuation of runoff processes parameter k is an independent term in eq 3 and the calculated value of k is less than 0 01 for most of the sites thus the change of parameter f has a more significant impact on the calculation results of baseflow theoretically varying the values of f and k by the same magnitude also shows that f is a more critical parameter for the brm method e g at no 06089000 site the baseflow obtained by increasing or decreasing f by 50 has 37 6 and 64 7 greater influence on the baseflow results than that by changing k at the same amplitude and similar results are obtained at other sites meanwhile the change of parameter Î± is very small in the calibration process eckhardt 2005 and it is not analyzed here therefore the analysis here focused on the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of the key parameters bfi max and f of the two methods to ensure the representativeness of the analysis results a comparative study was conducted in the orb where the topography and climate of the mrb differ greatly from that of the crb and the number of sites is similar to that of the crb the key parameters bfi max and f of both methods show significant seasonal characteristics in the two watersheds especially in the crb where the distribution of parameter f ranges from 0 001 to 0 399 and 0 001 0 692 with median values of 0 022 and 0 274 during the high flow and low flow seasons respectively the distribution of parameter bfi max ranges from 0 10 0 59 and 0 43 0 89 with median values of 0 262 and 0 637 respectively the parameter values in low flow seasons are significantly higher than those in high flow seasons fig 6 fig 7 in terms of spatial distribution the parameter bfi max in the crb is larger than that in the orb during the high flow and low flow seasons but there is no significant difference in the overall interval of the parameter f between the two watersheds besides the key parameters bfi max and f for both methods show an increasing trend from the upper basin at higher elevations to the lower basin for example the parameter f is below 0 01 in the upper basin and becomes significantly larger in the lower basin on the whole the climate in the crb is drier than that in the orb with the average annual precipitation of crb and orb less than 400 mm and more than 1000 mm and the annual evaporation is about 200 mm and 600 mm respectively milly and dunne 2001 miranda et al 2021 ziegler et al 2005 meanwhile there are differences in precipitation types between the two watersheds the main precipitation type in the crb is snowfall which accounts for more than half of the total precipitation carroll et al 2020 and the colorado river is primarily driven by the snowmelt grafton et al 2013 the orb is mostly dominated by rainfall and the temperature controlled precipitation type may lead to differences in the timing of flood peaks monteith et al 2006 snowmelt is a process of relatively low intensity but long duration which provides a pulse of water with a relatively high ratio of infiltration to runoff earman et al 2006 therefore the streamflow in the crb is dominated by snowmelt and is mainly recharged by baseflow while the rainfall in the orb has a large intensity and is concentrated in time in addition the vegetation coverage in the orb is sparse the soil water storage capacity is small and rainfall forms a quick flow and directly replenishes the river cao et al 2011 therefore the parameter bfi max in the crb in different seasons has a larger value than that in the orb following the same principle the parameters in the low flow seasons are higher than those in the high flow seasons secondly the influence of different climate conditions is also reflected in different areas of the same watershed compared to the lower reaches the temperature rises to above zero 1 to 2 months later in the upper reaches at a high altitude and the runoff and temperature rise simultaneously fig 8 when the surface of the vadose zone has not thawed completely in the upper reaches rises in this case the soil infiltration capacity could be significantly reduced snowmelt is difficult to infiltrate and form groundwater runoff and surface runoff is the main replenishment water source for rivers cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 gan et al 2015 the temperature in the middle and lower reaches rises earlier than that in the upper reaches fig 8 but the river recharge has a long path and produces flow at the same time as the upper reaches at this time the vadose zone has completely thawed and the snowmelt water can infiltrate and recharge the river as subsurface runoff so the key parameter bfi max of both watersheds gradually increases from the upper reaches of the basin at a high elevation to the lower reaches in addition from the physical meaning of the parameter the key parameter f of the brm method controls the response degree and response speed of the baseflow to the fluctuation in the runoff process which is also reflected in the proportion of the baseflow therefore parameter f has a similar spatial and temporal distribution with the parameter bfi max of the eck method this is consistent with the observations obtained by stewart 2014 in summary the main factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of the key parameters of the two methods are climatic conditions precipitation amount and type temperature etc the parameter values of the watershed with a drought climate and mainly recharged by snowmelt are higher than those of the watershed with a humid climate and mainly recharged by rainfall the temperature dynamics at different locations in the upper and lower reaches of the watershed determine the synchronous relationship between frozen soil and snowmelt and then control the way to recharge the river surface runoff or groundwater runoff as a result the parameters f and bfi max show a decreasing trend from the upper reaches to the lower reaches influenced by the combination of these factors the bfi exhibits a distribution pattern similar to that of bfi max fig 7 the distribution range of bfi in the crb is 0 19 0 76 with a median value of 0 40 about 20 8 10 48 of all monitoring sites have bfi values greater than 0 5 with baseflow as an important component of streamflow the overall bfi in the orb is smaller with a median value of only 0 30 and the bfi values of all sites are less than 0 5 4 conclusions in watersheds with a precipitation type of snowfall high elevation and complex topography or watersheds with a precipitation type of rainfall and flat topography more accurate baseflow separation results can be obtained after calibrating the parameters of the eck and brm methods with the cmb method also the brm method is more accurate than the eck method among multiple parameter calibration schemes cmbs contributes to the most accurate baseflow separation results and the accuracy of the results is improved by 40 75 and 60 85 compared to that of the empirical method indicating that parameter calibration can significantly improve the calculation accuracy the accuracy of parameter calibration is related to the length of conductivity data if the data length is less than 6 months the uncertainty of separation results will increase to minimize the cost it is recommended to conduct conductivity monitoring for not less than 6 months in areas where conductivity data are lacking then the cmb method and short term conductivity data can be used to calibrate the parameters of the eck and brm methods and the calibrated parameters can be used to perform high precision long term baseflow separation calculations based on subsequent streamflow data only noted that the monitoring duration of 6 months is preferable during the low flow season due to the greater influence of scbf on the baseflow results during the low flow period in this study the parameters f and bfi max of the two watersheds were calibrated by cmbs and the recommended parameter values of 109 monitoring sites were obtained where subsequent high precision baseflow separation can be performed using only streamflow data the spatiotemporal distribution of the key parameters f and bfi max is mainly controlled by climate due to the limited available data this study did not consider the influence of vegetation coverage and hydrogeological conditions on parameter distribution and the distribution of the parameter f was not analyzed comprehensively enough these issues will be further investigated in future studies credit authorship contribution statement rong

3238,behaviors of karst springs are manifestations of spatial and temporal dynamics involving multi hydrogeological processes including precipitation surface water runoff infiltration groundwater flow and anthropogenic activities these dynamic processes are usually nonlinear and nonstationary in this study we couple the shapley additive explanation shap with a long short term memory lstm recurrent neural network to produce an interpretable deep learning model to explore the precipitation driven spring discharge mechanism and to predict spatial temporal behaviors of karst springs applying the model to niangziguan springs catchment china we show that the precipitation infiltration volume of each catchment subregion is the primary factor driving the spring discharge and the precipitation over the 12 month period has the most significant effect on the spring discharge we categorize the precipitation driven spring discharge at the catchment into three patterns according to each subregion s landform and karst aquifer characteristics based on the shap analysis in the regions with deeply buried karst aquifers moderate to light precipitation recharges the karst aquifer on the other hand heavy precipitation recharges the karst aquifer in the river valley regions more efficiently than others in the regions where karst aquifers are exposed and groundwater discharges the groundwater level is the primary factor dictating precipitation and spring discharge processes keywords karst hydrological processes spring discharge lstm shap nonlinearity precipitation niangziguan springs 1 introduction a karst spring record can be used to manifest the integrated effects of spatiotemporal varying hydrologic processes these processes include precipitation surface runoff infiltration groundwater flow discharge and various anthropogenic activities dictated by the karst terrain landform i e mountains hills basins and valleys and the hierarchical aquifer heterogeneity i e pores fractures and conduits an et al 2020 identifying each process or factor from a karst spring record is a grand challenge for karst groundwater s sustainable development and management milly et al 2008 duran et al 2020 the lack of specifically measured spatial temporal data on karst terrains has led to several parsimonious rainfall discharge models labat et al 2000 for example hao et al 2013a developed a rainfall runoff model of liulin springs discharge china using the arimax model to investigate effects of anthropogenic activities and climatic variations on spring discharge they concluded that human activities have surpassed the climatic variation and become the primary factor causing the spring discharge depletion likewise labat et al 2000 developed a linear stochastic rainfall runoff model and a fourier analysis and applied them to three karst springs in france they concluded that linear input output models could not reflect hydraulic behaviors of karst springs similarly for identifying the heterogeneity of karst aquifers of niangziguan springs basin an et al 2019 developed a multitaper method to calculate the hydraulic response time of precipitation to spring discharge based on the hydraulic response time they mapped quick flow belts in the niangziguan springs catchment china recently with the development of data driven approaches such as machine learning ml the artificial neural network ann has been applied to the study of karst hydrological processes yaseen et al 2015 for example hu et al 2008 developed a nonlinear ann model to simulate the spring discharge response to precipitation for niangziguan springs china comparing the results with a previous time lag linear model they concluded that the ann model performed superiorly although anns have produced satisfactory results the time series or sequential order of input data vital in hydrological investigations are not fully explored kratzert et al 2018 lipton et al 2015 overcame the drawback of anns by developing a recurrent neural network rnn to selectively pass the information during sequence steps which is convenient to update the residual and weight values in the previous step suitable for time sequence prediction rnns unfortunately are unsuitable models for long time sequences because of their inherent gradient vanishing becoming zero or explosion becoming infinity issues in machine learning calin 2020 to address the shortcomings in the rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 proposed the long and short term memory lstm rnn approach known as lstm for short it does not suffer from vanishing gradient problems prevalent in conventional rnns therefore lstm is well suited for modeling dependencies embedded in time series solgi et al 2021 consequently lstm has become a popular tool for processing time series data recently lipton et al 2015 recently after identifying the frequency and trend feature of niangziguan springs discharge using time frequency analysis methods an et al 2020 used lstm to simulate the spring discharge s frequency and trend subsequence then they predicted the spring discharge by combining simulated results of each frequent component from lstm while the lstm model can produce satisfactory predictions it often fails to provide a clear explanation of the physical processes due to its black box nature sustainable development and management of the karst spring discharge demand an understanding of the physical mechanisms and processes such that future improvements can incorporate alterations of the mechanisms and processes hence improving lstm so that it is interpretable becomes necessary some recently emerged machine learning tools may help one to achieve the objective molnar 2020 several interpretable strategies for nonlinear ml models have been proposed including local shapley additive explanations shap shapley 1953 lundberg and lee 2017 interpretable model agnostic explanations lime ribeiro et al 2016 individual conditional expectation ice goldstein et al 2015 anchor ribeiro et al 2018 and accumulated local effects ale apley and zhu 2020 most of these strategies merely identify which input variables have a more significant influence on the output in addition most interpretation methods summarize the impact of input variables from a global perspective without revealing the impact of input variables on individual predictions lundberg et al 2020 however the shap method provides a quantitative insight into how input variables influence the model output from both global and local perspectives wang et al 2022 in particular the shap dependence plot explains the change of the shapley value with respect to the model inputs mangalathu et al 2022 moreover shap can decompose a single prediction into the sum of the effects of each input mangalathu et al 2022 revealing the magnitude and direction of each input s influence on the output in the model at each time step in this study we adopt couple shap with an lstm to produce an interpretable model and apply it to niangziguan springs catchment china to analyze spatial temporal behaviors of precipitation driven karst spring discharge including the effect of rainfall infiltration and groundwater flow to spring discharge through this study we hope to gain detailed hydrological explanations concerning the karst groundwater development and conservation 2 method in this study we use lstm to model dynamics underlying the precipitation spring discharge time series the input at each layer or unit of lstm see fig 1 is the

b are the bias vectors step length or size Ï„ 0 and Î¸ denotes the hadmard product we use the lstm to establish a precipitation driven discharge model for the karst spring the precipitation in each subregion is organized as an n dimensional vector time series input and spring discharge as the output fig 2 a these precipitation data are divided into disjoint training and testing sets sequentially fig 2b then the fixed length consecutive time series data are grouped as a fixed length time series fig 2c we then use the n index input data in the testing set assisted by data in the training set to predict the output in a future time step to train and test the lstm model using machine learning protocols we define the loss function as the mean squared error between the selected values of the ground truth and the model output we use the first order adam algorithm to minimize the loss function to assess the error in the lstm model we use several metrics including coefficient of

evaluate data abnormality swanson et al 2011 notice that rmse quantifies the deviation of the predicted values from the observed ones so the smaller the rmse value is the better the model is identical to r 2 nse is an efficiency indicator for the model ranging from to 1 an nse value close to 1 represents good model predictability meng et al 2019 yoon et al 2011 2 2 shap for quantifying contributions of inputs the shapley value which originated from cooperative game theory provides a method to distribute the profit of coalition among the participants shapley 1953 hou et al 2018a hou et al 2018b the profit of each participant reflects their relative contribution to the total gain of the coalition recently ones adopted the concept of the shapley value and coupled it with the machine learning model to endow the otherwise black box model interpretability to explain the relationship between input variables and the output so that a physically meaningful prediction can be achieved lundberg et al 2018 lundberg et al 2020 specifically the shapley value of each input variable reflects its distinctive contribution to the output quantifying the relationship between the input variables and the output and therefore facilitating improvement of prediction accuracy yang and chui 2021 shap proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 is an efficient method to compute the shapley value which is briefly described below assuming f x f x 1 x 2 x n is a predictive model where x 1 x 2 x n are n dimensional input variables suppose x 1 x 2 x n is an input sample and s x 1 x 2 x n is a subset of the input variables we define a real valued function v s 14 v s f x s x s x s d f x s e x f x where x s x i x i s x s x i x i s s x 1 x n s f is the cumulative distribution function e x is the expectation for sample x 1 x 2 x n the contribution of the input x j in s is defined as 15 Î´ v s x j v s x j v s the average contribution of the input x j for all subsets with the same size s p can be expressed as 16 Î´ v s x j s p s p s x 1 x 2 x n x j v s x j v s c n 1 p where c n 1 p is a combination by selecting p elements in a set of n 1 elements for all subsets with different sizes the

interpretable deep learning model by coupling shap with lstm we develop an interpretable deep learning model by applying shap to an lstm model fig 3 where eq 17 determines the shapley value of each input variable the shapley values are examined in four aspects to interpret the impact of inputs on outputs the first is a global summary plot which interprets the entire sample with two types of graphs one is a bar graph showing the mean absolute shapley values of all each inputs factor ranking the global order of importance of input factors the other is to plot the shapley values of each input factor for each sample through scatter plots to observe the distribution the local explanation summary as the second aspect displays how each input factor affects the predicted results the third is the contributions of different time steps specifically for each input factor the shapley values from t to t Ï„ can be displayed in scatter plots meanwhile these points also can be colored for observing the variation of contributions within time steps the fourth is examining the input variables impact on specific events e g extreme or medium spring discharge which are our primary concerns by analyzing the shapley values of input variables we can quantify the contribution of each input variables to the extreme event as a response proper mitigations and management protocols can be initiated 3 study area and data acquisition 3 1 study area the niangziguan springs complex one of the largest karst springs in northern china is located in the mian river valley eastern shanxi province china fig 4 niangziguan springs are distributed along 5 km of the mian riverbank with an annual average discharge of 9 35 m3 s from january 1959 to december 2019 fig 5 illustrates the geological cross section of the niangziguan springs catchment the cross section shows that the geological formation in the catchment from top to bottom comprises quaternary loss deposits and sandstone permian arenaceous shale carboniferous mud stone sandstone and limestone with coal seams ordovician carbonate rocks and cambrian dolomite the main aquifers of the basin are karstic limestone quaternary sandstone and porous sediments the ordovician karstic limestone is the karst aquifer which is hydraulically connected to overlying quaternary sediment aquifers han et al 1993 precipitation could reach the karst aquifer through fissures fractures and faults generally groundwater in the karst aquifer flows toward the mian river valley in the east where groundwater perches on low permeable strata of cambrian dolomite ultimately the groundwater intersects the seepage faces of the mian riverbank creating the niangziguan springs figs 4 5 rough hilly terrains with numerous small basins and gentle sloping river valleys are the typical physiographic features of the niangziguan springs catchment where the elevation ranges from 362 to 2149 m above mean sea level msl the western part of the basin is higher than the eastern part with the general topography of the basin inclining to the east the mian river valley where the niangziguan springs discharges has the lowest elevation in the catchment the valley s elevation ranges from 360 to 392 m above msl figs 4 and 5 the catchment covers a 7 394 km2 area including yangquan city pingding heshun zuoquan xiyang yuxian and shouyang counties fig 4 the annual average precipitation was 534 6 mm from 1959 to 2019 which was the primary source of aquifer recharge han et al 1993 the asian monsoon has been responsible for about 60 70 of the annual precipitation in july august and september each year 3 2 data acquisition the niangziguan springs station the northeast corner in fig 4 collected monthly spring discharges of the catchment from january 1959 to december 2019 displayed in fig 6 a the river gaging stations recorded the flow of the mian river at the upper and downstream of the niangziguan springs the spring discharge was the difference between downstream river flow and the upper stream plus pumping from the river between the two gaging stations in the catchment seven meteorological stations the black circles in fig 4 localed at yangquan pingding yuxian shouyang xiyang heshun and zuoquan provided the observed monthly precipitation time series data from january 1959 to december 2019 fig 6b h from january 1959 to december 1970 the annual mean precipitation x is 607 mm and the annual standard deviation Ïƒ is 141 mm the lower bound of heavy precipitation and upper bound of light precipitation are x 1 2 Ïƒ 678 mm and x 1 2 Ïƒ 537 mm respectively precipitation is then classified into three types heavy above 678 mm moderate 537 678 mm and light precipitation below 537 mm which account for 31 38 and 31 respectively the catchment is divided into seven subregions see fig 4 using the thiessen polygon according to the locations of gauge stations to determine the precipitation contributing areas and their fractions in terms of the total area of the catchment table 1 according to this table shouyang and heshun subregions are the largest subregions 4 results and discussion 4 1 lstm model for spring discharge spatiotemporally driven by precipitation the groundwater depths of the karst aquifer ranges from 150 to 450 m the pumping costs had limited the exploration of the karst groundwater from the depth over 150 m before 1970 in addition prior to 1970 the niangziguan springs catchment was a rural area where residents used surface water for irrigation and living primarily the spring discharge fluctuated between 12 m3 s and 18 m3 s fig 6a and the effects of human activities on the groundwater system were insignificant and negligible hao et al 2013b after 1970 the local economy started to grow due to china s economic reform and opening up policy the catchment became a vital center of coal smelting and electric power demanding a large amount of groundwater and subsequently creating a decreasing trend of spring discharge fig 6a before 1970 the springs discharge was mainly affected by precipitation without human effects after 1970 precipitation and human activities dominated the spring discharge thus we chose the precipitation and spring discharge from 1959 to 1970 to investigate the mechanism of precipitation driving the spring discharge from 1971 to 2019 we included the effects of human activities on the karst spring discharge to train the lstm model for rainfall discharge processes of the niangziguan springs we divided the data into two sets the training set from january 1959 to december 1966 and the testing set from january 1967 to december 1970 subsequently we use the monthly data of precipitation of the seven gauge stations as the input and the monthly data of the spring discharge as the output to machine learn the lstm model each lstm unit consists of one input layer three hidden layers associated with various control gates with 256 128 and 64 neurons respectively and one output layer the batch size and epochs used by the lstm model are 32 and 1380 respectively a vital hyperparameter reflecting rainfall discharge processes is the time step in the lstm and the effective time in hydrology which reflects the period of precipitation that drives the spring discharge for clarifying the time step i e effective time we describe the process of precipitation driving spring discharge as follows the karst aquifer is highly heterogeneous and exhibits hierarchical passages i e pores fractures and conduits the precipitation infiltrates through the vadose zone and reaches the saturated zone then groundwater pressure propagates through the different passages of the karst aquifer reaching the spring outlet and causing spring discharge alteration the karst processes from precipitation to spring discharge have a characteristic time scale called effective time in which the current spring discharge results from previous precipitation of a period in the past for this reason when establishing the lstm model of karst hydrology we optimized the time step simultaneously we optimized the time step through parameter identification among the choices of 2 to 20 months the errors in various metrics are showed in fig 7 fig 7 illustrated that when the time step was equal to 12 months r2 nse rmse mae and mape in the testing set are 0 72 0 68 0 64 0 53 and 3 9 respectively this result is optimal among models obtained using all time steps from 2 to 20 months indicating that precipitation within 12 months in the catchment drives the spring discharge in the lstm model the time step defines the length of a moving window in time to extract features from all the hydrological so an lstm model could deliver performance better than simple ann in hydrology hu et al 2018 using the lstm with a time step of 12 months we predicted the spring discharge in the training and testing sets the results are shown in fig 8 and the model performance is listed in table 2 fig 8a shows the observed spring discharge vs the predicted spring discharge indicating that the predicted spring discharge matches the observed spring discharge well in the training set the predicted spring discharge approximately captures the observed one in the testing set as well fig 8b and c further validate the agreement in the training and predictions in the testing period table 2 tabulates the nse rmse mae and mape values in the training and testing period demonstrating the robustness of lstm modeling of rainfall discharge processes of the niangziguan springs catchment subsequently we use the lstm model to predict the spring discharge from january 1971 to december 2019 using the precipitation data of the same period fig 9 fig 9a shows that the predicted spring discharge is stationary i e no trend under natural conditions i e without human influences in contrast the actual spring discharge exhibits an apparent decreasing trend subtracting the observed spring discharge from predicted ones we obtain the reduction of the spring discharge caused by anthropogenic activities fig 9b the reduction reveals that the groundwater consumption increases as the result of the local economic development and the spring discharge reduces gradually 4 2 shap for interpreting the lstm model fig 10 shows the shapley values of precipitation contributions from the seven subregions to the spring discharge the larger the shapley value the more significant contribution of the regional precipitation to spring discharge when the shapley value is positive precipitation plays a promoting role in spring discharge while the shapley value is negative the aquifer stores infiltrated precipitation the ranking of the contribution from the most to the least is heshun shouyang xiyang yuxian yangquan pingding and zuoquan region the top two contributors to the spring discharge i e heshun and shouyang correspond to the two subregions with large areas fig 4 and table 1 consistent with the intuition that the large area contributes more infiltration to the spring discharge however a detailed comparison of table 1 with fig 10 indicates some deviations because the landform and aquifer behaviors also affect the processes of precipitation driven spring discharge besides the area of the region fig 11 illustrates the relationship between spring discharge and precipitation at each subregion based on shapley values red and blue dots reflecting the roles of the landform and aquifer in the karst hydrological processes in the heshun subregion the shapley values of the heavy precipitation are highly positive red dots suggesting that heavy precipitation contributes significantly to the spring discharge fig 11a this finding is likely attributable to the well developed fractures and fissures connecting the surface water and the karst aquifer in this mountainous area on the contrary shapley values of heavy precipitation in the shouyang subregion are mainly negative fig 11b this subregion is a mountain area and it does not have a well developed fracture system heavy precipitation creates rapid slope runoff moving out of the regions on the other hand shapley values of slight precipitation are positive indicating that the medium and small intensity precipitation infiltrates and recharges the karst aquifer leading to the spring discharge changes in other words the second most significant contribution of the shouyang subregion is from the infiltration of medium and small precipitation over a large contributing area similarly heavy precipitation yields the spring discharge in yuxian yangquan and zuoquan fig 11d e and g and light precipitation contributes to the spring discharge in xiyang fig 11c to the contrary pingding fig 11f is somewhat different where both the heavy and light precipitation events contribute to the spring discharge the pingding subregion s low elevation and flat topography are likely the explanation the precipitation recharge depends on the groundwater level and the rainfall intensity overall the analysis shows three patterns of the spring discharge in the catchment depending on the landforms and behaviors of karst aquifers the first pattern shows up in heshun fig 11a yuxian fig 11d yangquan fig 11e and zuoquan fig 11g subregions this pattern shows that most red dots are located at the top right corner when precipitation is above 678 mm yr revealing that heavy precipitation is responsible for the high spring discharges in these subregions river valleys fractures and fissures are well developed deeply cutting into the aquifers making the well hydraulic connection between the surface water and groundwater consequently heavy precipitation recharges the karst aquifer efficiently and facilitates the increase in the spring discharge the second pattern emerges in shouyang fig 11b and xiyang fig 11c subregions where most of the red dots are distributed at the left bottom suggesting moderate to light precipitation i e 350 550 mm contributions to the spring discharge in these subregions the sediments are thick and the hydraulic connections between surface water and groundwater are weak most heavy precipitation becomes runoff rapidly flowing away from the catchment and a few may contribute to the spring discharge the recharge to karst aquifers in these areas mainly depended on moderate to light precipitation the third pattern primarily in the pingding subregion fig 11f shows that the red and blue dots distribute evenly indicating that all precipitation could facilitate the spring discharge irrespective of the intensity of the precipitation in this subregion the elevation is low and the karst aquifer is well developed precipitation recharges the karst aquifer depending on the groundwater level and precipitation when the groundwater level is low precipitation recharges the karst aquifer quickly and discharges as the spring conversely the high groundwater level limits infiltration hindering precipitation recharging and spring discharge one upshot of this study is that we have identified a 12 month window for the precipitation discharge process in the catchment as the effective time precipitation within 12 months fully contributes to the spring discharge and the contribution from precipitation beyond 12 months is insignificant and thus can be neglected meanwhile the contributions of precipitation within 12 months to the spring discharge show different behaviors in various time frames and locations fig 12 in the first group precipitation within 6 9 months has significant contributions to the spring discharge in heshun fig 12a shouyang fig 12b yuxian fig 12d and yangquan fig 12e in the second group such as xiyang fig 12c and zuoquan fig 12 g contributions of precipitation to the spring discharge increase gradually within 12 months the disparity could stem from temporal and spatial varying features of the recharge discharge processes in the heterogeneous karst aquifers of the catchment fig 13 a and b show the precipitation contribution in each subregion to the maximum spring discharge i e 17 37 m3 s in october 1964 and medium i e 13 43 m3 s in january 1970 respectively it is worth noting that fig 13 is the force plot showing the influence of each input i e precipitation in each subregion on the output i e the maximum medium spring discharge molnar 2020 the maximum spring discharge of 17 37 m3 s occurred in october 1964 the mean value of spring discharge across all samples is 13 81 m3 s we selected the measured spring discharge of 13 43 m3 s in january 1970 close to the mean spring discharge as the medium spring discharge for the investigation of the contribution of precipitation the length of the color bar indicates the absolute shapley values in each subregion the longer the color bar the larger the absolute shapley value the orange arrows represent the precipitation that directly drives the maximum medium spring discharge or the precipitation that positively influences the spring discharge the green arrows indicate that precipitation is stored in the aquifer did not reach the spring outlet and slowed the spring discharge or precipitation negatively influenced the spring discharge table 3 tabulates the shapley value of each subregion and corresponding precipitation when the maximum spring discharge occurs the shapley value of heshun is negative indicating precipitation of heshun did not increase the spring discharge fig 13a from fig 11a one notices that when precipitation exceeds 1100 mm the precipitation of heshun can drive the spring discharge at a high order position table 3 shows that precipitation of the past 12 months before maximum spring discharge occurred is 796 mm in heshun far less than the 1100 mm to accelerate the spring discharge likely the precipitation is not large enough to penetrate the aquifers and reach the spring outlet most of the infiltrated precipitation is stored in karst aquifers conversely the shapley values of shouyang xiyang pingding zuoquan yuxian and yangquan are positive suggesting that precipitation accelerates the spring discharge in these subregions fig 13 table 3 illustrates that precipitation of the previous 12 months before the maximum occurred in the six subregions is much larger than their annual average precipitation corresponding to much larger recharges to the karst aquifer thus precipitation in shouyang xiyang pingding zuoquan yuxian and yangquan subregions is directly linked to the maximum spring discharge when the spring discharge maximum occurs it does not mean that precipitation at each subregion is maximized the effective precipitation in subregions actually dictates spring discharge maximum fig 13b illustrates the precipitation contribution to the medium spring discharge in each subregion when the spring discharge medium occurs the shapley values of precipitation of shouyang and zuoquan are negative fig 13b and table 3 the annual precipitation in shouyang and zuoquan subregions is recorded at 527 mm and 550 mm respectively less than their annual average precipitation table 3 the energy of the infiltrated precipitation is weak and the infiltrated precipitation could not propagate and reach spring outlet most of the infiltrated precipitation stores in the strata and its contribution to the spring discharge is negative on the contrary the contributions of heshun yuxian yangquan xiyang and pingding are positive suggesting precipitation promotes spring discharge in these subregions fig 13b precipitation at heshun yuxian and yangquan is larger than their annual average precipitation and precipitation at xiyang and pingding is close to the annual average value the combined effect facilitates precipitation infiltration and then recharges the spring discharge leading to positive contributions thus the average precipitation at subregions triggers the medium spring discharge 5 conclusions precipitation driven spring discharge in a karst catchment is a complex dynamical process involving spatiotemporally varying precipitation surface runoff infiltration and groundwater flow the intricate terranes and highly heterogeneous distributions of fractures and conduits in a karst catchment exacerbate interactions complexity as a black box model the lstm model can yield reasonable predictions however management of karst catchment springs requires comprehension of physical mechanisms governing dynamics of the spring discharge coupling shap to lstm allows one to gain significant geophysical insights into spring discharge mechanisms in karst catchments lacked in the traditional machine learning model based on shapley values this study investigates contributions of regional precipitation to the spring discharge with respect to each subregion of the karst catchment determines the effective time of the precipitation driven discharge and recharge process and unravels some important spatial temporal behaviors of the precipitation driven spring discharge when studying niangziguan spring catchment china using this approach we found that the large subregion contributes more infiltration to spring discharge meanwhile the precipitation distribution in space intensity landform and aquifer heterogeneity dominate the karst hydrological processes it reveals that the study area s precipitation spring discharge processes exhibit three distinctive patterns firstly hydraulic connections between the surface formation and karst aquifer are copious in the well developed river valleys since valleys cut through sediments and reach karst aquifers moderate and low intensity precipitation leads to fewer recharges to the spring than high intensity ones secondly in subregions where the karst aquifer is deep and the mountain valley slopes are steep heavy precipitation becomes surface runoff leaving only a tiny fraction for spring recharges as a result the karst aquifer is mainly recharged by moderate to light precipitation thirdly in the karst exposed and groundwater discharge areas the groundwater level is the primary factor dictating precipitation and spring discharge processes when the groundwater level is low precipitation can contribute to the spring discharge irrespective of its intensity only heavy precipitation can recharge the spring discharge when the groundwater level is high the active time length i e the effective time of precipitation spring discharge is identified as 12 months for the subregion in the catchment with uneven effectiveness in the first type precipitation within 6 9 months contributes significantly to the spring discharge in the second type contributions of precipitation to the spring discharge increase gradually within 12 months the disparity could stem from spatiotemporal features of the recharge discharge in the heterogeneous karst aquifers of the catchment during groundwater converging and diverging flows the specific cases of the spring discharge maximum and medium represent the major hydrological processes of the karst catchment quantifying the contribution from precipitation to the maximum and medium spring discharge enhances our understanding of hydrological processes in the karst catchment when the spring discharge maximum occurs the precipitation at each subregion may not necessarily reaches the maximum effective high precipitation in most subregions is responsible for the maximum spring discharge the medium spring discharge signifies that most precipitation at subregions approximately is the average value leading to the medium spring discharge credit authorship contribution statement xiehui song formal analysis huiqing hao investigation wenqiang liu data

3238,behaviors of karst springs are manifestations of spatial and temporal dynamics involving multi hydrogeological processes including precipitation surface water runoff infiltration groundwater flow and anthropogenic activities these dynamic processes are usually nonlinear and nonstationary in this study we couple the shapley additive explanation shap with a long short term memory lstm recurrent neural network to produce an interpretable deep learning model to explore the precipitation driven spring discharge mechanism and to predict spatial temporal behaviors of karst springs applying the model to niangziguan springs catchment china we show that the precipitation infiltration volume of each catchment subregion is the primary factor driving the spring discharge and the precipitation over the 12 month period has the most significant effect on the spring discharge we categorize the precipitation driven spring discharge at the catchment into three patterns according to each subregion s landform and karst aquifer characteristics based on the shap analysis in the regions with deeply buried karst aquifers moderate to light precipitation recharges the karst aquifer on the other hand heavy precipitation recharges the karst aquifer in the river valley regions more efficiently than others in the regions where karst aquifers are exposed and groundwater discharges the groundwater level is the primary factor dictating precipitation and spring discharge processes keywords karst hydrological processes spring discharge lstm shap nonlinearity precipitation niangziguan springs 1 introduction a karst spring record can be used to manifest the integrated effects of spatiotemporal varying hydrologic processes these processes include precipitation surface runoff infiltration groundwater flow discharge and various anthropogenic activities dictated by the karst terrain landform i e mountains hills basins and valleys and the hierarchical aquifer heterogeneity i e pores fractures and conduits an et al 2020 identifying each process or factor from a karst spring record is a grand challenge for karst groundwater s sustainable development and management milly et al 2008 duran et al 2020 the lack of specifically measured spatial temporal data on karst terrains has led to several parsimonious rainfall discharge models labat et al 2000 for example hao et al 2013a developed a rainfall runoff model of liulin springs discharge china using the arimax model to investigate effects of anthropogenic activities and climatic variations on spring discharge they concluded that human activities have surpassed the climatic variation and become the primary factor causing the spring discharge depletion likewise labat et al 2000 developed a linear stochastic rainfall runoff model and a fourier analysis and applied them to three karst springs in france they concluded that linear input output models could not reflect hydraulic behaviors of karst springs similarly for identifying the heterogeneity of karst aquifers of niangziguan springs basin an et al 2019 developed a multitaper method to calculate the hydraulic response time of precipitation to spring discharge based on the hydraulic response time they mapped quick flow belts in the niangziguan springs catchment china recently with the development of data driven approaches such as machine learning ml the artificial neural network ann has been applied to the study of karst hydrological processes yaseen et al 2015 for example hu et al 2008 developed a nonlinear ann model to simulate the spring discharge response to precipitation for niangziguan springs china comparing the results with a previous time lag linear model they concluded that the ann model performed superiorly although anns have produced satisfactory results the time series or sequential order of input data vital in hydrological investigations are not fully explored kratzert et al 2018 lipton et al 2015 overcame the drawback of anns by developing a recurrent neural network rnn to selectively pass the information during sequence steps which is convenient to update the residual and weight values in the previous step suitable for time sequence prediction rnns unfortunately are unsuitable models for long time sequences because of their inherent gradient vanishing becoming zero or explosion becoming infinity issues in machine learning calin 2020 to address the shortcomings in the rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 proposed the long and short term memory lstm rnn approach known as lstm for short it does not suffer from vanishing gradient problems prevalent in conventional rnns therefore lstm is well suited for modeling dependencies embedded in time series solgi et al 2021 consequently lstm has become a popular tool for processing time series data recently lipton et al 2015 recently after identifying the frequency and trend feature of niangziguan springs discharge using time frequency analysis methods an et al 2020 used lstm to simulate the spring discharge s frequency and trend subsequence then they predicted the spring discharge by combining simulated results of each frequent component from lstm while the lstm model can produce satisfactory predictions it often fails to provide a clear explanation of the physical processes due to its black box nature sustainable development and management of the karst spring discharge demand an understanding of the physical mechanisms and processes such that future improvements can incorporate alterations of the mechanisms and processes hence improving lstm so that it is interpretable becomes necessary some recently emerged machine learning tools may help one to achieve the objective molnar 2020 several interpretable strategies for nonlinear ml models have been proposed including local shapley additive explanations shap shapley 1953 lundberg and lee 2017 interpretable model agnostic explanations lime ribeiro et al 2016 individual conditional expectation ice goldstein et al 2015 anchor ribeiro et al 2018 and accumulated local effects ale apley and zhu 2020 most of these strategies merely identify which input variables have a more significant influence on the output in addition most interpretation methods summarize the impact of input variables from a global perspective without revealing the impact of input variables on individual predictions lundberg et al 2020 however the shap method provides a quantitative insight into how input variables influence the model output from both global and local perspectives wang et al 2022 in particular the shap dependence plot explains the change of the shapley value with respect to the model inputs mangalathu et al 2022 moreover shap can decompose a single prediction into the sum of the effects of each input mangalathu et al 2022 revealing the magnitude and direction of each input s influence on the output in the model at each time step in this study we adopt couple shap with an lstm to produce an interpretable model and apply it to niangziguan springs catchment china to analyze spatial temporal behaviors of precipitation driven karst spring discharge including the effect of rainfall infiltration and groundwater flow to spring discharge through this study we hope to gain detailed hydrological explanations concerning the karst groundwater development and conservation 2 method in this study we use lstm to model dynamics underlying the precipitation spring discharge time series the input at each layer or unit of lstm see fig 1 is the monthly precipitation in selected subregions of the niagziguan springs catchment and the output is the catchment spring discharge 2 1 lstm model unlike a generic rnn composed of three types of layers

b are the bias vectors step length or size Ï„ 0 and Î¸ denotes the hadmard product we use the lstm to establish a precipitation driven discharge model for the karst spring the precipitation in each subregion is organized as an n dimensional vector time series input and spring discharge as the output fig 2 a these precipitation data are divided into disjoint training and testing sets sequentially fig 2b then the fixed length consecutive time series data are grouped as a fixed length time series fig 2c we then use the n index input data in the testing set assisted by data in the training set to predict the output in a future time step to train and test the lstm model using machine learning protocols we define the loss function as the mean squared error between the selected values of the ground truth and the model output we use the first order adam algorithm to minimize the loss function to assess the error in the lstm model we use several metrics including coefficient of

contributions of inputs the shapley value which originated from cooperative game theory provides a method to distribute the profit of coalition among the participants shapley 1953 hou et al 2018a hou et al 2018b the profit of each participant reflects their relative contribution to the total gain of the coalition recently ones adopted the concept of the shapley value and coupled it with the machine learning model to endow the otherwise black box model interpretability to explain the relationship between input variables and the output so that a physically meaningful prediction can be achieved lundberg et al 2018 lundberg et al 2020 specifically the shapley value of each input variable reflects its distinctive contribution to the output quantifying the relationship between the input variables and the output and therefore facilitating improvement of prediction accuracy yang and chui 2021 shap proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 is an efficient method to compute the shapley value which is briefly described below assuming f x f x 1 x 2 x n is a predictive model where x 1 x 2 x n are n dimensional input variables suppose x 1 x 2 x n is an input sample and s x 1 x 2 x n is a subset of the input variables we define a real valued function v s 14 v s f x s x s x s d f x s e x f x where x s x i x i s x s x i x i s s x 1 x n s f is the cumulative distribution function e x is the expectation for sample x 1 x 2 x n the contribution of the input x j in s is defined as 15 Î´ v s x j v s x j v s the average contribution of the input x j for all subsets with the same size s p can be expressed as 16 Î´ v s x j s p s p s x 1 x 2 x n x j v s x j v s c n 1 p where c n 1 p is a combination by selecting p elements in a set of n 1 elements for all subsets with different sizes the

contributions of all input variables 18 j 1 n Ï• x j f x 1 x 2 x n e x f x for each input we can calculate its shapley value which can be used to interpret the contribution to the prediction model s output known as the shap explanation force lundberg et al 2018 assessing the global influence of each input all the local and global interpretations involving shapley values can give the seemingly black box prediction model meaningful hydrologically explanations revealing the underlying mechanism in the model and highlighting the study s significance yang et al 2020 yang and chui 2021 2 3 an interpretable deep learning model by coupling shap with lstm we develop an interpretable deep learning model by applying shap to an lstm model fig 3 where eq 17 determines the shapley value of each input variable the shapley values are examined in four aspects to interpret the impact of inputs on outputs the first is a global summary plot which interprets the entire sample with two types of graphs one is a bar graph showing the mean absolute shapley values of all each inputs factor ranking the global order of importance of input factors the other is to plot the shapley values of each input factor for each sample through scatter plots to observe the distribution the local explanation summary as the second aspect displays how each input factor affects the predicted results the third is the contributions of different time steps specifically for each input factor the shapley values from t to t Ï„ can be displayed in scatter plots meanwhile these points also can be colored for observing the variation of contributions within time steps the fourth is examining the input variables impact on specific events e g extreme or medium spring discharge which are our primary concerns by analyzing the shapley values of input variables we can quantify the contribution of each input variables to the extreme event as a response proper mitigations and management protocols can be initiated 3 study area and data acquisition 3 1 study area the niangziguan springs complex one of the largest karst springs in northern china is located in the mian river valley eastern shanxi province china fig 4 niangziguan springs are distributed along 5 km of the mian riverbank with an annual average discharge of 9 35 m3 s from january 1959 to december 2019 fig 5 illustrates the geological cross section of the niangziguan springs catchment the cross section shows that the geological formation in the catchment from top to bottom comprises quaternary loss deposits and sandstone permian arenaceous shale carboniferous mud stone sandstone and limestone with coal seams ordovician carbonate rocks and cambrian dolomite the main aquifers of the basin are karstic limestone quaternary sandstone and porous sediments the ordovician karstic limestone is the karst aquifer which is hydraulically connected to overlying quaternary sediment aquifers han et al 1993 precipitation could reach the karst aquifer through fissures fractures and faults generally groundwater in the karst aquifer flows toward the mian river valley in the east where groundwater perches on low permeable strata of cambrian dolomite ultimately the groundwater intersects the seepage faces of the mian riverbank creating the niangziguan springs figs 4 5 rough hilly terrains with numerous small basins and gentle sloping river valleys are the typical physiographic features of the niangziguan springs catchment where the elevation ranges from 362 to 2149 m above mean sea level msl the western part of the basin is higher than the eastern part with the general topography of the basin inclining to the east the mian river valley where the niangziguan springs discharges has the lowest elevation in the catchment the valley s elevation ranges from 360 to 392 m above msl figs 4 and 5 the catchment covers a 7 394 km2 area including yangquan city pingding heshun zuoquan xiyang yuxian and shouyang counties fig 4 the annual average precipitation was 534 6 mm from 1959 to 2019 which was the primary source of aquifer recharge han et al 1993 the asian monsoon has been responsible for about 60 70 of the annual precipitation in july august and september each year 3 2 data acquisition the niangziguan springs station the northeast corner in fig 4 collected monthly spring discharges of the catchment from january 1959 to december 2019 displayed in fig 6 a the river gaging stations recorded the flow of the mian river at the upper and downstream of the niangziguan springs the spring discharge was the difference between downstream river flow and the upper stream plus pumping from the river between the two gaging stations in the catchment seven meteorological stations the black circles in fig 4 localed at yangquan pingding yuxian shouyang xiyang heshun and zuoquan provided the observed monthly precipitation time series data from january 1959 to december 2019 fig 6b h from january 1959 to december 1970 the annual mean precipitation x is 607 mm and the annual standard deviation Ïƒ is 141 mm the lower bound of heavy precipitation and upper bound of light precipitation are x 1 2 Ïƒ 678 mm and x 1 2 Ïƒ 537 mm respectively precipitation is then classified into three types heavy above 678 mm moderate 537 678 mm and light precipitation below 537 mm which account for 31 38 and 31 respectively the catchment is divided into seven subregions see fig 4 using the thiessen polygon according to the locations of gauge stations to determine the precipitation contributing areas and their fractions in terms of the total area of the catchment table 1 according to this table shouyang and heshun subregions are the largest subregions 4 results and discussion 4 1 lstm model for spring discharge spatiotemporally driven by precipitation the groundwater depths of the karst aquifer ranges from 150 to 450 m the pumping costs had limited the exploration of the karst groundwater from the depth over 150 m before 1970 in addition prior to 1970 the niangziguan springs catchment was a rural area where residents used surface water for irrigation and living primarily the spring discharge fluctuated between 12 m3 s and 18 m3 s fig 6a and the effects of human activities on the groundwater system were insignificant and negligible hao et al 2013b after 1970 the local economy started to grow due to china s economic reform and opening up policy the catchment became a vital center of coal smelting and electric power demanding a large amount of groundwater and subsequently creating a decreasing trend of spring discharge fig 6a before 1970 the springs discharge was mainly affected by precipitation without human effects after 1970 precipitation and human activities dominated the spring discharge thus we chose the precipitation and spring discharge from 1959 to 1970 to investigate the mechanism of precipitation driving the spring discharge from 1971 to 2019 we included the effects of human activities on the karst spring discharge to train the lstm model for rainfall discharge processes of the niangziguan springs we divided the data into two sets the training set from january 1959 to december 1966 and the testing set from january 1967 to december 1970 subsequently we use the monthly data of precipitation of the seven gauge stations as the input and the monthly data of the spring discharge as the output to machine learn the lstm model each lstm unit consists of one input layer three hidden layers associated with various control gates with 256 128 and 64 neurons respectively and one output layer the batch size and epochs used by the lstm model are 32 and 1380 respectively a vital hyperparameter reflecting rainfall discharge processes is the time step in the lstm and the effective time in hydrology which reflects the period of precipitation that drives the spring discharge for clarifying the time step i e effective time we describe the process of precipitation driving spring discharge as follows the karst aquifer is highly heterogeneous and exhibits hierarchical passages i e pores fractures and conduits the precipitation infiltrates through the vadose zone and reaches the saturated zone then groundwater pressure propagates through the different passages of the karst aquifer reaching the spring outlet and causing spring discharge alteration the karst processes from precipitation to spring discharge have a characteristic time scale called effective time in which the current spring discharge results from previous precipitation of a period in the past for this reason when establishing the lstm model of karst hydrology we optimized the time step simultaneously we optimized the time step through parameter identification among the choices of 2 to 20 months the errors in various metrics are showed in fig 7 fig 7 illustrated that when the time step was equal to 12 months r2 nse rmse mae and mape in the testing set are 0 72 0 68 0 64 0 53 and 3 9 respectively this result is optimal among models obtained using all time steps from 2 to 20 months indicating that precipitation within 12 months in the catchment drives the spring discharge in the lstm model the time step defines the length of a moving window in time to extract features from all the hydrological so an lstm model could deliver performance better than simple ann in hydrology hu et al 2018 using the lstm with a time step of 12 months we predicted the spring discharge in the training and testing sets the results are shown in fig 8 and the model performance is listed in table 2 fig 8a shows the observed spring discharge vs the predicted spring discharge indicating that the predicted spring discharge matches the observed spring discharge well in the training set the predicted spring discharge approximately captures the observed one in the testing set as well fig 8b and c further validate the agreement in the training and predictions in the testing period table 2 tabulates the nse rmse mae and mape values in the training and testing period demonstrating the robustness of lstm modeling of rainfall discharge processes of the niangziguan springs catchment subsequently we use the lstm model to predict the spring discharge from january 1971 to december 2019 using the precipitation data of the same period fig 9 fig 9a shows that the predicted spring discharge is stationary i e no trend under natural conditions i e without human influences in contrast the actual spring discharge exhibits an apparent decreasing trend subtracting the observed spring discharge from predicted ones we obtain the reduction of the spring discharge caused by anthropogenic activities fig 9b the reduction reveals that the groundwater consumption increases as the result of the local economic development and the spring discharge reduces gradually 4 2 shap for interpreting the lstm model fig 10 shows the shapley values of precipitation contributions from the seven subregions to the spring discharge the larger the shapley value the more significant contribution of the regional precipitation to spring discharge when the shapley value is positive precipitation plays a promoting role in spring discharge while the shapley value is negative the aquifer stores infiltrated precipitation the ranking of the contribution from the most to the least is heshun shouyang xiyang yuxian yangquan pingding and zuoquan region the top two contributors to the spring discharge i e heshun and shouyang correspond to the two subregions with large areas fig 4 and table 1 consistent with the intuition that the large area contributes more infiltration to the spring discharge however a detailed comparison of table 1 with fig 10 indicates some deviations because the landform and aquifer behaviors also affect the processes of precipitation driven spring discharge besides the area of the region fig 11 illustrates the relationship between spring discharge and precipitation at each subregion based on shapley values red and blue dots reflecting the roles of the landform and aquifer in the karst hydrological processes in the heshun subregion the shapley values of the heavy precipitation are highly positive red dots suggesting that heavy precipitation contributes significantly to the spring discharge fig 11a this finding is likely attributable to the well developed fractures and fissures connecting the surface water and the karst aquifer in this mountainous area on the contrary shapley values of heavy precipitation in the shouyang subregion are mainly negative fig 11b this subregion is a mountain area and it does not have a well developed fracture system heavy precipitation creates rapid slope runoff moving out of the regions on the other hand shapley values of slight precipitation are positive indicating that the medium and small intensity precipitation infiltrates and recharges the karst aquifer leading to the spring discharge changes in other words the second most significant contribution of the shouyang subregion is from the infiltration of medium and small precipitation over a large contributing area similarly heavy precipitation yields the spring discharge in yuxian yangquan and zuoquan fig 11d e and g and light precipitation contributes to the spring discharge in xiyang fig 11c to the contrary pingding fig 11f is somewhat different where both the heavy and light precipitation events contribute to the spring discharge the pingding subregion s low elevation and flat topography are likely the explanation the precipitation recharge depends on the groundwater level and the rainfall intensity overall the analysis shows three patterns of the spring discharge in the catchment depending on the landforms and behaviors of karst aquifers the first pattern shows up in heshun fig 11a yuxian fig 11d yangquan fig 11e and zuoquan fig 11g subregions this pattern shows that most red dots are located at the top right corner when precipitation is above 678 mm yr revealing that heavy precipitation is responsible for the high spring discharges in these subregions river valleys fractures and fissures are well developed deeply cutting into the aquifers making the well hydraulic connection between the surface water and groundwater consequently heavy precipitation recharges the karst aquifer efficiently and facilitates the increase in the spring discharge the second pattern emerges in shouyang fig 11b and xiyang fig 11c subregions where most of the red dots are distributed at the left bottom suggesting moderate to light precipitation i e 350 550 mm contributions to the spring discharge in these subregions the sediments are thick and the hydraulic connections between surface water and groundwater are weak most heavy precipitation becomes runoff rapidly flowing away from the catchment and a few may contribute to the spring discharge the recharge to karst aquifers in these areas mainly depended on moderate to light precipitation the third pattern primarily in the pingding subregion fig 11f shows that the red and blue dots distribute evenly indicating that all precipitation could facilitate the spring discharge irrespective of the intensity of the precipitation in this subregion the elevation is low and the karst aquifer is well developed precipitation recharges the karst aquifer depending on the groundwater level and precipitation when the groundwater level is low precipitation recharges the karst aquifer quickly and discharges as the spring conversely the high groundwater level limits infiltration hindering precipitation recharging and spring discharge one upshot of this study is that we have identified a 12 month window for the precipitation discharge process in the catchment as the effective time precipitation within 12 months fully contributes to the spring discharge and the contribution from precipitation beyond 12 months is insignificant and thus can be neglected meanwhile the contributions of precipitation within 12 months to the spring discharge show different behaviors in various time frames and locations fig 12 in the first group precipitation within 6 9 months has significant contributions to the spring discharge in heshun fig 12a shouyang fig 12b yuxian fig 12d and yangquan fig 12e in the second group such as xiyang fig 12c and zuoquan fig 12 g contributions of precipitation to the spring discharge increase gradually within 12 months the disparity could stem from temporal and spatial varying features of the recharge discharge processes in the heterogeneous karst aquifers of the catchment fig 13 a and b show the precipitation contribution in each subregion to the maximum spring discharge i e 17 37 m3 s in october 1964 and medium i e 13 43 m3 s in january 1970 respectively it is worth noting that fig 13 is the force plot showing the influence of each input i e precipitation in each subregion on the output i e the maximum medium spring discharge molnar 2020 the maximum spring discharge of 17 37 m3 s occurred in october 1964 the mean value of spring discharge across all samples is 13 81 m3 s we selected the measured spring discharge of 13 43 m3 s in january 1970 close to the mean spring discharge as the medium spring discharge for the investigation of the contribution of precipitation the length of the color bar indicates the absolute shapley values in each subregion the longer the color bar the larger the absolute shapley value the orange arrows represent the precipitation that directly drives the maximum medium spring discharge or the precipitation that positively influences the spring discharge the green arrows indicate that precipitation is stored in the aquifer did not reach the spring outlet and slowed the spring discharge or precipitation negatively influenced the spring discharge table 3 tabulates the shapley value of each subregion and corresponding precipitation when the maximum spring discharge occurs the shapley value of heshun is negative indicating precipitation of heshun did not increase the spring discharge fig 13a from fig 11a one notices that when precipitation exceeds 1100 mm the precipitation of heshun can drive the spring discharge at a high order position table 3 shows that precipitation of the past 12 months before maximum spring discharge occurred is 796 mm in heshun far less than the 1100 mm to accelerate the spring discharge likely the precipitation is not large enough to penetrate the aquifers and reach the spring outlet most of the infiltrated precipitation is stored in karst aquifers conversely the shapley values of shouyang xiyang pingding zuoquan yuxian and yangquan are positive suggesting that precipitation accelerates the spring discharge in these subregions fig 13 table 3 illustrates that precipitation of the previous 12 months before the maximum occurred in the six subregions is much larger than their annual average precipitation corresponding to much larger recharges to the karst aquifer thus precipitation in shouyang xiyang pingding zuoquan yuxian and yangquan subregions is directly linked to the maximum spring discharge when the spring discharge maximum occurs it does not mean that precipitation at each subregion is maximized the effective precipitation in subregions actually dictates spring discharge maximum fig 13b illustrates the precipitation contribution to the medium spring discharge in each subregion when the spring discharge medium occurs the shapley values of precipitation of shouyang and zuoquan are negative fig 13b and table 3 the annual precipitation in shouyang and zuoquan subregions is recorded at 527 mm and 550 mm respectively less than their annual average precipitation table 3 the energy of the infiltrated precipitation is weak and the infiltrated precipitation could not propagate and reach spring outlet most of the infiltrated precipitation stores in the strata and its contribution to the spring discharge is negative on the contrary the contributions of heshun yuxian yangquan xiyang and pingding are positive suggesting precipitation promotes spring discharge in these subregions fig 13b precipitation at heshun yuxian and yangquan is larger than their annual average precipitation and precipitation at xiyang and pingding is close to the annual average value the combined effect facilitates precipitation infiltration and then recharges the spring discharge leading to positive contributions thus the average precipitation at subregions triggers the medium spring discharge 5 conclusions precipitation driven spring discharge in a karst catchment is a complex dynamical process involving spatiotemporally varying precipitation surface runoff infiltration and groundwater flow the intricate terranes and highly heterogeneous distributions of fractures and conduits in a karst catchment exacerbate interactions complexity as a black box model the lstm model can yield reasonable predictions however management of karst catchment springs requires comprehension of physical mechanisms governing dynamics of the spring discharge coupling shap to lstm allows one to gain significant geophysical insights into spring discharge mechanisms in karst catchments lacked in the traditional machine learning model based on shapley values this study investigates contributions of regional precipitation to the spring discharge with respect to each subregion of the karst catchment determines the effective time of the precipitation driven discharge and recharge process and unravels some important spatial temporal behaviors of the precipitation driven spring discharge when studying niangziguan spring catchment china using this approach we found that the large subregion contributes more infiltration to spring discharge meanwhile the precipitation distribution in space intensity landform and aquifer heterogeneity dominate the karst hydrological processes it reveals that the study area s precipitation spring discharge processes exhibit three distinctive patterns firstly hydraulic connections between the surface formation and karst aquifer are copious in the well developed river valleys since valleys cut through sediments and reach karst aquifers moderate and low intensity precipitation leads to fewer recharges to the spring than high intensity ones secondly in subregions where the karst aquifer is deep and the mountain valley slopes are steep heavy precipitation becomes surface runoff leaving only a tiny fraction for spring recharges as a result the karst aquifer is mainly recharged by moderate to light precipitation thirdly in the karst exposed and groundwater discharge areas the groundwater level is the primary factor dictating precipitation and spring discharge processes when the groundwater level is low precipitation can contribute to the spring discharge irrespective of its intensity only heavy precipitation can recharge the spring discharge when the groundwater level is high the active time length i e the effective time of precipitation spring discharge is identified as 12 months for the subregion in the catchment with uneven effectiveness in the first type precipitation within 6 9 months contributes significantly to the spring discharge in the second type contributions of precipitation to the spring discharge increase gradually within 12 months the disparity could stem from spatiotemporal features of the recharge discharge in the heterogeneous karst aquifers of the catchment during groundwater converging and diverging flows the specific cases of the spring discharge maximum and medium represent the major hydrological processes of the karst catchment quantifying the contribution from precipitation to the maximum and medium spring discharge enhances our understanding of hydrological processes in the karst catchment when the spring discharge maximum occurs the precipitation at each subregion may not necessarily reaches the maximum effective high precipitation in most subregions is responsible for the maximum spring discharge the medium spring discharge signifies that most precipitation at subregions approximately is the average value leading to the medium spring discharge credit authorship contribution statement xiehui song formal analysis huiqing hao investigation wenqiang liu data

3239,accurate surface soil moisture ssm information is essential for various investigations and implications in agronomy hydrology meteorology and ecology in this study an improved ssm product from

soil moisture active passive smap version 5 products in the yangtze river delta yrd region the esa cci v04 7 and smap products were corrected against a reference model based ssm product using the cumulative distribution function matching method these two corrected ssm products were fused for pixels in which they were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the model based ssm product their fusing weights were determined by three methods including the equal weight ew method tc method and tc ev in tc ev for pixels in which both corrected ssm products were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the five auxiliary factors the ev method was applied to determine their fusing weights otherwise the tc method was used the ssm fused by tc ev was compared with those fused by ew and by tc the ssm fused

water resources management dobriyal et al 2012 georgakakos carpenter 2006 remote sensing is a promising technique to provide long term and large scale ssm information kim et al 2019 petropoulos et al 2015 high sensitivity to the soil dielectric properties and strong penetration to the atmosphere and vegetation canopy made the microwave remote sensing widely used in the ssm retrieval dobson ulaby 1986 various microwave remote sensors have been launched since the 1970s including advanced scatterometer ascat figa saldaÃ±a et al 2002 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 imaoka et al 2010 soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 in addition the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci provided a active and passive microwave combined ssm product over the globe liu et al 2012 however microwave retrieved ssm products have advantages and limitations due to their different frequency bands polarizations and incidence angle ranges gruber et al 2017 for example due to the deeper penetration the l band smap was generally superior to c or x band amsr2 ssm in low to moderate vegetated area kim et al 2018 smos ssm performed better than ascat over the temperate and cold regions zhang et al 2021 which was benefited from its multi angular and dual polarization brightness temperatures kerr et al 2012 moreover in the same region performance of a ssm product may vary with times and locations for example in eastern india singh et al 2019 found that smap performed better during the non growing season while it became worse during the rice paddy growing season in the heihe river watershed china zhang et al 2019 found that the performance of smos ssm decreased in order of forest cropland grassland and shrub liao et al 2020 observed a decreasing trend in northeast china and significant increasing trends in northwest china and qing tibet for esa cci ssm due to the performances of microwave satellite based ssm products varying across time and space single ssm product was inadequate in providing accurate ssm information therefore data fusion has become an alternative to mitigate the limitation of each single sensor and thus obtain accurate ssm information yahia et al 2018 a series of approaches have been developed to fuse multi source ssm products they were classified into three categories including the fusion of optical thermal and microwave data the fusion of active and passive microwave data and the fusion of different passive microwave data the first category of approaches was generally used to downscale ssm by taking the advantage of high spatial resolution of optical thermal sensors peng et al 2021 however its primary limitations included that optical thermal remote sensing was vulnerable to atmosphere and its physical linkage with ssm was indefinite de jeu et al 2008 the second category of approaches combined high spatial resolution of the radar with high sensitivity of a radiometer narayan et al 2006 but great expense in obtaining and complexity in processing the active microwave data affected its applicability the critical issue of the third kind approaches was the assignment of fusing weights methods of weight assignment included the equal weight ew method uncertainties based kalman filter method and triple collocation tc error estimation in the least square framework cui et al 2020 gruber et al 2017 yilmaz et al 2012 both the equal weight and assigning weights based on uncertainties neglected the impacts of environmental factors on the errors of microwave ssm data wu et al 2021 therefore these methods did not necessarily reflect the optimized fusion of independent data reichle et al 2008 spatial distribution of ssm was sensitive to the heterogeneities in land surface controls and atmospheric forcing e g vegetation cover precipitation and temperature sadri et al 2020 early studies have reported the benefit of using environmental ancillary information in geographical estimations and predictions for example zhu lin 2010 found that using the environmental variables in spatial interpolation improved accuracies of soil property estimations liu et al 2021 demonstrated the importance of considering the wetness conditions in downscaling esa cci ssm zeng et al 2022 found that the accuracy of satellite based precipitation data was improved when considering the vegetation index in downscaling the entropy value ev method proposed by shannon 1948 was an important criterion to judge the deviation of each input indicator the greater discrepancy of an indicator the greater influence it exerted on the evaluation object and the greater weight it would be assigned he sheng 2019 therefore relied on the information of auxiliary environmental factors this method could be promising in determining the fusing weights in recent years it has been applied in water quality evaluation resource effectiveness and regional development shen et al 2015 zou et al 2006 however its application in fusing satellite based ssm data has been rarely reported based on these we aimed to generate a high accurate ssm product in the yangtze river delta yrd region with complex land surface characteristics by fusing the esa cci and smap products using the combined method of tc and ev tc ev specifically the objective of this study was to i correct esa cci v04 7 and smap against a reference model based ssm by cumulative distribution function cdf matching method from 2015 to 2018 ii use tc ev method to fuse the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap and iii compare the accuracies of the ssm products fused by tc ev with other two ssm products fused by the ew method and by the tc method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located on the eastern coast of china the yrd region covers an area of 36 05 104 km2 and consists of plains and low hills with the elevation ranging from 21 to 1921 m above sea level fig 1 with a humid subtropical monsoon climate this region is characterized by four distinct seasons with average annual temperature and precipitation of 14 18 c and 1000 1400 mm respectively in addition the yrd region has complicated land covers due to substantial spatial variations of temperature precipitation and undulating terrain and intense human activities the cultivated land in the yrd region is mainly paddy field with rice wheat rotation in addition this region has abundant water resources with complex river systems and large amount of water bodies lu et al 2022 therefore as the source of crop water consumption and the link between surface water and groundwater kaplan muÃ±oz carpena 2011 accurate ssm information is important for this region 2 2 ssm datasets in the yrd region the soil relative humidity data at 10 cm depth with 10 day interval was available at 46 ground stations from 1992 to 2012 which can be downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn fig 1 the soil relative humidity was converted into volumetric soil water content based on soil bulk density and field capacity provided in the study of zhang et al 2018 the smap was available from 2015 to the present and esa cci v04 7 was available from 1978 to 2018 therefore the in situ ssm from 2015 to 2018 was needed for the validation purpose by constructing the random forest models with the in situ ssm and meteorological data from 1992 to 2012 the in situ ssms of different stations from 2013 to 2018 were predicted high accuracies of the training and testing sets were achieved for these models the average correlation coefficients r were above 0 857 unbiased root mean square errors ubrmse were below 0 025 m3 m 3 and the mean biases bias were below 0 001 m3 m 3 li et al 2022 according to the study of li et al 2022 the esa cci v04 7 and smap outperformed the amsr2 and chinese feng yun 3 for the ssm estimation over the yrd region therefore these two products were corrected and fused in the current study the esa cci v04 7 was generated by fusing data from 11 active and passive microwave sensors and provided daily long term records with a spatial resolution of 0 25 over the globe liu et al 2012 https www esa soilmoisture cci org the smap equipped with l band microwave instruments monitored the global surface soil every 2 3 days entekhabi et al 2010 and the radiometer signals were collected at a local overpass time of 6 00 a m a descending mode and 6 00p m an ascending mode the passive level 3 ssm products with a spatial resolution of 36 km were used in fusing https nsidc org data spl3smp in recent years the smap was fused into the esa cci version 5 2 esa cci v05 2 and the smap and chinese feng yun 3b were fused into the esa cci version 6 1 esa cci v06 1 in this study these two versions of esa cci were used to compare with our fused ssm products the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas ssm was used as a reference to correct esa cci v04 7 and smap this data was simulated by land surface models with high quality forcing datasets e g humidity soil temperature pressure precipitation and solar radiation and integrated in situ measurements remote sensing products and modeled outputs by data assimilation techniques shi et al 2011 it satisfied the requirements of high spatial temporal coverage long term record and high accuracy daily cldas ssm at 0 10 cm depth with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 was used in this study http data cma cn the study period was from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 this was a full period that both esa cci v04 7 and smap were available only the smap data flagged as recommended for retrieval was considered in this study colliander et al 2017 the ascending and descending data from the smap were averaged into a daily product the cldas esa cci and smap ssm data in pixels with temperatures below zero was discarded then smap and cldas were resampled to 0 25 by the nearest interpolation method to spatially match the esa cci 2 3 auxiliary variables the ssm from microwave signal was vulnerable to the vegetation and the land cover spatial heterogeneity which induced errors in the ssm retrieval lei et al 2018 wigneron et al 2017 precipitation and temperature have been widely considered as important factors in ssm estimations seneviratne et al 2010 therefore the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi gini simpson index gsi precipitation pre and land surface temperature lst were selected as auxiliary factors in addition the yrd region is featured with high density of rivers and lakes which covers an area of 2 45 104 km2 cook et al 2006 therefore the water area percentage wap was also selected the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer synthetic reflectance data http reverb echo nasa gov was obtained to calculate ndvi mod09q1 250 m lst mod11a2 1 km and land cover types mcd12c1 500 m the land cover data was classified based on the international geosphere biosphere programme classification scheme precipitation data version 6 from the level 3 integrated multi satellite retrieval of the final run from the global precipitation measurement mission 10 km spatial resolution was downloaded from https gpm nasa gov the ndvi lst and pre datasets were resampled with the spatial resolution of 0 25 to spatially match the esa cci ssm product water bodies in the land cover data were used to calculate wap by the percentage of the open water body in each 0 25 pixel the gsi simpson 1949 representing the land cover heterogeneity was calculated based land cover data in each 0 25 pixel as piles et al 2015 2 1 gsi 1 i p i 2 where pi was the proportion of pixels classified as land cover type i within a 0 25 pixel 2 4 cdf matching method the cdf matching method could remove the systematic differences between unscaled and reference data liu et al 2011 thus it was used to adjust the satellite based ssm datasets into the same numerical range of cldas the piece wise linear cdf was used at each pixel to correct the esa cci v04 7 and smap against cldas from 2015 to 2018 firstly the cdf curves of the reference cldas esa cci v04 7 and smap ssm datasets were evenly divided into 12 segments by 13 percentiles 0 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 100 secondly the linear regression was performed for each segment to determine the slope and intercept finally the esa cci v04 7 and smap were corrected by the linear equations determined in step two the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap were used in the fusion 2 5 tc method the tc method was applied to estimate the random errors of the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap to determinate the fusing weights under the framework of least square weighting this method proposed by stoffelen 1998 has been applied in validating the anomalies of satellite based ssm and estimating random error variance when the true ssm data was unavailable chen et al 2017 dorigo et al 2010 a commonly used error model in the tc method was expressed as 2 2 Î¸ i Î± i Î² i Î¸ Îµ i where Î¸i was the collocated independent dataset i corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap and cldas Î¸ was the unknown true ssm data Î±i and Î²i were the systematic biases of dataset i with respect to the true value and Îµi was additive zero mean random noise the successful application of the tc method should be under four assumptions which can refer to the study in gruber et al 2016 here the random error variances of the three ssm datasets were resolved by the covariance estimation as 2 3 Ïƒ ij c o v Î¸ i Î¸ j Ïƒ ij 2 Î² i Î² j Ïƒ Î¸ 2 i j Ïƒ i 2 Î² i 2 Ïƒ Î¸ 2 Ïƒ Îµ i 2 i j where i and j corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap and cldas Ïƒij 2 and Ïƒij were the variance and covariance of the dataset i and j respectively Ïƒ Îµi 2 was the random error variance of dataset i and ÏƒÎ¸ 2 was the variance of the unknown true ssm then the least square weighting introduced by yilmaz et al 2012 was employed to fuse the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap based on uncertainty estimates by the tc method which can be expressed as 2 4 Î¸ new i 1 n Ï‰ i Î¸ i 2 5 Ï‰ i t c 1 i 1 i t c 1 where Î¸new was the fused ssm data n was the number of datasets Ï‰i was the weight of i input data derived from a weight coefficient vector of Ï‰ Ï‰ 1 Ï‰ 2 Ï‰ n t i was a one vector of length n and c was the n n error covariance matrix which held the variance of the input dataset in the diagonals and zeros in the off diagonals instead of random error variances the signal to noise ratio was introduced to circumvent the assumption of the weight estimator without systematic differences between datasets gruber et al 2016 therefore weights of the two ssm satellite based products were expressed as below 2 6 Ï‰ esacci snr esacci snr esacci snr smap Ï‰ smap snr smap snr esacci snr smap 2 7 snr esacci Î² esacci 2 Ïƒ Î¸ 2 Ïƒ Îµ esacci 2 snr smap Î² smap 2 Ïƒ Î¸ 2 Ïƒ Îµ smap 2 where snresa cci and snrsmap were the signal to noise ratio of the esa cci v04 7 and smap respectively 2 6 ev method the ev method was applied to determine the fusing weights by calculating the weights of auxiliary factors a common assumed matrix in the ev method was formed by m samples i 1 2 3 m and n indicators j 1 2 3 n in this study the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap were two samples and correlations between them and five auxiliary factors i e ndvi lst pre gsi and wap were the five indicators due to the different dimensionalities of the disparate indicators original indicators were normalized by the standardized correction method then the entropy value of the j indicator was written as follows 2 8 e j 1 ln m i 1 m p ij ln p ij 2 9 p ij y ij i 1 m y ij where ej was the entropy value of the j indicator 0 ej 1 pij and yij were the proportion and the normalized value of the j indicator in i sample respectively and m was the total number of samples weight of the j indicator was determined as followed 2 10 Ï‰ j 1 e j j 1 n 1 e j where Ï‰j was the weight of the j indicator and n was the total number of indicators finally comprehensive score of the i sample was derived as followed 2 11 f i j 1 n Ï‰ j y ij where fi was the comprehensive score of the i sample which was the fusing weight of i product Ïƒfi 1 more details can reference to shannon 1948 2 7 fusion processes and error metrics significant correlation level p 0 05 was applied as a criterion for determining fusing scheme table 1 and fig 2 the esa cci v04 7 or smap was adopted for pixels in which significant correlations were only observed between the corrected esa cci v04 7 and cldas or only between the corrected smap and cldas respectively pixels were disregarded if correlations were not observed among these three products except these corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap were fused and their fusing weights were determined by three methods in ssm fused by ew equal weights were assigned to the corrected the esa cci v04 7 and smap in ssm fused by tc weights were obtained based on the uncertainty estimated for each product by the tc method in ssm fused by tc ev weights were depended on the correlations between these two ssm products and auxiliary factors in a specific pixel if both ssm products were correlated with all five auxiliary factors p 0 05 the ev method was applied to determine the fusing weights fig 2c otherwise the tc method was used the original and corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap the esa cci v05 2 and v06 1 and three fused ssm products were extracted for the 0 25 pixels in which the in situ ssm stations were located three statistical error metrics including the r ubrmse and bias were used to evaluate the corrections by the cdf method and the performances of the fused ssm products 3 results 3 1 accuracies of ssm corrected by cdf matching method the average r and ubrmse of esa cci v04 7 and smap were improved after the cdf corrections table 2 validating against cldas the correction increased r of esa cci v04 7 and smap by 0 038 and 0 103 respectively and reduced ubrmse of these two products by 0 001 m3 m 3 and 0 015 m3 m 3 respectively however the bias of smap increased by 0 004 m3 m 3 after correction spatial distributions of r ubrmse and bias before and after the correction were shown for both ssm products fig 3 slight changes in r indicated that corrections did not change the trends of the original ssm products fig 3a d g and j changes in bias were observed between the original and corrected smap fig 3i and l moreover ubrmse values were reduced fig 3b e h and k the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap also better captured the variations of in situ ssm than the original ssm products table 2 although the r of esa cci v04 7 and smap only increased 0 004 after the correction the ubrmse and bias decreased by more than 10 2 for esa cci v04 7 and by more than 5 8 for smap these indicated that the cdf correction did not change the trends of original ssm products but improved their overall qualities 3 2 accuracies of the fused ssm accuracies of three fused ssm products were evaluated against the in situ ssm from 40 stations from 2015 to 2018 over the yrd region table 3 six stations were disregarded here since their corresponding pixels had missing data in the corrected esa cci v04 7 smap or cldas all three fused ssm products performed better than the original and corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap with r 0 742 ubrmse 0 024 m3 m 3 and bias 0 050 m3 m 3 these three fused ssm products also had higher accuracies than the latest versions of esa cci v05 2 and v06 1 in addition among these three fused ssm products the ssm fused by tc ev outperformed the others in capturing temporal dynamics and absolute value of the in situ ssm with the highest r 0 766 and lowest ubrmse 0 022 m3 m 3 as expected the ssm fused by tc performed better than ssm fused by ew with the higher r of 0 748 and lower ubrmse and bias of 0 024 m3 m 3 and 0050 m3 m 3 respectively evaluation was also carried out for pixels in which ev method was used to determine the fusing weights since only nine in situ stations were distributed in these pixels fig 2c error metrics of ssm products were calculated against the in situ ssm at these nine stations table 3 compared to the original and corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap improvements were achieved in three fused ssm products with r 0 686 ubrmse 0 026 m3 m 3 and bias 0 043 m3 m 3 the three fused ssm products also had higher r and lower ubrmse than the latest esa cci v05 2 and v06 1 moreover the ssm fused by tc ev was superior to the other two fused ssm with the highest r of 0 711 and lowest ubrmse of 0 025 m3 m 3 different from the validation at 40 in situ stations the ssm fused by ew was slightly better than that fused by tc the ssm temporal variations of the original esa cci v04 7 and smap and ssm products fused by tc and tc ev were shown at representative dry moderate and wet stations figs 1 and 4 at the dry station 58040 except the original smap the other three products could well capture the ssm temporal variations with r 0 577 and ubrmse 0 048 m3 m 3 fig 4a at the wet station 58567 similar performances of these four ssm datasets were observed with r ranging from 0 539 to 0 612 ubrmse ranging from 0 032 to 0 046 m3 m 3 and bias ranging from 0 043 to 0 080 m3 m 3 fig 4c at the moderate station 58417 better performances were achieved for the two fused ssm products than the original ssm products with r 0 750 and ubrmse 0 024 m3 m 3 fig 4b in addition spatial distributions of the original esa cci v04 7 were similar with those of the ssm fused by tc and by tc ev fig 5 b c d while that of the original smap was obviously different from the others fig 5a 3 3 spatial distribution of fusing weights weights of the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap in ssm products fused by tc and tc ev were shown in fig 6 pixels with high weights of the corrected esa cci v04 7 were distributed in the south and west of the region fig 6a and c however pixels with high weighs of the corrected smap were distributed in central east and north of the region especially along the yangtze river fig 6b and d since ev method was only applied for pixels in which both corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap were correlated with all five auxiliary factors fig 2c weights of these two products were investigated for these pixels for the corrected esa cci v04 7 the average weight in the ssm fused by tc was about 0 40 while that in the ssm fused by tc ev was 0 29 fig 6e and g for the corrected smap the average weight in the ssm fused by tc was 0 60 while that in the ssm fused by tc ev was 0 72 fig 6f and h 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of different fusing approaches in the yrd region all three fused ssm products were superior to the esa cci v04 7 and smap and the ssm fused by tc ev outperformed the other two fused ssm products table 3 the ssm fused by ew averaged the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap for different pixels therefore its accuracy was dependent on the quality of these two products the tc method was based on an error stationarity assumption gruber et al 2016 however errors in the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap varied spatially and temporally therefore the ssm fused by tc could not well capture the spatially and temporally varied errors in these two corrected ssm products in addition different signs and qualities of datasets collocated in the triplet could also degrade the quality of ssm fused by tc zhang et al 2021 yilmaz et al 2012 also found that ssm product fused with the model thermal infrared and remote sensing based ssm by tc method was not superior to that fused by ew method the best performance of ssm fused by tc ev was benefited from the consideration of auxiliary environmental factors in the fusion the ev method could reflect the sensitivity of environmental factors to the ssm change long et al 2019 also found that incorporating the environment variables into the downscaling algorithm could largely improve the accuracy of the original ssm yuan et al 2020 also summarized advantages of estimating variables using the environmental ancillary information although esa cci v05 2 and v06 1 products included the smap they performed worse than our fused products in the yrd region table 3 the reason was that our three fused ssm products were obtained based on the localized cdf correction however the esa cci v05 2 and v06 1 were derived based on the correction and fusion at the global scale therefore our fused ssm products would better reflect the regional characteristics moreover the esa cci v04 7 and smap products used in the fusion were superior to other satellite based ssm products in the yrd region and the unsatisfactory performance of chinese feng yun 3b was reported li et al 2022 the poor performance of esa cci v06 1 was due to the inclusion of chinese feng yun 3b moreover the smap performed well and was complementary to esa cci v04 7 in the current study table 3 and fig 6 therefore including the smap in the esa cci products was necessary in this region spatial distributions of weights for the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap were similar in the ssm fused by tc and tc ev fig 6 in the south and southwest of the yrd region covered by forest high weights of esa cci v04 7 were observed fig 6a and c this was due to that ascat merged into esa cci had deep penetration in moderate to high vegetated areas than passive sensors e g smap zeng et al 2015 high weights of smap were observed in the central east and northeast areas with rivers and lakes fig 6b and d the water body correction in smap algorithm made it performed well in these areas al yaari et al 2017 for pixels in which the ev method was used 66 in total weights of smap were higher than weights of esa cci v04 7 this was due to that smap performed better than esa cci v04 7 in these pixels table 3 moreover pixels fused by ev method were mostly located along the rivers and coast with complex geographical environment this suggested that ev method had a strong adaptive ability in extracting information from the environment 4 2 importance of auxiliary factors although the number of pixels 66 in total fused by the ev method only accounted for 13 3 of the entire yrd region 494 in total the accuracy of ssm fused by tc ev was improved compared to the ssm fused by tc table 3 the gsi affected the lateral transport of runoff and solar radiation thus was strongly related to ssm distribution beldring et al 1999 burt butcher 1985 plant growth and distribution were depended on the amount of water that it can extract from the soil koupai et al 2008 therefore ssm variations were closely related to the ndvi in addition latent and sensible heat fluxes were affected by ssm which spatially and temporally altered the lst legates et al 2010 precipitation was one of the water supply sources for ssm while ssm also impacted the partitioning of precipitation yang et al 2018 surface open water body might contaminate microwave signal and thus influenced the ssm retrieval grant et al 2007 therefore the importance of the gsi ndvi lst pre and wap in the fusion processes was further investigated as the atmospheric forcing for the ssm variations the importance of lst was obvious pixels having lst as the first or second important factor 19 and 20 respectively accounted for 28 8 and 30 3 of pixels fused by ev method with weights over 0 50 fig 7 in areas with strong temperature variation active sensors were less sensitive to the surface temperature than passive sensors dorigo et al 2010 therefore the smap was sensitive to the surface temperature variation and thus had higher weights compared to the esa cci v04 7 al yaari et al 2014 also reported that the passive smos was more sensitive to the temperature variation than the active ascat high weights of the corrected smap in these pixels were also related to its overpass time at 06 00 a m during the early morning the small surface temperature change aided in the ssm retrieval from the passive microwave kerr et al 2001 compared to the lst the pre was less important with weights around 0 30 and ranked middle in most pixels the prevalence of moderate to strong correlations between pre and ssm were mostly positive covering 93 07 of the globe eltahir 1998 zheng eltahir 1998 this supported the hypothesis that as pre increasing the ssm increased however irrigation of crop lands would disturb such relationship sehler et al 2019 moreover during the dry season the hydraulic redistribution and the river system weakened the relationship between pre and ssm yan dickinson 2014 such weak positive or even negative correlations between pre and ssm were also observed in previous studies guillod et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the ndvi was an important factor since the vegetation density would induce the signal attenuation in the microwave ssm retrieval pixels having ndvi as the first or second important factor 19 and 18 respectively accounted for 28 8 and 27 2 of the pixels fused by the ev method respectively with weights over 0 50 fig 7 entekhabi et al 2014 pointed out that the dominant error source for microwave ssm retrievals came from the vegetation parameter uncertainty the reason was that most vegetation parameters in ssm retrieval were based on empirical transfer functions that link land cover to specific model parameters dong et al 2020 in addition higher weights of the corrected smap than those of the corrected esa cci v04 7 were also related to the deep penetration by l band and the vegetation correction in the smap retrieval algorithm o neill et al 2016 wigneron et al 2017 the wap and gsi also were the important land surface control factors for the ssm variations microwave signals received by satellites contained the information of the open water body gruber et al 2017 therefore wap was a critical error source in the ssm retrieval however wap was the least important factor in our case with pixels having it as the first or second important factor 8 and 7 respectively only accounting for 12 1 and 10 6 of pixels fused by the ev method fig 7 one reason was that the coarse resolution of land cover data and its small temporal variation reduced its sensitivity to ssm another reason was that irrigation increased the local ssm and subsequently affected the sensitivity of wap to ssm qiu et al 2016 the gsi was of minor importance for ssm estimation in the ev method with ratios of pixels having it as the first or second important factor 7 and 8 respectively lower than 10 6 fig 7 the reason was that passive sensors were not sensitive to the surface heterogeneities wagner et al 2013 the esa cci included seven passive products which made it insensitive to the surface heterogeneity additionally passive microwave observations would be contaminated by radio frequency interference which could obscure geophysical emission njoku et al 2005 lei et al 2018 also found that radio frequency interference exerted influence on the land surface heterogeneity therefore importance of gsi to the passive smap and esa cci was reduced 4 3 limitations and outlooks main limitations of this study included the data processing and acquisition the fusion and evaluation were based on microwave satellite based ssm products from 2015 to 2018 the accurate and consistent evaluation required a long covering period of the ssm products especially for the fusion by tc method zhang et al 2021 in addition the smap was resampled to 0 25 to match the spatial resolution of the esa cci the smap and cldas were rescaled to 0 0 50 m3 m 3 to match the range of in situ ssm bulut et al 2019 these processes exerted influences on the fusing furthermore when calculating auxiliary factors annual means from 2015 to 2018 were used this neglected their inter annual variations and thus affected the efficiency of ev method unmatched sensing depths and spatial resolutions between satellite based ssm data and the in situ ssm might also affect the evaluation lastly satellite based products only represented the moisture in the very surface and the observation depth varied with microwave frequencies of the satellite instruments and soil wetness in addition to the auxiliary factors considered in this study other factors such as soil texture soil structure and topography would also influence the surface ssm variation zhu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 however adding these factors increased the complexity of the fusing algorithm therefore a balance was needed between the complexity of the fusing algorithm and the number of input parameters additionally the algorithm combining the tc and ev methods was only evaluated for fusing esa cci v04 7 and smap over the yrd region using this approach to fuse other ssm products over other regions should be addressed in the future study 5 conclusions in this study we fused the esa cci v04 7 and smap to generate a ssm product using tc ev method its accuracy was evaluated against the other two fused products by the ew and tc in the yrd region firstly the esa cci v04 7 and smap were corrected against cldas by the cdf matching method then for pixels in which significant correlations p 0 05 were observed among cldas and the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap the two ssm products were fused great improvements were achieved in the three fused ssm products by ew tc and tc ev when compared to their original ssm products and the ssm fused by tc ev was superior to the others three fused ssm products also performed better than the two latest version of esa cci products v05 2 and v06 1 the lst and ndvi were the most important factors in determining the fusing weights in the ev method followed by the pre and wap and gsi the method proposed in the study provided a new insight to fuse multisource satellite based ssm products to generate an improved ssm dataset credit authorship contribution statement liuyang li

2015 to 2018 was generated by combining the triple collocation tc method and entropy value ev method tc ev to fuse the european space agency climate change initiative version 04 7 esa cci v04 7 and soil moisture active passive smap version 5 products in the yangtze river delta yrd region the esa cci v04 7 and smap products were corrected against a reference model based ssm product using the cumulative distribution function matching method these two corrected ssm products were fused for pixels in which they were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the model based ssm product their fusing weights were determined by three methods including the equal weight ew method tc method and tc ev in tc ev for pixels in which both corrected ssm products were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the five auxiliary factors the ev method was applied to determine their fusing weights otherwise the tc method was used the ssm fused by tc ev was compared with those fused by ew and by tc the ssm fused by tc ev outperformed the other two with the highest correlation coefficient r of 0 766 and lowest unbiased root mean square error ubrmse of 0 022 m3 m 3 it also had higher r lower ubrmse and lower

1986 various microwave remote sensors have been launched since the 1970s including advanced scatterometer ascat figa saldaÃ±a et al 2002 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 imaoka et al 2010 soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 in addition the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci provided a active and passive microwave combined ssm product over the globe liu et al 2012 however microwave retrieved ssm products have advantages and limitations due to their different frequency bands polarizations and incidence angle ranges gruber et al 2017 for example due to the deeper penetration the l band smap was generally superior to c or x band amsr2 ssm in low to moderate vegetated area kim et al 2018 smos ssm performed better than ascat over the temperate and cold regions zhang et al 2021 which was benefited from its multi angular and dual polarization brightness temperatures kerr et al 2012 moreover in the same region performance of a ssm product may vary with times and locations for example in eastern india singh et al 2019 found that smap performed better during the non growing season while it became worse during the rice paddy growing season in the heihe river watershed china zhang et al 2019 found that the performance of smos ssm decreased in order of forest cropland grassland and shrub liao et al 2020 observed a decreasing trend in northeast china and significant increasing trends in northwest china and qing tibet for esa cci ssm due to the performances of microwave satellite based ssm products varying across time and space single ssm product was inadequate in providing accurate ssm information therefore data fusion has become an alternative to mitigate the limitation of each single sensor and thus obtain accurate ssm information yahia et al 2018 a series of approaches have been developed to fuse multi source ssm products they were classified into three categories including the fusion of optical thermal and microwave data the fusion of active and passive microwave data and the fusion of different passive microwave data the first category of approaches was generally used to downscale ssm by taking the advantage of high spatial resolution of optical thermal sensors peng et al 2021 however its primary limitations included that optical thermal remote sensing was vulnerable to atmosphere and its physical linkage with ssm was indefinite de jeu et al 2008 the second category of approaches combined high spatial resolution of the radar with high sensitivity of a radiometer narayan et al 2006 but great expense in obtaining and complexity in processing the active microwave data affected its applicability the critical issue of the third kind approaches was the assignment of fusing weights methods of weight assignment included the equal weight ew method uncertainties based kalman filter method and triple collocation tc error estimation in the least square framework cui et al 2020 gruber et al 2017 yilmaz et al 2012 both the equal weight and assigning weights based on uncertainties neglected the impacts of environmental factors on the errors of microwave ssm data wu et al 2021 therefore these methods did not necessarily reflect the optimized fusion of independent data reichle et al 2008 spatial distribution of ssm was sensitive to the heterogeneities in land surface controls and atmospheric forcing e g vegetation cover precipitation and temperature sadri et al 2020 early studies have reported the benefit of using environmental ancillary information in geographical estimations and predictions for example zhu lin 2010 found that using the environmental variables in spatial interpolation improved accuracies of soil property estimations liu et al 2021 demonstrated the importance of considering the wetness conditions in downscaling esa cci ssm zeng et al 2022 found that the accuracy of satellite based precipitation data was improved when considering the vegetation index in downscaling the entropy value ev method proposed by shannon 1948 was an important criterion to judge the deviation of each input indicator the greater discrepancy of an indicator the greater influence it exerted on the evaluation object and the greater weight it would be assigned he sheng 2019 therefore relied on the information of auxiliary environmental factors this method could be promising in determining the fusing weights in recent years it has been applied in water quality evaluation resource effectiveness and regional development shen et al 2015 zou et al 2006 however its application in fusing satellite based ssm data has been rarely reported based on these we aimed to generate a high accurate ssm product in the yangtze river delta yrd region with complex land surface characteristics by fusing the esa cci and smap products using the combined method of tc and ev tc ev specifically the objective of this study was to i correct esa cci v04 7 and smap against a reference model based ssm by cumulative distribution function cdf matching method from 2015 to 2018 ii use tc ev method to fuse the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap and iii compare the accuracies of the ssm products fused by tc ev with other two ssm products fused by the ew method and by the tc method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located on the eastern coast of china the yrd region covers an area of 36 05 104 km2 and consists of plains and low hills with the elevation ranging from 21 to 1921 m above sea level fig 1 with a humid subtropical monsoon climate this region is characterized by four distinct seasons with average annual temperature and precipitation of 14 18 c and 1000 1400 mm respectively in addition the yrd region has complicated land covers due to substantial spatial variations of temperature precipitation and undulating terrain and intense human activities the cultivated land in the yrd region is mainly paddy field with rice wheat rotation in addition this region has abundant water resources with complex river systems and large amount of water bodies lu et al 2022 therefore as the source of crop water consumption and the link between surface water and groundwater kaplan muÃ±oz carpena 2011 accurate ssm information is important for this region 2 2 ssm datasets in the yrd region the soil relative humidity data at 10 cm depth with 10 day interval was available at 46 ground stations from 1992 to 2012 which can be downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn fig 1 the soil relative humidity was converted into volumetric soil water content based on soil bulk density and field capacity provided in the study of zhang et al 2018 the smap was available from 2015 to the present and esa cci v04 7 was available from 1978 to 2018 therefore the in situ ssm from 2015 to 2018 was needed for the validation purpose by constructing the random forest models with the in situ ssm and meteorological data from 1992 to 2012 the in situ ssms of different stations from 2013 to 2018 were predicted high accuracies of the training and testing sets were achieved for these models the average correlation coefficients r were above 0 857 unbiased root mean square errors ubrmse were below 0 025 m3 m 3 and the mean biases bias were below 0 001 m3 m 3 li et al 2022 according to the study of li et al 2022 the esa cci v04 7 and smap outperformed the amsr2 and chinese feng yun 3 for the ssm estimation over the yrd region therefore these two products were corrected and fused in the current study the esa cci v04 7 was generated by fusing data from 11 active and passive microwave sensors and provided daily long term records with a spatial resolution of 0 25 over the globe liu et al 2012 https www esa soilmoisture cci org the smap equipped with l band microwave instruments monitored the global surface soil every 2 3 days entekhabi et al 2010 and the radiometer signals were collected at a local overpass time of 6 00 a m a descending mode and 6 00p m an ascending mode the passive level 3 ssm products with a spatial resolution of 36 km were used in fusing https nsidc org data spl3smp in recent years the smap was fused into the esa cci version 5 2 esa cci v05 2 and the smap and chinese feng yun 3b were fused into the esa cci version 6 1 esa cci v06 1 in this study these two versions of esa cci were used to compare with our fused ssm products the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas ssm was used as a reference to correct esa cci v04 7 and smap this data was simulated by land surface models with high quality forcing datasets e g humidity soil temperature pressure precipitation and solar radiation and integrated in situ measurements remote sensing products and modeled outputs by data assimilation techniques shi et al 2011 it satisfied the requirements of high spatial temporal coverage long term record and high accuracy daily cldas ssm at 0 10 cm depth with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 was used in this study http data cma cn the study period was from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 this was a full period that both esa cci v04 7 and smap were available only the smap data flagged as recommended for retrieval was considered in this study colliander et al 2017 the ascending and descending data from the smap were averaged into a daily product the cldas esa cci and smap ssm data in pixels with temperatures below zero was discarded then smap and cldas were resampled to 0 25 by the nearest interpolation method to spatially match the esa cci 2 3 auxiliary variables the ssm from microwave signal was vulnerable to the vegetation and the land cover spatial heterogeneity which induced errors in the ssm retrieval lei et al 2018 wigneron et al 2017 precipitation and temperature have been widely considered as important factors in ssm estimations seneviratne et al 2010 therefore the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi gini simpson index gsi precipitation pre and land surface temperature lst were selected as auxiliary factors in addition the yrd region is featured with high density of rivers and lakes which covers an area of 2 45 104 km2 cook et al 2006 therefore the water area percentage wap was also selected the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer synthetic reflectance data http reverb echo nasa gov was obtained to calculate ndvi mod09q1 250 m lst mod11a2 1 km and land cover types mcd12c1 500 m the land cover data was classified based on the international geosphere biosphere programme classification scheme precipitation data version 6 from the level 3 integrated multi satellite retrieval of the final run from the global precipitation measurement mission 10 km spatial resolution was downloaded from https gpm nasa gov the ndvi lst and pre datasets were resampled with the spatial resolution of 0 25 to spatially match the esa cci ssm product water bodies in the land cover data were used to calculate wap by the percentage of the open water body in each 0 25 pixel the gsi simpson 1949 representing the land cover heterogeneity was calculated based land cover data in each 0 25 pixel as piles et al 2015 2 1 gsi 1 i p i 2 where pi was the proportion of pixels classified as land cover type i within a 0 25 pixel 2 4 cdf matching method the cdf matching method could remove the systematic differences between unscaled and reference data liu et al 2011 thus it was used to adjust the satellite based ssm datasets into the same numerical range of cldas the piece wise linear cdf was used at each pixel to correct the esa cci v04 7 and smap against cldas from 2015 to 2018 firstly the cdf curves of the reference cldas esa cci v04 7 and smap ssm datasets were evenly divided into 12 segments by 13 percentiles 0 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 100 secondly the linear regression was performed for each segment to determine the slope and intercept finally the esa cci v04 7 and smap were corrected by the linear equations determined in step two the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap were used in the fusion 2 5 tc method the tc method was applied to estimate the random errors of the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap to determinate the fusing weights under the framework of least square weighting this method proposed by stoffelen 1998 has been applied in validating the anomalies of satellite based ssm and estimating random error variance when the true ssm data was unavailable chen et al 2017 dorigo et al 2010 a commonly used error model in the tc method was expressed as 2 2 Î¸ i Î± i Î² i Î¸ Îµ i where Î¸i was the collocated independent dataset i corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap and cldas Î¸ was the unknown true ssm data Î±i and Î²i were the systematic biases of dataset i with respect to the true value and Îµi was additive zero mean random noise the successful application of the tc method should be under four assumptions which can refer to the study in gruber et al 2016 here the random error variances of the three ssm datasets were resolved by the covariance estimation as 2 3 Ïƒ ij c o v Î¸ i Î¸ j Ïƒ ij 2 Î² i Î² j Ïƒ Î¸ 2 i j Ïƒ i 2 Î² i 2 Ïƒ Î¸ 2 Ïƒ Îµ i 2 i j where i and j corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap and cldas Ïƒij 2 and Ïƒij were the variance and covariance of the dataset i and j respectively Ïƒ Îµi 2 was the random error variance of dataset i and ÏƒÎ¸ 2 was the variance of the unknown true ssm then the least square weighting introduced by yilmaz et al 2012 was employed to fuse the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap based on uncertainty estimates by the tc method which can be expressed as 2 4 Î¸ new i 1 n Ï‰ i Î¸ i 2 5 Ï‰ i t c 1 i 1 i t c 1 where Î¸new was the fused ssm data n was the number of datasets Ï‰i was the weight of i input data derived from a weight coefficient vector of Ï‰ Ï‰ 1 Ï‰ 2 Ï‰ n t i was a one vector of length n and c was the n n error covariance matrix which held the variance of the input dataset in the diagonals and zeros in the off diagonals instead of random error variances the signal to noise ratio was introduced to circumvent the assumption of the weight estimator without systematic differences between datasets gruber et al 2016 therefore weights of the two ssm satellite based products were expressed as below 2 6 Ï‰ esacci snr esacci snr esacci snr smap Ï‰ smap snr smap snr esacci snr smap 2 7 snr esacci Î² esacci 2 Ïƒ Î¸ 2 Ïƒ Îµ esacci 2 snr smap Î² smap 2 Ïƒ Î¸ 2 Ïƒ Îµ smap 2 where snresa cci and snrsmap were the signal to noise ratio of the esa cci v04 7 and smap respectively 2 6 ev method the ev method was applied to determine the fusing weights by calculating the weights of auxiliary factors a common assumed matrix in the ev method was formed by m samples i 1 2 3 m and n indicators j 1 2 3 n in this study the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap were two samples and correlations between them and five auxiliary factors i e ndvi lst pre gsi and wap were the five indicators due to the different dimensionalities of the disparate indicators original indicators were normalized by the standardized correction method then the entropy value of the j indicator was written as follows 2 8 e j 1 ln m i 1 m p ij ln p ij 2 9 p ij y ij i 1 m y ij where ej was the entropy value of the j indicator 0 ej 1 pij and yij were the proportion and the normalized value of the j indicator in i sample respectively and m was the total number of samples weight of the j indicator was determined as followed 2 10 Ï‰ j 1 e j j 1 n 1 e j where Ï‰j was the weight of the j indicator and n was the total number of indicators finally comprehensive score of the i sample was derived as followed 2 11 f i j 1 n Ï‰ j y ij where fi was the comprehensive score of the i sample which was the fusing weight of i product Ïƒfi 1 more details can reference to shannon 1948 2 7 fusion processes and error metrics significant correlation level p 0 05 was applied as a criterion for determining fusing scheme table 1 and fig 2 the esa cci v04 7 or smap was adopted for pixels in which significant correlations were only observed between the corrected esa cci v04 7 and cldas or only between the corrected smap and cldas respectively pixels were disregarded if correlations were not observed among these three products except these corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap were fused and their fusing weights were determined by three methods in ssm fused by ew equal weights were assigned to the corrected the esa cci v04 7 and smap in ssm fused by tc weights were obtained based on the uncertainty estimated for each product by the tc method in ssm fused by tc ev weights were depended on the correlations between these two ssm products and auxiliary factors in a specific pixel if both ssm products were correlated with all five auxiliary factors p 0 05 the ev method was applied to determine the fusing weights fig 2c otherwise the tc method was used the original and corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap the esa cci v05 2 and v06 1 and three fused ssm products were extracted for the 0 25 pixels in which the in situ ssm stations were located three statistical error metrics including the r ubrmse and bias were used to evaluate the corrections by the cdf method and the performances of the fused ssm products 3 results 3 1 accuracies of ssm corrected by cdf matching method the average r and ubrmse of esa cci v04 7 and smap were improved after the cdf corrections table 2 validating against cldas the correction increased r of esa cci v04 7 and smap by 0 038 and 0 103 respectively and reduced ubrmse of these two products by 0 001 m3 m 3 and 0 015 m3 m 3 respectively however the bias of smap increased by 0 004 m3 m 3 after correction spatial distributions of r ubrmse and bias before and after the correction were shown for both ssm products fig 3 slight changes in r indicated that corrections did not change the trends of the original ssm products fig 3a d g and j changes in bias were observed between the original and corrected smap fig 3i and l moreover ubrmse values were reduced fig 3b e h and k the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap also better captured the variations of in situ ssm than the original ssm products table 2 although the r of esa cci v04 7 and smap only increased 0 004 after the correction the ubrmse and bias decreased by more than 10 2 for esa cci v04 7 and by more than 5 8 for smap these indicated that the cdf correction did not change the trends of original ssm products but improved their overall qualities 3 2 accuracies of the fused ssm accuracies of three fused ssm products were evaluated against the in situ ssm from 40 stations from 2015 to 2018 over the yrd region table 3 six stations were disregarded here since their corresponding pixels had missing data in the corrected esa cci v04 7 smap or cldas all three fused ssm products performed better than the original and corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap with r 0 742 ubrmse 0 024 m3 m 3 and bias 0 050 m3 m 3 these three fused ssm products also had higher accuracies than the latest versions of esa cci v05 2 and v06 1 in addition among these three fused ssm products the ssm fused by tc ev outperformed the others in capturing temporal dynamics and absolute value of the in situ ssm with the highest r 0 766 and lowest ubrmse 0 022 m3 m 3 as expected the ssm fused by tc performed better than ssm fused by ew with the higher r of 0 748 and lower ubrmse and bias of 0 024 m3 m 3 and 0050 m3 m 3 respectively evaluation was also carried out for pixels in which ev method was used to determine the fusing weights since only nine in situ stations were distributed in these pixels fig 2c error metrics of ssm products were calculated against the in situ ssm at these nine stations table 3 compared to the original and corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap improvements were achieved in three fused ssm products with r 0 686 ubrmse 0 026 m3 m 3 and bias 0 043 m3 m 3 the three fused ssm products also had higher r and lower ubrmse than the latest esa cci v05 2 and v06 1 moreover the ssm fused by tc ev was superior to the other two fused ssm with the highest r of 0 711 and lowest ubrmse of 0 025 m3 m 3 different from the validation at 40 in situ stations the ssm fused by ew was slightly better than that fused by tc the ssm temporal variations of the original esa cci v04 7 and smap and ssm products fused by tc and tc ev were shown at representative dry moderate and wet stations figs 1 and 4 at the dry station 58040 except the original smap the other three products could well capture the ssm temporal variations with r 0 577 and ubrmse 0 048 m3 m 3 fig 4a at the wet station 58567 similar performances of these four ssm datasets were observed with r ranging from 0 539 to 0 612 ubrmse ranging from 0 032 to 0 046 m3 m 3 and bias ranging from 0 043 to 0 080 m3 m 3 fig 4c at the moderate station 58417 better performances were achieved for the two fused ssm products than the original ssm products with r 0 750 and ubrmse 0 024 m3 m 3 fig 4b in addition spatial distributions of the original esa cci v04 7 were similar with those of the ssm fused by tc and by tc ev fig 5 b c d while that of the original smap was obviously different from the others fig 5a 3 3 spatial distribution of fusing weights weights of the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap in ssm products fused by tc and tc ev were shown in fig 6 pixels with high weights of the corrected esa cci v04 7 were distributed in the south and west of the region fig 6a and c however pixels with high weighs of the corrected smap were distributed in central east and north of the region especially along the yangtze river fig 6b and d since ev method was only applied for pixels in which both corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap were correlated with all five auxiliary factors fig 2c weights of these two products were investigated for these pixels for the corrected esa cci v04 7 the average weight in the ssm fused by tc was about 0 40 while that in the ssm fused by tc ev was 0 29 fig 6e and g for the corrected smap the average weight in the ssm fused by tc was 0 60 while that in the ssm fused by tc ev was 0 72 fig 6f and h 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of different fusing approaches in the yrd region all three fused ssm products were superior to the esa cci v04 7 and smap and the ssm fused by tc ev outperformed the other two fused ssm products table 3 the ssm fused by ew averaged the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap for different pixels therefore its accuracy was dependent on the quality of these two products the tc method was based on an error stationarity assumption gruber et al 2016 however errors in the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap varied spatially and temporally therefore the ssm fused by tc could not well capture the spatially and temporally varied errors in these two corrected ssm products in addition different signs and qualities of datasets collocated in the triplet could also degrade the quality of ssm fused by tc zhang et al 2021 yilmaz et al 2012 also found that ssm product fused with the model thermal infrared and remote sensing based ssm by tc method was not superior to that fused by ew method the best performance of ssm fused by tc ev was benefited from the consideration of auxiliary environmental factors in the fusion the ev method could reflect the sensitivity of environmental factors to the ssm change long et al 2019 also found that incorporating the environment variables into the downscaling algorithm could largely improve the accuracy of the original ssm yuan et al 2020 also summarized advantages of estimating variables using the environmental ancillary information although esa cci v05 2 and v06 1 products included the smap they performed worse than our fused products in the yrd region table 3 the reason was that our three fused ssm products were obtained based on the localized cdf correction however the esa cci v05 2 and v06 1 were derived based on the correction and fusion at the global scale therefore our fused ssm products would better reflect the regional characteristics moreover the esa cci v04 7 and smap products used in the fusion were superior to other satellite based ssm products in the yrd region and the unsatisfactory performance of chinese feng yun 3b was reported li et al 2022 the poor performance of esa cci v06 1 was due to the inclusion of chinese feng yun 3b moreover the smap performed well and was complementary to esa cci v04 7 in the current study table 3 and fig 6 therefore including the smap in the esa cci products was necessary in this region spatial distributions of weights for the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap were similar in the ssm fused by tc and tc ev fig 6 in the south and southwest of the yrd region covered by forest high weights of esa cci v04 7 were observed fig 6a and c this was due to that ascat merged into esa cci had deep penetration in moderate to high vegetated areas than passive sensors e g smap zeng et al 2015 high weights of smap were observed in the central east and northeast areas with rivers and lakes fig 6b and d the water body correction in smap algorithm made it performed well in these areas al yaari et al 2017 for pixels in which the ev method was used 66 in total weights of smap were higher than weights of esa cci v04 7 this was due to that smap performed better than esa cci v04 7 in these pixels table 3 moreover pixels fused by ev method were mostly located along the rivers and coast with complex geographical environment this suggested that ev method had a strong adaptive ability in extracting information from the environment 4 2 importance of auxiliary factors although the number of pixels 66 in total fused by the ev method only accounted for 13 3 of the entire yrd region 494 in total the accuracy of ssm fused by tc ev was improved compared to the ssm fused by tc table 3 the gsi affected the lateral transport of runoff and solar radiation thus was strongly related to ssm distribution beldring et al 1999 burt butcher 1985 plant growth and distribution were depended on the amount of water that it can extract from the soil koupai et al 2008 therefore ssm variations were closely related to the ndvi in addition latent and sensible heat fluxes were affected by ssm which spatially and temporally altered the lst legates et al 2010 precipitation was one of the water supply sources for ssm while ssm also impacted the partitioning of precipitation yang et al 2018 surface open water body might contaminate microwave signal and thus influenced the ssm retrieval grant et al 2007 therefore the importance of the gsi ndvi lst pre and wap in the fusion processes was further investigated as the atmospheric forcing for the ssm variations the importance of lst was obvious pixels having lst as the first or second important factor 19 and 20 respectively accounted for 28 8 and 30 3 of pixels fused by ev method with weights over 0 50 fig 7 in areas with strong temperature variation active sensors were less sensitive to the surface temperature than passive sensors dorigo et al 2010 therefore the smap was sensitive to the surface temperature variation and thus had higher weights compared to the esa cci v04 7 al yaari et al 2014 also reported that the passive smos was more sensitive to the temperature variation than the active ascat high weights of the corrected smap in these pixels were also related to its overpass time at 06 00 a m during the early morning the small surface temperature change aided in the ssm retrieval from the passive microwave kerr et al 2001 compared to the lst the pre was less important with weights around 0 30 and ranked middle in most pixels the prevalence of moderate to strong correlations between pre and ssm were mostly positive covering 93 07 of the globe eltahir 1998 zheng eltahir 1998 this supported the hypothesis that as pre increasing the ssm increased however irrigation of crop lands would disturb such relationship sehler et al 2019 moreover during the dry season the hydraulic redistribution and the river system weakened the relationship between pre and ssm yan dickinson 2014 such weak positive or even negative correlations between pre and ssm were also observed in previous studies guillod et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the ndvi was an important factor since the vegetation density would induce the signal attenuation in the microwave ssm retrieval pixels having ndvi as the first or second important factor 19 and 18 respectively accounted for 28 8 and 27 2 of the pixels fused by the ev method respectively with weights over 0 50 fig 7 entekhabi et al 2014 pointed out that the dominant error source for microwave ssm retrievals came from the vegetation parameter uncertainty the reason was that most vegetation parameters in ssm retrieval were based on empirical transfer functions that link land cover to specific model parameters dong et al 2020 in addition higher weights of the corrected smap than those of the corrected esa cci v04 7 were also related to the deep penetration by l band and the vegetation correction in the smap retrieval algorithm o neill et al 2016 wigneron et al 2017 the wap and gsi also were the important land surface control factors for the ssm variations microwave signals received by satellites contained the information of the open water body gruber et al 2017 therefore wap was a critical error source in the ssm retrieval however wap was the least important factor in our case with pixels having it as the first or second important factor 8 and 7 respectively only accounting for 12 1 and 10 6 of pixels fused by the ev method fig 7 one reason was that the coarse resolution of land cover data and its small temporal variation reduced its sensitivity to ssm another reason was that irrigation increased the local ssm and subsequently affected the sensitivity of wap to ssm qiu et al 2016 the gsi was of minor importance for ssm estimation in the ev method with ratios of pixels having it as the first or second important factor 7 and 8 respectively lower than 10 6 fig 7 the reason was that passive sensors were not sensitive to the surface heterogeneities wagner et al 2013 the esa cci included seven passive products which made it insensitive to the surface heterogeneity additionally passive microwave observations would be contaminated by radio frequency interference which could obscure geophysical emission njoku et al 2005 lei et al 2018 also found that radio frequency interference exerted influence on the land surface heterogeneity therefore importance of gsi to the passive smap and esa cci was reduced 4 3 limitations and outlooks main limitations of this study included the data processing and acquisition the fusion and evaluation were based on microwave satellite based ssm products from 2015 to 2018 the accurate and consistent evaluation required a long covering period of the ssm products especially for the fusion by tc method zhang et al 2021 in addition the smap was resampled to 0 25 to match the spatial resolution of the esa cci the smap and cldas were rescaled to 0 0 50 m3 m 3 to match the range of in situ ssm bulut et al 2019 these processes exerted influences on the fusing furthermore when calculating auxiliary factors annual means from 2015 to 2018 were used this neglected their inter annual variations and thus affected the efficiency of ev method unmatched sensing depths and spatial resolutions between satellite based ssm data and the in situ ssm might also affect the evaluation lastly satellite based products only represented the moisture in the very surface and the observation depth varied with microwave frequencies of the satellite instruments and soil wetness in addition to the auxiliary factors considered in this study other factors such as soil texture soil structure and topography would also influence the surface ssm variation zhu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 however adding these factors increased the complexity of the fusing algorithm therefore a balance was needed between the complexity of the fusing algorithm and the number of input parameters additionally the algorithm combining the tc and ev methods was only evaluated for fusing esa cci v04 7 and smap over the yrd region using this approach to fuse other ssm products over other regions should be addressed in the future study 5 conclusions in this study we fused the esa cci v04 7 and smap to generate a ssm product using tc ev method its accuracy was evaluated against the other two fused products by the ew and tc in the yrd region firstly the esa cci v04 7 and smap were corrected against cldas by the cdf matching method then for pixels in which significant correlations p 0 05 were observed among cldas and the corrected esa cci v04 7 and smap the two ssm products were fused great improvements were achieved in the three fused ssm products by ew tc and tc ev when compared to their original ssm products and the ssm fused by tc ev was superior to the others three fused ssm products also performed better than the two latest version of esa cci products v05 2 and v06 1 the lst and ndvi were the most important factors in determining the fusing weights in the ev method followed by the pre and wap and gsi the method proposed in the study provided a new insight to fuse multisource satellite based ssm products to generate an improved ssm dataset credit authorship contribution statement liuyang li
