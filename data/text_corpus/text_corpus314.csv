1570,despite the increasing public concern about the frequent occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the water bodies their transport and fate are not yet well known in particular in groundwater in this laboratory study batch experiments were conducted to investigate the sorption behaviour of selected pharmaceuticals the choice of compounds was motivated by their chemical properties as well as by their occurrence at the relevant field sites it included antipyrine atenolol caffeine carbamazepine ciprofloxacin diclofenac ketoprofen ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole sorption behaviour has already been investigated for some of these compounds e g carbamazepine but for the others e g antipyrine ketoprofen extensive studies are missing so far for the experiments artificial and actual aquifer materials from complementary field sites were selected technical coarse quartz sand and sediments from alluvial vistrenque aquifer france sandy loam and fluvio deltaic baix fluvià aquifer spain sandy clay loam clay and medium sand in these field sites occurrence of pharmaceuticals in groundwater was previously stated and the presented laboratory experiments were complementary to the field investigations five concentration steps for determining the sorption isotherms were investigated correlation analysis showed dependencies of k coefficients of individual compounds and sediment properties however no clear universal patterns for all compounds were found batch experiments suggest that sorption behaviour was governed by compound specific properties rather than by sediment properties these results contribute to the understanding sorption behaviour of pharmaceuticals in heterogeneous sediments although some inconsistencies were revealed between laboratory scale results and field scale observations keywords batch experiment sorption isotherm emerging organic contaminants pharmaceuticals 1 introduction the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment and particularly in water resources is presently an issue of public concern d alessio et al 2015 loos et al 2013 their effect in nature as a threat to aquatic ecosystems is highly recognized e g petrovic et al 2016 petrovic et al 2013 as well as their relationship with the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in groundwater berendonk et al 2015 their effects on human health are found rare but statistically meaningful lei et al 2015 saikat et al 2013 despite this lack of certainty the precautionary principle stated in the 1992 rio declaration on environment and development compels a scientific and management effort to unveil the processes by which pharmaceuticals as a contaminant of emerging concern migrates in the subsurface and define their impact to groundwater resources quality the transport and fate of pharmaceuticals in groundwater is still not completely understood due to their complex behaviour which is extremely variable depending on the molecule structure and the local subsurface environmental conditions i e soil sediment rock type ph redox state organic matter content microbiological communities e g lapworth et al 2012 schaffer and licha 2015 in addition to the inherent spatial heterogeneity of the groundwater hydraulic transport components advection and dispersion reactive geochemical processes as sorption and degradation play a relevant influence on the migration of pharmaceutical compounds and therefore on their occurrence in vulnerable areas of the system either ecosystems and abstraction wells for human supply a widely applied approach to determine the magnitude and typology of both reactive processes is the use of laboratory analyses either batch or column experiments that provide the reaction coefficients under determined experimental conditions e g banzhaf and hebig 2016 resulting values can then be applied to model and predict the migration of these reactive pollutants at field scale as a managing tool to prevent or manage groundwater pollution nevertheless the extrapolation of laboratory results to field data modelling is usually challenging as the high variability of actual environmental circumstances and the complicated geochemical behaviour of these pollutants hardly coincides with the experimental conditions boxall et al 2012 moreover literature references for selected compounds offer a wide range of sorption coefficients for a single compound which increases the uncertainty on the application of laboratory results to regional scale pollution cases sorption processes are often represented by a linear isotherm and a distribution coefficient kd between the solute concentration in the aqueous phase and the adsorbed mass in sediment kd finally determines the retardation factor for that specific solute appelo and postma 2005 fetter 1999 furthermore for the sorption of organic contaminants and among them pharmaceutical compounds other types of isotherms must be considered in soils and sediments that take into account a limited adsorption capacity langmuir or a progressive saturation of the solid surface freundlich in addition while kd values for non ionisable compounds can be based on an empirical correlation of the octanol water partition coefficient kow and the soil water coefficient normalized to organic carbon koc those for ionisable compounds as pharmaceuticals are more complex to calculate and partition coefficients must be generated by predictive models bronner and goss 2011 kah and brown 2006 schaffer and licha 2015 propose a systematic framework that allows the assessment of transport properties of organic molecule species by their chemical nature neutral acidic basic ampholytic as a result the inclusion of a ph dependent n octanol water distribution coefficient log d which accounts for the species distribution at a certain ph leads to satisfying results log d is then calculated from log kow and the compound dissociation constant pka for acids and bases beyond this theoretical standpoint that briefly introduces the gaps and challenges in the scientific knowledge of organic contaminant sorption processes batch and column experiments are still the most common and practical approaches to characterize site specific sorption parameters for various hydrological conditions in summary the assessment of pharmaceutical pollution of groundwater resources must rely on appropriate laboratory experiments that provide adequate reactive information based on the most realistic conditions admitting this premise this paper presents the results of laboratory batch experiments using sediments and groundwater samples from two studied aquifers with the aim to provide suitable data for selected pharmaceuticals focusing on sorption processes our goal is characterizing the appropriate sorption reactions and the subsequent coefficients that will control their migration in the subsurface on the one hand we contribute to the overall knowledge of pharmaceutical sorption in sediments on the other hand we look forward providing data to understand their spatial distribution at a regional scale based on these results in particular selected compounds for this study comprise antipyrine atenolol caffeine carbamazepine ciprofloxacin diclofenac ketoprofen ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole table 1 these and other pharmaceuticals have been found in groundwater in two distinct field sites the vistrenque alluvial aquifer sassine et al 2016b sassine et al 2015 sassine et al 2014 and the baix fluvià fluvio deltaic aquifer boy roura et al 2018 these compounds also meet the following criteria 1 they represent different groups in terms of therapeutic use and 2 they lay on a wide range of log kow and pka values among them some are well studied as carbamazepine whereas a thorough understanding about others is missing such as ciprofloxacin although it is on the watch list of the eu carvalho et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals complete list of chemicals used in presented study can be found in the supplementary data sd 1 2 2 sediments different sediment types were selected for the laboratory experiments 1 technical quartz

selected as a reference material it was assumed that its low organic carbon content toc and clay content will result in low sorption the vistrenque aquifer is related to a shallow alluvial aquifer sassine et al 2016b the area is used for agriculture vineyards orchards vegetables and cereals in the vistrenque basin pharmaceuticals in the water bodies are related to the infiltration of stream water receiving wwtp effluents and such recharge is determined by surface water groundwater interactions several compounds antibiotics anticonvulsant beta blockers and analgesics were found in both surface waters and groundwater the baix fluvià unconfined quaternary aquifer is constituted by of the upper layers of fluvio deltaic deposits of fluvià river it consists of gravel and sand and is underlined by an aquitard of silt and loam the study area is dominated by intense agricultural activities corn and orchards as a result the occurrence of antibiotics is mainly attributed to agricultural fertilization inputs of slurry and manure boy roura et al 2018 locations of sediment sampling sites table 2 were selected according to two criteria 1 representativeness for each particular aquifer and 2 no pollution by pharmaceuticals detected in the vicinity of sampling location boy roura et al 2018 sassine et al 2016 the distinct particle size distribution for each sediment is shown in fig 1 sediments particles mainly range from fine sand to coarse sand according to usda soil texture classification yet two of them show a significant percentage of silt e2 and especially

in the experiment two collected from the field sites and one withdrawn for practical reasons from the nearby well located in neuherberg by münchen at the helmholtz zentrum münchen germany groundwater from the respective aquifers was obtained from selected non contaminated wells these waters are characterised by different mineralisation and ionic composition that allows considering the natural local hydrogeochemistry and its actual influence on sorption for instance water from the vistrenque aquifer presents a ca hco3 so4 facies and ph 6 9 and water from the baix fluvià area shows a ca so4

experiments are listed in the supplementary data sd 2 2 4 experimental setup experimental setup was planned according to oecd test guideline 106 oecd 2000 and to the guideline of epa 2008 with some modifications as described below air dried sediment aliquots were placed in 120 ml glass bottles a volume of 45 ml of water was added and left overnight for equilibration by shaking afterwards 5 ml of stock solution were added in order to achieve the final liquid volume of 50 ml the experiments were conducted in constant ph of ca 7 0 7 5 resulting in following ionic form of the selected compounds 1 neutral antipyrine carbamazepine caffeine 2 anionic diclofenac ketoprofen sulfamethoxazole 3 cationic atenolol and 4 zwitterion ciprofloxacin ofloxacin the bottles were closed with buthyl septum crimped and stored in the dark wrapped in aluminium foil to avoid photodegradation at room temperature 20 c 1 c in order to focus on sorption only and avoid biodegradation abiotic conditions were achieved by adding sodium azide nan3 with final concentration 50 mg l 1 ml of stock solution of 5 g l for each 100 ml hillebrand et al 2013 an aliquot of liquid was taken by syringe filtrated on a 0 22 μm syringe filter and transferred to vials batch blanks were prepared the same way but without sediment and the concentration measured in these samples were taken as the initial ones batch experiments were conducted in two steps 1 first sediment solution ratio and time of exposition was tested data not shown and then 2 the main batch test was performed of which results are presented preliminary study was performed in the course of this study in order to select the optimum experiment conditions using sediments g v and e1 and initial solute concentrations of about 400 μg l selected liquid to solid ratios of 1 1 2 1 and 5 1 were tested parallel method was used in the experiment i e triplicate samples with the same sediment water ratio were prepared as many as the time intervals at which it was desired to study the sorption kinetics to determine the equilibrium time samples were collected sequentially over few days after 4 8 h 1 2 3 4 d the equilibration time was determined by aqueous concentration versus time plot estimation liquid to solid ratio was set on 5 1 for practical reasons i e easier sampling of water phase 50 ml of liquid and 10 g of sediment equilibrium time was achieved after 4 days in the main batch experiment five concentrations steps for determining the sorption isotherms were investigated as advised by u s epa 2008 for each concentration step a separate stock solution was prepared with concentrations ranging from ca 500 up to ca 7500 μg l initial concentrations in respective bottles were than diluted and the final concentrations were about 10 times lower table 3 for double checking the final initial concentration in the respective concentration step and sediment type we prepared batch blanks without sediment and the concentrations in these samples were assumed as initial values therefore any analytical uncertainty can be indirectly accounted for and the actual used concentration was determined 2 5 quantification with lc ms ms concentrations of pharmaceuticals were measured with a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms system which consisted of agilent 1200 binary pump agilent technologies böblingen germany and ab sciex api 2000 q trap mass spectrometer applied biosystems framingham usa kinetex c18 column 2 6 μm 150 3 mm purchased from phenomenex aschaffenburg germany was used the method used was based

regression correlation tests were performed using sigma plot 12 0 to evaluate the influence of sediment properties on sorption behaviour of individual pharmaceuticals fitting was conducted by the least square method and the pearson product moment correlation was considered as a measure of the linear correlation plots were prepared in sigma plot 12 0 and in r r core team vienna austria errors were indicated in the graphs presenting data and isotherms horizontal error bars point out the standard deviation of the batch triplicates vertical error bars represent errors calculated basing on the error propagation methodology as s is a quantity calculated not measured directly from several input quantities therefore the uncertainty components from all components were taken into account resulting in combined standard uncertainty jcgm 100 2008 when error bars are not visible they are smaller than the symbol size to judge about the fitting goodness of sorption isotherm to data it was assumed either very good r2 0 9 satisfactory 0 9 r2 0 8 or acceptable 0 8 r2 0 6 in some cases it was not possible to fit any particular isotherm to the observed values meaning that calculations of parameters were mathematically possible but did not fulfil logical conditions all numbers positive r2 0 6 3 results 3 1 isotherm fitting sorption coefficients were obtained from the batch experiments by fitting of theoretical sorption isotherms to experimental data table 4 an illustrative example of isotherms obtained in sediment e3 which are graphical presentations of the outcomes is shown in fig 2 the entire set of all calculated isotherms is presented as supplementary data sd 6 comparison of sorption isotherm of atenolol caffeine and carbamazepine obtained for different sediments is presented in fig 3 sorption distribution coefficients of studied compounds are represented by different sorption isotherms the selection was done by comparing the r2 values in case of similar fitting goodness a simpler model was chosen freundlich or linear isotherms offered the best fit for most of the cases independently of compound or sediment type the highest sorption coefficients were normally observed for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin regardless of the sediment type however some results did not allow quantifying sorption parameters for these compounds as the goodness of fit was not sufficient so it may be qualitatively stated that kd is high 100 l kg for antipyrine in particular any fitting for the sediments from the field sites provided an acceptable isotherm table 4 due to little sorption which means that kd is very low or close to zero in general compound specific sorption was found the smallest for antipyrine and the largest for ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in table 4 the most fitting isotherm is highlighted in bold some isotherms were discarded either due to low r2 η 1 cell highlighted in light grey or due to non realistic values 0 highlighted in dark grey 3 2 sorption for the g sediment sorption of all compounds could be adequately fitted by a linear isotherm the kd values were as follows antipyrine 7 00 l kg atenolol 4 51 l kg caffeine 3 55 l kg carbamazepine 4 73 l kg ciprofloxacin 1 25 l kg diclofenac 0 31 l kg ketoprofen 0 66 l kg ofloxacin 3 30 l kg sulfamehoxazole 1 10 l kg for the sediment v a linear sorption offered the best fit for atenolol carbamazepine diclofenac and ketoprofen with kd of 2 15 l kg 0 48 l kg 2 39 l kg 0 07 l kg respectively whereas langmuir isotherm represented caffeine kl 0 01 l kg smax 444 μg kg and ciprofloxacin kl 0 06 l kg smax 5197 μg kg in the case of antipyrine ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole no isotherm could be fitted for the sediment e1 the best fit by linear sorption was obtained for caffeine kd 6 81 l kg freundlich isotherm represented the sorption behaviour of carbamazepine kf 6 80 l kg η η 0 68 langmuir isotherm represented atenolol kl 0 01 l kg smax 2000 μg kg dicofenac kl 3 7e 3 l kg smax 286 μg kg and sulfamethoxazole kl 0 01 l kg smax 2225 μg kg for antipyrine ciprofloxacin ketoprofen and ofloxacin no isotherm was fitted for sediment e2 linear sorption was found to be the best fit for antipyrine kd 0 43 l kg carbamazepine kd 2 30 l kg and sulfamethoxazole kd 0 30 l kg whereas a freundlich isotherm was better fitted to atenolol kf 32 35 l kg η η 0 59 caffeine kf 14 44 l kg η η 0 81 and ciprofloxacin kf 820 l kg η η 0 40 ciprofloxacin was fitted by langmuir isotherm kl 0 01 l kg smax 2225 μg kg for diclofenac ketoprofen and ofloxacin no isotherm was fitted for the sediment e3 linear sorption isotherm corresponds to caffeine kd 2 05 l kg carbamazepine kd 1 14 l kg and ofloxacine kd 87 55 l kg for atenolol a langmuir isotherm was an acceptable fit kl 0 02 l kg smax 573 μg kg satisfactory for sulfamethoxazole kl 1 3e 3 l kg smax 1967 2 μg kg and very good for ciprofloxacin kl 0 04 l kg smax 4114 μg kg diclofenac kl 0 01 l kg smax 7335 μg kg ketoprofen kl 0 01 l kg smax 2234 μg kg for antipyrine no isotherm was fitted 3 3 influential factors the sorption coefficients corresponding to the linear model were further used for statistical data evaluation even when linear model was not chosen as the best fit the correlations between sediment properties and sorption parameters are presented in table 5 whereas all correlation plots are presented in the supplementary data sd 7 sd 8 correlation plots between sorption coefficient kd and selected sediment properties identify the interactions that govern sorption of the respective different compounds fig 4 the sediment properties used in correlation included cation exchange capacity cec clay and silt content clay sediment ph ph specific surface area ssa total carbon tc and total organic carbon toc in particular antipyrine showed high correlation of k coefficient with sediment ph for caffeine sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin cec and ssa were the most crucial factors ciprofloxacin also showed correlation of sorption to the presence of clay minerals sorption of carbamazepine presented moderate correlation to sediment ph and atenolol to cec and ssa for diclofenac and ketoprofen no correlations were found sorption behaviour cannot be explained by the octanol water partitioning coefficient kow for any sediment table 6 for all sediments any prove of correlation was found between these two coefficients as the correlation coefficients r2 describing relationship between kow and kd were low 4 discussion a distinct range of sorption parameters have been obtained from batch experiments for the tested compounds in different sediment types from low values kd 0 l kg for antipyrine up to the high values for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin kd 100 l kg observed values were generally within the range reported in literature fig 5 yet this figure illustrates the wide range of partition coefficient values for a single compound under distinct experimental setups kd and kf values presented on the fig 5 as well as details to the experiments and reference list is given in the suplementary data sd 9 in this work determination of isotherm could not be determined in some cases due to too low initial concentrations and complete sorption of all compound suggesting high k coefficients ciprofloxacin ofloxacin the problem in finding an appropriate isotherm appeared also for antipyrine or ketoprofen where k coefficients oscillated around 0 making it difficult to find more precise values from this result we anticipate that increasing the concentration range would improve the experimental determination of the isotherm admittedly isotherms for sediment g could be attributed to the s class with much lower k values however this type of isotherm is rather rare hinz 2001 and therefore was excluded from further analysis as stated in the introduction literature review indicates that sorption of ionic compounds strongly depends on ph in these experiments the ionic form of the compounds had stronger influence on sorption behaviour than sediment type the experiments were conducted at constant ph of ca 7 0 up to 7 5 and the selected compounds were in different ionic forms 1 neutral antipyrine carbamazepine caffeine 2 anionic diclofenac ketoprofen sulfamethoxazole 3 cationic atenolol and 4 zwitterion ciprofloxacin ofloxacin these differences were reflected in their sorption behaviour in the batch experiments and are hereafter discussed 4 1 sorption of neutral compounds in this study sorption of neutral compounds was negligible similar observations are present in the literature for example greenhagen et al 2014 stated no retardation due to sorption in their column experiments carbamazepine is the most documented compound among the pharmaceuticals included in this study and it is known to be persistent in the environment with negligible or low retardation due to sorption scheytt et al 2005a however banzhaf et al 2012 observed apparent retardation of carbamazepine in a column experiment that was explained by sorption as the dominating transport process chefetz et al 2008 reported nonlinear sorption isotherms with kf values of 0 9 and 12 7 for sediment samples of respectively low 0 94 and high 8 13 organic carbon similar observations were described by drillia et al 2005 where the lowest values of kf 0 5 l kg η were obtained for sediment with low organic content otherwise higher sorption was linked to sediments with high organic content being the highest in sludge kf 49 l kg η in the presented study however no correlation between toc and sorption coefficient was found indeed the observed kd was between 0 5 l kg and 4 7 l kg antipyrine is reported by burke et al 2013 to show conservative transport behaviour kd 0 l kg similar results were corroborated by d alessio et al 2015 and henzler et al 2014 4 2 sorption of anionic compounds negatively charged compounds diclofenac ketoprofen and sulfamethoxazole generally showed small sorption since most sediments lack strong anion exchange sites manahan 2017 however anionic compounds diclofenac and ketoprofen were largely sorbed than neutral molecules in sediment e3 4 3 sorption of cationic compounds sorption of atenolol present in cationic form is relatively high for example schaffer et al 2012b and yamamoto et al 2009 reported the strongest retardation due to sorption for protonated molecules in their column experiments atenolol among the others 4 4 sorption of zwitterions sorption of ciprofloxacin is strongly ph dependant and the most effective at lower ph when the compound appears in cationic form vasudevan et al 2009 in this study even in a less sorbing zwitterion form ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most sorbed among the tested compounds high sorption k coefficients even 1000 l kg of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin has been reported in the literature and their dependency on ph was also emphasized drillia et al 2005 vasudevan et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 similar observations were obtained in this study with k coefficients ranging from 4 up to 100 for both antibiotics in general high k values should be treated with caution as it may be concluded that high loads of these compounds can be entirely sorbed suggesting little threat for water quality deterioration it is therefore puzzling that ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are present in the aquatic environments and have been reported in several field sites also of the tested sediments e g boy roura et al 2018 lópez serna et al 2013 santos et al 2013 reporting the paradox of why highly sorbing compounds in lab experiments occurring at considerable concentrations in groundwater discrepancies between lab data and field observations at a regional scale reflect the difficulty on tracing the fate of these pollutants in the subsurface and assessing their impact in groundwater quality 4 5 choice of isotherm and reactions involved it is known that the isotherm itself does not automatically provide information about the type of reaction involved limousin et al 2007 for instance it is known that linear sorption that showed a good fit for most of the compounds and sediments used in the experiment satisfactorily describes the sorption behaviour for low solute concentrations delle site 2001 this case actually corresponds well to the pharmaceuticals in groundwater as these compounds are generally found at low concentrations at ng l level boy roura et al 2018 nevertheless linear isotherm is considered as an easy to use approximation rather than an precise description of sorption mechanism limousin et al 2007 other sorption models used in this study take into account that sorption is not infinitely linear the freundlich isotherm is an empirical model that assumes a progressive saturation of the sorption sites whereas the langmuir model assumes to have a limited sorption capacity usually the choice of isotherm has to be found experimentally because it strongly depends on several site specific factors as presented e g by al khazrajy and boxall 2016 paul et al 2014 for example chefetz et al 2008 observed that carbamazepine sorption was less linear in sample with high organic carbon content whereas with low organic carbon content isotherm became more linear conversely the linear model accurately represented sorption of carbamazepine in the present study indeed the simplest model is usually selected rather than the more complex ones limousin et al 2007 therefore a careful selection of sorption model is critical for its further use in modelling approaches that predict solute mobility in groundwater hinz et al 1994 in our experiments we have opted for selecting the isotherm with a best regression coefficient in the fitting process table 5 yet we are aware of the conceptual assumptions involved in this decision this is the reason why all potential isotherms are also included as supplementary data sd6 4 6 other factors controlling sorption the impact of compound properties and sediment characteristics on sorption parameters has also been addressed by different authors e g al khazrajy and boxall 2016 kodešová et al 2015 however any attempt to find a general relationship enabling calculating kd based on other parameters has only been possible for specific for the particular experiment conditions and it was therefore biased although this work points out some dependencies of the k coefficients of individual compounds and the sediment properties fig 5 a clear universal pattern for all compounds is missing for example for the tested compounds sorption behaviour cannot be explained by kow of the respective compounds or organic carbon content as previously proposed scheytt et al 2005b this standard concept to predict retardation by means of kow could be improved by considering the charge of the species in dependence on ph value the mechanistic understanding of the sorption behaviour of charged compounds has been recently highlighted because in particular electrostatic interactions are not yet quantitatively predictable schaffer et al 2012 schaffer and licha 2015 4 7 concentration range used in the experiment used concentrations of all compounds ca 35 750 μg l are still higher comparing to the concentrations observed in the environment range of ng l but lower compared to other laboratory studies which generally used high initial concentrations in batch studies fenet et al 2012 used carbamazepine in concentrations of 250 3000 μg l and calisto and esteves 2012 performed their experiment at even higher input concentrations 2 10 mg l kodešová et al 2015 and yamamoto et al 2009 performed batch tests using different compounds in concentrations of 0 5 10 mg l and 20 100 μg l respectively we highlight the scale range of our experiments as well as those referenced in literature as an issue of concern when isotherms are applied to model field data 5 conclusion batch experiments sorption parameters of selected pharmaceuticals for distinct scenarios based on actual sediments and groundwater from previously studied field sites even though the underlying processes of the different sorption behaviour are difficult to assess due to several factors influencing sorption we found that pharmaceuticals on selected sediments did not depend solely on kow organic carbon content or any other parameter as proposed in the literature more important was the ionic form of the compounds therefore it is crucial to control ph during experiments in order to be able to predict the behavior of examined chemicals further studies are also needed to advance our understanding about specific sorption processes adsorption vs absorption in particular the role of organic matter and clay minerals batch experiments are and remain a reliable method to investigate sorption behaviour of contaminants in groundwater systems they are easy to apply relatively fast enable to study site specific sorption and give quantitative results which may be further utilized e g in vulnerability analysis and modelling still it needs to be kept in mind that laboratory batch experiments give information on sorption behaviour for equilibrium conditions and for initial concentrations of compounds exceeding concentration ranges μg l typically found in aquifers ng l further we showed that it is important to consider different isotherm types because different compounds undergo different sorption mechanisms not necessarily described best by linear approximations even for pharmaceutical compounds with low

1570,despite the increasing public concern about the frequent occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the water bodies their transport and fate are not yet well known in particular in groundwater in this laboratory study batch experiments were conducted to investigate the sorption behaviour of selected pharmaceuticals the choice of compounds was motivated by their chemical properties as well as by their occurrence at the relevant field sites it included antipyrine atenolol caffeine carbamazepine ciprofloxacin diclofenac ketoprofen ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole sorption behaviour has already been investigated for some of these compounds e g carbamazepine but for the others e g antipyrine ketoprofen extensive studies are missing so far for the experiments artificial and actual aquifer materials from complementary field sites were selected technical coarse quartz sand and sediments from alluvial vistrenque aquifer france sandy loam and fluvio deltaic baix fluvià aquifer spain sandy clay loam clay and medium sand in these field sites occurrence of pharmaceuticals in groundwater was previously stated and the presented laboratory experiments were complementary to the field investigations five concentration steps for determining the sorption isotherms were investigated correlation analysis showed dependencies of k coefficients of individual compounds and sediment properties however no clear universal patterns for all compounds were found batch experiments suggest that sorption behaviour was governed by compound specific properties rather than by sediment properties these results contribute to the understanding sorption behaviour of pharmaceuticals in heterogeneous sediments although some inconsistencies were revealed between laboratory scale results and field scale observations keywords batch experiment sorption isotherm emerging organic contaminants pharmaceuticals 1 introduction the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment and particularly in water resources is presently an issue of public concern d alessio et al 2015 loos et al 2013 their effect in nature as a threat to aquatic ecosystems is highly recognized e g petrovic et al 2016 petrovic et al 2013 as well as their relationship with the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in groundwater berendonk et al 2015 their effects on human health are found rare but statistically meaningful lei et al 2015 saikat et al 2013 despite this lack of certainty the precautionary principle stated in the 1992 rio declaration on environment and development compels a scientific and management effort to unveil the processes by which pharmaceuticals as a contaminant of emerging concern migrates in the subsurface and define their impact to groundwater resources quality the transport and fate of pharmaceuticals in groundwater is still not completely understood due to their complex behaviour which is extremely variable depending on the molecule structure and the local subsurface environmental conditions i e soil sediment rock type ph redox state organic matter content microbiological communities e g lapworth et al 2012 schaffer and licha 2015 in addition to the inherent spatial heterogeneity of the groundwater hydraulic transport components advection and dispersion reactive geochemical processes as sorption and degradation play a relevant influence on the migration of pharmaceutical compounds and therefore on their occurrence in vulnerable areas of the system either ecosystems and abstraction wells for human supply a widely applied approach to determine the magnitude and typology of both reactive processes is the use of laboratory analyses either batch or column experiments that provide the reaction coefficients under determined experimental conditions e g banzhaf and hebig 2016 resulting values can then be applied to model and predict the migration of these reactive pollutants at field scale as a managing tool to prevent or manage groundwater pollution nevertheless the extrapolation of laboratory results to field data modelling is usually challenging as the high variability of actual environmental circumstances and the complicated geochemical behaviour of these pollutants hardly coincides with the experimental conditions boxall et al 2012 moreover literature references for selected compounds offer a wide range of sorption coefficients for a single compound which increases the uncertainty on the application of laboratory results to regional scale pollution cases sorption processes are often represented by a linear isotherm and a distribution coefficient kd between the solute concentration in the aqueous phase and the adsorbed mass in sediment kd finally determines the retardation factor for that specific solute appelo and postma 2005 fetter 1999 furthermore for the sorption of organic contaminants and among them pharmaceutical compounds other types of isotherms must be considered in soils and sediments that take into account a limited adsorption capacity langmuir or a progressive saturation of the solid surface freundlich in addition while kd values for non ionisable compounds can be based on an empirical correlation of the octanol water partition coefficient kow and the soil water coefficient normalized to organic carbon koc those for ionisable compounds as pharmaceuticals are more complex to calculate and partition coefficients must be generated by predictive models bronner and goss 2011 kah and brown 2006 schaffer and licha 2015 propose a systematic framework that allows the assessment of transport properties of organic molecule species by their chemical nature neutral acidic basic ampholytic as a result the inclusion of a ph dependent n octanol water distribution coefficient log d which accounts for the species distribution at a certain ph leads to satisfying results log d is then calculated from log kow and the compound dissociation constant pka for acids and bases beyond this theoretical standpoint that briefly introduces the gaps and challenges in the scientific knowledge of organic contaminant sorption processes batch and column experiments are still the most common and practical approaches to characterize site specific sorption parameters for various hydrological conditions in summary the assessment of pharmaceutical pollution of groundwater resources must rely on appropriate laboratory experiments that provide adequate reactive information based on the most realistic conditions admitting this premise this paper presents the results of laboratory batch experiments using sediments and groundwater samples from two studied aquifers with the aim to provide suitable data for selected pharmaceuticals focusing on sorption processes our goal is characterizing the appropriate sorption reactions and the subsequent coefficients that will control their migration in the subsurface on the one hand we contribute to the overall knowledge of pharmaceutical sorption in sediments on the other hand we look forward providing data to understand their spatial distribution at a regional scale based on these results in particular selected compounds for this study comprise antipyrine atenolol caffeine carbamazepine ciprofloxacin diclofenac ketoprofen ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole table 1 these and other pharmaceuticals have been found in groundwater in two distinct field sites the vistrenque alluvial aquifer sassine et al 2016b sassine et al 2015 sassine et al 2014 and the baix fluvià fluvio deltaic aquifer boy roura et al 2018 these compounds also meet the following criteria 1 they represent different groups in terms of therapeutic use and 2 they lay on a wide range of log kow and pka values among them some are well studied as carbamazepine whereas a thorough understanding about others is missing such as ciprofloxacin although it is on the watch list of the eu carvalho et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

selected as a reference material it was assumed that its low organic carbon content toc and clay content will result in low sorption the vistrenque aquifer is related to a shallow alluvial aquifer sassine et al 2016b the area is used for agriculture vineyards orchards vegetables and cereals in the vistrenque basin pharmaceuticals in the water bodies are related to the infiltration of stream

underlined by an aquitard of silt and loam the study area is dominated by intense agricultural activities corn and orchards as a result the occurrence of antibiotics is mainly attributed to agricultural fertilization inputs of slurry and manure boy roura et al 2018 locations of sediment sampling sites table 2 were selected according to two criteria 1 representativeness for each particular aquifer and 2 no pollution by pharmaceuticals detected in the vicinity of sampling location boy roura et al 2018 sassine et al 2016 the distinct particle size distribution for each sediment

modifications as described below air dried sediment aliquots were placed in 120 ml glass bottles a volume of 45 ml of water was added and left overnight for equilibration by shaking afterwards 5 ml of stock solution were added in order to achieve the final liquid volume of 50 ml the experiments were conducted in constant ph of ca 7 0 7 5 resulting in following ionic form of the selected compounds 1 neutral antipyrine carbamazepine caffeine 2 anionic diclofenac ketoprofen sulfamethoxazole 3 cationic atenolol and 4 zwitterion ciprofloxacin ofloxacin the bottles were closed with buthyl septum crimped and stored in the dark wrapped in aluminium foil to avoid photodegradation at room temperature 20 c 1 c in order to focus on sorption only and avoid biodegradation abiotic conditions were achieved by adding sodium azide nan3 with final concentration 50 mg l 1 ml of stock solution of 5 g l for each 100 ml hillebrand et al 2013 an aliquot of liquid was taken by syringe filtrated on a 0 22 μm syringe filter and transferred to vials batch blanks were prepared the same way but without sediment and the concentration measured in these samples were taken as the initial ones batch experiments were conducted in two steps 1 first sediment solution ratio and time of exposition was tested data not shown and then 2 the main batch test was performed of which results are presented preliminary study was performed in the course of this study in order to select the optimum experiment conditions using sediments g v and e1 and initial solute concentrations of about 400 μg l selected liquid to solid ratios of 1 1 2 1 and 5 1 were tested parallel method was used in the experiment i e triplicate samples with the same sediment water ratio were prepared as many as the time intervals at which it was desired to study the sorption kinetics to determine the equilibrium time samples were collected sequentially over few days after 4 8 h 1 2 3 4 d the equilibration time was determined by aqueous concentration versus time plot estimation liquid to solid ratio was set on 5 1 for practical reasons i e easier sampling of water phase 50 ml of liquid and 10 g of sediment equilibrium time was achieved after 4 days in the main batch experiment five concentrations steps for determining the sorption isotherms were investigated as advised by u s epa 2008 for each concentration step a separate stock solution was prepared with concentrations ranging from ca 500 up to ca 7500 μg l initial concentrations in respective bottles were than diluted and the final concentrations were about 10 times lower table 3 for double checking the final initial concentration in the respective concentration step and sediment type we prepared batch blanks without sediment and the concentrations in these samples were assumed as initial values therefore any analytical uncertainty can be indirectly accounted for and the actual used concentration was determined 2 5 quantification with lc ms ms

least square method and the pearson product moment correlation was considered as a measure of the linear correlation plots were prepared in sigma plot 12 0 and in r r core team vienna austria errors were indicated in the graphs presenting data and isotherms horizontal error bars point out the standard deviation of the batch triplicates vertical error bars represent errors calculated basing on the error propagation methodology as s is a quantity calculated not measured directly from several input quantities therefore the uncertainty components from all components were taken into account resulting in combined standard uncertainty jcgm 100 2008 when error bars are not visible they are smaller than the symbol size to judge about the fitting goodness of sorption isotherm to data it was assumed either very good r2 0 9 satisfactory 0 9 r2 0 8 or acceptable 0 8 r2 0 6 in some cases it was not possible to fit any particular isotherm to the observed values meaning that calculations of parameters were mathematically possible but did not fulfil logical conditions all numbers positive r2 0 6 3 results 3 1 isotherm fitting sorption coefficients were obtained from the batch experiments by fitting of theoretical sorption isotherms to experimental data table 4 an illustrative example of isotherms obtained in sediment e3 which are graphical presentations of the outcomes is shown in fig 2 the entire set of all calculated isotherms is presented as supplementary data sd 6 comparison of sorption isotherm of atenolol caffeine and carbamazepine obtained for different sediments is presented in fig 3 sorption distribution coefficients of studied compounds are represented by different sorption isotherms the selection was done by comparing the r2 values in case of similar fitting goodness a simpler model was chosen freundlich or linear isotherms offered the best fit for most of the cases independently of compound or sediment type the highest sorption coefficients were normally observed for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin regardless of the sediment type however some results did not allow quantifying sorption parameters for these compounds as the goodness of fit was not sufficient so it may be qualitatively stated that kd is high 100 l kg for antipyrine in particular any fitting for the sediments from the field sites provided an acceptable isotherm table 4 due to little sorption which means that kd is very low or close to zero in general compound specific sorption was found the smallest for antipyrine and the largest for ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in table 4 the most fitting isotherm is highlighted in bold some isotherms were discarded either due to low r2 η 1 cell highlighted in light grey or due to non realistic values 0 highlighted in dark grey 3 2 sorption for the g sediment sorption of all compounds could be adequately fitted by a linear isotherm the kd values were as follows antipyrine 7 00 l kg atenolol 4 51 l kg caffeine 3 55 l kg carbamazepine 4 73 l kg ciprofloxacin 1 25 l kg diclofenac 0 31 l kg ketoprofen 0 66 l kg ofloxacin 3 30 l kg sulfamehoxazole 1 10 l kg for the sediment v a linear sorption offered the best fit for atenolol carbamazepine diclofenac and ketoprofen with kd of 2 15 l kg 0 48 l kg 2 39 l kg 0 07 l kg respectively whereas langmuir isotherm represented caffeine kl 0 01 l kg smax 444 μg kg and ciprofloxacin kl 0 06 l kg smax 5197 μg kg in the case of antipyrine ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole no isotherm could be fitted for the sediment e1 the best fit by linear sorption was obtained for caffeine kd 6 81 l kg freundlich isotherm represented the sorption behaviour of carbamazepine kf 6 80 l kg η η 0 68 langmuir isotherm represented atenolol kl 0 01 l kg smax 2000 μg kg dicofenac kl 3

the best fit for antipyrine kd 0 43 l kg carbamazepine kd 2 30 l kg and sulfamethoxazole kd 0 30 l kg whereas a freundlich isotherm was better fitted to atenolol kf 32 35 l kg η η 0 59 caffeine kf 14 44 l kg η η 0 81 and ciprofloxacin kf 820 l kg η η 0 40 ciprofloxacin was fitted by langmuir isotherm kl 0 01 l kg smax 2225 μg kg for diclofenac ketoprofen and ofloxacin no isotherm was fitted for the sediment e3 linear sorption isotherm corresponds to caffeine kd 2 05 l kg carbamazepine kd 1 14 l kg and ofloxacine kd 87 55 l kg for atenolol a langmuir isotherm was an acceptable fit kl 0 02 l

0 01 l kg smax 2234 μg kg for antipyrine no isotherm was fitted 3 3 influential factors the sorption coefficients corresponding to the linear model were further used for statistical data evaluation even when linear model was not chosen as the best fit the correlations between sediment properties and sorption parameters are presented in table 5 whereas all correlation plots are presented in the supplementary data sd 7 sd 8 correlation plots between sorption coefficient kd and selected sediment properties identify the interactions that govern sorption of the respective different compounds fig 4 the sediment properties used in correlation included cation exchange capacity cec clay and silt content clay sediment ph ph specific surface area ssa total carbon tc and total organic carbon toc in particular antipyrine showed high correlation of k coefficient with sediment ph for caffeine sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin cec and ssa were the most crucial factors ciprofloxacin also showed correlation of sorption to the presence of clay minerals sorption of carbamazepine presented moderate correlation to sediment ph and atenolol to cec and ssa for diclofenac and ketoprofen no correlations were found sorption behaviour cannot be explained by the octanol water partitioning coefficient kow for any sediment table 6 for all sediments any prove of correlation was found between these two coefficients as the correlation coefficients r2 describing relationship between kow and kd were low 4 discussion a distinct range of sorption parameters have been obtained from batch experiments for the tested compounds in different sediment types from low values kd 0 l kg for antipyrine up to the high values for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin kd 100 l kg observed values were generally within the range reported in literature fig 5 yet this figure illustrates the wide range of partition coefficient values for a single compound under distinct experimental setups kd and kf values presented on the fig 5 as well as details to the experiments and reference list is given in the suplementary data sd 9 in this work determination of isotherm could not be determined in some cases due to too low initial concentrations and complete sorption of all compound suggesting high k coefficients ciprofloxacin ofloxacin the problem in finding an appropriate isotherm appeared also for antipyrine or ketoprofen where k coefficients oscillated around 0 making it difficult to find more precise values from this result we anticipate that increasing the concentration range would improve the experimental determination of the isotherm admittedly isotherms for sediment g could be attributed to the s class with much lower k values however this type of isotherm is rather rare hinz 2001 and therefore was excluded from further analysis as stated in the introduction literature review indicates that sorption of ionic compounds strongly depends on ph in these experiments the ionic form of the compounds had stronger influence on sorption behaviour than sediment type the experiments were conducted at constant ph of ca 7 0 up to 7 5 and the selected compounds were in different ionic forms 1 neutral antipyrine carbamazepine caffeine 2 anionic diclofenac ketoprofen sulfamethoxazole 3 cationic atenolol and 4 zwitterion ciprofloxacin ofloxacin these differences were reflected in their sorption behaviour in the batch experiments and are hereafter discussed 4 1 sorption of neutral compounds in this study sorption of neutral compounds was negligible similar observations are present in the literature for example greenhagen et al 2014 stated no retardation due to sorption in their column experiments carbamazepine is the most documented compound among the pharmaceuticals included in this study and it is known to be persistent in the environment with negligible or low retardation due to sorption scheytt et al 2005a however banzhaf et al 2012 observed apparent retardation of carbamazepine in a column experiment that was explained by sorption as the dominating transport process chefetz et al 2008 reported nonlinear sorption isotherms with kf values of 0 9 and 12 7 for sediment samples of respectively low 0 94 and high 8 13 organic carbon similar observations were described by drillia et al 2005 where the lowest values of kf 0 5 l kg η were obtained for sediment with low organic content otherwise higher sorption was linked to sediments with high organic content being the highest in sludge kf 49 l kg η in the presented study however no correlation between toc and sorption coefficient was found indeed the observed kd was between 0 5 l kg and 4 7 l kg antipyrine is reported by burke et al 2013 to show conservative transport behaviour kd 0 l kg similar results were corroborated by d alessio et al 2015 and henzler et al 2014 4 2 sorption of anionic compounds negatively charged compounds diclofenac ketoprofen and sulfamethoxazole generally showed small sorption since most sediments lack strong anion exchange sites manahan 2017 however anionic compounds diclofenac and ketoprofen were largely sorbed than neutral molecules in sediment e3 4 3 sorption of cationic compounds sorption of atenolol present in cationic form is relatively high for example schaffer et al 2012b and yamamoto et al 2009 reported the strongest retardation due to sorption for protonated molecules in their column experiments atenolol among the others 4 4 sorption of zwitterions sorption of ciprofloxacin is strongly ph dependant and the most effective at lower ph when the compound appears in cationic form vasudevan et al 2009 in this study even in a less sorbing zwitterion form ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most sorbed among the tested compounds high sorption k coefficients even 1000 l kg of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin has been reported in the literature and their dependency on ph was also emphasized drillia et al 2005 vasudevan et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 similar observations were obtained in this study with k coefficients ranging from 4 up to 100 for both antibiotics in general high k values should be treated with caution as it may be concluded that high loads of these compounds can be entirely sorbed suggesting little threat for water quality deterioration it is therefore puzzling that ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are present in the aquatic environments and have been reported in several field sites also of the tested sediments e g boy roura et al 2018 lópez serna et al 2013 santos et al 2013 reporting the paradox of why highly sorbing compounds in lab experiments occurring at considerable concentrations in groundwater discrepancies between lab data and field observations at a regional scale reflect the difficulty on tracing the fate of these pollutants in the subsurface and assessing their impact in groundwater quality 4 5 choice of isotherm and reactions involved it is known that the isotherm itself does not automatically provide information about the type of reaction involved limousin et al 2007 for instance it is known that linear sorption that showed a good fit for most of the compounds and sediments used in the experiment satisfactorily describes the sorption behaviour for low solute concentrations delle site 2001 this case actually corresponds well to the pharmaceuticals in groundwater as these compounds are generally found at low concentrations at ng l level boy roura et al 2018 nevertheless linear isotherm is considered as an easy to use approximation rather than an precise description of sorption mechanism limousin et al 2007 other sorption models used in this study take into account that sorption is not infinitely linear the freundlich isotherm is an empirical model that assumes a progressive saturation of the sorption sites whereas the langmuir model assumes to have a limited sorption capacity usually the choice of isotherm has to be found experimentally because it strongly depends on several site specific factors as presented e g by al khazrajy and boxall 2016 paul et al 2014 for example chefetz et al 2008 observed that carbamazepine sorption was less linear in sample with high organic carbon content whereas with low organic carbon content isotherm became more linear conversely the linear model accurately represented sorption of carbamazepine in the present study indeed the simplest model is usually selected rather than the more complex ones limousin et al 2007 therefore a careful selection of sorption model is critical for its further use in modelling approaches that predict solute mobility in groundwater hinz et al 1994 in our experiments we have opted for selecting the isotherm with a best regression coefficient in the fitting process table 5 yet we are aware of the conceptual assumptions involved in this decision this is the reason why all potential isotherms are also included as supplementary data sd6 4 6 other factors controlling sorption the impact of compound properties and sediment characteristics on sorption parameters has also been addressed by different authors e g al khazrajy and boxall 2016 kodešová et al 2015 however any attempt to find a general relationship enabling calculating kd based on other parameters has only been possible for specific for the particular experiment conditions and it was therefore biased although this work points out some dependencies of the k coefficients of individual compounds and the sediment properties fig 5 a clear universal pattern for all compounds is missing for example for the tested compounds sorption behaviour cannot be explained by kow of the respective compounds or organic carbon content as previously proposed scheytt et al 2005b this standard concept to predict retardation by means of kow could be improved by considering the charge of the species in dependence on ph value the mechanistic understanding of the sorption behaviour of charged compounds has been recently highlighted because in particular electrostatic interactions are not yet quantitatively predictable schaffer et al 2012 schaffer and licha 2015 4 7 concentration range used in the experiment used concentrations of all compounds ca 35 750 μg l are still higher comparing to the concentrations observed in the environment range of ng l but lower compared to other laboratory studies which generally used high initial concentrations in batch studies fenet et al 2012 used carbamazepine in concentrations of 250 3000 μg l and calisto and esteves 2012 performed their experiment at even higher input concentrations 2 10 mg l kodešová et al 2015 and yamamoto et al 2009 performed batch tests using different compounds in concentrations of 0 5 10 mg l and 20 100 μg l respectively we highlight the scale range of our experiments as well as those referenced in literature as an issue of concern when isotherms are applied to model field data 5 conclusion batch experiments sorption parameters of selected pharmaceuticals for distinct scenarios based on actual sediments and groundwater from previously studied field sites even though the underlying processes of the different sorption behaviour are difficult to assess due to several factors influencing sorption we found that pharmaceuticals on selected sediments did not depend solely on kow organic carbon content or any other parameter as proposed in the literature more important was the ionic form of the compounds therefore it is crucial to control ph during experiments in order to be able to predict the behavior of examined chemicals further studies are also needed to advance our understanding about specific sorption processes adsorption vs absorption in particular the role of organic matter and clay minerals batch experiments are and remain a reliable method to investigate sorption behaviour of contaminants in groundwater systems they are easy to apply relatively fast enable to study site specific sorption and give quantitative results which may be further utilized e g in vulnerability analysis and modelling still it needs to be kept in mind that laboratory batch experiments give information on sorption behaviour for equilibrium conditions and for initial concentrations of compounds exceeding concentration ranges μg l typically found in aquifers ng l further we showed that it is important to consider different isotherm types because different compounds undergo different sorption mechanisms not necessarily described best by linear approximations even for pharmaceutical compounds with low

currently the combination of cfd based numerical solver and volume interface tracking method such as vof ls and coupled of vof and ls is widely recognized as an effective approach to simulate the fluid flow and pore scale physics with a wide range of density and viscosity ratios due to its mass conservation principle and superior numerical compute ability mohammadmoradi and kantzas 2016a 2016b nikhil and premachandran 2018 raeini et al 2012 these models adopting tetrahedron meshes are generated by commercial codes which are prior to preserve the natural geometry and present the transient phase distribution in pores while considering both viscous and capillary forces however the tetrahedron meshes which is also named unstructured meshes have been used in these studies to discretize the flow domain which is difficult to control the mesh quality for such complex structure of natural rock what s more uniform wettability is assumed in these simulations in this paper the structured mesh models generated from the micro ct images are used to simulate the immiscible two phase flow in the nonuniform wettability rock adopting cfd and vof methods the effects of scaling up micro macro

general workflow of micro ct imaging process is shown in fig 1 the carbonate and sandstone rock samples with significant different pore size distribution and heterogeneity are adopted in order to make

idea and technique theory for pore scale structured mesh model reconstruction is by substituting structured hexahedron elements for the voxels within the same 3d images and the grid size is same with the pixel resolution the details of modeling algorithm were proposed and validated in our previous works song et al 2017a 2017b the reconstruction model of sample c1 and f1 are presented in fig 2 pore size distribution curves are plotted in fig 3 2 2 mathematical model the advantages of the vof method on capturing interface mechanisms which include the hysteresis of contact angle and film flow have been proven lunati and or 2009 hirt and nichols 1981 for the immiscible flow the continuity equation with the vof methods can be expressed as shams et al 2018 4 1 ρ i t α i ρ i α i ρ i v i 0 where α i is volume fraction of the i th phase in the computing cell ρ i and v i are density and velocity for the i th phase in the flow domain the velocity field is shared by different phases and the momentum equation is described as follow shams et al 2018 5 t ρ v ρ v v p μ v v t ρ g f s where μ represents viscosity and ρ g accounts for body force the term f s 2 σκ n δ γ describes the effect of laplace pressure and its value is nonzero only at the phase interface the solving of the phases volume fraction follows the eq 6 shams et al 2018 6 i 1 n α i 1 in each computing cell the volume fraction of the component phases is used to determine the properties in the transport equations for multiphase system the density ρ and viscosity μ in each computing cell are derived by shams et al 2018 7 ρ i 1 n α i ρ i 8 μ i 1 n α i μ i where the bulk properties of phase fluids ρ i and μ i are assumed to be constant in most vof implementations the force acting at the surface of discontinuity is replaced by a continuum force brackbill et al 1992 9 f v 2 σκ α i this continuum surface force csf model leads to a volume force that tends to the surface force when the thickness of the interface region h approaches to 0 brackbill et al 1992 i e 10 lim h 0 f v f s 2 σκ n δ γ where σ is the interface tension κ is the mean curvature and n is the normal to the interface the term δ γ x δ α i x 1 2 is the delta function concentrated on the fluid fluid interface the phase interface curvature can be calculated by the local gradients of the phase interface normal which is determined by the volume fraction gradient of the i th phase brackbill et al 1992 11 κ 1 2 n 12 n n n 13 n α i at the solid boundaries however the direction of the normal vector is defined by solid surface wettability which is determined by the contact angle gennes 1985 14 n n w cos θ w t w sin θ w where n w and t w are the unit vectors normal and tangential to the wall respectively θ w is the contact angle ununiform contact angle and wettability for the reconstructed models have been realized by user s defined function udf in fluent software the details of the implementation approach refer to song et al 2017a the relative permeability for the i th phase can be calculated by raeini et al 2014 15 k rp q i δ p i q i sp δ p i sp where q i is the total flow rate of phase i in multiphase flow the subscript sp is for the variables corresponding to the single phase flow under the same boundary conditions δp i is the darcy scale pressures drop for each phase which can be calculated by velocity average weighted value of the pore scale pressure gradient raeini et al 2014 16 δ p i 1 q i v i v i p i dv i where v i accounts for the flow volume occupied by the i th phase the immiscible displacement efficiency is defined as raeini et al 2015 17 e m 1 s or s wi 1 s wi 3 results and discussion in this section the effects of induced fluid properties capillary number and rock wettability on water flooding efficiency are analyzed using the reconstructed pore scale models via cfd vof method the models are initially saturated by water followed by oil displacement to irreducible water saturation and then water of two pore volume pv is injected to simulate the water flooding process simulations are conducted only along the z direction of the models and the rest surfaces of the model are set to impermeable boundaries it is noted that the fluid properties used in the drainage are constant so it is the same with the initial water saturation of the water flooding process the fluid flow was assumed as laminar flow in this paper and the simplec scheme for velocity pressure coupling is adopted along with default relaxation factors the convective term is discretized by the linear upwind scheme the simulation results of the structured mesh model have been validated by comparing to the results of experimental and pnm simulation in our previous work song et al 2017a the simulation results and volume fraction distribution of the irreducible water and residual oil for sample c1 are presented in fig 4 3 1 microscopic capillary number ca micro the fluid properties used in simulation are shown in table 2 the relative permeability curves acquired by the simulation are presented in fig 5 it can be found that the relative permeability of both the oil and water increases as the capillary number rises whereas the residual oil saturation decreases the curves of the residual oil saturation and microscopic displacement efficiency v s capillary numbers in water wetted and oil wetted models are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively it is indicated that the oil recovery increases with the rising of the capillary number however the critical ca micro for microscopic water flooding of the water wetted and oil wetted models behaves differently for the water wetted rock the microscopic critical ca micro is about 10 6 while the microscopic critical ca micro is about 10 5 for the oil wetted rock the results are in agreement with the laboratory study on core sample which indicates the microscopic ca micro is between 10 5 and 10 7 humphry et al 2014 dullien 1979 armstrong et al 2012 when ca micro is less than the critical value the residual oil saturation reduces slowly and it decreases rapidly when ca micro is in the range of the critical value 10 2 meanwhile it is found that the decrease trend of the oil wetted models is slower than that of the water wetted models more details of the effects of microscopic wettability on the immiscible flooding efficiency will be discussed in section 3 3 when ca micro 10 2 the residual oil saturation in the effective pores is approaching to 0 in which case the residual oil mainly exists in the isolated pores in other words when ca micro exceeds the critical value mobilization of the residual trapped non wetting phase is found to occur the reason lies in that the mobilization of the larger capillary trapped oil clusters will be broken apart by snap off processes into smaller clusters or are mobilized and recovered by increasing flooding rate displacement phase viscosity or and reducing oil water interfacial tension which have been actually adopted by chemical flooding 3 2 macroscopic capillary number ca macro the curves of the residual oil saturation s or and microscopic displacement efficiency e m v s the macroscopic capillary number in water wetted and oil wetted models are shown in fig 8 the results indicate that the critical macroscopic capillary number is approaching to 1 which are in the representative range as the literature georgiadis et al 2013 when ca macro 1 the residual oil saturation decreases and the microscopic recovery efficiency increases with the rising of ca macro in macroscopic view ca macro 1 means the balance of the effects between the viscous and capillary pressure thus an increase in viscous forces or reduction in capillary forces will realize the reduction of the non wetting phase and optimized oil recovery 3 3 rock wettability based on the structured mesh models the water flooding processes are simulated for different wettability ranging from strong water wet to strong oil wet the fluid properties used in this section are presented in table 3 as shown in fig 9 the relative permeability curves vary with the rock wettability when the contact angle increases from strong water wet to strong oil wet the flowing capacity of water on the solid surface increases resulting in the rising of the water relative permeability and the relative permeability of oil decreases conversely meanwhile the water saturation of the strong water wetted models is larger than 0 5 when the k rw equals to k ro and the value decreases when the model changes to oil wet the curves of ultimate residual oil saturation and microscopic displacement efficiency in different wettability models are presented in fig 10 the results indicate that the intermediate wet or weak water wetted models can achieve the maximum displacement efficiency while that of the strong wettability model is the lowest meanwhile the oil recovery of the strong water wetted model is lower than that of strong oil wet the reason lies in that the induced water flow along the solid surface in the strong water wetted models in which case the remaining oil in the middle part of the pore is left behind when the injecting water breaks through this phenomenon usually occurs in big pores leading to higher residual oil saturation for the strong oil wetted models induced water flow along the middle part of the channels to reduce the flowing resistance which causes lots of residual oil on the rock surface however these two effects are weak in the intermediate wet or weak oil water wetted models resulting in higher oil recovery there are rare researches of the effect of capillary number on oil recovery in rock medium with real pore structure therefore we acquired the scaling up critical capillary number at both micro and macro level via pore scale simulation under ununiform wettability conditions and validated with the analytical derivation and experimental results in literatures compared to experiment the pore scale simulation method proposed in this paper based on digital rock model directly generated from ct image of rock could be recognized as a novel approach to study the trapping and mobilization mechanism of residual fluids in porous media 4 conclusions in this paper pore scale structured mesh models of rock are generated based on the micro ct images and used as inputs for pore scale simulations of immiscible two phase flow using cfd vof method the effects of micro macro scale capillary number and rock wettability on relative permeability oil recovery and water flooding efficiency are analyzed the following results and conclusions can be achieved for the water wetted rock the microscopic critical capillary number is about 10 6 while the microscopic critical ca is about 10 5 for the oil wetted rock the macroscopic capillary number is approaching to 1 the decreasing trends of the residual oil and increasing of the immiscible displacement efficiency are validated with the increasing of both microscale and macroscale capillary number the rock wettability has a significant influence on the oil recovery the maximum oil recovery can be achieved for intermediate wet or weak water wetted models and the oil recovery of the strong wettability model is the lowest compared to the existing experimental study the method proposed in this paper has the advantages of investigation multiple factors response independent of model structure as well the research efficiency as for the numerical simulations this paper conducts multiple factors investigation including micro macro capillary number and uniform wettability in the real shape pore scale models of rock the cfd vof method is adopted in this paper considering its mass conservation ability superior numerical adeptness and ability to simulate fluid flow and pore scale physics in a wide range of density and viscosity ratios it should be noted that this research aims to provide a preliminary study for micro fluids in porous media using finite volume methods as mentioned in the introduction part the trapping and mobilization mechanism of residual fluids in porous media are crucial to various engineering applications related to rock and soil medium although examples used in this study mainly focus on the petroleum industry except for enhanced oil recovery the findings acquired in this paper are also helpful to clean up the oil leakage for environmental protection as well as pollute transport mechanism investigation involving pesticides heavy

porous rock to describe the ratio between the macroscale viscous force and the capillary force a dimensional number the capillary number ca was derived by a dimensional analysis of pore scale stokes

e g capillary tube however the feasibility of these ca micro at macroscale is unclear since the effects of complex pore scale fluid topology have not been taken into consideration anton and hilfer 1999 by the averaging of accessible pore scale parameters acquired from fast x ray computed microtomography to macroscale and an up scaling rigorous dimensional analysis the macroscopic capillary number was defined as armstrong et al 2014 2 ca macro l c μ wet u wet k rwet p c 3 l c s c l cl s c where the term l c is the average length of the oil cluster μ wet is the wetting phase viscosity u

given cluster per sample volume and l cl is the length of the oil cluster along a viscous pressure drop which can be estimated by the ref georgiadis et al 2013 these micro scale parameters of p c s c and l cl are usually determined by flooding tests using real time micro ct technology georgiadis et al 2013 however more expense and more precise equipment are required for these microscale displacement experiments besides the disorder and complex pore structure of rock is another challenge to conduct parallel experiments in the same flow channels thus numerical simulation based on the pore scale modeling of porous rock has been regarded as an efficient tool to handle these problems pore network model pnm has been one of the effective attempts in the pore scale simulations which is generated by defining pores and throats after dividing the pore space into larger and narrow voids ai raoush and willson 2005 pores were usually assumed as cubic sphere dong and blunt 2009 or

algharbi and blunt 2005 or square mogensen and stenby 1998 the quasi static and dynamic computational algorithms are usually adopted to simulate fluid flow in these models the quasi static models simulate the equilibrium states of drainage and the imbibition processes controlled by capillary forces oren et al 1998 rahul et al 2018 the dynamic models can handle the time dependent pore scale

angle increases from strong water wet to strong oil wet the flowing capacity of water on the solid surface increases resulting in the rising of the water relative permeability and the relative permeability of oil decreases conversely meanwhile the water saturation of the strong water wetted models is larger than 0 5 when the k rw equals to k ro and the value decreases when the model changes to oil wet the curves of ultimate residual oil saturation and microscopic displacement efficiency in different wettability models are presented in fig 10 the results indicate that the intermediate wet or weak water wetted models can achieve the maximum displacement efficiency while that of the strong wettability model is the lowest meanwhile the oil recovery of the strong water wetted model is lower than that of strong oil wet the reason lies in that the induced water flow along the solid surface in the strong water wetted models in which case the remaining oil in the middle part of the pore is left behind when the injecting water breaks through this phenomenon usually occurs in big pores leading to higher residual oil saturation for the strong oil wetted models induced water flow along the middle part of the channels to reduce the flowing resistance which causes lots of residual oil on the rock surface however these two effects are weak in the intermediate wet or weak oil water wetted models resulting in higher oil recovery there are rare researches of the effect of capillary number on oil recovery in rock medium with real pore structure therefore we acquired the scaling up critical capillary number at both micro and macro level via pore scale simulation under ununiform wettability conditions and validated with the analytical derivation and experimental results in literatures compared to experiment the pore scale simulation method proposed in this paper based on digital rock model directly generated from ct image of rock could be recognized as a novel approach to study the trapping and mobilization mechanism of residual fluids in porous media 4 conclusions in this paper pore scale structured mesh models of rock are generated based on the micro ct images and used as inputs for pore scale simulations of immiscible two phase flow using cfd vof method the effects of micro macro scale capillary number and rock wettability on relative permeability oil recovery and water flooding efficiency are analyzed the following results and conclusions can be achieved for the water wetted rock the microscopic critical capillary number is about 10 6 while the microscopic critical ca is about 10 5 for the oil wetted rock the macroscopic capillary number is approaching to 1 the decreasing trends of the residual oil and increasing of the immiscible displacement efficiency are validated with the increasing of both microscale and macroscale capillary number the rock wettability has a significant influence on the oil recovery the maximum oil recovery can be achieved for intermediate wet or weak water wetted models and the oil recovery of the strong wettability model is the lowest compared to the existing experimental study the method proposed in this paper has the advantages of investigation multiple factors response independent of model structure as well the research efficiency as for the numerical simulations this paper conducts multiple factors investigation including micro macro capillary number and uniform wettability in the real shape pore scale models of rock the cfd vof method is adopted in this paper considering its mass conservation ability superior numerical adeptness and ability to simulate fluid flow and pore scale physics in a wide range of density and viscosity ratios it should be noted that this research aims to provide a preliminary study for micro fluids in porous media using finite volume methods as mentioned in the introduction part the trapping and mobilization mechanism of residual fluids in porous media are crucial to various engineering applications related to rock and soil medium although examples used in this study mainly focus on the petroleum industry except for enhanced oil recovery the findings acquired in this paper are also helpful to clean up the oil leakage for environmental protection as well as pollute transport mechanism investigation involving pesticides heavy

1572,agroforestry practices have been acknowledged for reducing pesticide losses while maintaining land productivity pesticide removal from overland flow results from great infiltration capacities of the buffer soils this can in turn threaten the quality of groundwater in case of poor pesticide sorption and degradation in the root influenced zone these mechanisms and their balance are likely to be influenced by plant species however little is known about the role of agroforestry species in the infiltration of herbicides the aim of this study was thereby to evaluate how popular agroforestry species modulate the infiltration of water and of a widely used herbicide we established large buffer microcosms by planting brome grass black walnut pin oak and poplar trees in repacked soil columns after a growth season of 4 months we performed ponded infiltration experiments with bromide and s metolachlor we used then the hydrus 1d model to compare the hydrodynamic properties and s metolachlor transport patterns between the microcosms in addition we compared the sorption properties of the rhizosphere and bulk soils we found that the tree species increased the sorption of s metolachlor in soil with kd being 3 times greater than in the un vegetated and brome grass microcosms poplar trees increased the hydraulic conductivity ksat compared to the control and was associated to a low retardation of s metolachlor which increases the risk of groundwater contamination with slightly reduced ksat and retardation factor in the root zone 1 6 to 1 8 times greater than in the control treatment black walnut appears as an optimal species for mitigating s metolachlor the brome grass and oak microcosms had the lowest ksat of all treatments and s metolachlor retardation factors were equal and slightly increased compared to the control respectively these results show that agroforestry buffer s efficiency can be optimized by selecting appropriate species graphical abstract

financial and technical support for buffer s implementation farmers remain reluctant to convert croplands into non productive buffer zones lovell and sullivan 2006 agroforestry practices such as in field agroforestry buffers or alley cropping by combining intensively cropped areas with economically viable non cropped buffer zones may offer an optimal landscape setting for both maintaining land productivity and reducing pesticide losses jose 2009 nair 2007 in alley cropping agroforestry systems high value hardwood trees are planted in rows between which crops are established in allay ways kremer and kussman 2011 agroforestry buffers refer to in field edge of field or riparian buffers planted with both grass and wooded species caron et al 2010a b udawatta et al 2011 evidence on efficiency of agroforestry systems in reducing npsp from overland flow has been provided by several studies across north america and europe pesticides abatements rates varying between 58 and 90 have been measured between the inlet and outlet of edge of field and in field agroforestry buffers borin et al 2010 caron et al 2010a b lin et al 2011 the pesticide abatements in those studies were attributed to significant runoff reduction and sediment trapping indeed buffer vegetation provides roughness that slows overland flow and increases infiltration duration caron et al 2010a dosskey 2001 dosskey et al 2010 in addition enhanced evapotranspiration by buffer vegetation with deeper root systems induces drier soil moisture conditions than for adjacent row crop soils thereby enhancing infiltration and water storage capacities in the buffers anderson et al 2008 dosskey et al 2010 lin et al 2011 sahin et al 2016 schultz et al 1995 moreover roots and biological activity increase the soil macroporosity in vegetated buffers creating preferential flow pathways while the pesticide reduction from overland flow in agroforestry buffers has been fairly well described the fate of pesticide in buffer soils and the risk for groundwater contamination remains to be documented preferential flow in soils leads to rapid leaching of pollutants and consequently to non equilibrium sorption which increases the risk of groundwater contamination dages et al 2015 pot et al 2005 vanderborght et al 2002 however the vicinity of root channels which are major conducting macropores might be enriched in specific soil organic carbon and microbial biomass enhancing sorption and degradation potentials efficiency of agroforestry buffer zones depend on a balance of these mechanisms the magnitude of water and pesticide infiltration fluxes is assumed to be mainly dependent on vegetation type because of contrasted root biomass distribution along the soil profile lin et al 2011 schultz et al 1995 diverse composition of soil organic carbon and microbial activities chu et al 2013 lin et al 2004 2010 and differing soil structure and moisture modification anderson et al 2008 sahin et al 2016 schultz et al 1995 seobi et al 2005 pesticide retention patterns would then be contrasted among plant species and between the rhizosphere and the soil matrix chu et al 2013 lin et al 2010 rodríguez cruz et al 2012 water and pesticide transport and retention in the root zone of a few herbaceous species have been evaluated and compared belden and coats 2009 lin et al 2004 2011 but there is to our knowledge no study investigating the influence of temperate agroforestry species on those mechanisms accordingly the objectives of this study were i to compare the influence of popular agroforestry buffer trees and herbaceous species on the mechanisms of water and herbicide fluxes and ii to compare soil textural chemical and sorption properties between the bulk soil and rhizosphere of the tested species in order to isolate the effect of the plant species from pedo climatic effects that can be locally highly variable and difficult to monitor precisely we chose to implement a large microcosm approach the water and herbicide infiltration parameters obtained from microcosm approaches might not be directly transferable to all field situations however the differential in water and herbicide infiltration parameters measured between microcosms planted with various species indicates if a given species has the ability to increase or decrease the hydraulic conductivity or herbicide sorption in the root influenced zone this information is useful for designing agroforestry buffers with optimized herbicide mitigation capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 microcosm design five treatments consisting of large 25 4 cm diameter 30 cm height packed soil columns were designed three treatments were planted each with a respective tree species 1 treatment was planted with an herbaceous species and the final treatment remained un vegetated each treatment was established in triplicate for a total of 15 columns 2 1 1 plant species the herbaceous species selected was smooth brome grass bromus sp a cold season grass widely used in agroforestry buffers strips because of its great performance under shade lin et al 2004 2007 smooth brome grass seeds were purchased from stock seed farm murdock nebraska usa the tree species selected were poplar populus sp oak quercus sp and walnut juglans sp poplar tree is probably the most popular tree species in agroforestry buffer design caron et al 2010a b chu et al 2010 this fast growing species is used all over the world in diverse agroforestry systems oak and walnut trees are also widely used cardinael et al 2015 garrett et al 1991 pinto correia et al 2011 pin oak quercus palustris and black walnut juglans nigra are species well acclimated to the midwestern usa and often locally grown in agroforestry systems bare root dormant tree seedlings 30 to 40 cm tall were used to establish the tree buffer microcosms hybrid poplar seedlings populus deltoides populus nigra were purchased from the arbor day foundation nursery lincoln nebraska usa pin oak and black walnut seedlings were purchased from the cold stream farm nursery michigan usa 2 1 2 soil collection and columns preparation the soil used to build the buffer microcosms was sampled in a permanent prairie plot at the horticulture and agroforestry research center in new franklin missouri usa 39 0 2 nord 92 46 west the plot has no history of pesticide or herbicide use the soil at the site is a menfro silt loam fine silty mixed superactive mesic typic hapludalf udawatta et al 2010 about 350 kg soil was collected from the upper organic matter rich horizon 0 30 cm depth the soil was stored in a walk in growth chamber where it was air dried at 30 c then sieved at 2 mm pvc cylinders 25 4 cm id and 30 cm length were sealed at the bottom with a pvc sheet and packed with the dry sieved soil at a 1 2 g cm 3 density to ensure the homogeneity of the soil density over the column s height the columns were packed progressively by 1 cm layer increments for each layer the mass of soil required to reach a density of 1 2 g cm 3 was precisely weighed then homogeneously spread over the surface and manually compacted to reach 1 cm height for the un vegetated controls and smooth brome grass microcosms the columns were packed directly at the final height of 23 cm the soil in the columns was humidified with a rainfall simulator to reach 50 of the water holding capacity and for the brome grass treatment 10 seeds per columns were dispersed to the surface and gently buried at 1 2 mm depth the columns were covered with aluminum foil for 10 days until the seeds germinated for the tree treatments the columns were first packed by 1 cm increments as described earlier over a height of 8 cm each seedling previously soaked in clear tap water to remove the hydroponic gel from the roots was positioned in a column so that the taproot was centered and the collar positioned at 23 cm above the bottom of the column the lateral roots were distributed around the tap root and maintained in their natural orientation while packing the columns as previously described to reach a final height of 23 cm at a 1 2 g cm 3 density the natural architecture of the root system was thus preserved and the soil density was homogeneous along the column the soil was then humidified to reach 50 of the water holding capacity as previously described 2 1 3 vegetation growth period after the tree seedlings were planted and the brome grass was seeded all of the microcosms were incubated for 4 months in a walk in environmental growth chamber environmental growth chambers gc72 walk in unit chagrin falls ohio under constant and controlled climatic conditions during the growth period a 12 h day and 12 h night cycle was imposed during the day the temperature was set to 25 c humidity to 25 and the total light intensity was 3 95 105 lm composed of 97 fluorescent light and 3 halogen lights providing the blue and red light range for plant growth respectively during the night the temperature was set to 19 c humidity to 40 and the complete darkness was maintained irrigation was designed to simulate rainfall events with cumulative amount intensity and frequency representative of the mid missourian climate each microcosm received a cumulated amount of 100 mm month which corresponds to the average monthly rainfall over the april to august period two major rainfall events of 10 mm each and a minor event of 5 mm were performed weekly all of the microcosms including the un vegetated ones were subjected to the same climatic conditions for 4 months at the end of the growth period 2 out of 3 trees of each treatment had grown well thereby the infiltration experiments were conducted in duplicates for all of the treatments 2 2 characterization of the water and solute infiltration fluxes 2 2 1 selected herbicide and conservative tracer bromide was selected as a conservative tracer to characterize the hydrodynamic properties in the microcosms because it rarely sorbs to soil particles and is only present as trace element in the environment flury and wai 2003 s metolachlor was selected as a model herbicide to characterize the transfer and retention mechanisms s metolachlor is from the chloroacetamide family is hydrophobic log kow 3 05 it s water solubility is relatively low 480 mg l 1 its soil sorption affinity is moderate and it s degradation half life in soil varies between 15 and 92 days ppdb 2018 s metolachlor is widely used across the world for selective weeding in a variety of crops including maize rapeseed cotton etc e g o connell et al 1998 being moderately sorbed by soils and despite a relatively low persistence a few weeks this compound is classified as moderately mobile ppdb 2018 indeed it has been frequently detected in surface and groundwater in the usa and eu e g toccalino et al 2014 2 2 2 transport experiments for the transport experiments the pvc sheets at the bottom of the columns were replaced by metal with 3 to 4 mm pore size to prevent soil loss without restricting the water flow in the columns columns were progressively saturated by capillarity rise 48 h prior to the infiltration experiments to minimize trapping of gas bubbles in the soil pores bromide tracer experiments were performed in duplicates and s metolachlor transport experiments on a single series two series of infiltration experiment were thus performed the first evaluating only bromide transport and the second both bromide and s metolachlor transport the injection solutions used for the first series of displacement experiments contained 500 mg l 1 of bromide br this series was performed on a set of columns including one from each treatment control ci smooth brome grass bgi black walnut bwi pin oak oi and poplar pi the injection solution used for the second series of transport experiments contained 500 mg l 1 bromide and 300 μg l 1 s metolachlor this series was performed on a second set of columns including the second replicate from each treatment control cii smooth brome grass bgii black walnut bwii pin oak oii and poplar pii thereby the bromide transport experiments were performed in duplicates while the s metolachlor transport experiments were performed only once for each treatment indeed one series had to remain uncontaminated by s metolachlor for further characterization of the textural chemical and sorption properties see section 2 3 at the beginning of the transport experiments the saturated columns were manually ponded with a 10 mm water height of the injection solution the water height was maintained constant during the infiltration by adjusting the supply of the injection solution a total volume of 118 mm 6000 cm3 of solution was supplied to each column among the 10 columns the pore volumes ranged from 119 6030 cm3 to 129 6537 cm3 mm as estimated with pedotransfer functions from the density and volume of the soil cylinders schaap et al 2001 therefore the volume of tracer solution supplied during the displacement experiment was always approximately equal or slightly lower than the column pore volume when the solution supply stopped the decrease in water head was monitored during the remaining period of ponded water infiltration just after all the ponded solution had infiltrated the columns were ponded again with a constant head of 10 mm tracer free water and the columns were eluted with 118 mm of degassed tap water following the same procedure during the infiltration and elution periods 100 ml fractions of the effluents were collected in polypropylene pp containers at the outlets of the columns the sampling frequency varied from 50 s to about 2 min depending on the columns drainage rate the outlet flowrates were monitored using the timing of sample collection and the measured weights the recovery of each solute was calculated by dividing the mass of the solute collected in the effluent by the mass injected cout cin belden and coats 2009 dollinger et al 2018 2 2 3 determination of the hydrodynamic properties by inverse modelling as described in dollinger et al 2018 the bromide tracer experiments were simulated using hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 šimůnek et al 2003 that solves the richards and convection dispersion equations the classical formalism of the richards equation assuming homogeneous flow pathways and the dual permeability model considering two mobile compartments a fast macroporal compartment and the slow matrix were successively used to simulate the experiments although the single porosity model gave acceptable results for most columns fig s1 and s2 the dual permeability model was more effective for all of the columns fig s3 and s4 and was thus used to determine the hydrodynamic properties equations of the dual permeability model are briefly described in the supplementary material eq s1a and s1b for more details on the equilibrium and non equilibrium formalisms please refer to šimůnek et al 2008 or köhne et al 2009 the water retention curve θ h and the unsaturated hydraulic function k h are defined for both compartments using the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 k h is described as the product of the relative hydraulic conductivity function kr dimensionless and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks l t 1 the transport equations associated with dual permeability formulation for water flow eq s2a to s2c are based on the classical convection dispersion equation for both the fast compartment and the slow compartment completed with an exchange term between the two compartments šimůnek et al 2008 köhne et al 2009 an inverse modelling approach was implemented to reproduce both the bromide breakthrough curves and percolation outfluxes of the 2 series of transport experiments the 0 23 m soil profiles were densely discretized with 150 nodes to facilitate numerical convergence an initial hydrostatic equilibrium with a zero pressure was considered and a variable head corresponding to the water level fluctuation at the top of the soil column was imposed as top boundary condition the eight following parameters were fitted against total soil column porosity cumulative water outflows heights and bromide concentrations at the outlet of the soil column θr m θs m θs f ks m ks f ω disp m disp f with θs and θr respectively the saturated and residual soil water content and disp the dispersion coefficient l to avoid local minimum the stability of the fitted parameter set estimated was evaluated using different sets of initial parameters including the estimated sets themselves the other hydrodynamic parameters were set according to their textural composition and their bulk density using rosetta schaap et al 2001 except θr f that was set to zero the bromide diffusion coefficient was fixed to 2 10 9 m2 s 1 köhne et al 2006 2 2 4 modelling of the s metolachlor breakthrough curves to simulate the breakthrough curves of s metolachlor we used the dual permeability formalism for the water flow coupled to the convection dispersion equation for the solute transport with an additional term for sorption we assumed the degradation processes to be negligible given the short duration of the experiments varying between 2 and 6 h compared to the half life of 15 to 92 days of this molecule section 2 2 1 a linear sorption equilibrium model with no desorption hysteresis was considered first we used the sorption coefficients measured in the batch studies section 2 3 2 we implemented in the model the rhizosphere sorption coefficient for the macroporal compartment and the bulk sorption coefficient for the slow matrix compartment then to account for potential reduced sorption mechanisms that might occur especially in the macroporal compartment due to reduced contact duration we implemented an inverse modelling approach therefore the sorption coefficients kdf and kdm were fitted against the s metolachlor breakthrough curves the retardation factors schaffer and licha 2015 were calculated for both the matrix and macroporal compartments for the 2 sets of sorption coefficients measured and optimized 2 3 measurement of the physico chemical and sorption properties in the rhizosphere and bulk soil from the different microcosms 2 3 1 soil sampling and analysis soil from the first series that did not receive s metolachlor during the transport experiment was collected from each treatment ci bgi bwi oi and pi for the vegetated treatments bulk and rhizosphere soil were collected separately rhizosphere soil was defined as soil attached to the root system to sample the rhizosphere soil roots were gently shaken to remove un attached particles then brushed to collect the attached fraction bulk soil was collected in areas not or poorly colonized by roots very fine roots diameter 1 mm had colonized most of the soil profiles in the vegetated treatments so the bulk soil collected aren t totally un affected by the root systems we hypothesized that the bulk and rhizosphere soils were homogeneous along the soil profile of a given column as the columns were packed with homogeneous soil the soil samples were then sieved at 2 mm and sent to the soil and plant testing laboratory at the university of missouri for analysis of texture ph organic matter content om and cationic exchange capacity cec after soil sampling the root and aerial biomass from the ci bgi bwi oi and pi treatments were separately collected and oven dried at 105 c for 24 h 2 3 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption parameters were measured according to a procedure adapted from the oecd guideline 106 oecd 2000 with equilibrium conditions and solid to liquid ratio chosen to mimic the soil solution conditions as much as possible given the analytical constraints prior to the experiments the sieved soils were air dried to a target humidity of 10 which was precisely measured by oven drying at 105 c for 24 h then 4 ml of the s metolachlor solutions with concentration ranging from 50 to 1000 μg l 1 50 100 250 500 and 1000 μg l 1 prepared in an electrolyte solution composed of cacl2 0 01 m and nan3 200 mg l 1 were equilibrated with 2 g of soil in polypropylen pp centrifuge tubes cacl2 was added in the electrolyte solution to minimize the soil aggregate breakdown and nan3 to prevent microbial degradation during the incubation periods the tubes were equilibrated for 48 h without shaking and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min aliquots of the supernatants were collected and filtered at 0 2 μm prior to s metolachlor analysis s metolachlor concentration in soils was assessed by mass balance between initial and equilibrium concentrations both linear eq 1a and freundlich models eq 1b were fitted to the experimental data 1a cs kd cw 1b cs kf cw n where cs is the amount of sorbed pesticides in the soil at equilibrium μg kg 1 cw is the equilibrium concentration in the supernatant μg l 1 kd is the linear sorption coefficient l kg 1 kf μg 1 n ln kg 1 and n are the freundlich coefficients with n the non linearity parameter of the freundlich model adsorption of s metolachlor to the pp tubes and membrane filters were evaluated before the sorption experiments and found to be negligible all of the batch experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 4 chemical analyses bromide was quantified in the leachate samples using an ion specific electrode hanna instruments hi4102 usa a previous study has proven the accuracy of this electrode when compared to ionic chromatography dollinger et al 2018 for the measurement 15 ml sample aliquots were mixed with 500 μl of the hi4000 00 reactive solution hanna instruments usa and stirred for 2 min before the electrode measurement the limit of quantification of this method was 1 mg l 1 the quantification of s metolachlor was performed using a waters acquity tq triple quadrupole mass spectrometer waters usa with an electrospray ionization interface operated in positive mode esi coupled to a waters alliance 2695 hplc system waters usa the separation was performed at 40 c on a 4 6 id and 100 mm length c18 column kinetex under gradient mode the 2 solvents constituting the mobile phase were acetonitrile a and milliq h2o with 10 mm ammonium acetate and 0 1 formic acid b the gradient was initiated with 2 of a and 98 b for 0 3 min then the relative proportion of solvent a was risen from 2 to 80 between 0 3 and 7 27 min risen again from 80 to 98 between 7 27 and 7 37 then maintained until 9 min run between 9 and 10 min run the relative proportion of a was lowered from 98 to 2 than maintained until the end of the 15 min run the flowrate of the mobile phase was 0 5 ml min 1 all along the run the data acquisition was performed with the multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode by monitoring the dissociation of the m z 284 precursor ion to the m z 252 product ions for a cone voltage and a collision energy of 30 and 16 v respectively prior to the analysis all of the samples were filtered at 0 2 μm on inorganic membrane filters whatman anotop 10 the limit of quantification was 0 05 μg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 root system architecture and plant growth at the end of the 4 months growth period the plants of the vegetated microcosms had grown well in two replicates out of the three initially established the aerial biomass structure and height was visually very similar among the two replicates for a given species exception made of the poplar trees the two poplar trees revealed to be different hybrids the pi hybrid had triangle leaves shape and dark red shoots while the pii hybrid had more elongated leaves shape and green shoots the pii hybrid was also taller than the pi hybrid the height of the three tree species had almost doubled during the growth period and the collar circumference reached 3 3 to 3 6 cm the global biomass recorded was from far the greatest for brome grass followed by poplar trees fig 1 oak and walnut trees had equivalent biomasses which were lower than those of poplar trees for all species the root biomass was 2 to 10 times greater than the aerial biomass the smooth brome grass had developed a very dense root system that had colonized the entire column profile with similar densities at the different depths the root development didn t seem to be constrained by the cylinder wall the roots had all similar diameters about 1 mm and were greatly interwoven with no dominant orientation angle for the tree species the architecture of the root system didn t evolve much during the 4 months growth fig 2 the end part of the tape roots from the oak and black walnut seedlings had degenerated and few lateral roots were created but the diameter of tape roots and lateral roots almost doubled in addition branching from the lateral roots had generated a dense network of very fine roots 1 mm diameter the structure of the black walnut root system was characterized by a large tap root and 10 20 large lateral roots evenly distributed along the tape root with orientation angles varying from 40 to 60 from the tape root axis and a dense fine to very fine root system the root system architecture was rather similar for oak trees but the lateral roots were more horizontal the tape root and lateral roots were also finer than those from the black walnut seedlings lateral roots elongation was also not constrained by the cylinder walls for both species the architecture of the poplar root systems was greatly contrasted few lateral roots were generated at the high end of the tape root but most of them were located at the bottom end the lateral roots elongation was greatly constrained by the cylinder size so when the roots reached the walls new branching were created and those branched roots circled several times the soil cylinder at the edge with the pvc walls thereby contrastingly with the other tree species the root density was very high on the edges and low in the center of the soil profile root system architecture is dependent on the soil compaction heterogeneity contrasted water and nutrient availability but also on the slope of the plot the wind and other climatic conditions di iorio et al 2005 hodge et al 2009 pregitzer et al 2002 zanetti et al 2015 the homogeneous soil density humidity and nutrient availability provided by the microcosms allows almost un constraint development of the root systems only the size of the cylinders could constrain the natural development of the lateral root as observed for the poplar trees fig 2 the root systems architecture from the plant grown in the large microcosms should not differ much from those of the same species established in field buffers with low constraint level environments like some riparian buffers with shallow water table collecting runoff loaded with nutrients from surrounding crop plots under more constrained field conditions like some alley cropping systems the morphology of the root system could differ according to the pedo climatic factors malamy 2005 3 2 influence of plant species on water and solutes infiltration fluxes the bromide breakthrough curves and outflow patterns monitored during the infiltration experiments allow comparing the water fluxes and hydrodynamic properties between the different treatments the bromide breakthrough curves were relatively well repeatable between the duplicates of the smooth brome grass black walnut and oak treatments fig 3 for those treatments the outflow patterns were also similar and constant between the injection and elution phases fig 3 for the poplar treatment the outflow was greater for the second replicate pii the bromide concentration rise was sharper during the injection phase and the concentration dropped faster during the elution phase which resulted in an earlier bromide peak this could be either due to the fact that the 2 poplar hybrids had different phenotypical characteristics or to the fact that roots had circled the soil profile and may have induced contrasted sidewall flow paths in both replicates section 3 1 the patterns also greatly differed between the 2 replicates of the control treatment with an outflow 2 times greater for the first replicate accompanied by an accelerated bromide transport the outflow decreased for the ci replicate all along the infiltration experiment being un vegetated the controls had lower evaporation rates during the growth period and a biological crust composed of algae and moss formed at the surface of the columns this poorly permeable crust covered almost the entire surface of the cii replicate but only half of it for the ci replicate which could explain the different patterns moreover desiccation cracks that formed between the irrigation events at the early stage of the growth periods were set by these crusts under field condition soils un protected by vegetation and especially soils with high silt and clay contents are also exposed to crusting and to the formation of drying cracks that modify the infiltration rates e g chamizo et al 2012 dunne et al 1991 eldridge et al 2000 despite some significant variability between the control and poplar replicates contrasted patterns of hydrodynamic properties between the treatments could be highlighted table 1 the macroporal flow contribution to the global outflow was found to be higher for the vegetated treatments than for the un vegetated controls exception made of the pii microcosms for the un vegetated treatments the macroporal fraction of the soil porosity ω was significant but the hydraulic conductivity and dispersion of the macroporal compartment were only slightly greater than those of the matrix compartment the high hydraulic conductivity and dispersion in both compartments resulted in the fast leaching of bromide with concentration greater than the lod measured already in the first collected samples contrastingly the hydraulic conductivity and dispersion of the matrix compartment were significantly lower in the vegetated treatment while those of the macroporal compartment were equivalent to those of the un vegetated treatments accordingly the overall hydraulic conductivities were reduced and the transport of bromide was slower the breakthrough time reached up to 18 min in the oak treatments the greatest global ksat were recorded for the control and poplar treatments and the lowest for the smooth brome grass and oak treatments black walnut treatments had intermediate ksat the hydraulic conductivity conditions the amount of water infiltrated during a runoff event thereby among the different plant species tested poplar trees would be the most efficient in reducing overland flow followed by black walnut then oak trees and smooth brome grass for most of the treatments s metolachlor transport had patterns contrasting with those of bromide fig 4 for the control treatment s metolachlor breakthrough was not significantly delayed compared to bromide but the concentration rise during the injection phase was slower however the concentration drop during the elution phase was similar to that of bromide for this cii treatment the bromide recovery was about 10 greater than that of s metolachlor at the end of the transport experiment but the model extrapolation suggests a 2 difference after eluting with 10 pore volumes table 2 as the transport pattern of s metolachlor was measured on the cii replicate having the slowest ksat it represents the best case scenario for the brome grass treatment s metolachlor breakthrough was slightly delayed compared to bromide the concentration rise during the injection phase was slower and so was the concentration drop during the elution phase fig 4 a second small peak for both bromide and s metolachlor was observed fig 4 this second peak corresponds to the fraction of the solute fluxes transported in the slow matrix compartment for the other treatments only the peak corresponding to the fraction of solutes transported through the fracture was observed and the second peak was probably too low to be distinguished as suggested by the greater macroporal fractions in these cases table 1 as for the control the difference in recovery rate between bromide and s metolachlor was about 10 at the end of the experiment for the brome grass treatment but the values simulated for an elution period of 10 pore volumes were equal contrastingly for the black walnut and oak treatments the s metolachlor breakthrough was so delayed that the concentration didn t even started to drop during the elution phase fig 4 the difference in recovery rates between bromide and s metolahclor reached 30 for those treatments at the end of the experiment and was still of 10 after a simulated elution period of 10 pore volumes last for the poplar treatment the bromide and s metolachlor breakthrough curves were relatively similar for the first part of the curve and except for a slightly faster concentration drop during the elution phase for s metolachlor fig 4 accordingly the difference in recovery rates between bromide and s metolachlor was only 5 at the end of the experiment for the poplar treatment s metolachlor transport was assessed on the pii replicate having the greatest ksat thereby it represents the worst case scenario except for the poplar treatment the direct implementation in the model of the kd measured in the batch experiments allowed rather good reproduction of the s metolachlor breakthrough curves fig 4 however the optimization of the sorption parameters improved the predictions especially for the control brome grass and poplar treatments fig 4 and table 2 therefore the extrapolation of the s metolachlor recovery rates to 10 pore volumes was calculated using the optimized sorption coefficients in the transport model section 2 2 4 except for the poplar treatment the very large confidence interval on the optimized kd for the matrix compartments up to 103 suggest that this parameter is not sensitive this is in accordance with the great contribution of the macroporal flow table 1 and the fast s metolachlor breakthrough fig 3 the kd measured for the bulk fraction were thereby used to parameterize the matrix compartment of the control smooth brome grass black walnut and oak treatments the kd optimized for the fracture compartment differed from the kd values measured for the rhizosphere soils and this parameter was sensitive for all treatments for the poplar treatment the optimized kd values were zero for both compartments accordingly s metolachlor was not retarded compared to bromide the optimized kd for the black walnut and oak treatments were the highest resulting in overall high retardation factors compared to the control and brome grass treatments table 2 under the studied flooding conditions the risk of groundwater contamination by s metolachlor was the lowest for the black walnut and oak treatments followed by the brome grass and the un vegetated treatment the poplar treatment recorded the highest contamination risk among all treatments more generally in the case of successive drying wetting cycles as for buffer soils submitted to successions of flood events retardation of herbicides gives a chance for degradation processes to take place and may also generate non reversible sorption mechanisms therefore as the transport model considered neglects desorption hysteresis and degradation processes the extrapolation of s metolachlor breakthrough to 10 pore volumes and more or to a succession of flood events might overestimate the recovery rates 3 3 influence of the root systems on the soil properties the soil analyses of the vegetated microcosms show that the textural and chemical properties and especially the texture class and organic matter content were very similar in the rhizosphere and bulk soils for a given species table 3 however when comparing treatments it appears that the organic matter content was slightly greater in the tree microcosms than in the smooth brome grass and control treatments the smooth brome grass treatment was equivalent in terms of organic matter content to the un vegetated control moreover the texture was slightly finer in the smooth brome grass treatment than in the others and the cec slightly higher in the control and poplar treatments in sum root systems of the different species contrastingly affected the soil textural and chemical properties however this action of the root systems was not restricted to the close vicinity of the root system but extended to most of the profile this might be due to the dense colonization of the soil profiles by the very fine root systems but also to root exudation and diffusion of dissolved organic carbon in the soil columns section 3 1 the sorption of s metolachlor on the rhizosphere and bulk soil from all treatments were best fitted by linear isotherms fig 5 table 3 as many other hydrophobic and non ionic herbicides s metolachlor has a great affinity for the organic matter fraction of soils and its sorption rate is mainly driven by the organic matter content weber et al 2004 accordingly the linear sorption coefficients kd were about 3 times greater for the oak poplar and walnut treatments having greater organic matter content table 3 than for the control and brome grass treatments moreover the difference in kd between the rhizosphere and bulk soils in the vegetated microcosms was negligible table 3 the kd and kf measured are in the range of sorption coefficients reported in the literature for soil with similar properties e g alletto et al 2013 krutz et al 2004 shaner et al 2006 the greater kd in soils from the oak and black walnut treatments could explain along with low hydraulic conductivities the greater retention capacity of s metolachlor except for smooth brome grass the optimized parameters were slightly lower for the macroporal compartment 0 13 0 72 0 77 and 0 00 l kg 1 for c bw o and p respectively than the coefficients measured in the rhizosphere of the different species table 3 which suggests that the higher flow velocities resulted in a reduced contact time for sorption for this compartment for the matrix compartment the optimized sorption coefficients were found to be poorly sensitive in accordance to the limited contribution of the matrix to the global outflow for the poplar treatment the high measured sorption is counterbalanced by faster infiltration which limits the time for equilibrium sorption indeed the estimated sorption coefficients for both compartments are null 4 conclusion designing agroforestry buffers for multipurpose use including herbicide retention is limited by consequent gaps of knowledge concerning the influence of plant species composition on the infiltration of water and herbicides therefore the influence of various tree or herbaceous species commonly used in agroforestry buffers on the water and s metolachlor infiltration fluxes in buffer soil and how these plant species modify the soil textural chemical and sorption properties were tested in large microcosms the results highlight the advantage of introducing wooded species in vegetated buffers indeed for the 3 tree species tested the hydraulic conductivity of the soil was equivalent or significantly higher than that of brome grass which guaranties a greater reduction of overland flow and associated herbicide fluxes for the oak and black walnut this increased infiltration was not associated with greater s metolachlor transport which would have threatened the groundwater quality with a medium hydraulic conductivity low macroporal flow and high s metolachlor retardation black walnut appears to be the most interesting species future research should investigate the transfer mechanisms of different categories of pesticides and under contrasted pedoclimatic contexts this would improve the genericity of the present results and allow designing

1572,agroforestry practices have been acknowledged for reducing pesticide losses while maintaining land productivity pesticide removal from overland flow results from great infiltration capacities of the buffer soils this can in turn threaten the quality of groundwater in case of poor pesticide sorption and degradation in the root influenced zone these mechanisms and their balance are likely to be influenced by plant species however little is known about the role of agroforestry species in the infiltration of herbicides the aim of this study was thereby to evaluate how popular agroforestry species modulate the infiltration of water and of a widely used herbicide we established large buffer microcosms by planting brome grass black walnut pin oak and poplar trees in repacked soil columns after a growth season of 4 months we performed ponded infiltration experiments with bromide and s metolachlor we used then the hydrus 1d model to compare the hydrodynamic properties and s metolachlor transport patterns between the microcosms in addition we compared the sorption properties of the rhizosphere and bulk soils we found that the tree species increased the sorption of s metolachlor in soil with kd being 3 times greater than in the un vegetated and brome grass microcosms poplar trees increased the hydraulic conductivity ksat compared to the control and was associated to a low retardation of s metolachlor which increases the risk of groundwater contamination with slightly reduced ksat and retardation factor in the root zone 1 6 to 1 8 times greater than in the control treatment black walnut appears as an optimal species for mitigating s metolachlor the brome grass and oak microcosms had the lowest ksat of all treatments and s metolachlor retardation factors were equal and slightly increased compared to the control respectively these results show that agroforestry buffer s efficiency can be optimized by selecting appropriate species graphical abstract

kremer and kussman 2011 agroforestry buffers refer to in field edge of field or riparian buffers planted with both grass and wooded species caron et al 2010a b udawatta et al 2011 evidence on efficiency of agroforestry systems in reducing npsp from overland flow has been provided by several studies across north america and europe pesticides abatements rates varying between 58 and 90 have been measured between the inlet and outlet of edge of field and in field agroforestry buffers borin et al 2010 caron et al 2010a b lin et al 2011 the pesticide abatements in those studies were attributed to significant runoff reduction and sediment trapping indeed buffer vegetation provides roughness that slows overland flow and increases infiltration duration caron et al 2010a dosskey 2001 dosskey et al 2010 in addition enhanced evapotranspiration by buffer vegetation with deeper root systems induces drier soil moisture conditions than for adjacent row crop soils thereby enhancing infiltration and water storage capacities in the buffers anderson et al 2008 dosskey et al 2010 lin et al 2011 sahin et al 2016 schultz et al 1995 moreover roots and biological activity increase the soil macroporosity in vegetated buffers creating preferential flow pathways while the pesticide reduction from overland flow in agroforestry buffers has been fairly well described the fate of pesticide in buffer soils and the risk for groundwater contamination remains to be documented preferential flow in soils leads to rapid leaching of pollutants and consequently to non equilibrium sorption which increases the risk of groundwater contamination dages et al 2015 pot et al 2005 vanderborght et al 2002 however the vicinity of root channels which are major conducting macropores might be enriched in specific soil organic carbon and microbial biomass enhancing sorption and degradation potentials efficiency of agroforestry buffer zones depend on a balance of these mechanisms the magnitude of water and pesticide infiltration fluxes is assumed to be mainly dependent on vegetation type because of contrasted root biomass distribution along the soil profile lin et al 2011 schultz et al 1995 diverse composition of soil organic carbon and microbial activities chu et al 2013 lin et al 2004 2010 and differing soil structure and moisture modification anderson et al 2008 sahin et al

rodríguez cruz et al 2012 water and pesticide transport and retention in the root zone of a few herbaceous species have been evaluated and compared belden and coats 2009 lin et al 2004 2011 but there is to our knowledge no study investigating the influence of temperate agroforestry species on those mechanisms accordingly the objectives of this study were i to compare the influence of popular agroforestry buffer trees and herbaceous species on the mechanisms of water and herbicide fluxes and ii to compare soil textural chemical and sorption properties between the bulk soil and rhizosphere of the tested species in order to isolate the effect of the plant species from pedo climatic effects that can be locally highly variable and difficult to monitor precisely we chose to implement a large microcosm approach the water and herbicide infiltration parameters obtained from microcosm approaches might not be directly transferable to all field situations however the differential in water and herbicide infiltration parameters measured between microcosms planted with various species indicates if a given species has the ability to increase or decrease the hydraulic conductivity or herbicide sorption in the root influenced zone this information is useful for designing agroforestry buffers with optimized herbicide mitigation capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 microcosm design five treatments consisting of large 25 4 cm diameter 30 cm height packed soil columns were designed three treatments were planted each with a respective tree species 1 treatment was planted with an herbaceous species and the final treatment remained un vegetated each treatment was established in triplicate for a total of 15 columns 2 1 1 plant species the herbaceous species selected was smooth brome grass bromus sp a cold season grass widely used in agroforestry buffers strips because of its great performance under shade lin et al 2004 2007 smooth brome grass seeds were purchased from stock seed farm murdock nebraska usa the tree species selected were poplar populus sp oak quercus sp and walnut juglans sp poplar tree is probably the most popular tree species in agroforestry buffer design caron et al 2010a b chu et al 2010 this fast growing species is used all over the world in diverse agroforestry systems oak and walnut trees are also widely used cardinael et al 2015 garrett et al 1991 pinto correia et al 2011 pin oak quercus palustris and black walnut juglans nigra are species well acclimated to the midwestern usa and often locally grown in agroforestry systems bare root dormant tree seedlings 30 to 40 cm tall were used to establish the tree buffer microcosms hybrid poplar seedlings populus deltoides populus nigra were purchased from the arbor day foundation nursery lincoln nebraska usa pin oak and black walnut seedlings were purchased from the cold stream farm nursery michigan usa 2 1 2 soil collection and columns preparation the soil used to build the buffer microcosms was sampled in a permanent prairie plot at the horticulture and agroforestry research center in new franklin missouri usa 39 0 2 nord 92 46 west the plot has no history of pesticide or herbicide use the soil at the site is a menfro silt loam fine silty mixed superactive mesic typic hapludalf udawatta et al 2010 about 350 kg soil was collected from the upper organic matter rich horizon 0 30 cm depth the soil was stored in a walk in growth chamber where it was air dried at 30 c then sieved at 2 mm pvc cylinders 25 4 cm id and 30 cm length were sealed at the bottom with a pvc sheet and packed with the dry sieved soil at a 1 2 g cm 3 density to ensure the homogeneity of the soil density over the column s height the columns were packed progressively by 1 cm layer increments for each layer the mass of soil required to reach a density of 1 2 g cm 3 was precisely weighed then homogeneously spread over the surface and manually compacted to reach 1 cm height for the un vegetated controls and smooth brome grass microcosms the columns were packed directly at the final height of 23 cm the soil in the columns was humidified with a rainfall simulator to reach 50 of the water holding capacity and for the brome grass treatment 10 seeds per columns were dispersed to the surface and gently buried at 1 2 mm depth the columns were covered with aluminum foil for 10 days until the seeds germinated for the tree treatments the columns were first packed by 1 cm increments as described earlier over a height of 8 cm each seedling previously soaked in clear tap water to remove the hydroponic gel from the roots was positioned in a column so that the taproot was centered and the collar positioned at 23 cm above the bottom of the column the lateral roots were distributed around the tap root and maintained in their natural orientation while packing the columns as previously described to reach a final height of 23 cm at a 1 2 g cm 3 density the natural architecture of the root system was thus preserved and the soil density was homogeneous along the column the soil was then humidified to reach 50 of the water holding capacity as previously described 2 1 3 vegetation growth period after the tree seedlings were planted and the brome grass was seeded all of the microcosms were incubated for 4 months in a walk in environmental growth chamber environmental growth chambers gc72 walk in unit chagrin falls ohio under constant and controlled climatic conditions during the growth period a 12 h day and 12 h night cycle was imposed during the day the temperature was set to 25 c humidity to 25 and the total light intensity was 3 95 105 lm composed of 97 fluorescent light and 3 halogen lights providing the blue and red light range for plant growth respectively during the night the temperature was set to 19 c humidity to 40 and the complete darkness was maintained irrigation was designed to simulate rainfall events with cumulative amount intensity and frequency representative of the mid missourian climate each microcosm received a cumulated amount of 100 mm month which corresponds to the average monthly rainfall over the april to august period two major rainfall events of 10 mm each and a minor event of 5 mm were performed weekly all of the microcosms including the un vegetated ones were subjected to the same climatic conditions for 4 months at the end of the growth period 2 out of 3 trees of each treatment had grown well thereby the infiltration experiments were conducted in duplicates for all of the treatments 2 2 characterization of the water and solute infiltration fluxes 2 2 1 selected herbicide and conservative tracer bromide was selected as a conservative tracer to characterize the hydrodynamic properties in the microcosms because it rarely sorbs to soil particles and is only present as trace element in the environment flury and wai 2003 s metolachlor was selected as a model herbicide to characterize the transfer and retention mechanisms s metolachlor is from the chloroacetamide family is hydrophobic log kow 3 05 it s water solubility is relatively low 480 mg l 1 its soil sorption affinity is moderate and it s degradation half life in soil varies between 15 and 92 days ppdb 2018 s metolachlor is widely used across the world for selective weeding in a variety of crops including maize rapeseed cotton etc e g o connell et al 1998 being moderately sorbed by soils and despite a relatively low persistence a few weeks this compound is classified as moderately mobile ppdb 2018 indeed it has been frequently detected in surface and groundwater in the usa and eu e g toccalino et al 2014 2 2 2 transport experiments for the transport experiments the pvc sheets at the bottom of the columns were replaced by metal with 3 to 4 mm pore size to prevent soil loss without restricting the water flow in the columns columns were progressively saturated by capillarity rise 48 h prior to the infiltration experiments to minimize trapping of gas bubbles in the soil pores bromide tracer experiments were performed in duplicates and s metolachlor transport experiments on a single series two series of infiltration experiment were thus performed the first evaluating only bromide transport and the second both bromide and s metolachlor transport the injection solutions used for the first series of displacement experiments contained 500 mg l 1 of bromide br this series was performed on a set of columns including one from each treatment control ci smooth brome grass bgi black walnut bwi pin oak oi and poplar pi the injection solution used for the second series of transport experiments contained 500 mg l 1 bromide and 300 μg l 1 s metolachlor this series was performed on a second set of columns including the second replicate from each treatment control cii smooth brome grass bgii black walnut bwii pin oak oii and poplar pii thereby the bromide transport experiments were performed in duplicates while the s metolachlor transport experiments were performed only once for each treatment indeed one series had to remain uncontaminated by s metolachlor for further characterization of the textural chemical and sorption properties see section 2 3 at the beginning of the transport experiments the saturated columns were manually ponded with a 10 mm water height of the injection solution the water height was maintained constant during the infiltration by adjusting the supply of the injection solution a total volume of 118 mm 6000 cm3 of solution was supplied to each column among the 10 columns the pore volumes ranged from 119 6030 cm3 to 129 6537 cm3 mm as estimated with pedotransfer functions from the density and volume of the soil cylinders schaap et al 2001 therefore the volume of tracer solution supplied during the displacement experiment was always approximately equal or slightly lower than the column pore volume when the solution supply stopped the decrease in water head was monitored during the remaining period of ponded water infiltration just after all the ponded solution had infiltrated the columns were ponded again with a constant head of 10 mm tracer free water and the columns were eluted with 118 mm of degassed tap water following the same procedure during the infiltration and elution periods 100 ml fractions of the effluents were collected in polypropylene pp containers at the outlets of the columns the sampling frequency varied from 50 s to about 2 min depending on the columns drainage rate the outlet flowrates were monitored using the timing of sample collection and the measured weights the recovery of each solute was calculated by dividing the mass of the solute collected in the effluent by the mass injected cout cin belden and coats 2009 dollinger et al 2018 2 2 3 determination of the hydrodynamic properties by inverse modelling as described in dollinger et al 2018 the bromide tracer experiments were simulated using hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 šimůnek et al 2003 that solves the richards and convection dispersion equations the classical formalism of the richards equation assuming homogeneous flow pathways and the dual permeability model considering two mobile compartments a fast macroporal compartment and the slow matrix were successively used to simulate the experiments although the single porosity model gave acceptable results for most columns fig s1 and s2 the dual permeability model was more effective for all of the columns fig s3 and s4 and was thus used to determine the hydrodynamic properties equations of the dual permeability model are briefly described in the supplementary material eq s1a and s1b for more details on the equilibrium and non equilibrium formalisms please refer to šimůnek et al 2008 or köhne et al 2009 the water retention curve θ h and the unsaturated hydraulic function k h are defined for both compartments using the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 k h is described as the product of the relative hydraulic conductivity function kr dimensionless and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks l t 1 the transport equations associated with dual permeability formulation for water flow eq s2a to s2c are based on the classical convection dispersion equation for both the fast compartment and the slow compartment completed with an exchange term between the two compartments šimůnek et al 2008 köhne et al 2009 an inverse modelling approach was implemented to reproduce both the bromide breakthrough curves and percolation outfluxes of the 2 series of transport experiments the 0 23 m soil profiles were densely discretized with 150 nodes to facilitate numerical convergence an initial hydrostatic equilibrium with a zero pressure was considered and a variable head corresponding to the water level fluctuation at the top of the soil column was imposed as top boundary condition the eight following parameters were fitted against total soil column porosity cumulative water outflows heights and bromide concentrations at the outlet of the soil column θr m θs m θs f ks m ks f ω disp m disp f with θs and θr respectively the saturated and residual soil water content and disp the dispersion coefficient l to avoid local minimum the stability of the fitted parameter set estimated was evaluated using different sets of initial parameters including the estimated sets themselves the other hydrodynamic parameters were set according to their textural composition and their bulk density using rosetta schaap et al 2001 except θr f that was set to zero the bromide diffusion coefficient was fixed to 2 10 9 m2 s 1 köhne et al 2006 2 2 4 modelling of the s metolachlor breakthrough curves to simulate the breakthrough curves of s metolachlor we used the dual permeability formalism for the water flow coupled to the convection dispersion equation for the solute transport with an additional term for sorption we assumed the degradation processes to be negligible given the short duration of the experiments varying between 2 and 6 h compared to the half life of 15 to 92 days of this molecule section 2 2 1 a linear sorption equilibrium model with no desorption hysteresis was considered first we used the sorption coefficients measured in the batch studies section 2 3 2 we implemented in the model the rhizosphere sorption coefficient for the macroporal compartment and the bulk sorption coefficient for the slow matrix compartment then to account for potential reduced sorption mechanisms that might occur especially in the macroporal compartment due to reduced contact duration we implemented an inverse modelling approach therefore the sorption coefficients kdf and kdm were fitted against the s metolachlor breakthrough curves the retardation factors schaffer and licha 2015 were calculated for both the matrix and macroporal compartments for the 2 sets of sorption coefficients measured and optimized 2 3 measurement of the physico chemical and sorption properties in the rhizosphere and bulk soil from the different microcosms 2 3 1 soil sampling and analysis soil from the first series that did not receive s metolachlor during the transport experiment was collected from each treatment ci bgi bwi oi and pi for the vegetated treatments bulk and rhizosphere soil were collected separately rhizosphere soil was defined as soil attached to the root system to sample the rhizosphere soil roots were gently shaken to remove un attached particles then brushed to collect the attached fraction bulk soil was collected in areas not or poorly colonized by roots very fine roots diameter 1 mm had colonized most of the soil profiles in the vegetated treatments so the bulk soil collected aren t totally un affected by the root systems we hypothesized that the bulk and rhizosphere soils were homogeneous along the soil profile of a given column as the columns were packed with homogeneous soil the soil samples were then sieved at 2 mm and sent to the soil and plant testing laboratory at the university of missouri for analysis of texture ph organic matter content om and cationic exchange capacity cec after soil sampling the root and aerial biomass from the ci bgi bwi oi and pi treatments were separately collected and oven dried at 105 c for 24 h 2 3 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption parameters were measured according to a procedure adapted from the oecd guideline 106 oecd 2000 with equilibrium conditions and solid to liquid ratio chosen to mimic the soil solution conditions as much as possible given the analytical constraints prior to the experiments the sieved soils were air dried to a target humidity of 10 which was precisely measured by oven drying at 105 c for 24 h then 4 ml of the s metolachlor solutions with concentration ranging from 50 to 1000 μg l 1 50 100 250 500 and 1000 μg l 1 prepared in an electrolyte solution composed of cacl2 0 01 m and nan3 200 mg l 1 were equilibrated with 2 g of soil in polypropylen pp centrifuge tubes cacl2 was added in the electrolyte solution to minimize the soil aggregate breakdown and nan3 to prevent microbial degradation during the incubation periods the tubes were equilibrated for 48 h without shaking and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min aliquots of the supernatants were collected and filtered at 0 2 μm prior to s metolachlor analysis s metolachlor concentration in soils was assessed by mass balance between initial and equilibrium concentrations both linear eq 1a and freundlich models eq 1b were fitted to the experimental data 1a cs kd cw 1b cs kf cw n where cs is the amount of sorbed pesticides in the soil at equilibrium μg kg 1 cw is the equilibrium concentration in the supernatant μg l 1 kd is the linear sorption coefficient l kg 1 kf μg 1 n ln kg 1 and n are the freundlich coefficients with n the non linearity parameter of the freundlich model adsorption of s metolachlor to the pp tubes and membrane filters were evaluated before the sorption experiments and found to be negligible all of the batch experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 4 chemical analyses bromide was quantified in the leachate samples using an ion specific electrode hanna instruments hi4102 usa a previous study has proven the accuracy of this electrode when compared to ionic chromatography dollinger et al 2018 for the measurement 15 ml sample aliquots were mixed with 500 μl of the hi4000 00 reactive solution hanna instruments usa and stirred for 2 min before the electrode measurement the limit of quantification of this method was 1 mg l 1 the quantification of s metolachlor was performed using a waters acquity tq triple quadrupole mass spectrometer waters usa with an electrospray ionization interface operated in positive mode esi coupled to a waters alliance 2695 hplc system waters usa the separation was performed at 40 c on a 4 6 id and 100 mm length c18 column kinetex under gradient mode the 2 solvents constituting the mobile phase were acetonitrile a and milliq h2o with 10 mm ammonium acetate and 0 1 formic acid b the gradient was initiated with 2 of a and 98 b for 0 3 min then the relative proportion of solvent a was risen from 2 to 80 between 0 3 and 7 27 min risen again from 80 to 98 between 7 27 and 7 37 then maintained until 9 min run between 9 and 10 min run the relative proportion of a was lowered from 98 to 2 than maintained until the end of the 15 min run the flowrate of the mobile phase was 0 5 ml min 1 all along the run the data acquisition was performed with the multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode by monitoring the dissociation of the m z 284 precursor ion to the m z 252 product ions for a cone voltage and a collision energy of 30 and 16 v respectively prior to the analysis all of the samples were filtered at 0 2 μm on inorganic membrane filters whatman anotop 10 the limit of quantification was 0 05 μg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 root system architecture and plant growth at the end of the 4 months growth period the plants of the vegetated microcosms had grown well in two replicates out of the three initially established the aerial biomass structure and height was visually very similar among the two replicates for a given species exception made of the poplar trees the two poplar trees revealed to be different hybrids the pi hybrid had triangle leaves shape and dark red shoots while the pii hybrid had more elongated leaves shape and green shoots the pii hybrid was also taller than the pi hybrid the height of the three tree species had almost doubled during the growth period and the collar circumference reached 3 3 to 3 6 cm the global biomass recorded was from far the greatest for brome grass followed by poplar trees fig 1 oak and walnut trees had equivalent biomasses which were lower than those of poplar trees for all species the root biomass was 2 to 10 times greater than the aerial biomass the smooth brome grass had developed a very dense root system that had colonized the entire column profile with similar densities at the different depths the root development didn t seem to be constrained by the cylinder wall the roots had all similar diameters about 1 mm and were greatly interwoven with no dominant orientation angle for the tree species the architecture of the root system didn t evolve much during the 4 months growth fig 2 the end part of the tape roots from the oak and black walnut seedlings had degenerated and few lateral roots were created but the diameter of tape roots and lateral roots almost doubled in addition branching from the lateral roots had generated a dense network of very fine roots 1 mm diameter the structure of the black walnut root system was characterized by a large tap root and 10 20 large lateral roots evenly distributed along the tape root with orientation angles varying from 40 to 60 from the tape root axis and a dense fine to very fine root system the root system architecture was rather similar for oak trees but the lateral roots were more horizontal the tape root and lateral roots were also finer than those from the black walnut seedlings lateral roots elongation was also not constrained by the cylinder walls for both species the architecture of the poplar root systems was greatly contrasted few lateral roots were generated at the high end of the tape root but most of them were located at the bottom end the lateral roots elongation was greatly constrained by the cylinder size so when the roots reached the walls new branching were created and those branched roots circled several times the soil cylinder at the edge with the pvc walls thereby contrastingly with the other tree species the root density was very high on the edges and low in the center of the soil profile root system architecture is dependent on the soil compaction heterogeneity contrasted water and nutrient availability but also on the slope of the plot the wind and other climatic conditions di iorio et al 2005 hodge et al 2009 pregitzer et al 2002 zanetti et al 2015 the homogeneous soil density humidity and nutrient availability provided by the microcosms allows almost un constraint development of the root systems only the size of the cylinders could constrain the natural development of the lateral root as observed for the poplar trees fig 2 the root systems architecture from the plant grown in the large microcosms should not differ much from those of the same species established in field buffers with low constraint level environments like some riparian buffers with shallow water table collecting runoff loaded with nutrients from surrounding crop plots under more constrained field conditions like some alley cropping systems the morphology of the root system could differ according to the pedo climatic factors malamy 2005 3 2 influence of plant species on water and solutes infiltration fluxes the bromide breakthrough curves and outflow patterns monitored during the infiltration experiments allow comparing the water fluxes and hydrodynamic properties between the different treatments the bromide breakthrough curves were relatively well repeatable between the duplicates of the smooth brome grass black walnut and oak treatments fig 3 for those treatments the outflow patterns were also similar and constant between the injection and elution phases fig 3 for the poplar treatment the outflow was greater for the second replicate pii the bromide concentration rise was sharper during the injection phase and the concentration dropped faster during the elution phase which resulted in an earlier bromide peak this could be either due to the fact that the 2 poplar hybrids had different phenotypical characteristics or to the fact that roots had circled the soil profile and may have induced contrasted sidewall flow paths in both replicates section 3 1 the patterns also greatly differed between the 2 replicates of the control treatment with an outflow 2 times greater for the first replicate accompanied by an accelerated bromide transport the outflow decreased for the ci replicate all along the infiltration experiment being un vegetated the controls had lower evaporation rates during the growth period and a biological crust composed of algae and moss formed at the surface of the columns this poorly permeable crust covered almost the entire surface of the cii replicate but only half of it for the ci replicate which could explain the different patterns moreover desiccation cracks that formed between the irrigation events at the early stage of the growth periods were set by these crusts under field condition soils un protected by vegetation and especially soils with high silt and clay contents are also exposed to crusting and to the formation of drying cracks that modify the infiltration rates e g chamizo et al 2012 dunne et al 1991 eldridge et al 2000 despite some significant variability between the control and poplar replicates contrasted patterns of hydrodynamic properties between the treatments could be highlighted table 1 the macroporal flow contribution to the global outflow was found to be higher for the vegetated treatments than for the un vegetated controls exception made of the pii microcosms for the un vegetated treatments the macroporal fraction of the soil porosity ω was significant but the hydraulic conductivity and dispersion of the macroporal compartment were only slightly greater than those of the matrix compartment the high hydraulic conductivity and dispersion in both compartments resulted in the fast leaching of bromide with concentration greater than the lod measured already in the first collected samples contrastingly the hydraulic conductivity and dispersion of the matrix compartment were significantly lower in the vegetated treatment while those of the macroporal compartment were equivalent to those of the un vegetated treatments accordingly the overall hydraulic conductivities were reduced and the transport of bromide was slower the breakthrough time reached up to 18 min in the oak treatments the greatest global ksat were recorded for the control and poplar treatments and the lowest for the smooth brome grass and oak treatments black walnut treatments had intermediate ksat the hydraulic conductivity conditions the amount of water infiltrated during a runoff event thereby among the different plant species tested poplar trees would be the most efficient in reducing overland flow followed by black walnut then oak trees and smooth brome grass for most of the treatments s metolachlor transport had patterns contrasting with those of bromide fig 4 for the control treatment s metolachlor breakthrough was not significantly delayed compared to bromide but the concentration rise during the injection phase was slower however the concentration drop during the elution phase was similar to that of bromide for this cii treatment the bromide recovery was about 10 greater than that of s metolachlor at the end of the transport experiment but the model extrapolation suggests a 2 difference after eluting with 10 pore volumes table 2 as the transport pattern of s metolachlor was measured on the cii replicate having the slowest ksat it represents the best case scenario for the brome grass treatment s metolachlor breakthrough was slightly delayed compared to bromide the concentration rise during the injection phase was slower and so was the concentration drop during the elution phase fig 4 a second small peak for both bromide and s metolachlor was observed fig 4 this second peak corresponds to the fraction of the solute fluxes transported in the slow matrix compartment for the other treatments only the peak corresponding to the fraction of solutes transported through the fracture was observed and the second peak was probably too low to be distinguished as suggested by the greater macroporal fractions in these cases table 1 as for the control the difference in recovery rate between bromide and s metolachlor was about 10 at the end of the experiment for the brome grass treatment but the values simulated for an elution period of 10 pore volumes were equal contrastingly for the black walnut and oak treatments the s metolachlor breakthrough was so delayed that the concentration didn t even started to drop during the elution phase fig 4 the difference in recovery rates between bromide and s metolahclor reached 30 for those treatments at the end of the experiment and was still of 10 after a simulated elution period of 10 pore volumes last for the poplar treatment the bromide and s metolachlor breakthrough curves were relatively similar for the first part of the curve and except for a slightly faster concentration drop during the elution phase for s metolachlor fig 4 accordingly the difference in recovery rates between bromide and s metolachlor was only 5 at the end of the experiment for the poplar treatment s metolachlor transport was assessed on the pii replicate having the greatest ksat thereby it represents the worst case scenario except for the poplar treatment the direct implementation in the model of the kd measured in the batch experiments allowed rather good reproduction of the s metolachlor breakthrough curves fig 4 however the optimization of the sorption parameters improved the predictions especially for the control brome grass and poplar treatments fig 4 and table 2 therefore the extrapolation of the s metolachlor recovery rates to 10 pore volumes was calculated using the optimized sorption coefficients in the transport model section 2 2 4 except for the poplar treatment the very large confidence interval on the optimized kd for the matrix compartments up to 103 suggest that this parameter is not sensitive this is in accordance with the great contribution of the macroporal flow table 1 and the fast s metolachlor breakthrough fig 3 the kd measured for the bulk fraction were thereby used to parameterize the matrix compartment of the control smooth brome grass black walnut and oak treatments the kd optimized for the fracture compartment differed from the kd values measured for the rhizosphere soils and this parameter was sensitive for all treatments for the poplar treatment the optimized kd values were zero for both compartments accordingly s metolachlor was not retarded compared to bromide the optimized kd for the black walnut and oak treatments were the highest resulting in overall high retardation factors compared to the control and brome grass treatments table 2 under the studied flooding conditions the risk of groundwater contamination by s metolachlor was the lowest for the black walnut and oak treatments followed by the brome grass and the un vegetated treatment the poplar treatment recorded the highest contamination risk among all treatments more generally in the case of successive drying wetting cycles as for buffer soils submitted to successions of flood events retardation of herbicides gives a chance for degradation processes to take place and may also generate non reversible sorption mechanisms therefore as the transport model considered neglects desorption hysteresis and degradation processes the extrapolation of s metolachlor breakthrough to 10 pore volumes and more or to a succession of flood events might overestimate the recovery rates 3 3 influence of the root systems on the soil properties the soil analyses of the vegetated microcosms show that the textural and chemical properties and especially the texture class and organic matter content were very similar in the rhizosphere and bulk soils for a given species table 3 however when comparing treatments it appears that the organic matter content was slightly greater in the tree microcosms than in the smooth brome grass and control treatments the smooth brome grass treatment was equivalent in terms of organic matter content to the un vegetated control moreover the texture was slightly finer in the smooth brome grass treatment than in the others and the cec slightly higher in the control and poplar treatments in sum root systems of the different species contrastingly affected the soil textural and chemical properties however this action of the root systems was not restricted to the close vicinity of the root system but extended to most of the profile this might be due to the dense colonization of the soil profiles by the very fine root systems but also to root exudation and diffusion of dissolved organic carbon in the soil columns section 3 1 the sorption of s metolachlor on the rhizosphere and bulk soil from all treatments were best fitted by linear isotherms fig 5 table 3 as many other hydrophobic and non ionic herbicides s metolachlor has a great affinity for the organic matter fraction of soils and its sorption rate is mainly driven by the organic matter content weber et al 2004 accordingly the linear sorption coefficients kd were about 3 times greater for the oak poplar and walnut treatments having greater organic matter content table 3 than for the control and brome grass treatments moreover the difference in kd between the rhizosphere and bulk soils in the vegetated microcosms was negligible table 3 the kd and kf measured are in the range of sorption coefficients reported in the literature for soil with similar properties e g alletto et al 2013 krutz et al 2004 shaner et al 2006 the greater kd in soils from the oak and black walnut treatments could explain along with low hydraulic conductivities the greater retention capacity of s metolachlor except for smooth brome grass the optimized parameters were slightly lower for the macroporal compartment 0 13 0 72 0 77 and 0 00 l kg 1 for c bw o and p respectively than the coefficients measured in the rhizosphere of the different species table 3 which suggests that the higher flow velocities resulted in a reduced contact time for sorption for this compartment for the matrix compartment the optimized sorption coefficients were found to be poorly sensitive in accordance to the limited contribution of the matrix to the global outflow for the poplar treatment the high measured sorption is counterbalanced by faster infiltration which limits the time for equilibrium sorption indeed the estimated sorption coefficients for both compartments are null 4 conclusion designing agroforestry buffers for multipurpose use including herbicide retention is limited by consequent gaps of knowledge concerning the influence of plant species composition on the infiltration of water and herbicides therefore the influence of various tree or herbaceous species commonly used in agroforestry buffers on the water and s metolachlor infiltration fluxes in buffer soil and how these plant species modify the soil textural chemical and sorption properties were tested in large microcosms the results highlight the advantage of introducing wooded species in vegetated buffers indeed for the 3 tree species tested the hydraulic conductivity of the soil was equivalent or significantly higher than that of brome grass which guaranties a greater reduction of overland flow and associated herbicide fluxes for the oak and black walnut this increased infiltration was not associated with greater s metolachlor transport which would have threatened the groundwater quality with a medium hydraulic conductivity low macroporal flow and high s metolachlor retardation black walnut appears to be the most interesting species future research should investigate the transfer mechanisms of different categories of pesticides and under contrasted pedoclimatic contexts this would improve the genericity of the present results and allow designing

1573,the dual porosity structure of peat and the extremely high organic matter content give rise to a complex medium that typically generates prolonged tailing and early 50 concentration breakthrough in the breakthrough curves btcs of chloride cl and other anions untangling whether these observations are due to rate limited physical diffusion into inactive pores chemical adsorption or anion exclusion remains a critical question in peat hydrogeochemistry this study aimed to elucidate whether cl is truly conservative in peat as usually assumed and whether the prolonged tailing and early 50 concentration breakthrough of cl observed is due to diffusion adsorption anion exclusion or a combination of all three the mobile immobile mim dual porosity model was fit to btcs of cl and deuterated water measured on undisturbed cores of the same peat soils and equilibrium cl adsorption batch experiments were conducted adsorption of cl to undecomposed and decomposed peat samples in batch experiments followed freundlich isotherms but did not exhibit any trends with the degree of peat decomposition and sorption became negligible below aqueous cl concentrations of 310 mg l 1 the dispersivity determined by fitting the cl btcs whether assuming adsorption or no adsorption were significantly different than determined by the deuterated water p 0001 however no statistical differences in dispersivity p 27 or immobile water content p 97 was observed between deuterated water and cl when accounting for anion exclusion a higher degree of decomposition significantly increased anion exclusion p 0001 but did not influence the diffusion of either tracer into the immobile porosity contrary to previous assumptions cl is not truly conservative in peat due to anion exclusion and adsorption at higher aqueous concentrations but the overall effect of anion exclusion on transport is likely minimal keywords conservative tracer breakthrough curve equilibrium adsorption pore structure solute transport 1 introduction chloride cl and other monovalent anions e g bromide have been widely used as conservative tracers in field and laboratory scale transport experiments in peat hoag and price 1997 kleimeier et al 2014 kleimeier et al 2017 mccarter et al 2018 ours et al 1997 rezanezhad et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2012 and peatlands baird and gaffney 2000 hoag and price 1995 mccarter et al 2017a mccarter and price 2017 these experiments often display an early arrival of the tracer at one pore volume and a prolonged tailing attributed to diffusion into an immobile pore region mccarter et al 2018 the immobile pore region is thought to consist of the hyaline cells of sphagnum moss in surficial bog peat hoag and price 1997 weber et al 2017 or collapsed and isolated pores in more decomposed peats kleimeier et al 2017 however in other experiments the cl diffusion rate is fast enough to rapidly equilibrate with the immobile pore region resulting in no or limited tailing but consistent early arrival of tracer at one pore volume hoag and price 1997 mccarter et al 2018 hoag and price 1995 first used sodium chloride in a field scale tracer experiment in a peatland and determined that the arrival of the tracer was delayed relative to the average linear groundwater velocity v yet conclusive evidence for physical retardation by solute diffusion into the immobile porosity could not be established as sodium na is highly adsorptive in peat mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2012 the field study of hoag and price 1995 was followed by other laboratory breakthrough curve btc experiments by hoag and price 1997 and ours et al 1997 who observed cl retardation in peat relative to ν and attributed their findings to diffusion of cl into the immobile porosity subsequent work at the field scale further illustrated the retardation of cl in peatlands mccarter and price 2017 the idea that prolonged tailing of cl breakthrough at both field and laboratory scales is solely due to physical retardation that is diffusion into immobile pores has persisted throughout the literature as the most prominent explanation of the observed data in peat kleimeier et al 2017 mccarter and price 2017 mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2012 rezanezhad et al 2016 simhayov et al 2018 the validity of the conservative nature of cl and other anions in peat has recently been questioned caron et al 2015 liu et al 2017 using tritiated water and bromide liu et al 2017 found no difference between the two tracers and attributed the observed prolonged tailing in their experiment to physical retardation processes chiefly diffusion into inactive porosity or flow through a dual permeability medium however liu et al 2017 also noted that given the experimental setup the prolonged tailing could also be due to adsorption of bromide to amine groups or complexation to humic acids boudreau et al 2009 caron et al 2015 or to hydrogen exchange with organic matter in the case of tritiated water sauer et al 2009 schimmelmann 1991 but no evidence for these processes was provided in poor fen peat comprising sphagnum and sedge remains mccarter et al 2018 observed cl adsorption in equilibrium batch experiments with the data following a sigmodal sips isotherm the form of this adsorption isotherm implied that there was essentially no adsorption at low aqueous cl concentrations 500 mg l 1 yet at higher concentrations adsorption affected the aqueous concentration that can result in a prolonged tailing of the measured btc mccarter et al 2018 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 in peat the early breakthrough of anion tracers at one pore volume has been attributed to the presence of a physical immobile porosity however anion exclusion which has been identified in delignified sphagnum russowii cells richter and dainty 1989 could also decrease the total mobile porosity available to anions which may partly explain the observed early breakthrough in peat anion exclusion has been well documented in mineral soil and is typically associated with the small micro pores in clay sediments or a function of water films and small pores in sands and other sediments bresler 1973 gvirtzman and gorelick 1991 james and rubin 1986 rose et al 2009 smith et al 2004 van loon et al 2007 anion exclusion occurs when negatively charged soils with small pore throats prevent the movement of anions into the hydrologically connected pore network typically identified by the early breakthrough of an anion tracer bresler 1973 gvirtzman and gorelick 1991 james and rubin 1986 rose et al 2009 like clay soils which have a large cation exchange capacity due their negative charge appelo and postma 2005 peat and other organic soils are predominately negatively charged andreasson et al 1988 delicato 1996 gogo et al 2010 rippy and nelson 2007 and can have an abundance of small pores especially under increasing decomposition levels gharedaghloo et al 2018 mccarter and price 2014 rezanezhad et al 2010 these conditions may induce anion exclusion in peat which would decrease the time required for cl detection in the effluent similar to the presence of the immobile pore spaces although richter and dainty 1989 observed anion exclusion in delignified sphagnum russowii cells there remains no direct observation of anion exclusion affecting solute transport in peat given the limited and at times contradictory information on cl transport in peat the primary objectives of this research were to elucidate whether the degree of decomposition affects cl transport process and if cl adsorption or anion exclusion significantly alters the determination of hydrophysical parameters derived from btcs to achieve these objectives our experiments were designed to test the following two hypotheses 1 the higher the degree of peat decomposition the higher the cl adsorption because of the increase in specific surface area and 2 adsorption of cl or anion exclusion will induce differences in the btcs of cl and deuterated water through peat deuterium deuterated water hdo is the best conservative tracer of water movement in soils koeniger et al 2010 hence deuterated water btcs are used here as the baseline against which the cl btcs were compared 2 methods bog peat was sampled from a hollow i e between hummocks in the luther marsh wetland conservation area ontario canada 43 54 21 n 80 24 21 w the bog hollow soil profile exhibited a sharp change in peat properties from undecomposed sphagnum moss chiefly s rubellum and s fuscum at the surface to relatively decomposed sphagnum peat at depth and contained relatively few woody roots the organic matter weight fraction was between 0 88 and 0 96 and the organic carbon content varied between 0 43 and 0 47 gharedaghloo 2018 gharedaghloo and price 2017 and gharedaghloo and price 2018 determined that the same peat was hydrophilic and water wet under saturated conditions a first peat monolith 70 50 40 cm 0 40 cm below ground surface bgs was extracted in winter using a chainsaw to penetrate the frozen unsaturated zone and a hand saw to detach the peat monolith from the bottom the monolith was then placed in a plastic bin and transported to the laboratory at the university of waterloo to extract deeper peat 50 80 cm bgs a 20 l plastic bucket 30 cm diameter and 50 cm height with the bottom removed was used to cut a second peat monolith out of the space cleared below the first upper monolith the resulting monolith was placed in another 20 l plastic bucket for transport to the laboratory both upper and lower peat monoliths were placed in a 20 c freezer until sub sampling for experimentation although the freezing and thawing of peat can result in secondary consolidation processes these processes are reversible kennedy and price 2005 moreover this peat has experienced numerous cycles of freeze and that during its development so the implications of freezing the is likely negligible 2 1 equilibrium adsorption batch experiments the peat samples were sorted in three distinct groups based on the degree of decomposition following the von post scale of decomposition von post 1926 and identified as h1 h2 5 15 cm bgs h3 h4 15 30 cm bgs and h7 50 cm bgs herein referred to as h1 h4 and h7 respectively one peat sample 10 10 10 cm of each group were taken from the monoliths and air dried milled horticultural peat premier horticultural peat which has been used as a hydrological control in previous studies mccarter et al 2017b was sieved to 1 mm and used as a control group resulting in a total of four distinct peat types h1 h4 h7 and milled for each of the peat groups two separate batches of triplicates were used in the sorption experiments an individual experiment consisted of 1 g of air dried peat placed in a 60 ml glass bottle with 40 ml of the chloride containing solution and sealed with a teflon cap the solutions were prepared with sodium chloride nacl with cl concentrations of 0 017 0 031 0 10 0 31 0 95 and 1 64 mg ml 1 17 31 100 305 950 and 1640 mg l 1 at ph 7 once the bottles were filled the samples were placed on a rotating wheel and continuously agitated for 48 h which is an adequate time period to reach equilibrium as shown previously boudreau et al 2009 rezanezhad et al 2012 after 48 h the bottles were uncapped and the resulting solutions filtered through 0 2 μm poresize polysulfone filters thermofisher scientific into 10 ml vials for cl concentration analysis by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 3 0 error and 1 6

curve experiments the frozen peat monoliths were sub sampled to obtain six 10 cm long peat cores from the undecomposed 10 20 cm bgs and decomposed layers 60 70 cm bgs the cores were then fitted inside 10 cm high acrylic flow through reactors ftr as described by pallud et al 2007 the key difference with the reactors used by pallud et al 2007 was the greater length 10 cm the increased length to diameter 4 2 cm ratio relative to the original design of pallud et al 2007 produces a more uniform one dimensional flow regime lewis and sjöstrom 2010 and is well above the representative elementary volume of peat see gharedaghloo et al 2018 for further details the btcs were measured directly on the undisturbed peat cores after sampling the peat cores were carefully shaved to fit the inside diameter of the ftr the undecomposed layer comprised h1 to h4 peat while the decomposed layer entirely comprised h7 peat prior to insertion into the acrylic reactors the shaved cores were wrapped in parafilm and heated using a heat gun to shrink wrap the cores to prevent bypassing wall flow at least 5 cm of parafilm was left at the top and bottom of the cores to wrap around the acrylic tube to further prevent any bypassing flow along the ftr wall no adsorption of cl to the parafilm was observed during a 72 h equilibrium batch experiment the samples were then saturated from the bottom for 24 h in milli q water to minimize entrapped air before the endcaps of the ftr were placed on the acrylic tube a polypropylene membrane filter 0 2 μm pore size 50 mm diameter pall life sciences and a fibreglass filter 1 μm pore size 47 mm diameter pall life sciences were placed between the endcaps and sample on each end to equalize flow see pallud et al 2007 for details the ftrs were connected to a peristaltic pump minipuls 3 gilson with equal lengths of tygon tubing and each ftr was individually connected to a 3 way valve each valve was connected to two water sources 1 milli q water to flush the cores and the other a tracer solution of 0 12 mg ml 1 cl nacl and 220 δ2h sigma 99 9 d2o as hdo the δ2h enrichment was far above the 70 δ2h of the milli q water the tracer solution was stored in 10 l tedlar bags to prevent evaporative enrichment over the course of the experiment the cores were first flushed 3 ml h 1 with milli q water for 10 days to purge gas bubbles that may block flow lewis and sjöstrom 2010 after flushing the residual cl concentration in the pore water was 4 3 10 4 mg ml 1 0 43 mg l 1 once purged inflow was instantaneously switched to the tracer solution maintaining a constant flow rate 3 ml h 1 5 2 cm day 1 to begin the btc experiment the inflow was switched back to milli q water after 5 days to capture the flushing of the tracers from the cores three millilitre of effluent of the ftrs were sampled every 5 6 h and immediately filtered through a 0 2 μm pore size polysulfone filter the filtrated outflow samples were each split into two vials the first 1 7 ml was analysed for deuterated water using off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy los gatos research liquid water isotope analyser 45 ep 0 8 0 03 error and the second 1 3 ml was analysed for cl and other common anions concentrations by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 3 0 error and 1 6 precision a zero dead volume blank rajendran et al 2008 was run with just cl as the ftr are inert to cl pallud et al 2007 the experiments were carried out at room temperature 22 2 c once the btc experiment was completed the bulk density ρ of the peat was determined by drying samples at 80 c for 48 h assuming a particle density ρ p of 1 4 g cm 3 redding and devito 2006 the porosity ϕ table 1 was calculated by 2 ϕ 1 ρ ρ p 2 3 breakthrough curve analyses the transport of cl and deuterated water were

individually simulate the cl both with and without adsorption and anion exclusion and deuterated water btcs to better assess the conservative nature of chloride as well as gain a better understanding of the diffusion processes the cl data was additionally fit by fixing the λ and θ im with determined from hdo λ 2h and θ im 2h respectively and assuming anion exclusion herein referred to as cl hdo thus only α mim and kd were fit in this modelling scenario all btcs were normalized to the specific tracer s input concentration for display the transport of solutes in peat is governed by the

is unknown the provided pe s are a more conservative estimate however pe only considers the flow in the θ mo and not the relative importance of the mass transfer into the θ im the damköhler number da gives the relative importance of the diffusion rate into the θ im where 9 da α mim l ν θ mo as α mim increases the da will approach infinity and it is unnecessary to account for diffusion into the θ im as it is assumed to be instantaneous and the convection dispersion equation can be used for parameter estimation vanderborght et al 1997 wehrer and totsche 2005 2 4 statistical analyses the rmse between a simulated average breakthrough curve and the observed breakthrough curve data of each solute deuterated water or cl was computed as 10 rmse i 1 n obs i sim i 2 n 1 2 where obs i is the i th observed point sim i is the corresponding simulated concentration and n is the number of measured points additionally the akaike information criterion aic was calculated for all btcs to further compare tracers and modelling scenarios 11 aic 2 k 2 ln l where k is the number of estimated parameters and l is the maximum value of the likelihood function akaike 1974 to further determine whether there were significant differences between the hydrophysical parameters λ θ im θ mo θ eff d mo and v mo v eff determined using deuterated water cl with and without adsorption cl with anion exclusion a mixed effect model for each parameter was generated in r statistical software r development core team 2018 using the distributions determined from the global searches using the lmer function in the lme4 package bates et al 2015 pinheiro et al 2018 when assuming anion exclusion the θ eff and v eff were used in place of θ mo and v mo the mixed effect model for each parameter was compared individually to the different parameter fitting assumptions i e deuterated water cl with adsorption and cl without adsorption with the sample id nested within the sample depth i e the decomposition level the least squares means were estimated with the lmer function in the lme4 package bates et al 2015 and statistical significance of each interaction was determined using a contrasting pair wise comparison with tukey adjustment using the lsmean function in the lsmean package lenth 2016 to determine the effect the degree of decomposition had on the diffusion rate into the immobile pore space and anion exclusion the observed cl data were fit to the mim model using λ 2h and θ im 2h thus only α mim and kd were fit cl hdo to assess the relative differences between the two tracers and the undecomposed and decomposed peat a general linear model was developed using the distributions determined from the global searches where α mim was dependent on both decomposition level and tracer hdo or cl hdo with an intercept equal to zero a second general linear model was constructed to assess the influence of peat decomposition level on anion exclusion r and ϕ ex where r and ϕ ex were dependent on decomposition level of the cl hdo results the statistical significance of each interaction was determined using a contrasting pair wise comparison with tukey adjustment in the lsmean

concentration dependent cl adsorption was apparent at concentrations 305 mg l 1 0 31 mg ml 1 where the local slope of the isotherm was 0 below this threshold adsorption was negligible and the local slope of the isotherm approached 0 fig 1 the k f values ranged between 0 33 and 61 3 mg1 n g 1 ml n no consistent trend between k f and the degree of decomposition was observed similarly the n parameter did not systematically vary with degree of decomposition and was typically observed to be near or above 1 except for sample h7 1 table 2 only the h4 and milled peat yielded similar near linear isotherms for the two individual sample batches over the concentration range tested however for replicates within a given batch e g batch 1 of h1 peat the observed averages were close fig 1 and the resultant rmse were acceptable table 2 given the magnitude of the reported rmse 0 19 15 50 mg g 1 table 2 the 17 mg l 1 0 017 mg ml 1 results in all samples were not reliable i e the confidence intervals c i were of the same magnitude as the measured values and hence excluded from the analysis and not presented no release of other anions fluoride nitrite nitrate sulphate bromide or phosphate was observed 3 2 breakthrough curve experiments the modelled deuterated water btcs were in good agreement with the measured values resulting in low rmse 0 021 0 050 table 3 with little data scatter fig 2 this resulted in small c i s for λ 2h and θ im 2h for all peat cores there was a general increase in θ im 2h and λ 2h with a higher degree of decomposition while no apparent trend in α mim 2h was observed table 3 similar trends were observed for the parameters obtained with cl btcs table 4 table s2 table s3 regardless of tracer or model choice the fitted θ im agreed extremely well with the measured drainable porosity at 100 mb and only when accounting for the ϕ ex was a notable difference in θ eff observed fig 3 overall the effluent concentrations of cl exhibited more scatter than those of deuterated water fig 2 resulting in higher rmse and aic nevertheless the cl model fits were still in good agreement with the data regardless of cl model choice tables 4 s2 and s3 slightly lower rmse were observed when not including adsorption but all cl btc models performed worse than that of deuterated water typically the aic was lowest when assuming anion exclusion but the difference between all cl models were 10 tables 4 s2 and s3 for the cl models the lowest rmses were observed when assuming anion exclusion tables 4 s2 and s3 the fitted freundlich parameters determined from the cl model with adsorption were similar across all btcs displaying strong non linearity i e n mim 10 as well as large c i s table s3 the freundlich isotherm coefficients k f mim varied between 1 3 and 3 2 mg1 n g 1 mln table s3 although these values were within the large range determined in the adsorption batch experiments 0 33 61 25 mg1 n g 1 mln table 2 the corresponding n mim values table s3 were generally much greater than those determined in the equilibrium batch experiments table 2 however both the rmse and aic of the adsorption models were typically greater than other 2 cl models although the btcs were very similar between cl and deuterated water there were differences in the physical e g λ θ im θ mo and flow e g d mo dependent parameters depending on the model deuterated water cl with and without adsorption and anion exclusion used to derive the parameters fig 4 when simulated with and without adsorption the estimated dispersivity values λ and d mo were statistically different p 0001 between deuterated water and cl however the θ im and θ mo values were not statistically different table 5 the average estimated λ using cl was 2 3 and 2 4 larger than that estimated with deuterated water without and with adsorption respectively however when accounting for anion exclusion processes cl ae the estimated λ d mo θ im and v eff were not significantly different from those determined by deuterated water but the θ eff was significantly lower table 5 however the estimated θ mo note θ mo θ eff ϕ ex assuming anion exclusion agreed well with deuterated water and the measured drainable porosity not shown the random effects accounted for 41 38 29 24 and 36 of the model variation for λ d mo θ im θ mo and v mo respectively the resultant least square means can be found in supplementary information table s4 3 3 anion exclusion and diffusion of hdo and cl given the similarity of estimated hydrophysical parameters when accounting for anion exclusion the cl data were fit using λ 2h and θ im 2h to limit variability between models and assess the validity of anion exclusion assumptions this dual tracer technique allows for the better estimation of the effect of the degree of decomposition on diffusion into the inactive porosity and anion exclusion cl hdo effects without assuming anion exclusion the modelled cl simulation was unable to fit the observed data under the same hydrophysical conditions fig 5 and table s5 anion exclusion significantly increased with the degree of decomposition p 0001 where the least square mean r values were 0 95 and 0 87 for undecomposed and decomposed peat respectively additionally the ϕ ex significantly increased with degree of decomposition p 0001 the pe for deuterated water was well above 10 table 3 indicating that advective flow was dominant and that diffusion in the θ mo was insignificant contrary to diffusion in the θ mo diffusion into the θ im was an important process to consider as the da cl hdo were between 1 5 and 30 4 and 0 9 32 2 for deuterated water and cl hdo respectively the fitted cl hdo resulted in similar or slightly lower rmses relative to the cl ae and cl while typically much lower aic due to the lower number of fitted parameters table 6 the diffusion of both deuterated water and cl were significantly different depending on the degree of decomposition but were not different between deuterated water and cl within a degree of decomposition table 7 the differences in α mim values resulted in a ratio between α mim 2h and α mim cl hdo of 0 74 and 0 84 for undecomposed and decomposed peat respectively table 8 these ratios were similar to the ratio between the free water diffusion coefficients of deuterated water and cl 0 78 and fell within the 95 c i for both degrees of decomposition however the limited sample numbers preclude further statistical analysis the resultant least square means can be found in supplementary information table s6 4 discussion 4 1 chloride adsorption isotherms the freundlich isotherm parameters vary significantly among the various batches of luther marsh bog peat while isotherms for replicate samples of an individual batch were comparable large differences were observed between batches from the same peat layer in particular for the h1 and h7 peat fig 1 furthermore some peat samples exhibit near linear isotherms n 1 while others do not table 2 mccarter et al 2018 report non linear cl isotherms for undegraded poor fen peat however these authors found a distinct upper limit to cl adsorption which was best described by a sips isotherm limousin et al 2007 sips 1948 in contrast over the concentration range tested here no upper limit is observed for bog peat regardless of the degree of decomposition one potential explanation for the highly variable isotherms is a highly heterogenous distribution of surface area in peat rezanezhad et al 2016 which hinders the preparation of reproducible samples even within a single peat layer limousin et al 2007 the large observed variation in isotherms suggests that a greater number of samples and mass of peat may be required to comment on the ubiquity of cl adsorption in peat nonetheless our results overall do not support an increase in cl adsorption with increased degree of peat decomposition as reported for cations and organic contaminants gharedaghloo 2018 possibly this reflects the different mechanisms governing anion adsorption compared to cations ho and mckay 1999 ho et al 2002 mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2012 and organic molecules cohen et al 1991 gharedaghloo 2018 rutherford et al 1992 whose adsorption chiefly depends on the specific surface area and the chemical properties of the organic matter andreasson et al 1988 further note that the cl isotherms were measured at neutral ph which is higher than found in pore waters of most bog peatlands glaser et al 1997 hayward and clymo 1982 at neutral ph the overall surface charge is thought to be highly negative andreasson et al 1988 delicato 1996 suggesting that having electrostatically bound anions at low pore water ionic strengths is unlikely andreasson et al 1988 however given that the point of zero charge has been observed to be ph 4 and perhaps ph 2 5 for undecomposed sphagnum peat delicato 1996 in the low ph environments of bogs ph 4 the net surface charge would likely remain negative and similar adsorption processes where a threshold cl concentration is required before cl adsorption can occur our results clearly highlight the need for more research into the binding mechanisms of cl and other anions to peat the effect of ph on anion adsorption and the variability of adsorption across different peat types i e sphagnum sedge or wood dominated and degree of decomposition nonetheless taken together the observed adsorption isotherms imply that strictly speaking cl is not an inert solute in peat as is usually assumed our results however also indicate that cl adsorption is very limited at aqueous concentrations below 0 31 mg ml 1 fig 1 thus at sufficiently low concentrations cl should still behave as a conservative transport tracer with regards to anion adsorption this hypothesis is further explored below 4 2 btc parameter estimation chloride versus deuterated water flow through experiments are a powerful approach to characterize key reactive transport properties of porous media chief among these properties is the dispersivity λ whose accurate determination is crucial to reduce uncertainties in other parameter values šimůnek et al 2003 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 relative to cl deuterated water had lower parameter c i s rmse and aic table 3 due to lower data scatter fig 2 suggesting it may be a more reliable tracer when further reactive transport modelling is required however the deuterated water and cl when assuming anion exclusion yield statistically indistinguishable λ θ im and d mo values and slightly lower θ eff confirming the consistency of the inferred physical flow properties of the peat and the validity of using either tracer when assuming cl adsorption to the peat fitting all of the parameters f mo k f mim and n mim derived from the cl btcs resulted in larger c i s table s3 suggestive of poorer parameter identifiability the inferior performance of the cl model with adsorption i e higher rmse and aic indicates that at the inflow concentration used 0 12 mg ml 1 the adsorption of cl was not a dominant process affecting cl transport this result was consistent with the equilibrium adsorption isotherms experiments which in most cases show minimal cl adsorption at aqueous concentrations below 0 31 mg ml 1 fig 1 without the ϕ ex the θ mo agreed very well with the measured drainable porosity at 100 mb fig 3 confirming the validity of using this measured value to fix θ im as suggested by mccarter and price 2017 additionally the small decrease in θ mo due to the ϕ ex table 6 did not significantly affect the flow dependent parameters v mo and d mo table 5 and still fell within 0 1 of the measured drainable porosity at 100 mb ne when not accounting for anion exclusion the estimated λ and d mo were significantly different than those determined using deuterated water table 5 the results of the cl btc modelling indicate that anion exclusion is influencing the transport of cl in peat and should potentially be accounted for if treating cl as a conservative tracer the slightly better fits of simulated concentrations assuming anion exclusion with the observed data and the statistically indistinguishable λ and d mo parameters to those determined by the deuterated water btcs further illustrate that cl is not truly conservative in peat for example when not assuming anion exclusion the cl btc could not be fit to the data when using the λ and θ im determined using deuterated water table s5 while when assuming anion exclusion the observed data were successfully fit using the same parameters fig 5 table 6 therefore in the remaining discussion we will only consider cl assuming anion exclusion using the deuterated water λ and θ im parameters cl hdo table 6 and the deuterated water table 3 btc modelling results 4 3 the role of decomposition on diffusion and anion exclusion in peat using two tracers a more representative estimation of cl diffusion and anion exclusion can be achieved where the deuterated water was used to estimate the λ and θ im and cl to determine α mim cl hdo and kd cl hdo table 6 in both cases da for both hdo and cl hdo between 1 5 and 30 4 and 0 9 32 2 respectively suggest that diffusion into the inactive porosity remains an important process to characterize within this particular peat at the tested flow rates conversely the pe were all well above 10 indicating that in the θ mo θ eff advection was the primary process governing the transport of all solutes and diffusion did not significantly contribute to the flux the mass transfer coefficient of cl α mim cl hdo were typically slightly lower than that of deuterated water α mim 2h which was expected as the free water diffusion coefficient for cl is lower than that for deuterated water appelo and postma 2005 easteal et al 1984 murday and cotts 1970 however the relative difference between α mim cl hdo and α mim 2h were not distinguishable between undecomposed and decomposed samples table 8 the average ratios between α mim values in the undecomposed peat was 0 74 lower than the ratio of the free water diffusion coefficients of deuterated water and cl of 0 78 in contrast the average ratio between α mim values in the decomposed peat was 0 84 table 8 these diffusion ratio s c i s overlapped and encompasses the free water diffusion coefficient suggesting that under these flow conditions changes in the peat pore structure with increasing degree of decomposition did not limit the diffusion rate between the mobile and immobile porosity and that the free water diffusion coefficient of both solutes was the governing transport property recently simhayov et al 2018 illustrated that in degraded and re packed fen peat the mim model was not appropriate because this particular peat visually appeared and behaved as a single porosity media both hydraulically and chemically and the convection dispersion equation could be used in peats with a distinct dual porosity structure the mim model is only relevant when ω is 100 and when this condition is violated the mim model essentially simplifies to the convection dispersion equation simhayov et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2003 šimůnek et al 2008 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 there was large variability in the observed ω parameter for both deuterated water and cl hdo where in three cases ω was near or above 100 tables 3 and 6 suggesting that in these cases the data may be overparameterized and a simpler solute transport model i e the convection dispersion model would suffice however given the wide range of ω and α mim parameters there was no discernable trend to inform when to use a simplified model or the mim given this the mim model was used for all samples to ensure consistency within the study in any case when ω 100 the system is still a dual porosity media but the equilibrium time between the mobile and immobile porosities is rapid enough to treat the entire system as a single porosity medium i e no observable tailing in the btcs thus there are hydrophysical conditions when the mim model may be inappropriate due to overparameterization but it may be appropriate to use the mim model to accurately represent the physical system unless all samples within a given study allow for the use of simpler transport model past studies gharedaghloo 2018 hoag and price 1997 kleimeier et al 2017 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2016 mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2016 simhayov et al 2018 have attributed the early observed breakthrough of chloride to the presence of an immobile porosity structure in the peat while the dual porosity structure in peat is not in question by using two conservative tracers it is apparent that the early arrival of cl cannot be solely accounted for due to the current dual porosity structure concept chloride induced pore dilation may increase the saturated hydraulic conductivity hoag and price 1997 kettridge and binley 2010 mccarter et al 2018 ours et al 1997 by increasing the θ mo comas and slater 2004 however the changes induced by cl interactions with organic functional groups comas and slater 2004 ours et al 1997 would change the media properties and thus influence both tracers equally given the differential response in tracers and the negative charge associated with peat at ph above 4 0 andreasson et al 1988 delicato 1996 there is clear evidence of anion exclusion at both degrees of decomposition whereby incorporating anion exclusion processes resulted in the same hydrophysical parameter estimation as deuterated water table 5 unlike single porosity soils where anion exclusion can be identified by a decrease in λ and θ mo and subsequent increase in d mo gvirtzman and gorelick 1991 james and rubin 1986 van loon et al 2007 the λ cl increased relative to λ 2h in the mim model since θ mo is already represented however a similar result increase in d mo can be achieved in the mim model by increasing λ and keeping θ mo constant see eq 3a and 3b which was typically observed in this study table s2 similar to the traditional method of describing anion exclusion significantly lower θ eff p 0002 was observed when accounting for anion exclusion where r 1 fig 3 table 5 without both tracers it is impossible to determine if anion exclusion is occurring especially in a known dual porosity media furthermore including the flushing curve in the btc experiments which many past studies have not included hoag and price 1997 kleimeier et al 2017 mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2012 highlighted the inability of cl without anion exclusion to accurately describe the hydrophysical transport parameters table s5 and fig 5 only through the combination of the dual tracer approach and investigating the injection and flushing curves was anion exclusion identified in peat if anion exclusion is a ubiquitous process in peat previous estimations of the mim parameters may overestimate the λ as the λ cl table s2 was on average 2 4 larger than that of λ 2h table 3 when fitting θ im which is common in peat transport studies gharedaghloo 2018 kleimeier et al 2017 mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2012 rezanezhad et al 2016 in these cases as well as when fitting v mo mccarter et al 2018 simhayov et al 2018 or r hoag and price 1997 the overall retardation as determined by r is still 1 because the magnitude of anion exclusion is less than the retardation caused by the diffusion into the inactive porosity however when the parameter estimations are completed with fitting r in the convection dispersion equation hoag and price 1997 rather than the mim a more representative parameter estimation of r may be derived as r is the total summation non advective forces acting on the solute in any case given the indistinguishable parameter estimation table 5 between deuterated water table 3 and cl when assuming anion exclusion table 4 and table 6 it is possible to correctly estimate the physical parameters of peat using cl provided that anion exclusion is accounted for unlike α mim where there was no difference with degree of decomposition table 8 the effect of anion exclusion increased p 0001 with degree of decomposition as r was further from unity and ϕ ex was larger with an increased degree of decomposition table 6 this increase in anion exclusion with increased degree of decomposition was likely due to the increasing number of smaller pores carey et al 2007 gharedaghloo 2018 gharedaghloo et al 2018 mccarter and price 2014 quinton et al 2009 where the more abundant small pore throats increased the specific surface area gharedaghloo et al 2018 and the overall increase in negative surface charge with increasing fulvic acid concentration a common feature of increased degree of decomposition led to a decrease in θ eff and increased the effective pore water velocity bratskaya et al 2008 comas and slater 2004 gondar et al 2005a gondar et al 2005b ours et al 1997 rose et al 2009 these results suggest that cl and potentially other anions may undergo anion exclusion resulting in slightly higher effective solute velocities than predicted by a conservative tracer furthermore the observed effect may be enhanced when the peat pore structure and or experimental conditions results in the rapid equilibrium between the θ eff and θ im and limited to no extended tailing is observed such as this study however for cl the overall effect of anion exclusion remained relatively minor and the 2 increase in λ only resulted in a maximum 0 16 decrease in r from unity given the dearth of knowledge regarding peat surface charge further studies are required to better understand the exact mechanisms governing the transport of anions in peat moreover as development in peatland dominated watersheds increases the potential for unintentional contaminant release will increase thus it might be prudent to account for anion exclusion processes depending on the contaminant in any case this study represents the first identification of anion exclusion as a transport process in peat and further studies are required to establish the ubiquity of this process 4 4 implications of tracer choice on solute transport the lower estimated parameter c i s imply that deuterated water btcs yield parameter values with lower overall error the decreased scatter in the observed deuterated water relative to cl may in part reflect the lower analytical error in isotopic 0 3 than chemical 3 0 measurements however the relatively large difference in input concentrations may exaggerate this effect when the larger analytical error of cl is coupled with the apparent non conservative nature of cl in peat whether due to adsorption at higher concentrations or anion exclusion it is recommended to use enriched water isotopes as tracers rather than chemical tracers to avoid these issues however the relative analytical cost and time need to be weighed against the decreased total error for a given experiment especially considering that it is generally prudent to have a greater number of replicates with lower precision than fewer replicates with higher precision graniero 1999 in this study the variability of hydrophysical parameters within a given degree of peat decomposition exceeds the c i s signifying that the spatial variability can be large even among cores sampled within 50 cm of each other in the case of anion exclusion the overall effect is relatively minor as r approaches 1 in many cases and the deviation from 1 did not exceed 0 16 in all undecomposed cores the r values were 0 93 and would have a lesser influence on solute transport than the more decomposed peat with lower r values similarly mccarter et al 2018 observed that cl adsorption did not significantly affect the transport parameters when r 1 07 which is a similar absolute distance away from 1 as the anion exclusion results it is likely that when majority of solute transport occurs in large connected pores such as are common in poorly decomposed peat suitable results can be obtained without including anion exclusion in the fitting routines particularly when only the hydrophysical parameters λ θ im θ mo d mo and α mim are considered however if the goal of the study is to characterize the reactive transport of other solutes where the relative effect size may be small or concentrations low such as trace metals it might be prudent to use enriched water isotope tracers to characterize the flow domain rather than anion tracers to avoid potential complications with anion exclusion or adsorption given the logistical challenges in field scale tracer studies baird and gaffney 2000 balliston et al 2018 hoag and price 1995 mccarter et al 2017a mccarter and price 2017 the importance of appropriate transport model choice liu et al 2017 simhayov et al 2018 and sample variability cl in many instances remains a suitable tracer choice 5 conclusions the dual tracer approach used in this study highlighted that cl is not strictly speaking a conservative non reactive tracer in peat however for the peat soils used here the effect of adsorption was negligible on the btcs obtained with an inflow concentration of 0 12 mg ml 1 anion exclusion processes resulted in significantly different hydrophysical parameter estimation than deuterated water when this process was not accounted for in the fitting routines thus for sufficiently low cl concentrations the transport of cl is indistinguishable from those of deuterated water when anion exclusion processes are considered yet the overall magnitude of the effect of anion exclusion in peat is minor resulting in a maximum deviation of r from unity of 0 16 to our knowledge this is the first instance that anion exclusion has been identified in transport processes in peat but the ubiquity of this process needs to be confirmed on a greater variety of peat types and degrees of decomposition and the specific surface charge of the peat surface needs to be explored this study confirmed that the saturated porosity at 100 mb is equivalent to the θ im and can be fixed in the fitting routines the observed variability within the small sample set used in this study illustrates the need for a greater number of samples and studies on these processes to better characterize transport processes in peat both the btc and batch adsorption experiments imply a high spatial variability of the hydrophysical and adsorptive properties of peat even within layers of a given degree

1573,the dual porosity structure of peat and the extremely high organic matter content give rise to a complex medium that typically generates prolonged tailing and early 50 concentration breakthrough in the breakthrough curves btcs of chloride cl and other anions untangling whether these observations are due to rate limited physical diffusion into inactive pores chemical adsorption or anion exclusion remains a critical question in peat hydrogeochemistry this study aimed to elucidate whether cl is truly conservative in peat as usually assumed and whether the prolonged tailing and early 50 concentration breakthrough of cl observed is due to diffusion adsorption anion exclusion or a combination of all three the mobile immobile mim dual porosity model was fit to btcs of cl and deuterated water measured on undisturbed cores of the same peat soils and equilibrium cl adsorption batch experiments were conducted adsorption of cl to undecomposed and decomposed peat samples in batch experiments followed freundlich isotherms but did not exhibit any trends with the degree of peat decomposition and sorption became negligible below aqueous cl concentrations of 310 mg l 1 the dispersivity determined by fitting the cl btcs whether assuming adsorption or no adsorption were significantly different than determined by the deuterated water p 0001 however no statistical differences in dispersivity p 27 or immobile water content p 97 was observed between deuterated water and cl when accounting for anion exclusion a higher degree of decomposition significantly increased anion exclusion p 0001 but did not influence the diffusion of either tracer into the immobile porosity contrary to previous assumptions cl is not truly conservative in peat due to anion exclusion and adsorption at higher aqueous concentrations but the overall effect of anion exclusion on transport is likely minimal keywords conservative tracer breakthrough curve equilibrium

hoag and price 1995 mccarter et al 2017a mccarter and price 2017 these experiments often display an early arrival of the tracer at one pore volume and a prolonged tailing attributed to diffusion into an immobile pore region mccarter et al 2018 the immobile pore region is thought to consist of the hyaline cells of sphagnum moss in surficial bog peat hoag and price 1997 weber et al 2017 or collapsed and isolated pores in more decomposed peats kleimeier et al 2017 however in other experiments the cl diffusion rate is fast enough to rapidly equilibrate with the immobile pore region resulting in no or limited tailing but consistent early arrival of tracer at one pore volume hoag and price 1997 mccarter et al 2018 hoag and price 1995 first used sodium chloride in a field scale tracer experiment in a peatland and determined that the arrival of the tracer was delayed relative to the average linear groundwater velocity v yet conclusive evidence for physical retardation by solute diffusion into the immobile porosity could not be established as sodium na is highly adsorptive in peat mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2012 the field study of hoag and price 1995 was followed by other laboratory breakthrough curve btc experiments by hoag and price 1997 and ours et al 1997 who observed cl retardation in peat relative to ν and attributed their findings to diffusion of cl into the immobile porosity subsequent work at the field scale further illustrated the retardation of cl in peatlands mccarter and price 2017 the idea that prolonged tailing of cl breakthrough at both field and laboratory scales is solely due to physical retardation that is diffusion into immobile pores has persisted throughout the literature as the most prominent explanation of the observed data in peat kleimeier et al 2017 mccarter and price 2017 mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2012 rezanezhad et al 2016 simhayov et al 2018 the validity of the conservative nature of cl and other anions in peat has recently been questioned caron et al 2015 liu et al 2017 using tritiated water and bromide liu et al 2017 found no difference between the two tracers and attributed the observed prolonged tailing in their experiment to physical retardation processes chiefly diffusion into inactive porosity or flow through a dual permeability medium however liu et al 2017 also noted that given the experimental setup the prolonged tailing could also be due to adsorption of bromide to amine groups or complexation to humic acids boudreau et al 2009 caron et al 2015 or to hydrogen exchange with organic matter in the case of tritiated water sauer et al 2009 schimmelmann 1991 but no evidence for these processes was provided in poor fen peat comprising sphagnum and sedge remains mccarter et al 2018 observed cl adsorption in equilibrium batch experiments with the data following a sigmodal sips isotherm the form of this adsorption isotherm implied that there was essentially no adsorption at low aqueous cl concentrations 500 mg l 1 yet at higher concentrations adsorption affected the aqueous concentration that can result in a prolonged tailing of the measured btc mccarter et al 2018 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 in peat the early breakthrough of anion tracers at one pore volume has been attributed to the presence of a physical immobile porosity however anion exclusion which has been identified in delignified sphagnum russowii cells richter and dainty 1989 could also decrease the total mobile porosity available to anions which may partly explain the observed early breakthrough in peat anion exclusion has been well documented in mineral soil and is typically associated with the small micro pores in clay sediments or a function of water films and small pores in sands and other sediments bresler 1973 gvirtzman and gorelick 1991 james and rubin 1986 rose et al 2009 smith et al 2004 van loon et al 2007 anion exclusion occurs when negatively charged soils with small pore throats prevent the movement of anions into the hydrologically connected pore network typically identified by the early breakthrough of an anion tracer bresler 1973 gvirtzman and gorelick 1991 james and rubin 1986 rose et al 2009 like clay soils which have a large cation exchange capacity due their negative charge appelo and postma 2005 peat and other organic soils are predominately negatively charged andreasson et al 1988 delicato 1996 gogo et al 2010 rippy and nelson 2007 and can have an abundance of small pores especially under increasing decomposition levels gharedaghloo et al 2018 mccarter and price 2014 rezanezhad et al 2010 these conditions may induce anion exclusion in peat which would decrease the time required for cl detection in the effluent similar to the presence of the immobile pore spaces although richter and dainty 1989 observed anion exclusion in delignified sphagnum russowii cells there remains no direct observation of anion exclusion affecting solute transport in peat given the limited and at times contradictory information on cl transport in peat the primary objectives of this research were to elucidate whether the degree of decomposition affects cl transport process and if cl adsorption or anion exclusion significantly alters the determination of hydrophysical parameters derived from btcs to achieve these objectives our experiments were designed to test the following two hypotheses 1 the higher the degree of peat decomposition the higher the cl adsorption because of the increase in specific surface area and 2 adsorption of cl or anion exclusion will induce differences in the btcs of cl and deuterated water through peat deuterium deuterated water hdo is the best conservative tracer of water movement in soils koeniger et al 2010 hence deuterated water btcs are used here as the baseline against which the cl btcs were compared 2 methods bog peat was sampled from a hollow i e between hummocks in the luther marsh wetland conservation area ontario canada 43 54 21 n 80 24 21 w the bog hollow soil profile exhibited a sharp change in peat properties from undecomposed sphagnum moss chiefly s rubellum and s fuscum at the surface to relatively decomposed sphagnum peat at depth and contained relatively few woody roots the organic matter weight fraction was between 0 88 and 0 96 and the organic carbon content varied between 0 43 and 0 47 gharedaghloo 2018 gharedaghloo and price 2017 and gharedaghloo and price 2018 determined that the same peat was hydrophilic and water wet under saturated conditions a first peat monolith 70 50 40 cm 0 40 cm below ground surface bgs was extracted in winter using a chainsaw to penetrate the frozen unsaturated zone and a hand saw to detach the peat monolith from the bottom the monolith was then placed in a plastic bin and transported to the laboratory at the university of waterloo to extract deeper peat 50 80 cm bgs a 20 l plastic bucket 30 cm diameter and 50 cm height with the bottom removed was used to cut a second peat monolith out of the space cleared below the first upper monolith the resulting monolith was placed in another 20 l plastic bucket for transport to the laboratory both upper and lower peat monoliths were placed in a 20 c freezer until sub sampling for experimentation although the freezing and thawing of peat can result in secondary consolidation processes these processes are reversible kennedy and price 2005 moreover this peat has experienced numerous cycles of freeze and that during its development so the implications of freezing the is likely negligible 2 1 equilibrium adsorption batch experiments the peat samples were sorted in three distinct groups based on the degree of decomposition following the von post scale of decomposition von post 1926 and identified as h1 h2 5 15 cm bgs h3 h4 15 30 cm bgs and h7 50 cm bgs herein referred to as h1 h4 and h7 respectively one peat sample 10 10 10 cm of each group were taken from the monoliths and air dried milled horticultural peat premier horticultural peat which has been used as a hydrological control in previous studies mccarter et al 2017b was sieved to 1 mm and used as a control group resulting in a total of four distinct peat types h1 h4 h7 and milled for each of the peat groups two separate batches of triplicates were used in the sorption experiments an individual experiment consisted of 1 g of air dried peat placed in a 60 ml glass bottle with 40 ml of the chloride containing solution and sealed with a teflon cap the solutions were prepared with sodium chloride nacl with cl concentrations of 0 017 0 031 0 10 0 31 0 95 and 1 64 mg ml 1 17 31 100 305 950 and 1640 mg l 1 at ph 7 once the bottles were filled the samples were placed on a rotating wheel and continuously agitated for 48 h which is an adequate time period to reach equilibrium as shown previously boudreau et al 2009 rezanezhad et al 2012 after 48 h the bottles were uncapped and the resulting solutions filtered through 0 2 μm poresize polysulfone filters thermofisher scientific into 10 ml vials for cl concentration analysis by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 3 0 error and 1 6

curve experiments the frozen peat monoliths were sub sampled to obtain six 10 cm long peat cores from the undecomposed 10 20 cm bgs and decomposed layers 60 70 cm bgs the cores were then fitted inside 10 cm high acrylic flow through reactors ftr as described by pallud et al 2007 the key difference with the reactors used by pallud et al 2007 was the greater length 10 cm the increased length to diameter 4 2 cm ratio relative to the original design of pallud et al 2007 produces a more uniform one dimensional flow regime lewis and sjöstrom 2010 and is well above the representative elementary volume of peat see gharedaghloo et al 2018 for further details the btcs were measured directly on the undisturbed peat cores after sampling the peat cores were carefully shaved to fit the inside diameter of the ftr the undecomposed layer comprised h1 to h4 peat while the decomposed layer entirely comprised h7 peat prior to insertion into the acrylic reactors the shaved cores were wrapped in parafilm and heated using a heat gun to shrink wrap the cores to prevent bypassing wall flow at least 5 cm of parafilm was left at the top and bottom of the cores to wrap around the acrylic tube to further prevent any bypassing flow along the ftr wall no adsorption of cl to the parafilm was observed during a 72 h equilibrium batch experiment the samples were then saturated from the bottom for 24 h in milli q water to minimize entrapped air before the endcaps of the ftr were placed on the acrylic tube a polypropylene membrane filter 0 2 μm pore size 50 mm diameter pall life sciences and a fibreglass filter 1 μm pore size 47 mm diameter pall life sciences were placed between the endcaps and sample on each end to equalize flow see pallud et al 2007 for details the ftrs were connected to a peristaltic pump minipuls 3 gilson with equal lengths of tygon tubing and each ftr was individually connected to a 3 way valve each valve was connected to two water sources 1 milli q water to flush the cores and the other a tracer solution of 0 12 mg ml 1 cl nacl and 220 δ2h sigma 99 9 d2o as hdo the δ2h enrichment was far above the 70 δ2h of the milli q water the tracer solution was stored in 10 l tedlar bags to prevent evaporative enrichment over the course of the experiment the cores were first flushed 3 ml h 1 with milli q water for 10 days to purge gas bubbles that may block flow lewis and sjöstrom 2010 after flushing the residual cl concentration in the pore water was 4 3 10 4 mg ml 1 0 43 mg l 1 once purged inflow was instantaneously switched to the tracer solution maintaining a constant flow rate 3 ml h 1 5 2 cm day 1 to begin the btc experiment the inflow was switched back to milli q water after 5 days to capture the flushing of the tracers from the cores three millilitre of effluent of the ftrs were sampled every 5 6 h and immediately filtered through a 0 2 μm pore size polysulfone filter the filtrated outflow samples were each split into two vials the first 1 7 ml was analysed for deuterated water using off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy los gatos research liquid water isotope analyser 45 ep 0 8 0 03 error and the second 1 3 ml was analysed for cl and other common anions concentrations by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 3 0 error and 1 6 precision a zero dead volume blank rajendran et al 2008 was run with just cl as the ftr are inert to cl pallud et al 2007 the experiments were carried out at room temperature 22 2 c once the btc experiment was completed the bulk density ρ of the peat was determined by drying samples at 80 c for 48 h assuming a particle density ρ p of 1 4 g cm 3 redding and devito 2006 the porosity ϕ table 1 was calculated by 2 ϕ 1 ρ ρ p 2 3 breakthrough curve analyses the transport of cl and deuterated water were

4b v mo q mo θ mo where v mo cm day 1 is the average linear groundwater velocity in the mobile region the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient ω was determined as 5 ω α mim l θ mo v mo where l is the column length the liquid flux was simulated using the van genuchten mualem soil water retention and conductivity equation mualem 1976 šimůnek et al 2008 van genuchten 1980 to parameterize richard

the residual water content 0 01 alpha 0 42 cm 1 n 1 31 and l 4 84 determined by mccarter and price 2014 were used total porosity ϕ θ mo θ im and ρ of each soil core were used as known model parameters for each ftr peat core table 1 only the hydrophysical parameters dispersivity λ θ im α mim were fit using deuterated water tracer to investigate the conservative nature of cl as a tracer in peat three different fitting assumptions were tested cl without adsorption cl with adsorption and cl with anion exclusion in hydrus 1d anion exclusion can be simulated by linear partitioning coefficients kd 0 resulting in retardation coefficients r 1 bradford et al 2003 rose et al 2009 šimůnek et al 2003 šimůnek et al 2008 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 note when using the kd to represent anion exclusion the effective v mo increases as the kd is 0 whereas under adsorption the kd decreases the effective v mo bradford et al 2003 rose et al 2009 šimůnek et al 2003 šimůnek et al 2008 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the retardation coefficient was determined by 6a r 1 ρkd θ 6b r v mo θ mo ϕ ex q mo where ϕ ex is the excluded porosity due to anion exclusion since anion exclusion decreases the mobile porosity the effective velocity v eff can be determined by 7a v eff q mo θ eff 7b θ eff θ mo ϕ ex where θ eff is the effective porosity to determine the unknown parameters of the mim model λ θ im α mim f mo the freundlich adsorption model coefficients in hydrus 1d k f mim n mim and kd a global search algorithm was programmed in r statistical software generating 1000 realizations where the lowest 2 n 20 of root mean square errors rmse of each global fit distribution were averaged 95 confidence interval c i and taken as the representative parameters of each core and tracer the unknown parameters were randomized between defined upper and lower bounds assuming a uniform distribution for each parameter table s1 the effective porosity n e was estimated using the drainable porosity at 100 mb measured in a soil moisture equipment corp model 1600 pressure cell mccarter and price 2017 the resulting random values of all parameters were written in the hydrus 1d input file to individually simulate the cl both with and without adsorption and anion exclusion and deuterated water btcs to better assess the conservative nature of chloride as well as gain a better understanding of the diffusion processes the cl data was additionally fit by fixing the λ and θ im with determined from hdo λ 2h and θ im 2h respectively and assuming anion exclusion herein referred to as cl hdo thus only α mim and kd were fit in this modelling scenario all btcs were normalized to the specific tracer s input concentration for display the transport of solutes in peat is governed by the advective and diffusional processes in the θ mo while diffusion governs the transfer of water into out of the θ im however understanding the relative importance of each process is critical to correctly assessing solute transport the peclet number pe illustrates the relative importance of advection or diffusion in the θ mo following huysmans and dassargues 2005 pe was calculated by 8 pe q mo l θ mo d when pe 10 diffusion is negligible to the transport of a given solute in the mobile phase huysmans and dassargues 2005 by using the d rather than the effective diffusion coefficient which is unknown the provided pe s are a more conservative estimate however pe only considers the flow in the θ mo and not the relative importance of the mass transfer into the θ im the damköhler number da gives the relative importance of the diffusion rate into the θ im where 9 da α mim l ν θ mo as α mim increases the da will approach infinity and it is unnecessary to account for diffusion into the θ im as it is assumed to be instantaneous and the convection dispersion equation can be used for parameter estimation vanderborght et al 1997 wehrer and totsche 2005 2 4 statistical analyses the rmse between a simulated average breakthrough curve and the observed breakthrough curve data of each solute deuterated water or cl was computed as 10 rmse i 1 n obs i sim i 2 n 1 2 where obs i is the i th observed point sim i is the corresponding simulated concentration and n is the number of measured points additionally the akaike information criterion aic was calculated for all btcs to further compare tracers and modelling scenarios 11 aic 2 k 2 ln l where k is the number of estimated parameters and l is the maximum value of the likelihood function akaike 1974 to further determine whether there were significant differences between the hydrophysical parameters λ θ im θ mo θ eff d mo and v mo v eff determined using deuterated water cl with and without adsorption cl with anion exclusion a mixed effect model for each parameter was generated in r statistical software r development core team 2018 using the distributions determined from the global searches using the lmer function in the lme4 package bates et al 2015 pinheiro et al 2018 when assuming anion exclusion the θ eff and v eff were used in place of θ mo and v mo the mixed effect model for each parameter was compared individually to the different parameter fitting assumptions i e deuterated water cl with adsorption and cl without adsorption with the sample id nested within the sample depth i e the decomposition level the least squares means were estimated with the lmer function in the lme4 package bates et al 2015 and statistical significance of each interaction was determined using a contrasting pair wise comparison with tukey adjustment using the lsmean function in the lsmean package lenth 2016 to determine the effect the degree of decomposition had on the diffusion rate into the immobile pore space and anion exclusion the observed cl data were fit to the mim model using λ 2h and θ im 2h thus only α mim and kd were fit cl hdo to assess the relative differences between the two tracers and the undecomposed and decomposed peat a general linear model was developed using the distributions determined from the global searches where α mim was dependent on both decomposition level and tracer hdo or cl hdo with an intercept equal to zero a second general linear model was constructed to assess the influence of peat decomposition level on anion exclusion r and ϕ ex where r and ϕ ex were dependent on decomposition level of the cl hdo results the statistical significance of each interaction was determined using a contrasting pair wise comparison with tukey adjustment in the lsmean function in the lsmean package lenth 2016 all statistical analyses were performed in r statistical software version 3 4 4 r development core team 2018 3 results 3 1 adsorption batch experiments concentration dependent cl adsorption was apparent at concentrations 305 mg l 1 0 31 mg ml 1 where the local slope of the isotherm was 0 below this threshold adsorption was negligible and the local slope of the isotherm approached 0 fig 1 the k f values ranged between 0 33 and 61 3 mg1 n g 1 ml n no consistent trend between k f and the degree of decomposition was observed similarly the n parameter did not systematically vary with degree of decomposition and was typically observed to be near or above 1 except for sample h7 1 table 2 only the h4 and milled peat yielded similar near linear isotherms for the two individual sample batches over the concentration range tested however for replicates within a given batch e g batch 1 of h1 peat the observed averages were close fig 1 and the resultant rmse were acceptable table 2 given the magnitude of the reported rmse 0 19 15 50 mg g 1 table 2 the 17 mg l 1 0 017 mg ml 1 results in all samples were not reliable i e the confidence intervals c i were of the same magnitude as the measured values and hence excluded from the analysis and not presented no release of other anions fluoride nitrite nitrate sulphate bromide or phosphate was observed 3 2 breakthrough curve experiments the modelled deuterated water btcs were in good agreement with the measured values resulting in low rmse 0 021 0 050 table 3 with little data scatter fig 2 this resulted in small c i s for λ 2h and θ im 2h for all peat cores there was a general increase in θ im 2h and λ 2h with a higher degree of decomposition while no apparent trend in α mim 2h was observed table 3 similar trends were observed for the parameters obtained with cl btcs table 4 table s2 table s3 regardless of tracer or model choice the fitted θ im agreed extremely well with the measured drainable porosity at 100 mb and only when accounting for the ϕ ex was a notable difference in θ eff observed fig 3 overall the effluent concentrations of cl exhibited more scatter than those of deuterated water fig 2 resulting in higher rmse and aic nevertheless the cl model fits were still in good agreement with the data regardless of cl model choice tables 4 s2 and s3 slightly lower rmse were observed when not including adsorption but all cl btc models performed worse than that of deuterated water typically the aic was lowest when assuming anion exclusion but the difference between all cl models were 10 tables 4 s2 and s3 for the cl models the lowest rmses were observed when assuming anion exclusion tables 4 s2 and s3 the fitted freundlich parameters determined from the cl model with adsorption were similar across all btcs displaying strong non linearity i e n mim 10 as well as large c i s table s3 the freundlich isotherm coefficients k f mim varied between 1 3 and 3 2 mg1 n g 1 mln table s3 although these values were within the large range determined in the adsorption batch experiments 0 33 61 25 mg1 n g 1 mln table 2 the corresponding n mim values table s3 were generally much greater than those determined in the equilibrium batch experiments table 2 however both the rmse and aic of the adsorption models were typically greater than other 2 cl models although the btcs were very similar between cl and deuterated water there were differences in the physical e g λ θ im θ mo and flow e g d mo dependent parameters depending on the model deuterated water cl with and without adsorption and anion exclusion used to derive the parameters fig 4 when simulated with and without adsorption the estimated dispersivity values λ and d mo were statistically different p 0001 between deuterated water and cl however the θ im and θ mo values were not statistically different table 5 the average estimated λ using cl was 2 3 and 2 4 larger than that estimated with deuterated water without and with adsorption respectively however when accounting for anion exclusion processes cl ae the estimated λ d mo θ im and v eff were not significantly different from those determined by deuterated water but the θ eff was significantly lower table 5 however the estimated θ mo note θ mo θ eff ϕ ex assuming anion exclusion agreed well with deuterated water and the measured drainable porosity not shown the random effects accounted for 41 38 29 24 and 36 of the model variation for λ d mo θ im θ mo and v mo respectively the resultant least square means can be found in supplementary information table s4 3 3 anion exclusion and diffusion of hdo and cl given the similarity of estimated hydrophysical parameters when accounting for anion exclusion the cl data were fit using λ 2h and θ im 2h to limit variability between models and assess the validity of anion exclusion assumptions this dual tracer technique allows for the better estimation of the effect of the degree of decomposition on diffusion into the inactive porosity and anion exclusion cl hdo effects without assuming anion exclusion the modelled cl simulation was unable to fit the observed data under the same hydrophysical conditions fig 5 and table s5 anion exclusion significantly increased with the degree of decomposition p 0001 where the least square mean r values were 0 95 and 0 87 for undecomposed and decomposed peat respectively additionally the ϕ ex significantly increased with degree of decomposition p 0001 the pe for deuterated water was well above 10 table 3 indicating that advective flow was dominant and that diffusion in the θ mo was insignificant contrary to diffusion in the θ mo diffusion into the θ im was an important process to consider as the da cl hdo were between 1 5 and 30 4 and 0 9 32 2 for deuterated water and cl hdo respectively the fitted cl hdo resulted in similar or slightly lower rmses relative to the cl ae and cl while typically much lower aic due to the lower number of fitted parameters table 6 the diffusion of both deuterated water and cl were significantly different depending on the degree of decomposition but were not different between deuterated water and cl within a degree of decomposition table 7 the differences in α mim values resulted in a ratio between α mim 2h and α mim cl hdo of 0 74 and 0 84 for undecomposed and decomposed peat respectively table 8 these ratios were similar to the ratio between the free water diffusion coefficients of deuterated water and cl 0 78 and fell within the 95 c i for both degrees of decomposition however the limited sample numbers preclude further statistical analysis the resultant least square means can be found in supplementary information table s6 4 discussion 4 1 chloride adsorption isotherms the freundlich isotherm parameters vary significantly among the various batches of luther marsh bog peat while isotherms for replicate samples of an individual batch were comparable large differences were observed between batches from the same peat layer in particular for the h1 and h7 peat fig 1 furthermore some peat samples exhibit near linear isotherms n 1 while others do not table 2 mccarter et al 2018 report non linear cl isotherms for undegraded poor fen peat however these authors found a distinct upper limit to cl adsorption which was best described by a sips isotherm limousin et al 2007 sips 1948 in contrast over the concentration range tested here no upper limit is observed for bog peat regardless of the degree of decomposition one potential explanation for the highly variable isotherms is a highly heterogenous distribution of surface area in peat rezanezhad et al 2016 which hinders the preparation of reproducible samples even within a single peat layer limousin et al 2007 the large observed variation in isotherms suggests that a greater number of samples and mass of peat may be required to comment on the ubiquity of cl adsorption in peat nonetheless our results overall do not support an increase in cl adsorption with increased degree of peat decomposition as reported for cations and organic contaminants gharedaghloo 2018 possibly this reflects the different mechanisms governing anion adsorption compared to cations ho and mckay 1999 ho et al 2002 mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2012 and organic molecules cohen et al 1991 gharedaghloo 2018 rutherford et al 1992 whose adsorption chiefly depends on the specific surface area and the chemical properties of the organic matter andreasson et al 1988 further note that the cl isotherms were measured at neutral ph which is higher than found in pore waters of most bog peatlands glaser et al 1997 hayward and clymo 1982 at neutral ph the overall surface charge is thought to be highly negative andreasson et al 1988 delicato 1996 suggesting that having electrostatically bound anions at low pore water ionic strengths is unlikely andreasson et al 1988 however given that the point of zero charge has been observed to be ph 4 and perhaps ph 2 5 for undecomposed sphagnum peat delicato 1996 in the low ph environments of bogs ph 4 the net surface charge would likely remain negative and similar adsorption processes where a threshold cl concentration is required before cl adsorption can occur our results clearly highlight the need for more research into the binding mechanisms of cl and other anions to peat the effect of ph on anion adsorption and the variability of adsorption across different peat types i e sphagnum sedge or wood dominated and degree of decomposition nonetheless taken together the observed adsorption isotherms imply that strictly speaking cl is not an inert solute in peat as is usually assumed our results however also indicate that cl adsorption is very limited at aqueous concentrations below 0 31 mg ml 1 fig 1 thus at sufficiently low concentrations cl should still behave as a conservative transport tracer with regards to anion adsorption this hypothesis is further explored below 4 2 btc parameter estimation chloride versus deuterated water flow through experiments are a powerful approach to characterize key reactive transport properties of porous media chief among these properties is the dispersivity λ whose accurate determination is crucial to reduce uncertainties in other parameter values šimůnek et al 2003 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 relative to cl deuterated water had lower parameter c i s rmse and aic table 3 due to lower data scatter fig 2 suggesting it may be a more reliable tracer when further reactive transport modelling is required however the deuterated water and cl when assuming anion exclusion yield statistically indistinguishable λ θ im and d mo values and slightly lower θ eff confirming the consistency of the inferred physical flow properties of the peat and the validity of using either tracer when assuming cl adsorption to the peat fitting all of the parameters f mo k f mim and n mim derived from the cl btcs resulted in larger c i s table s3 suggestive of poorer parameter identifiability the inferior performance of the cl model with adsorption i e higher rmse and aic indicates that at the inflow concentration used 0 12 mg ml 1 the adsorption of cl was not a dominant process affecting cl transport this result was consistent with the equilibrium adsorption isotherms experiments which in most cases show minimal cl adsorption at aqueous concentrations below 0 31 mg ml 1 fig 1 without the ϕ ex the θ mo agreed very well with the measured drainable porosity at 100 mb fig 3 confirming the validity of using this measured value to fix θ im as suggested by mccarter and price 2017 additionally the small decrease in θ mo due to the ϕ ex table 6 did not significantly affect the flow dependent parameters v mo and d mo table 5 and still fell within 0 1 of the measured drainable porosity at 100 mb ne when not accounting for anion exclusion the estimated λ and d mo were significantly different than those determined using deuterated water table 5 the results of the cl btc modelling indicate that anion exclusion is influencing the transport of cl in peat and should potentially be accounted for if treating cl as a conservative tracer the slightly better fits of simulated concentrations assuming anion exclusion with the observed data and the statistically indistinguishable λ and d mo parameters to those determined by the deuterated water btcs further illustrate that cl is not truly conservative in peat for example when not assuming anion exclusion the cl btc could not be fit to the data when using the λ and θ im determined using deuterated water table s5 while when assuming anion exclusion the observed data were successfully fit using the same parameters fig 5 table 6 therefore in the remaining discussion we will only consider cl assuming anion exclusion using the deuterated water λ and θ im parameters cl hdo table 6 and the deuterated water table 3 btc modelling results 4 3 the role of decomposition on diffusion and anion exclusion in peat using two tracers a more representative estimation of cl diffusion and anion exclusion can be achieved where the deuterated water was used to estimate the λ and θ im and cl to determine α mim cl hdo and kd cl hdo table 6 in both cases da for both hdo and cl hdo between 1 5 and 30 4 and 0 9 32 2 respectively suggest that diffusion into the inactive porosity remains an important process to characterize within this particular peat at the tested flow rates conversely the pe were all well above 10 indicating that in the θ mo θ eff advection was the primary process governing the transport of all solutes and diffusion did not significantly contribute to the flux the mass transfer coefficient of cl α mim cl hdo were typically slightly lower than that of deuterated water α mim 2h which was expected as the free water diffusion coefficient for cl is lower than that for deuterated water appelo and postma 2005 easteal et al 1984 murday and cotts 1970 however the relative difference between α mim cl hdo and α mim 2h were not distinguishable between undecomposed and decomposed samples table 8 the average ratios between α mim values in the undecomposed peat was 0 74 lower than the ratio of the free water diffusion coefficients of deuterated water and cl of 0 78 in contrast the average ratio between α mim values in the decomposed peat was 0 84 table 8 these diffusion ratio s c i s overlapped and encompasses the free water diffusion coefficient suggesting that under these flow conditions changes in the peat pore structure with increasing degree of decomposition did not limit the diffusion rate between the mobile and immobile porosity and that the free water diffusion coefficient of both solutes was the governing transport property recently simhayov et al 2018 illustrated that in degraded and re packed fen peat the mim model was not appropriate because this particular peat visually appeared and behaved as a single porosity media both hydraulically and chemically and the convection dispersion equation could be used in peats with a distinct dual porosity structure the mim model is only relevant when ω is 100 and when this condition is violated the mim model essentially simplifies to the convection dispersion equation simhayov et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2003 šimůnek et al 2008 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 there was large variability in the observed ω parameter for both deuterated water and cl hdo where in three cases ω was near or above 100 tables 3 and 6 suggesting that in these cases the data may be overparameterized and a simpler solute transport model i e the convection dispersion model would suffice however given the wide range of ω and α mim parameters there was no discernable trend to inform when to use a simplified model or the mim given this the mim model was used for all samples to ensure consistency within the study in any case when ω 100 the system is still a dual porosity media but the equilibrium time between the mobile and immobile porosities is rapid enough to treat the entire system as a single porosity medium i e no observable tailing in the btcs thus there are hydrophysical conditions when the mim model may be inappropriate due to overparameterization but it may be appropriate to use the mim model to accurately represent the physical system unless all samples within a given study allow for the use of simpler transport model past studies gharedaghloo 2018 hoag and price 1997 kleimeier et al 2017 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2016 mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2016 simhayov et al 2018 have attributed the early observed breakthrough of chloride to the presence of an immobile porosity structure in the peat while the dual porosity structure in peat is not in question by using two conservative tracers it is apparent that the early arrival of cl cannot be solely accounted for due to the current dual porosity structure concept chloride induced pore dilation may increase the saturated hydraulic conductivity hoag and price 1997 kettridge and binley 2010 mccarter et al 2018 ours et al 1997 by increasing the θ mo comas and slater 2004 however the changes induced by cl interactions with organic functional groups comas and slater 2004 ours et al 1997 would change the media properties and thus influence both tracers equally given the differential response in tracers and the negative charge associated with peat at ph above 4 0 andreasson et al 1988 delicato 1996 there is clear evidence of anion exclusion at both degrees of decomposition whereby incorporating anion exclusion processes resulted in the same hydrophysical parameter estimation as deuterated water table 5 unlike single porosity soils where anion exclusion can be identified by a decrease in λ and θ mo and subsequent increase in d mo gvirtzman and gorelick 1991 james and rubin 1986 van loon et al 2007 the λ cl increased relative to λ 2h in the mim model since θ mo is already represented however a similar result increase in d mo can be achieved in the mim model by increasing λ and keeping θ mo constant see eq 3a and 3b which was typically observed in this study table s2 similar to the traditional method of describing anion exclusion significantly lower θ eff p 0002 was observed when accounting for anion exclusion where r 1 fig 3 table 5 without both tracers it is impossible to determine if anion exclusion is occurring especially in a known dual porosity media furthermore including the flushing curve in the btc experiments which many past studies have not included hoag and price 1997 kleimeier et al 2017 mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2012 highlighted the inability of cl without anion exclusion to accurately describe the hydrophysical transport parameters table s5 and fig 5 only through the combination of the dual tracer approach and investigating the injection and flushing curves was anion exclusion identified in peat if anion exclusion is a ubiquitous process in peat previous estimations of the mim parameters may overestimate the λ as the λ cl table s2 was on average 2 4 larger than that of λ 2h table 3 when fitting θ im which is common in peat transport studies gharedaghloo 2018 kleimeier et al 2017 mccarter et al 2018 rezanezhad et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2012 rezanezhad et al 2016 in these cases as well as when fitting v mo mccarter et al 2018 simhayov et al 2018 or r hoag and price 1997 the overall retardation as determined by r is still 1 because the magnitude of anion exclusion is less than the retardation caused by the diffusion into the inactive porosity however when the parameter estimations are completed with fitting r in the convection dispersion equation hoag and price 1997 rather than the mim a more representative parameter estimation of r may be derived as r is the total summation non advective forces acting on the solute in any case given the indistinguishable parameter estimation table 5 between deuterated water table 3 and cl when assuming anion exclusion table 4 and table 6 it is possible to correctly estimate the physical parameters of peat using cl provided that anion exclusion is accounted for unlike α mim where there was no difference with degree of decomposition table 8 the effect of anion exclusion increased p 0001 with degree of decomposition as r was further from unity and ϕ ex was larger with an increased degree of decomposition table 6 this increase in anion exclusion with increased degree of decomposition was likely due to the increasing number of smaller pores carey et al 2007 gharedaghloo 2018 gharedaghloo et al 2018 mccarter and price 2014 quinton et al 2009 where the more abundant small pore throats increased the specific surface area gharedaghloo et al 2018 and the overall increase in negative surface charge with increasing fulvic acid concentration a common feature of increased degree of decomposition led to a decrease in θ eff and increased the effective pore water velocity bratskaya et al 2008 comas and slater 2004 gondar et al 2005a gondar et al 2005b ours et al 1997 rose et al 2009 these results suggest that cl and potentially other anions may undergo anion exclusion resulting in slightly higher effective solute velocities than predicted by a conservative tracer furthermore the observed effect may be enhanced when the peat pore structure and or experimental conditions results in the rapid equilibrium between the θ eff and θ im and limited to no extended tailing is observed such as this study however for cl the overall effect of anion exclusion remained relatively minor and the 2 increase in λ only resulted in a maximum 0 16 decrease in r from unity given the dearth of knowledge regarding peat surface charge further studies are required to better understand the exact mechanisms governing the transport of anions in peat moreover as development in peatland dominated watersheds increases the potential for unintentional contaminant release will increase thus it might be prudent to account for anion exclusion processes depending on the contaminant in any case this study represents the first identification of anion exclusion as a transport process in peat and further studies are required to establish the ubiquity of this process 4 4 implications of tracer choice on solute transport the lower estimated parameter c i s imply that deuterated water btcs yield parameter values with lower overall error the decreased scatter in the observed deuterated water relative to cl may in part reflect the lower analytical error in isotopic 0 3 than chemical 3 0 measurements however the relatively large difference in input concentrations may exaggerate this effect when the larger analytical error of cl is coupled with the apparent non conservative nature of cl in peat whether due to adsorption at higher concentrations or anion exclusion it is recommended to use enriched water isotopes as tracers rather than chemical tracers to avoid these issues however the relative analytical cost and time need to be weighed against the decreased total error for a given experiment especially considering that it is generally prudent to have a greater number of replicates with lower precision than fewer replicates with higher precision graniero 1999 in this study the variability of hydrophysical parameters within a given degree of peat decomposition exceeds the c i s signifying that the spatial variability can be large even among cores sampled within 50 cm of each other in the case of anion exclusion the overall effect is relatively minor as r approaches 1 in many cases and the deviation from 1 did not exceed 0 16 in all undecomposed cores the r values were 0 93 and would have a lesser influence on solute transport than the more decomposed peat with lower r values similarly mccarter et al 2018 observed that cl adsorption did not significantly affect the transport parameters when r 1 07 which is a similar absolute distance away from 1 as the anion exclusion results it is likely that when majority of solute transport occurs in large connected pores such as are common in poorly decomposed peat suitable results can be obtained without including anion exclusion in the fitting routines particularly when only the hydrophysical parameters λ θ im θ mo d mo and α mim are considered however if the goal of the study is to characterize the reactive transport of other solutes where the relative effect size may be small or concentrations low such as trace metals it might be prudent to use enriched water isotope tracers to characterize the flow domain rather than anion tracers to avoid potential complications with anion exclusion or adsorption given the logistical challenges in field scale tracer studies baird and gaffney 2000 balliston et al 2018 hoag and price 1995 mccarter et al 2017a mccarter and price 2017 the importance of appropriate transport model choice liu et al 2017 simhayov et al 2018 and sample variability cl in many instances remains a suitable tracer choice 5 conclusions the dual tracer approach used in this study highlighted that cl is not strictly speaking a conservative non reactive tracer in peat however for the peat soils used here the effect of adsorption was negligible on the btcs obtained with an inflow concentration of 0 12 mg ml 1 anion exclusion processes resulted in significantly different hydrophysical parameter estimation than deuterated water when this process was not accounted for in the fitting routines thus for sufficiently low cl concentrations the transport of cl is indistinguishable from those of deuterated water when anion exclusion processes are considered yet the overall magnitude of the effect of anion exclusion in peat is minor resulting in a maximum deviation of r from unity of 0 16 to our knowledge this is the first instance that anion exclusion has been identified in transport processes in peat but the ubiquity of this process needs to be confirmed on a greater variety of peat types and degrees of decomposition and the specific surface charge of the peat surface needs to be explored this study confirmed that the saturated porosity at 100 mb is equivalent to the θ im and can be fixed in the fitting routines the observed variability within the small sample set used in this study illustrates the need for a greater number of samples and studies on these processes to better characterize transport processes in peat both the btc and batch adsorption experiments imply a high spatial variability of the hydrophysical and adsorptive properties of peat even within layers of a given degree

1574,emulsified vegetable oil combined with colloidal mg oh 2 evo cm can slowly release electron donors and oh into groundwater and is therefore regarded as a promising amendment for enhanced in situ treatment of chlorinated solvents such as tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce however its migration ability in different porous media and the simultaneous release of electron donor and ph buffer during enhanced reductive dechlorination erd have never been evaluated in detail in this study evo cm with uniform drop size and desirable stability was prepared laboratory scale column tests were conducted to investigate the transport and spatial distribution of the evo cm in different porous media batch microcosm experiments were carried out to study the dechlorination efficiency under different evo mg oh 2 ratios experimental results indicate that prepared evo cm emulsions can be transported effectively through different porous media with grain size ranging from 0 1 1 0 mm the emulsified vegetable oil evo and colloidal mg oh 2 showed synchronous movement through the porous media column systems providing both electron donor and alkalinity at the same location the retention degree of evo cm is greater in the finer grained media and decreases with increasing distance from the inlet the injection of evo cm lead to a significant mobilization of tce in the column the reductive dechlorination of tce in the microcosms was remarkably enhanced in the presence of evo cm the coaddition of sufficient colloidal mg oh 2 effectively limits the deleterious ph decline caused by acid release the microcosm achieves an optimum dechlorination efficiency when the evo mg oh 2 ratio is 1 1 keywords chlorinated solvents dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl enhanced reductive dechlorination erd ph buffer groundwater 1 introduction trichloroethene tce is a chlorinated organic compound used as dry cleaning and metal degreasing agents in many industrial processes azizian et al 2010 and frequently is found in groundwater of many industrial areas or in illegal waste disposal sites based on its toxicity to human health the maximum contaminant level for tce in drinking water is set at 5 μg l according to the u s drinking water standard lien and zhang 2001 however in some contaminated groundwater the tce concentration can reach several thousand micrograms per liter godsy et al 2003 tsai et al 2008 tce can be transported in the subsurface environment waller 2010 and simultaneously be retained in soil and experience retardation in groundwater due to its high density and low water solubility tce is likely to migrate vertically through the vadose zone to the aquifer and eventually down to a low permeability layer or boundary i e aquitard or clay lens where dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl can accumulate he et al 2003 dnapl tce moves under gradients in pressure or head at saturations just above residual saturation dnapl relative permeability is low and will not move easily in this case dnapl tce cannot be effectively displaced by groundwater flow under typical pumping conditions david 2004 hunt et al 1988 in addition continuous dissolution of dnapl tce into groundwater often leads to the expansion of the pollutant plume over time adding further complication for contamination characterization transport prediction and remediation yang et al 2018 in situ enhanced reductive dechlorination erd technology targeting dnapl phase chlorinated solvents involves the injection of an organic substrate as the electron donor to the subsurface to stimulate dechlorinating bacteria chiu et al 2013 borden 2007 watson et al 2013 thus the injection of a carbon based substrate electron donor can significantly affect the dechlorination efficiency a desirable electron donor must be able to migrate and become distributed over the target plume regions effectively be retained within particular zones and dissolve slowly over time soluble substrates migrate easily in an aquifer and can be quickly flushed away by flowing groundwater therefore only a small fraction of the injected amount can be retained on porous media reacting with the target pollutant in contrast insoluble substrates are easily retained on porous media and tend to aggregate in a small region thus cannot be effectively distributed over the contaminated zone emulsified vegetable oil evo a slow release cost saving and environmentally friendly substrate is considered a promising reagent for in situ erd of chlorinated solvents as an amphiphilic material evo can enter the dnapl phase and reduce mass transfer resistance substantially and as a slow release electron donor it has demonstrated a desirable longevity and effectiveness for promoting biological reduction mateas et al 2017 harkness and fisher 2013 liang et al 2013 lutes et al 2002 however in actual remediation hcl released by dechlorination of the pollutant as well as the volatile fatty acid vfas h2co3 etc that are generated by evo fermentation can lead to declines in ph resulting in the inhibition of the dechlorinating bacteria tokunaga et al 1998 therefore ph buffering may be necessary to optimize erd soluble alkaline buffers robinson et al 2009 such as nahco3 and khco3 are easily flushed away from the treatment zone by flowing groundwater and thus require frequent resupply thereby increasing the maintenance cost in addition in aquifers with significant concentrations of ca2 or mg2 the introduction of bicarbonate may lead to precipitation of calcite at neutral ph reducing the permeability lacroix et al 2012 magnesium hydroxide which dissolves slowly in water pksp 10 4 can provide a long term source of oh pishtshev et al 2014 kameda et al 2009 preventing large decreases or increases in ph colloidal mg oh 2 modified with surfactant can be transported through porous media dong et al 2017 allowing the distribution of oh in close contact with dnapl where acidity is produced hiortdahl and borden hiortdahl and borden 2014 have reported the effectiveness of evo combined with colloidal mg oh 2 evo cm in accelerating a bioenhanced dissolution of pce dnapl and limiting ph declines however whether the evo and the mg oh 2 can migrate synchronously through varying porous media to provide both electron donor and alkalinity at the same location is still unclear a lack of independent water and sand analysis limits the quantitative understanding of the remediation process in addition the permeability loss following the amendment injection which is critical for the design of in situ treatment with evo cm has not yet been evaluated furthermore the effect of evo mg oh 2 ratio on tce dechlorination and changes in geochemical parameters during the biodegradation are poorly understood in this work we use evo cm as a slow release reactive reagent for the enhanced reductive dechlorination of dnapl tce columns packed with three different porous media fine sand medium sand and coarse sand were used to investigate the transport of evo cm in representative aquifer systems i e groundwater batch microcosm tests were performed using a groundwater sediment suspension to describe the reactions between the pollutant electron donor and ph buffer in the presence of evo cm the objectives of this work are to i investigate the influence of media grain size on the migration and distribution of evo cm in saturated column systems ii evaluate the changes in media permeability and tce mobility following amendment injection and iii determine the optimum evo colloidal mg oh 2 ratio for the enhanced treatment of tce with evo cm 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of evo cm the evo cm used in this work was prepared by mixing evo and colloidal mg oh 2 in certain volume ratios with 1 g l yeast extract powder the evo contained 10 vegetable oil 2 tween 80 and 88 deionized water by weight and the colloidal mg oh 2 contained 2 magnesium hydroxide 0 02 sds 0 02 tween 80 and 97 96 deionized water by weight the mixture was shaken with a homogenizer for 24 h to obtain a uniform emulsion the emulsion droplet was observed with an optical microscope xsp bm bcas shanghai china before and after centrifugation at 5000 rpm using a fulgor tdl 5a centrifuge shanghai china the drop size distribution was analyzed with a bettersize 2000 laser particle size distribution instrument dandong china 2 2 column transport experiments the column transport experiments were conducted in three 30 cm long clear pvc columns inner diameter i d 3 cm with a side injection port at 3 cm from the inlet as shown in fig 1 the columns were separately packed with three different sands sieved and graded from commercial river sand and saturated with a synthetic groundwater solution deionized water the basic mineralogy of the river sand was quartz silica sand with bulk density of 1 81 g cm3 and grain sizes ranging from 0 08 to 5 mm basic parameters and grain size distribution of the three porous media are shown in table 1 and fig 2 respectively the chemical composition of the groundwater solution was ph 6 85 0 6 μg l no3 1 μg l so4 2 0 5 μg l po4 3 fe concentration below the detection limit and 85 μg l total organic carbon toc one pore volume pv of evo cm solution was then injected into the columns at the inlet followed by 4 pv of groundwater solution throughout the injection phase the injection flow rate was 0 85 ml min equal to a linear pore velocity of 5 m d which is close to the values under actual remediation conditions transport of the evo and mg oh 2 was evaluated by monitoring the column effluents for toc and mg the pvc columns were frozen at the end of the experiments and cut into 2 cm sections for analysis of the spatial distribution of the toc and alkalinity the total discharged toc and mg were obtained by integrating corresponding breakthrough curves btcs using eq 1 similarly the total retained amounts were obtained by integrating the spatial distribution curves using eq 2 the mass balance of the column systems was described by eq 3 and eq 4 the integral calculations were conducted using origin 8 5 1 discharged amount v 0 v c e d v where v is the effluent volume l and c e is the effluent concentration of toc or mg mg l 2 retained amount m 0 m c m d m where m is the weight of the packed media g and c m is the solid phase concentration of toc or mg on the media mg g 3 injected toc discharged toc retained toc δtoc 4 injected mg discharged mg retained mg δmg where δtoc and δmg are the errors of the toc mass balance mg and the mg mass balance mg respectively previous work has shown that oil droplets will not be effectively transported until most of the attachment sites of the porous media are occupied by oil droplets gabitto and tsouris 2017 therefore in this experiment the total amounts of evo cm added were much larger than the retention capacity of the porous media allowing some emulsion to be discharged in the column effluents the volume ratio of evo to colloidal mg oh 2 for the transport experiments was prepared at a 10 1 ratio the influence of evo cm injection on the hydraulic conductivity was measured in the column packed with fine sand and saturated with the synthetic groundwater solution the hydraulic conductivity was measured by a constant head permeameter 1 pv of evo cm was injected at the inlet of the column followed by 4 pv of groundwater solution injection and flushing the effluent flow rate was regularly recorded and the hydraulic conductivity was calculated according to darcy s law the influence of the evo cm injection on tce dissolution and transport was measured in the column packed with fine sand the column was saturated with synthetic groundwater solution for 24 h and then 240 μl 0 35 g of pure tce was injected into the center of the porous media from the side injection port fig 1 and allowed to drain downward toward the inlet 1 pv of evo cm was then injected into the column at the inlet and this was followed with the injection and flushing of 4 pv of groundwater solution to displace the evo cm that was not retained on porous media surfaces transport of the tce was evaluated by monitoring the tce concentration in the column effluent the evo cm was replaced with an equivalent amount of groundwater solution in a duplicate parallel control column to evaluate tce flushing and elution with groundwater solution only 2 3 batch microcosm experiments six 500 ml gas tight flasks containing 600 g of fine sand and 270 ml of 228 μμ tce aqueous solution were used to establish the microcosms the fine sand used had been exposed to tce in prior adaptation experiments to enrich the dechlorinating bacteria the flasks were shaken well and let to stand for 24 h to achieve equilibrium adsorption conditions and form an artificial tce contaminated aquifer then 30 ml of evo cm with different evo mg oh 2 ratios and 20 ml of culture solution were added to each of the flasks all flasks were well shaken and incubated in an incubator at 30 c solution samples were taken regularly with a glass syringe and diluted before analysis sand samples were taken at the end of the experiment for the analysis of iron concentration in porous media the evo mg oh 2 ratios v v used in the experiment were 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 5 1 1 and 1 2 evo cm was replaced with an equivalent amount of representative groundwater solution in a duplicate parallel control flask the culture solution prepared using consistent methods described in other studies was composed of 305 6 mg l kcl 898 6 mg l nh4cl 159 mg l nahco3 phosphate buffer mineral salts and trace elements ye et al 2008 the treatment efficiency for tce and the slow release performance of evo cm were evaluated by monitoring the concentration of tce dichloroethane dce vinyl chloride vc ethene ph oxidation reduction potential orp mg cl total iron tfe fe iii fe ii and ch4 2 4 analytical methods the toc and mg were determined using potassium dichromate spectrophotometry and edta titration respectively the alkalinity was analyzed by acidifying the dried soil samples to ph 2 with 0 05 mm hcl

agilent technologies 7890 gc with the agilent pro plot q column for which the method detection limit mdl and the quantifiable detection limit qdl were 0 05 μg l and 0 15 μg l respectively chloride was

analyzed with an agilent technologies 2010 gc with a flame ionization detector fid and agilent technological hp plot q column mdl 0 02 μl qdl 0 07 μl 3 results and discussion 3 1 dispersion stability and drop size distribution of evo cm as shown in fig 3a the prepared evo cm is a homogeneous milky white emulsion the appearance of evo cm did not change after centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min fig 3b or a 35 day static settlement not shown according to the stability delamination time relationship chu et al 2012 the emulsion was supposed to exist under stable condition without delamination for 300 days images of the material under an optical microscope are shown in fig 3c and d the drop size is uniform and only a few large oil drops were observed previous related research has shown that when the drop size of the injected material is smaller than 3 μm it can be transported effectively through an aquifer leeson et al 2004 fig 4 indicates that 98 of the prepared evo cm droplets are smaller than 3 μm with the median diameter of 0 450 μm 3 2 transport of evo cm in columns packed with different porous media the percentages of mg and toc representing evo discharged in the effluent and retained by the porous media during the transport experiments are summarized in table 2 evo was effectively transported through all columns with 88 of the injected evo being discharged in the column effluents however 60 of the injected colloidal mg oh 2 was retained by the porous media which is similar to the results reported in another study hiortdahl and borden 2014 the retention of oil droplets in porous media involves two different mechanisms coulibaly et al 2006 a physical straining in pore constrictions smaller than the droplet diameter and b interception on pore walls the interception of particles on pore walls is a function of collision efficiency which can approach unity under favorable conditions e g particle with positive charge colliding with a negatively charged attachment site however evo has a net negative surface charge zeta potential 0 636 mv thus the collision efficiency with the sand would be expected to be low 0 01 therefore physical straining would likely impose a relatively dominant role in evo droplet retention similarly modified colloidal mg oh 2 is also negatively charged dong et al 2017 and therefore is not expected to be retained through electrical attraction on the aquifer media a related study indicated that the contact retention of colloidal mg oh 2 on porous media is mainly influenced by diffusion brownian movement physical blocking and the gravity deposition process li et al 2018 the corresponding breakthrough curves btcs show that retention times for evo and colloidal mg oh 2 are very similar in all column experiments 1 8 pv indicating the synchronous transport of the electron donor and ph buffer in various systems fig 5a and b in addition retardation factors for evo and colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media were calculated according to the btcs of a representative conservative tracer br fig 5c surprisingly the evo and colloidal mg oh 2 both migrated faster than the tracer resulting in retardation factors 1 this phenomenon can be explained by the effect of buoyancy and size exclusion of macromolecules enfield and bengtssona 2010 the larger colloidal molecules evo and colloidal mg oh 2 can be excluded from the smaller soil pores and forced to move through only the larger pores therefore the effective pore volume for evo and colloidal mg oh 2 was much less than for the water and the resultant average interstitial velocities of evo and colloidal mg oh 2 would be greater than for the water grain size of the media had a notable effect on the retention and distribution of evo and colloidal mg oh 2 in the columns a larger fraction of injectant solution was discharged from the columns packed with the coarser grained media especially for the colloidal mg oh 2 component analysis of the sands indicated that evo and colloidal mg oh 2 were distributed throughout the length of the column the retention of evo was significantly greater in fine sand than in the medium coarse sand fig 5d this is because the sorption of evo on porous media directly depends on the specific surface area and organic carbon content of sand which decreased with the increase of media grain size karickhoff et al 1979 the solid phase concentration of evo in the fine sand reached 6 mg g at the inlet and decreased with the increase of distance from the inlet however in the medium sand and the coarse sand the solid phase concentrations of evo are similar 2 mg g without a significant decrease or dilution along the length of the column alkalinity of the sand increased significantly throughout the columns at the completion of the evo cm injection fig 5e which is favorable for the in situ ph adjustment and buffering capacity higher alkalinity was observed in the finer grained media for all three porous media alkalinity was highest at the inlet as the groundwater solution was injected and flushed through the systems the colloidal mg oh 2 was displaced further into the columns and porous medium alkalinity was observed to decline along the flow direction due to dilution and dispersion results of the constant head permeameter indicate that the hydraulic conductivity k of the fine sand reduced from the initial 1 25 10 4 m s to 9 65 10 5 m s following the injection of evo cm and then increased continuously during water washing fig 6 hydraulic conductivity levels off after 60 min and was restored to 1 13 10 4 m s by the end of the 2 h test the maximum k reduction 23 was observed at the beginning of flushing which could possibly impact the amendment delivery during the early phase of remediation however the hydraulic conductivity rapidly recovered after a short period of flushing and the final permeability loss of the porous medium was only 9 6 according to coulibaly and borden 2004 permeability loss 40 is regarded as moderate for emulsified oil amendments in which case the groundwater flow bypassing around the reactive zone would not occur therefore the above results indicate that the prepared evo cm caused very slight loss of permeability and can potentially be used to form in situ reactive zone for enhanced treatment of tce contaminated groundwater 3 3 enhanced transport of tce following evo cm injection as shown in fig 7 effluent tce concentration of the control column without evo cm injection was below 0 55 mm and only 6 1 of the injected amount was discharged from the column indicating limited recovery of tce during flushing as a result of slow dissolution rates in addition the dnapl tce tends to drain downward and pool on the bottom under the influence of gravity forces jiang et al 2013 and thus cannot be as easily mobilized as the free phase upward through the column in the column treated with evo cm tce was detected in the effluent between 0 8 1 9 pv after the evo cm injection when emulsion was visually observed the effluent concentration of tce reaches a maximum of 46 mm at approximately 1 4 pv which is 80 times that observed in the control column 51 of the injected tce was transported through the column and discharged in the effluent which is consistent with the previous study conducted in similar conditions hiortdahl and borden 2014 two mechanisms are hypothesized for the significant enhancement of tce transport after evo cm injection the first one is the solubilization of tce in oil compared to the aqueous groundwater solution flush dnapl tce was miscible within the evo cm and was thus removed as an emulsified oil phase the visible emulsion in the effluent consisted of small droplets of mixed napl containing both tce and the evo cm therefore flushing evo cm through the dnapl zone can decrease the tce concentration in the aqueous phase and the associated toxicity the surfactants in the evo cm which have the ability to reduce the napl water interfacial tension and increase tce solubility in water likely play a minor role in the transport of tce because no significant increase in aqueous tce concentration was observed the second mechanism is the alteration of apparent density as evo cm is lighter than water the mixed napl has a smaller apparent density than pure tce and may be more beneficial for bulk tce oil mobilization more buoyant the enhancement of tce mobility may be undesirable under some conditions because of the possible escape of dnapl from target injection zones and pollution of clean area however in the present work the tce and the amendment formed a mixed napl phase allowing the electron acceptor tce electron donor evo and ph buffer colloidal mg oh 2 to move together that may minimize substrate delivery limitations and increase the contact time between nutrients contaminant and bacteria resulting in the improvement of the biodegradation efficiency in practical remediation processes auxiliary measures may be needed to minimize the potential negative influences while ensuring the efficiency of biodegradation 3 4 enhanced dechlorination of tce by indigenous microbes in the presence of evo cm 3 4 1 temporal changes in tce breakdown products ph mg orp fe ii and ch4 in the microcosm as shown in fig 8a the concentration of tce decreased rapidly in the initial stage day 0 2 which was likely due to the physical adsorption on the sand rather than biodegradation in this experiment the measured sand water partition coefficient kd of tce in the absence and presence of evo cm was 0 65 l kg and 1 91 l kg respectively indicating that the addition of evo cm could significantly promote the tce adsorption on the sand after that a short steady stage day 2 5 was observed the enhanced dechlorination of tce started from day 6 evidenced by a significant decrease of tce and increase in the reduction products dce and cl the concentration of tce fell below the detection limit on day 10 whereas the concentration of dce and cl increased to approximately 113 μm and 111 μm respectively based on these results the removal of tce can be divided into three stages 1 the adsorption equilibrium is completed within 48 h during the physical adsorption stage 2 the microbes are adapted to the environment within 2 3 days during slow degradation stage and 3 a stable anaerobic dechlorination stage is maintained inducing relatively rapid degradation of tce when the dechlorinating bacteria are playing a primary role in this experiment we did not observe any other subsequent dechlorination products such as vc and ethene the incomplete dechlorination which is not ideal can be explained by the fact that dce is more difficult to degrade under reducing conditions than tce and pce mirza and darwin 2017 dhc strains are the only known organisms that can carry out complete reductive dehalogenation of tce to ethene therefore a lack of presence of the specific bacteria in the indigenous community can limit the transformation of dce to vc and to ethene hence for the remediation of actual tce contaminated sites the addition of a bioaugmentation culture may be needed to ensure that the parent contaminant is reduced all the way to nontoxic end products mclean et al 2015 the ph was roughly stable at 7 5 fig 8b except for an observed decrease on day 6 which may be due to rapid substrate fermentation and acid generation with the occurrence of erd the colloidal mg oh 2 was slowly dissolved releasing sufficient amounts of oh to buffer the decreasing ph at the same time the concentration of mg2 increased significantly fig 8c the initial orp of the microcosm was approximately 250 mv fig 8d the orp then decreased significantly over time and reached an equilibrium on day 10 at approximately 50 mv which indicates a reducing condition the shift of the redox condition indicates that the electron donors released from evo cm consumed the oxidizing substances e g o2 no3 fe iii and so4 2 during the biodegradation process within the microcosm a reducing environment is conducive to the growth of microorganisms that can reductively dechlorinate tce to dce the increase in fe ii concentration over time fig 8e further indicates that fe iii was converted to fe ii by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria via stimulation from electron donors that reaction is favorable because fe ii can chemically reduce tce within a relatively short time period kim et al 2011 anaerobic fermentation of electron donors is always accompanied by the production of ch4 therefore in this biodegradation system the methanogens are potentially competing directly with the dechlorinating microorganisms for electron donors freedman and gossett 1989 however as shown in fig 8f the significant production of methane was not observed until day 20 which is much later than dce production this indicates that the methanogens lag behind the dechlorinating bacteria in the competition for the electron donor under the conditions of these experiments this suggests that such competitive impacts did not adversely affect the dechlorination of tce to dce to any significant extent 3 4 2 effect of evo mg oh 2 ratio on tce dechlorination and geochemical parameters based on the different kinetics of substrate fermentation pollutant dechlorination and hydroxide dissolution the ratio between evo and colloidal mg oh 2 is crucial to achieve a coordinated release of electron donor and oh during the anaerobic reductive dechlorination process under the conditions used the highest dechlorination efficiency was obtained in the microcosm with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 1 in which the tce was almost completely degraded generating substantial amounts of dce and cl fig 9a and b the tce concentrations in the microcosms with evo mg oh 2 ratios of 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 5 and 1 2 were approximately 120 130 μm at the end of experiments with the dechlorination efficiency below 9 the ph decreased significantly in the microcosm without mg oh 2 because of the dechlorination of tce and the fermentation of evo fig 9c in the other microcosms any decreases in ph were buffered to different extents depending on the evo mg oh 2 ratio in the microcosm with the evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 2 the final ph exceeded the initial level reaching approximately 8 5 among all the microcosms the minimum extent of ph change was observed in the microcosm with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 1 indicating an optimum condition for ph buffering the obtained results reveal that the ratio of colloidal mg oh 2 in evo cm has a significant influence on the ph insufficient mg oh 2 cannot provide enough buffering capacity to neutralize the acid substances under the experimental time frames whereas excessive mg oh 2 yields alkalinity beyond what is necessary for adequate ph control and cost effectiveness the mg2 concentration increased with the decrease of evo mg oh 2 ratio fig 9d however the ionization degree of mg oh 2 showed a reverse trend as 100 82 9 70 5 and 55 2 of total magnesium was released in the form of mg2 in microcosms with evo mg oh 2 ratios of 1 0 1 1 0 5 1 1 and 1 2 respectively that result is because the dissolution of mg oh 2 is ph dependent according to the precipitation dissolution equilibrium mg oh 2 dissolves more easily in acidic conditions releasing more alkalinity when the ph increases the dissolution of mg oh 2 is reduced due to thermodynamic constraints this mechanism ensures a relatively long lifetime of injected mg oh 2 during in situ remediation compared to the control experiments additional evo initiated greater reducing conditions within the systems the particular extent of the decrease of orp was different for the five treated microcosms fig 9e depending on the evo mg oh 2 ratio the ratio of mg oh 2 had a significant influence on orp and is related to the utilization efficiency of electron donors added in the microcosm with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 1 the ph condition was optimum for the growth of microorganisms involved in biodegradation of evo and dechlorination of tce resulting in the largest relative extent of orp decrease to estimate the total transformation of fe iii to fe ii fe in aqueous solution and in porous media were measured separately initial solid phase total iron in each microcosm was 2132 mg with fe iii and fe ii concentrations of 3 18 mg g and 0 45 mg g respectively fig 9f indicates that at the end of the experiment the tfe still mainly existed in porous media and only a small fraction was dissolved in the aqueous solution the concentration of aqueous tfe decreased with the decrease in the evo mg oh 2 ratio in this experiment the aqueous tfe concentration primarily depended on the ph condition other studies have shown that iron tends to enter the aqueous phase from the solid phase under lower ph dong et al 2018a b the redox reaction of iron was influenced by the orp condition as shown in fig 9f the total conversion ratio of fe iii to fe ii in the six microcosms were 0 79 19 5 18 9 18 5 21 3 and 19 8 respectively this indicates that the addition of evo promoted the dissimilatory fe iii reduction and the process is insensitive to the evo mg oh 2 ratio the generation of ch4 in the microcosm with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 1 was 3 times greater than that in the microcosm with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 0 5 fig 9g no significant methane production occurred in the other four microcosm experiments considering that dechlorination efficiency was also highest with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 1 we can infer that the ongoing methane production did not limit the tce reduction to any significant extent 4 conclusions in this study we used evo cm as a slow release reactive reagent for the in situ remediation of tce contaminated groundwater evo cm consisted primarily of uniform droplet size d50 0 450 μm and can be prepared with good dispersibility and stability potential the evo cm was able to be transported effectively through columns packed with different porous media with grain size between 0 1 and 1 0 mm the evo and the colloidal mg oh 2 were synchronously transported through the column systems providing the microorganisms with both electron donor and alkalinity at the same location throughout space approximately 10 of the evo and 60 of the colloidal mg oh 2 were retained in the porous media and distributed throughout the length of column the amount of evo cm retained in the column was greater for the finer grained media and retention decreased with an increase in distance from the inlet only a slight permeability loss 9 6 in the fine sand was observed after the injection of evo cm the injection of evo cm significantly enhances the transport of tce in the column systems however further investigations are necessary to evaluate the pros and cons of the enhanced tce mobilization and to figure out the exact contribution of dissolution versus pure phase mixing and partitioning the addition of evo cm significantly facilitates the dechlorination of tce via the continuous supply of electron donor and alkalinity for the biodegradation process the ph decline during anaerobic reductive dechlorination was effectively inhibited due to the mg oh 2 dissociation and the orp decreased significantly transitioning from an oxidizing to a reducing condition which is accompanied with dissimilatory iron reduction any methanogens in the system did not seemingly adversely influence the dechlorination of tce the ratio of colloidal mg oh 2 in the evo cm influences not only the ph but also the utilization efficiency of the electron donors the ph dependent dissolution of mg oh 2 is favorable for long term buffering during in situ remediation the microcosm achieves an optimum dechlorination efficiency when the evo mg oh 2 ratio is 1 1 which may improve the overall remediation performance cost effectiveness for real world contamination sites in spite of the knowledge gained from this study additional studies involving microbial characterization and growth kinetics are required to deepen our understanding of the remediation mechanism of tce contaminated groundwater when we apply this coupled in situ evo cm technology acknowledgments this work was supported by the key laboratory of groundwater resources and environment ministry of education china this research was

1574,emulsified vegetable oil combined with colloidal mg oh 2 evo cm can slowly release electron donors and oh into groundwater and is therefore regarded as a promising amendment for enhanced in situ treatment of chlorinated solvents such as tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce however its migration ability in different porous media and the simultaneous release of electron donor and ph buffer during enhanced reductive dechlorination erd have never been evaluated in detail in this study evo cm with uniform drop size and desirable stability was prepared laboratory scale column tests were conducted to investigate the transport and spatial distribution of the evo cm in different porous media batch microcosm experiments were carried out to study the dechlorination efficiency under different evo mg oh 2 ratios experimental results indicate that prepared evo cm emulsions can be transported effectively through different porous media with grain size ranging from 0 1 1 0 mm the emulsified vegetable oil evo and colloidal mg oh 2 showed synchronous movement through the porous media column systems providing both electron donor and alkalinity at the same location the retention degree of evo cm is greater in the finer grained media and decreases with increasing distance from the inlet the injection of evo cm lead to a significant mobilization of tce in the column the reductive dechlorination of tce in the microcosms was remarkably enhanced in the presence of evo cm the coaddition of sufficient colloidal mg oh 2 effectively limits the deleterious ph decline caused by acid release the microcosm achieves an optimum dechlorination efficiency when the evo mg oh 2 ratio is 1 1 keywords chlorinated solvents dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl enhanced reductive dechlorination erd ph buffer groundwater 1 introduction trichloroethene tce is a chlorinated organic compound used as dry cleaning and metal degreasing agents in many industrial processes azizian et al 2010 and frequently is found in groundwater of many industrial areas or in illegal waste disposal sites based on its toxicity to human health the maximum contaminant level for tce in drinking water is set at 5 μg l according to the u s drinking water standard lien and zhang 2001 however in some contaminated groundwater the tce concentration can reach several thousand micrograms per liter godsy et al 2003 tsai et al 2008 tce can be transported in the subsurface environment waller 2010 and simultaneously be retained in soil and experience retardation in groundwater due to its high density and low water solubility tce is likely to migrate vertically through the vadose zone to the aquifer and eventually down to a low permeability layer or boundary i e aquitard or clay lens where dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl can accumulate he et al 2003 dnapl tce moves under gradients in pressure or head at saturations just above residual saturation dnapl relative permeability is low and will not move easily in this case dnapl tce cannot be effectively displaced by groundwater flow under typical pumping conditions david 2004 hunt et al 1988 in addition continuous dissolution of dnapl tce into groundwater often leads to the expansion of the pollutant plume over time adding further complication for contamination characterization transport prediction and remediation yang et al 2018 in situ enhanced reductive dechlorination erd technology targeting dnapl phase chlorinated solvents involves the injection of an organic substrate as the electron donor to the subsurface to stimulate dechlorinating bacteria chiu et al 2013 borden 2007 watson et al 2013 thus the injection of a carbon based substrate electron donor can significantly affect the dechlorination efficiency a desirable electron donor must be able to migrate and become distributed over the target plume regions effectively be retained within particular zones and dissolve slowly over time soluble substrates migrate easily in an aquifer and can be quickly flushed away by flowing groundwater therefore only a small fraction of the injected amount can be retained on porous media reacting with the target pollutant in contrast insoluble substrates are easily retained on porous media and tend to aggregate in a small region thus cannot be effectively distributed over the contaminated zone emulsified vegetable oil evo a slow release cost saving and environmentally friendly substrate is considered a promising reagent for in situ erd of chlorinated solvents as an amphiphilic material evo can enter the dnapl phase and reduce mass transfer resistance substantially and as a slow release electron donor it has demonstrated a desirable longevity and effectiveness for promoting biological reduction mateas et al 2017 harkness and fisher 2013 liang et al 2013 lutes et al 2002 however in actual remediation hcl released by dechlorination of the pollutant as well as the volatile fatty acid vfas h2co3 etc that are generated by evo fermentation can lead to declines in ph resulting in the inhibition of the dechlorinating bacteria tokunaga et al 1998 therefore ph buffering may be necessary to optimize erd soluble alkaline buffers robinson et al 2009 such as nahco3 and khco3 are easily flushed away from the treatment zone by flowing groundwater and thus require frequent resupply thereby increasing the maintenance cost in addition in aquifers with significant concentrations of ca2 or mg2 the introduction of bicarbonate may lead to precipitation of calcite at neutral ph reducing the permeability lacroix et al 2012 magnesium hydroxide which dissolves slowly in water pksp 10 4 can provide a long term source of oh pishtshev et al 2014 kameda et al 2009 preventing large decreases or increases in ph colloidal mg oh 2 modified with surfactant can be transported through porous media dong et al 2017 allowing the distribution of oh in close contact with dnapl where acidity is produced hiortdahl and borden hiortdahl and borden 2014 have reported the effectiveness of evo combined with colloidal mg oh 2 evo cm in accelerating a bioenhanced dissolution of pce dnapl and limiting ph declines however whether the evo and the mg oh 2 can migrate synchronously through varying porous media to provide both electron donor and alkalinity at the same location is still unclear a lack of independent water and sand analysis limits the quantitative understanding of the remediation process in addition the permeability loss following the amendment injection which is critical for the design of in situ treatment with evo cm has not yet been evaluated furthermore the effect of evo mg oh 2 ratio on tce dechlorination and changes in geochemical parameters during the biodegradation are poorly understood in this work we use evo cm as a slow release reactive reagent for the enhanced reductive dechlorination of dnapl tce columns packed with three different porous media fine sand medium sand and coarse sand were used to investigate the transport of evo cm in representative aquifer systems i e groundwater batch microcosm tests were performed using a groundwater sediment suspension to describe the reactions between the pollutant electron donor and ph buffer in the presence of evo cm the objectives of this work are to i investigate the influence of media grain size on the migration and distribution of evo cm in saturated column systems ii evaluate the changes in media permeability and tce mobility following amendment injection and iii determine the optimum evo colloidal mg oh 2 ratio for the enhanced treatment of tce with evo cm 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of evo cm the evo cm used in this work was prepared by mixing evo and colloidal mg oh 2 in certain volume ratios with 1 g l yeast extract powder the evo contained 10 vegetable oil 2 tween 80 and 88 deionized water by weight and the colloidal mg oh 2 contained 2 magnesium hydroxide 0 02 sds 0 02 tween 80 and 97 96 deionized water by weight the mixture was shaken with a homogenizer for 24 h to obtain a uniform emulsion the emulsion droplet was observed with an optical microscope xsp bm bcas shanghai china before and after centrifugation at 5000 rpm using a fulgor tdl 5a centrifuge shanghai china the drop size distribution was analyzed with a bettersize 2000 laser particle size distribution instrument dandong china 2 2 column transport experiments the column transport experiments were conducted in three 30 cm long clear pvc columns inner diameter i d 3 cm with a side injection port at 3 cm from the inlet as shown in fig 1 the columns were separately packed with three different sands sieved and graded from commercial river sand and saturated with a synthetic groundwater solution deionized water the basic mineralogy of the river sand was quartz silica sand with bulk density of 1 81 g cm3 and grain sizes ranging from 0 08 to 5 mm basic parameters and grain size distribution of the three porous media are shown in table 1 and fig 2 respectively the chemical composition of the groundwater solution was ph 6 85 0 6 μg l no3 1 μg l so4 2 0 5 μg l po4 3 fe concentration below the detection limit and 85 μg l total organic carbon toc one pore volume pv of evo cm solution was then injected into the columns at the inlet followed by 4 pv of groundwater solution throughout the injection phase the injection flow rate was 0 85 ml min equal to a linear pore velocity of 5 m d which is close to the values under actual remediation conditions transport of the evo and mg oh 2 was evaluated by monitoring the column effluents for toc and mg the pvc columns were frozen at the end of the experiments and cut into 2 cm sections for analysis of the spatial distribution of the toc and alkalinity the total discharged toc and mg were obtained by integrating corresponding breakthrough curves btcs using eq 1 similarly the total retained amounts were obtained by integrating the spatial distribution curves using eq 2 the mass balance of the column systems was described by eq 3 and eq 4 the integral calculations were conducted using origin 8 5 1 discharged amount v 0 v c e d v where v is the effluent volume l and c e is the effluent concentration of toc or mg mg l 2 retained amount m 0 m c m d m where m is the weight of the packed media g and c m is the solid phase concentration of toc or mg on the media mg g 3 injected toc discharged toc retained toc δtoc 4 injected mg discharged mg retained mg δmg where δtoc and δmg are the errors of the toc mass balance mg and the mg mass balance mg respectively previous work has shown that oil droplets will not be effectively transported until most of the attachment sites of the porous media are occupied by oil droplets gabitto and tsouris 2017 therefore in this experiment the total amounts of evo cm added were much larger than the retention capacity of the porous media allowing some emulsion to be discharged in the column effluents the volume ratio of evo to colloidal mg oh 2 for the transport experiments was prepared at a 10 1 ratio the influence of evo cm injection on the hydraulic conductivity was measured in the column packed with fine sand and saturated with the synthetic groundwater solution the hydraulic conductivity was measured by a constant head permeameter 1 pv of evo cm was injected at the inlet of the column followed by 4 pv of groundwater solution injection and flushing the effluent flow rate was regularly recorded and the hydraulic conductivity was calculated according to darcy s law the influence of the evo cm injection on tce dissolution and transport was measured in the column packed with fine sand the column was saturated with synthetic groundwater solution for 24 h and then 240 μl 0 35 g of pure tce was injected into the center of the porous media from the side injection port fig 1 and allowed to drain downward toward the inlet 1 pv of evo cm was then injected into the column at the inlet and this was followed with the injection and flushing of 4 pv of groundwater solution to displace the evo cm that was not retained on porous media surfaces transport of the tce was evaluated by monitoring the tce concentration in the column effluent the evo cm was replaced with an equivalent amount of groundwater solution in a duplicate parallel control column to evaluate tce flushing and elution with groundwater solution only 2 3 batch microcosm experiments six 500 ml gas tight flasks containing 600 g of fine sand and 270 ml of 228 μμ tce aqueous solution were used to establish the microcosms the fine sand used had been exposed to tce in prior adaptation experiments to enrich the dechlorinating bacteria the flasks were shaken well and let to stand for 24 h to achieve equilibrium adsorption conditions and form an artificial tce contaminated aquifer then 30 ml of evo cm with different evo mg oh 2 ratios and 20 ml of culture solution were added to each of the flasks all flasks were well shaken and incubated in an incubator at 30 c solution samples were taken regularly with a glass syringe and diluted before analysis sand samples were taken at the end of the experiment for the analysis of iron concentration in porous media the evo mg oh 2 ratios v v used in the experiment were 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 5 1 1 and 1 2 evo cm was replaced with an equivalent amount of representative groundwater solution in a duplicate parallel control flask the culture solution prepared using consistent methods described in other studies was composed of 305 6 mg l kcl 898 6 mg l nh4cl 159 mg l nahco3 phosphate buffer mineral salts and trace elements ye et al 2008 the treatment efficiency for tce and the slow release performance of evo cm were evaluated by monitoring the concentration of tce dichloroethane dce vinyl chloride vc ethene ph oxidation reduction potential orp mg cl total iron tfe fe iii fe ii and ch4 2 4 analytical methods the toc and mg were determined using potassium dichromate spectrophotometry and edta titration respectively the alkalinity was analyzed by acidifying the dried soil samples to ph 2 with 0 05 mm hcl shaking and equilibrating for 45 min and then back titrating to ph 4 5 with 0 1 mm naoh tce and its organic byproducts dce vc and ethene were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent technologies 7890 gc with the agilent pro plot q column for which the method detection limit mdl and the quantifiable detection limit qdl were 0 05 μg l and 0 15 μg l respectively chloride was analyzed through ion chromatography using a dionex ics 2100 with a hydroxide mobile phase column dionex ionpac as11 hc for which the mdl and qdl were 0 003 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively tfe and fe iii concentrations were determined following potassium thiocyanate spectrophotometry mdl 0 01 μg ml qdl 0 04 μg ml fe ii concentration was calculated based on the difference between the tfe and the fe iii the sand samples taken from the microcosms were dried anaerobically and extracted using hcl v v 1 1 for 24 h under n2 the extract liquid was then analyzed for iron concentration the ch4 was analyzed with an agilent technologies 2010 gc with a flame ionization detector fid and agilent technological hp plot q column mdl 0 02 μl qdl 0 07 μl 3 results and discussion 3 1 dispersion stability and drop size distribution of evo cm as shown in fig 3a the prepared evo cm is a homogeneous milky white emulsion the appearance of evo cm did not change after centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min fig 3b or a 35 day static settlement not shown according to the stability delamination time relationship chu et al 2012 the emulsion was supposed to exist under stable condition without delamination for 300 days images of the material under an optical microscope are shown in fig 3c and d the drop size is uniform and only a few large oil drops were observed previous related research has shown that when the drop size of the injected material is smaller than 3 μm it can be transported effectively through an aquifer leeson et al 2004 fig 4 indicates that 98 of the prepared evo cm droplets are smaller than 3 μm with the median diameter of 0 450 μm 3 2 transport of evo cm in columns packed with different porous media the percentages of mg and toc representing evo discharged in the effluent and retained by the porous media during the transport experiments are summarized in table 2 evo was effectively transported through all columns with 88 of the injected evo being discharged in the column effluents however 60 of the injected colloidal mg oh 2 was retained by the porous media which is similar to the results reported in another study hiortdahl and borden 2014 the retention of oil droplets in porous media involves two different mechanisms coulibaly et al 2006 a physical straining in pore constrictions smaller than the droplet diameter and b interception on pore walls the interception of particles on pore walls is a function of collision efficiency which can approach unity under favorable conditions e g particle with positive charge colliding with a negatively charged attachment site however evo has a net negative surface charge zeta potential 0 636 mv thus the collision efficiency with the sand would be expected to be low 0 01 therefore physical straining would likely impose a relatively dominant role in evo droplet retention similarly modified colloidal mg oh 2 is also negatively charged dong et al 2017 and therefore is not expected to be retained through electrical attraction on the aquifer media a related study indicated that the contact retention of colloidal mg oh 2 on porous media is mainly influenced by diffusion brownian movement physical blocking and the gravity deposition process li et al 2018 the corresponding breakthrough curves btcs show that retention times for evo and colloidal mg oh 2 are very similar in all column experiments 1 8 pv indicating the synchronous transport of the electron donor and ph buffer in various systems fig 5a and b in addition retardation factors for evo and colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media were calculated according to the btcs of a representative conservative tracer br fig 5c surprisingly the evo and colloidal mg oh 2 both migrated faster than the tracer resulting in retardation factors 1 this phenomenon can be explained by the effect of buoyancy and size exclusion of macromolecules enfield and bengtssona 2010 the larger colloidal molecules evo and colloidal mg oh 2 can be excluded from the smaller soil pores and forced to move through only the larger pores therefore the effective pore volume for evo and colloidal mg oh 2 was much less than for the water and the resultant average interstitial velocities of evo and colloidal mg oh 2 would be greater than for the water grain size of the media had a notable effect on the retention and distribution of evo and colloidal mg oh 2 in the columns a larger fraction of injectant solution was discharged from the columns packed with the coarser grained media especially for the colloidal mg oh 2 component analysis of the sands indicated that evo and colloidal mg oh 2 were distributed throughout the length of the column the retention of evo was significantly greater in fine sand than in the medium coarse sand fig 5d this is because the sorption of evo on porous media directly depends on the specific surface area and organic carbon content of sand which decreased with the increase of media grain size karickhoff et al 1979 the solid phase concentration of evo in the fine sand reached 6 mg g at the inlet and decreased with the increase of distance from the inlet however in the medium sand and the coarse sand the solid phase concentrations of evo are similar 2 mg g without a significant decrease or dilution along the length of the column alkalinity of the sand increased significantly throughout the columns at the completion of the evo cm injection fig 5e which is favorable for the in situ ph adjustment and buffering capacity higher alkalinity was observed in the finer grained media for all three porous media alkalinity was highest at the inlet as the groundwater solution was injected and flushed through the systems the colloidal mg oh 2 was displaced further into the columns and porous medium alkalinity was observed to decline along the flow direction due to dilution and dispersion results of the constant head permeameter indicate that the hydraulic conductivity k of the fine sand reduced from the initial 1 25 10 4 m s to 9 65 10 5 m s following the injection of evo cm and then increased continuously during water washing fig 6 hydraulic conductivity levels off after 60 min and was restored to 1 13 10 4 m s by the end of the 2 h test the maximum k reduction 23 was observed at the beginning of flushing which could possibly impact the amendment delivery during the early phase of remediation however the hydraulic conductivity rapidly recovered after a short period of flushing and the final permeability loss of the porous medium was only 9 6 according to coulibaly and borden 2004 permeability loss 40 is regarded as moderate for emulsified oil amendments in which case the groundwater flow bypassing around the reactive zone would not occur therefore the above results indicate that the prepared evo cm caused very slight loss of permeability and can potentially be used to form in situ reactive zone for enhanced treatment of tce contaminated groundwater 3 3 enhanced transport of tce following evo cm injection as shown in fig 7 effluent tce concentration of the control column without evo cm injection was below 0 55 mm and only 6 1 of the injected amount was discharged from the column indicating limited recovery of tce during flushing as a result of slow dissolution rates in addition the dnapl tce tends to drain downward and pool on the bottom under the influence of gravity forces jiang et al 2013 and thus cannot be as easily mobilized as the free phase upward through the column in the column treated with evo cm tce was detected in the effluent between 0 8 1 9 pv after the evo cm injection when emulsion was visually observed the effluent concentration of tce reaches a maximum of 46 mm at approximately 1 4 pv which is 80 times that observed in the control column 51 of the injected tce was transported through the column and discharged in the effluent which is consistent with the previous study conducted in similar conditions hiortdahl and borden 2014 two mechanisms are hypothesized for the significant enhancement of tce transport after evo cm injection the first one is the solubilization of tce in oil compared to the aqueous groundwater solution flush dnapl tce was miscible within the evo cm and was thus removed as an emulsified oil phase the visible emulsion in the effluent consisted of small droplets of mixed napl containing both tce and the evo cm therefore flushing evo cm through the dnapl zone can decrease the tce concentration in the aqueous phase and the associated toxicity the surfactants in the evo cm which have the ability to reduce the napl water interfacial tension and increase tce solubility in water likely play a minor role in the transport of tce because no significant increase in aqueous tce concentration was observed the second mechanism is the alteration of apparent density as evo cm is lighter than water the mixed napl has a smaller apparent density than pure tce and may be more beneficial for bulk tce oil mobilization more buoyant the enhancement of tce mobility may be undesirable under some conditions because of the possible escape of dnapl from target injection zones and pollution of clean area however in the present work the tce and the amendment formed a mixed napl phase allowing the electron acceptor tce electron donor evo and ph buffer colloidal mg oh 2 to move together that may minimize substrate delivery limitations and increase the contact time between nutrients contaminant and bacteria resulting in the improvement of the biodegradation efficiency in practical remediation processes auxiliary measures may be needed to minimize the potential negative influences while ensuring the efficiency of biodegradation 3 4 enhanced dechlorination of tce by indigenous microbes in the presence of evo cm 3 4 1 temporal changes in tce breakdown products ph mg orp fe ii and ch4 in the microcosm as shown in fig 8a the concentration of tce decreased rapidly in the initial stage day 0 2 which was likely due to the physical adsorption on the sand rather than biodegradation in this experiment the measured sand water partition coefficient kd of tce in the absence and presence of evo cm was 0 65 l kg and 1 91 l kg respectively indicating that the addition of evo cm could significantly promote the tce adsorption on the sand after that a short steady stage day 2 5 was observed the enhanced dechlorination of tce started from day 6 evidenced by a significant decrease of tce and increase in the reduction products dce and cl the concentration of tce fell below the detection limit on day 10 whereas the concentration of dce and cl increased to approximately 113 μm and 111 μm respectively based on these results the removal of tce can be divided into three stages 1 the adsorption equilibrium is completed within 48 h during the physical adsorption stage 2 the microbes are adapted to the environment within 2 3 days during slow degradation stage and 3 a stable anaerobic dechlorination stage is maintained inducing relatively rapid degradation of tce when the dechlorinating bacteria are playing a primary role in this experiment we did not observe any other subsequent dechlorination products such as vc and ethene the incomplete dechlorination which is not ideal can be explained by the fact that dce is more difficult to degrade under reducing conditions than tce and pce mirza and darwin 2017 dhc strains are the only known organisms that can carry out complete reductive dehalogenation of tce to ethene therefore a lack of presence of the specific bacteria in the indigenous community can limit the transformation of dce to vc and to ethene hence for the remediation of actual tce contaminated sites the addition of a bioaugmentation culture may be needed to ensure that the parent contaminant is reduced all the way to nontoxic end products mclean et al 2015 the ph was roughly stable at 7 5 fig 8b except for an observed decrease on day 6 which may be due to rapid substrate fermentation and acid generation with the occurrence of erd the colloidal mg oh 2 was slowly dissolved releasing sufficient amounts of oh to buffer the decreasing ph at the same time the concentration of mg2 increased significantly fig 8c the initial orp of the microcosm was approximately 250 mv fig 8d the orp then decreased significantly over time and reached an equilibrium on day 10 at approximately 50 mv which indicates a reducing condition the shift of the redox condition indicates that the electron donors released from evo cm consumed the oxidizing substances e g o2 no3 fe iii and so4 2 during the biodegradation process within the microcosm a reducing environment is conducive to the growth of microorganisms that can reductively dechlorinate tce to dce the increase in fe ii concentration over time fig 8e further indicates that fe iii was converted to fe ii by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria via stimulation from electron donors that reaction is favorable because fe ii can chemically reduce tce within a relatively short time period kim et al 2011 anaerobic fermentation of electron donors is always accompanied by the production of ch4 therefore in this biodegradation system the methanogens are potentially competing directly with the dechlorinating microorganisms for electron donors freedman and gossett 1989 however as shown in fig 8f the significant production of methane was not observed until day 20 which is much later than dce production this indicates that the methanogens lag behind the dechlorinating bacteria in the competition for the electron donor under the conditions of these experiments this suggests that such competitive impacts did not adversely affect the dechlorination of tce to dce to any significant extent 3 4 2 effect of evo mg oh 2 ratio on tce dechlorination and geochemical parameters based on the different kinetics of substrate fermentation pollutant dechlorination and hydroxide dissolution the ratio between evo and colloidal mg oh 2 is crucial to achieve a coordinated release of electron donor and oh during the anaerobic reductive dechlorination process under the conditions used the highest dechlorination efficiency was obtained in the microcosm with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 1 in which the tce was almost completely degraded generating substantial amounts of dce and cl fig 9a and b the tce concentrations in the microcosms with evo mg oh 2 ratios of 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 5 and 1 2 were approximately 120 130 μm at the end of experiments with the dechlorination efficiency below 9 the ph decreased significantly in the microcosm without mg oh 2 because of the dechlorination of tce and the fermentation of evo fig 9c in the other microcosms any decreases in ph were buffered to different extents depending on the evo mg oh 2 ratio in the microcosm with the evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 2 the final ph exceeded the initial level reaching approximately 8 5 among all the microcosms the minimum extent of ph change was observed in the microcosm with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 1 indicating an optimum condition for ph buffering the obtained results reveal that the ratio of colloidal mg oh 2 in evo cm has a significant influence on the ph insufficient mg oh 2 cannot provide enough buffering capacity to neutralize the acid substances under the experimental time frames whereas excessive mg oh 2 yields alkalinity beyond what is necessary for adequate ph control and cost effectiveness the mg2 concentration increased with the decrease of evo mg oh 2 ratio fig 9d however the ionization degree of mg oh 2 showed a reverse trend as 100 82 9 70 5 and 55 2 of total magnesium was released in the form of mg2 in microcosms with evo mg oh 2 ratios of 1 0 1 1 0 5 1 1 and 1 2 respectively that result is because the dissolution of mg oh 2 is ph dependent according to the precipitation dissolution equilibrium mg oh 2 dissolves more easily in acidic conditions releasing more alkalinity when the ph increases the dissolution of mg oh 2 is reduced due to thermodynamic constraints this mechanism ensures a relatively long lifetime of injected mg oh 2 during in situ remediation compared to the control experiments additional evo initiated greater reducing conditions within the systems the particular extent of the decrease of orp was different for the five treated microcosms fig 9e depending on the evo mg oh 2 ratio the ratio of mg oh 2 had a significant influence on orp and is related to the utilization efficiency of electron donors added in the microcosm with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 1 the ph condition was optimum for the growth of microorganisms involved in biodegradation of evo and dechlorination of tce resulting in the largest relative extent of orp decrease to estimate the total transformation of fe iii to fe ii fe in aqueous solution and in porous media were measured separately initial solid phase total iron in each microcosm was 2132 mg with fe iii and fe ii concentrations of 3 18 mg g and 0 45 mg g respectively fig 9f indicates that at the end of the experiment the tfe still mainly existed in porous media and only a small fraction was dissolved in the aqueous solution the concentration of aqueous tfe decreased with the decrease in the evo mg oh 2 ratio in this experiment the aqueous tfe concentration primarily depended on the ph condition other studies have shown that iron tends to enter the aqueous phase from the solid phase under lower ph dong et al 2018a b the redox reaction of iron was influenced by the orp condition as shown in fig 9f the total conversion ratio of fe iii to fe ii in the six microcosms were 0 79 19 5 18 9 18 5 21 3 and 19 8 respectively this indicates that the addition of evo promoted the dissimilatory fe iii reduction and the process is insensitive to the evo mg oh 2 ratio the generation of ch4 in the microcosm with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 1 was 3 times greater than that in the microcosm with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 0 5 fig 9g no significant methane production occurred in the other four microcosm experiments considering that dechlorination efficiency was also highest with an evo mg oh 2 ratio of 1 1 we can infer that the ongoing methane production did not limit the tce reduction to any significant extent 4 conclusions in this study we used evo cm as a slow release reactive reagent for the in situ remediation of tce contaminated groundwater evo cm consisted primarily of uniform droplet size d50 0 450 μm and can be prepared with good dispersibility and stability potential the evo cm was able to be transported effectively through columns packed with different porous media with grain size between 0 1 and 1 0 mm the evo and the colloidal mg oh 2 were synchronously transported through the column systems providing the microorganisms with both electron donor and alkalinity at the same location throughout space approximately 10 of the evo and 60 of the colloidal mg oh 2 were retained in the porous media and distributed throughout the length of column the amount of evo cm retained in the column was greater for the finer grained media and retention decreased with an increase in distance from the inlet only a slight permeability loss 9 6 in the fine sand was observed after the injection of evo cm the injection of evo cm significantly enhances the transport of tce in the column systems however further investigations are necessary to evaluate the pros and cons of the enhanced tce mobilization and to figure out the exact contribution of dissolution versus pure phase mixing and partitioning the addition of evo cm significantly facilitates the dechlorination of tce via the continuous supply of electron donor and alkalinity for the biodegradation process the ph decline during anaerobic reductive dechlorination was effectively inhibited due to the mg oh 2 dissociation and the orp decreased significantly transitioning from an oxidizing to a reducing condition which is accompanied with dissimilatory iron reduction any methanogens in the system did not seemingly adversely influence the dechlorination of tce the ratio of colloidal mg oh 2 in the evo cm influences not only the ph but also the utilization efficiency of the electron donors the ph dependent dissolution of mg oh 2 is favorable for long term buffering during in situ remediation the microcosm achieves an optimum dechlorination efficiency when the evo mg oh 2 ratio is 1 1 which may improve the overall remediation performance cost effectiveness for real world contamination sites in spite of the knowledge gained from this study additional studies involving microbial characterization and growth kinetics are required to deepen our understanding of the remediation mechanism of tce contaminated groundwater when we apply this coupled in situ evo cm technology acknowledgments this work was supported by the key laboratory of groundwater resources and environment ministry of education china this research was
