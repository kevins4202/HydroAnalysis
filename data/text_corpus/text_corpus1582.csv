been conducted to minimize the side effect of soil erosion in recent decades assessing soil erosion and identifying driving mechanisms are necessary due to the increased risk of ecological security in qlmnp here we employed the revised universal soil loss equation rusle to assess the soil erosion rate in qlmnp from 1982 to 2020 the driving mechanism was detected through the differences between the realistic scenario and four idealized scenarios with different fixed rusle input parameters the contributions of different driving factors soil type digital elevation model slope extreme precipitation

maintaining ecosystem stability and developing a sustainable economy amundson et al 2015 soil erosion which mainly has to do with water impact has been identified as a primary driver of soil degradation in arid and semi arid areas on a global scale panagos et al 2017 climate change and inappropriate human activities may accelerate soil erosion in some certain places rosas and gutierrez 2020 panagos and katsoyiannis 2019 indicated that more than 2 01 105 km2 of the land area is at high risk of soil erosion 1000 t km 2 yr 1 increased erosion in soil may lead to soil fertility loss land degradation and eventually a large decrease in terrestrial ecosystem productivity alewell et al 2020 li et al 2021 in addition soil erosion causes secondary environmental problems such as river siltation and water pollution which may throw the ecosystem into utter chaos garcía ruiz et al 2015 ravi et al 2010 arabameri et al 2021 indicated that soil erosion causes will lead to an 8 billion loss in global gdp each year more environmental disasters and large economic losses are projected to occur in the warming world borrelli et al 2020 therefore understanding soil erosion dynamics give governmental sectors suggestions to map out damage mitigation strategies for land degradation which is essential for ecosystem security in the warming world almagro et al 2017 xia et al 2020 large scale and long term measurements for soil erosion are difficult to achieve due to expensive economic costs various models have been therefore developed to estimate soil erosion at both regional and global scales duan et al 2020 kinnell 2015 thomas et al 2018 models are generally classified as empirical statistical models e g the revised universal soil loss equation rusle and physical models e g the water erosion prediction project wepp model pan european soil erosion assessment pesera model lugato et al 2018 rosas and gutierrez 2020 the performance of physical models has been validated in many previous soil erosion studies liu et al 2006 wu and chen 2012 however massive data is required for driving the physical model which is challenging in some specific areas and also for long timescale studies borrelli et al 2017 garcía ruiz et al 2015 in contrast the empirical statistical model rusle has been widely used to assess long term soil erosion locally and globally kinnell 2015 thomas et al 2018 the performance of the family of r usle models has been well validated during the past 10 years borrelli et al 2021 gao and wang 2019 huang et al 2021 yang et al 2021 due to the lacking of observational data in the mountainous region rusle model may be a good choice to assess the soil erosion dynamics in qlmnp soil erosion is a complicated process that could be influenced by both natural factors e g precipitation topographic conditions soil properties vegetation and human activities e g land use cover change lucc chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the characteristics of precipitation amount intensity and spatial and temporal distribution are crucial to affect soil erosion process borrelli et al 2020 li and fang 2016 ma et al 2020 both enhanced intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation caused by climate change lead to the higher risk in soil erosion li and fang 2016 mullan et al 2012 soil characteristics and topographic properties also affect the separability and mobility of soil particles which affect soil erodibility gayen et al 2019 vegetation not only affects precipitation distribution and increases runoff resistance coefficients but also modifies the physical and chemical properties of the soil and can increase soil erodibility kinnell 2015 in addition to the environmental factors lucc induced by human activities may also have to do with soil erosion smith et al 2016 some studies indicated that lucc such as industrialization urbanization unsuitable agricultural management overgrazing and deforestation may largely enhance soil erosion rate amundson et al 2015 montgomery 2007 however the other studies focusing on other lucc e g humans build terraces implement ecological protection and restoration and forbid grazing found human activities are effective to prevent soil erosion wang et al 2016b zhang et al 2021 since soil erosion is influenced by multiple variables it is important for policy makers to understand the dominated factor and the driving mechanism for soil erosion at the regionals scale when formulating the soil and water conservation strategies li and fang 2016 smith et al 2016 some studies have quantified the contribution of each factor to soil erosion amount using multiple linear regression equations or partial least squares regression yao et al 2016 however these methods are aiming at the correlation between various factors and the magnitude of soil erosion but never quantify the interactions between these factors the geodetector model focusing on detecting the spatial relationships between factors and corresponding outcomes has been used to explore the complex impacts of various factors on soil erosion xu and zhang 2020 interestingly the response of soil erosion to different factors usually features substantial heterogeneous in spatial patterns and temporal evolutions borrelli et al 2020 panagos et al 2017 in mountainous areas the assessment for soil erosion involves further challenges due to the complex terrain huang et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to conduct analysis to understand the driving mechanisms of soil erosion in specific mountain areas qilian mountain is an important ecological barrier to the hexi corridor in china and qilian mountain national park qlmnp is developed for ecological and environmental protection in the qilian mountain over the past several decades the response of qilian mountain to climate change is stronger than the response in global average huai et al 2021 both the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events in the qilian mountain region is enhanced significantly which largely increase the risk of soil erosion in qlmnp lin et al 2017 in addition illegal human activities in qlmnp e g mining unauthorized construction of hydropower stations and irregular operation of tourist facilities further damage the mountain ecosystem qian et al 2018 more recently with more concerns about the ecological issues in china a series of restoration measures e g the natural forest conservation program nfcp grazing withdrawal program gwp grain to green program gtgp and the afforestation projects to conserve the soil and water in qlmnp deng et al 2012 yet the impacts of climate change and human activities on soil erosion in qlmnp are still largely uncertain thus there is a need to study the degree of influence of different factors on soil erosion to provide support for regional ecological security protection the main objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the variations in soil erosion dynamics in qlmnp from 1982 to 2020 and 2 understand the dominant factors affecting soil erosion in qlmnp 2 methodology 2 1 study area qlmnp 36 46 45 39 47 05 n 94 49 8 102 59 08 e fig 1a is located on the border of gansu and qinghai provinces in northwest china and covers an area of approximately 50 200 km2 with surface elevations ranging from 1765 to 5604 m the qlmnp has a continental plateau climate with a mean annual rainfall that ranges from 102 50 to 740 60 mm climatological data averaged from 1982 to 2020 in addition to local precipitation melting glaciers and snow in the mountains are another water sources in the study area that provide water for the mountain ecosystem exposed soil 59 75 in 2000 and grasslands 26 37 in 2000 are the two predominant land types in qlmnp fig 1b although sparse and scattered trees and glaciers also perform crucial roles in soil and water conservation roles in the mountain ecosystem 2 2 data collection and sources the topographic soil land use cover type vegetation and precipitation data used in the rusle model were obtained from multiple sources table 1 to minimize the impacts of differences in the spatial resolutions of the datasets the variables were re sampled to a 1 km x 1 km resolution using the nearest neighborhood method this study focuses on evaluating the extreme precipitation that can induce water erosion in qlmnp therefore the threshold for extreme precipitation is defined as the precipitation which larger than 12 mm day and can lead to soil loss the frequency of extreme precipitation is defined in this study as the number of days with daily precipitation that exceeded 12 mm r12 frequency extreme precipitation intensity r12 intensity was identified as mean daily precipitation values greater than 12 mm extreme precipitation frequency and intensity raster data were obtained based on daily precipitation raster data from 1982 to 2020 2 3 soil erosion estimates and scenarios setting 2 3 1 rusle model this study used the rusle model to estimate long term soil erosion variability in qlmnp the rusle model has been widely used to assess the spatial patterns and temporal evolution of soil erosion at regional and global scales borrelli et al 2017 godoi et al 2021 wuepper et al 2020 the model is as follows 1 a k r l s c p where a is the annual soil erosion t ha 1 yr 1 k is the soil erodibility factor t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 r is the rainfall runoff erosivity factor mj mm h 1 ha 1 yr 1 l is the slope length factor dimensionless s is the slope steepness factor dimensionless c is the cover and management factor dimensionless and p is the soil conservation or prevention practices factor dimensionless k is influenced by the soil texture structure organic content and hydraulic properties in this study the environmental policy integrated climate epic model morris 2000 was used to calculate the k factor as follows 2 k epic 0 2 0 3 exp 0 0256 sand 1 slit 100 silt s ilt clay 0 3 1 0 25 oc oc exp 3 72 2 95 oc 1 0 7 sn sn exp 22 9 sn 5 51 3 sn 1 s and 100 4 k 0 01317 0 01383 0 051575 k epic where sand silt clay and oc represent the sand silt clay and organic carbon contents respectively r represents the potential ability of rainfall runoff to erode the soil in this study the daily precipitation data were used to calculate r using a power function model zhang and fu 2003 which has been widely used in china and implemented by the national water resources investigation bureau duan et al 2020 lin et al 2020 the calculation equations are as follows 5 r hm α j 1 n p j β 6 r i 1 24 r hm i 7 β 0 8363 18 177 p d 12 24 455 p y 12 8 α 21 586 β 7 1891 where r is the annual rainfall runoff erosivity r hm is the semi monthly rainfall runoff erosivity p j is the daily erosive precipitation 12 mm on the j th day of half of a month p d12 is the average rainfall intensity when the daily precipitation is greater than 12 mm p y12 is the number of days with rainfall greater than 12 mm in a year the australian smooth spline function interpolation anusplin tool was used to interpolate daily precipitation into a dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km the l and s factors were derived from the digital elevation model dem data following the method of mccool et al 1989 9 l λ 22 1 m 10 m 0 2 θ 1 0 3 1 θ 3 0 4 3 θ 5 0 5 θ 5 11 s 10 8 sin θ 0 03 θ 5 16 8 sin θ 0 05 5 θ 10 21 9 sin θ 0 96 θ 10 where λ is the slope length m θ is the slope steepness and m is a dimensionless constant based on θ c was calculated from the fractional vegetation cover fvc the long term fvc data were derived using a dimidiate pixel model carlson and ripley 1997 ding et al 2016 with corrected normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data from 1982 to 2020 considering the differences and uncertainties of the different datasets a spatiotemporal stability analysis and the statistical downscaling technique were used to correct the two ndvi datasets during the overlapped period 2000 2015 lin et al 2020 c was calculated as follows cai et al 2000 12 c 1 fvc 0 0 6508 0 3436 lg fvc 0 fvc 78 3 0 fvc 78 3 p values have been defined using land use cover data in previous studies doulabian et al 2021 gayen et al 2019 in this study p values of 0 4 0 23 0 45 0 1 0 1 0 9 and 0 were used for farmland forest grassland wetland water bareland construction land and snow ice land use cover types respectively jin et al 2021 teng et al 2018 2 3 2 scenarios setting five scenarios were established separately to investigate the driving mechanisms of soil erosion in qlmnp including one realistic scenario and four idealized scenarios all of the scenarios used the same rusle model but different input data the real scenario estimated the actual soil erosion during 1982 2020 real scenario the potential scenario estimated the maximum soil erosion in qlmnp without vegetation coverage and soil and water conservation measures potential scenario the other three idealized scenarios c fixed r fixed and p fixed scenarios were designed to analyze the factors driving soil erosion in qlmnp through comparisons with the real scenario in the c fixed scenario the land cover and management factor c were set by fixing the fvc data averaged over 1982 2020 the differences between the real and the c fixed scenarios can quantify the effects of vegetation cover on regional soil erosion similarly the r fixed scenario used a fixed r value 1982 2020 average to reflects the effect of other factors on soil erosion in a constant precipitation scenario considering the timing of ecological project implementation in qlmnp based on an analysis of land cover use changes in qlmnp from 1982 to 2020 it is known that notable land use changes began in 2000 fig s1 therefore the p values in the p fixed scenario were set using the land use cover in 2000 2 4 trend analysis trend analysis was used in this study to detect changes in soil erosion during the period of 1982 2020 the formula is as follows 13 θ slope n i 1 n i x i i 2 n i i 1 n x i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where θ slope represents the slope of the trend n is the number of years in the study and x i is the factor value in the i th year 2 5 geographical detector model by comparing the differences in soil erosion in qlmnp under the different setting scenarios a general judgment regarding the dominant drivers can be made the geodetector model was used to quantify the relative contribution of multiple factors to soil erosion this tool contains four modules for geographical detection which have been widely used to detect spatial heterogeneity and potential factors affecting erosion rates ma et al 2020 wang et al 2010 based on the findings of many soil erosion studies borrelli et al 2021 li and fang 2016 ma et al 2021 the data required for soil erosion simulations and the results of scenario setting judgments soil type elevation slope land use cover vegetation cover ndvi precipitation and extreme precipitation frequency intensity r12 frequency and r12 intensity were used as driving factors in the contribution analysis this study applied the factor and interaction detectors to explore the independent and interaction interpretation abilities of the influencing factors on soil erosion respectively the q value in the factor detector indicates the extent to which a single factor affects soil erosion larger q values indicate larger impacts on soil erosion the q value in the interaction detector reflects the extent to which the two factor interaction affects soil erosion detailed calculation and description of the q values in the model can be found in reference wang et al 2010 3 results 3 1 variations in actual soil erosion the k r ls c and p values used in this study were calculated according to the descriptions in section 2 3 the k and ls factors were fixed while the r c and p factors varied over time the r and c factors in fig 2 are multi year averages and the p factor is the value in 2000 the spatial distribution of the average annual soil erosion rate in qlmnp during 1982 2020 is shown in fig 3a the soil erosion rate in qlmnp was light dominated by slight 0 10 t ha 1 yr 1 and low 10 25 t ha 1 yr 1 erosion the areas with high annual soil losses were mainly located in the steep slope areas at high altitudes the annual realistic soil erosion real scenario trends in qlmnp are shown in fig 3b the mean annual soil erosion in qlmnp was 7 90 t ha 1 yr 1 from 1982 to 2020 in which 2020 1 21 t ha 1 yr 1 and 2012 18 27 t ha 1 yr 1 had the weakest and strongest annual soil erosion rates respectively during the study period the annual soil erosion increased by 0 13 t ha 1 yr 1 p 0 05 the spatial annual soil erosion trend ranged from 4 89 t ha 1 yr 1 to 23 64 t ha 1 yr 1 fig 3c areas exhibiting decreased 62 62 soil erosion were more numerous than those exhibiting increased erosion 37 38 fig 3d areas with significant or slight decreases in erosion represented 56 92 and 5 70 of the total respectively significant and slight increases in erosion were observed in 12 54 and 24 84 of the areas respectively however the average soil erosion increased during the study period as the increased erosion values were much larger than the decreased erosion values 3 2 soil erosion in different scenarios 3 2 1 c fixed and r fixed scenarios to determine the degree to which precipitation and vegetation cover affected soil erosion two scenarios c fixed and r fixed scenarios were performed to simulate soil erosion compared to the actual soil erosion c and r fixed vs real scenario soil erosion under the r fixed scenario differed considerably from the real and c fixed scenarios fig 4 the changes in soil erosion under the c fixed scenario were similar to the actual changes in erosion annual soil erosion in the c fixed model increased at a rate of 0 12 t ha 1 yr 1 p 0 05 while the r fixed scenario increased at a rate of 0 0069 t ha 1 yr 1 therefore it is indicated that the r factor had a much greater effect on soil erosion in qlmnp than the c factor the r factor had an obvious effect on soil erosion as the r factor is closely related to precipitation and extreme precipitation events to further explore the factors affecting soil erosion changes under the c fixed scenario were compared with changes in the r factor extreme precipitation frequency and intensity and precipitation fig 5 the variations in soil erosion in the c fixed scenario and r exhibited similar fluctuations in addition years with maximum and minimum r factor values were similar to those with high and low extreme precipitation frequencies a difference was observed in 2012 however the maximum r factor was consistent with the maximum extreme precipitation intensity therefore while studying the impact of precipitation on soil erosion more attention should be paid to extreme precipitation events 3 2 2 potential scenario to evaluate the effectiveness of vegetation coverage and soil conservation measures for reducing soil erosion we compared soil erosion under the potential and real scenarios fig 6 in the scenario potential scenario without vegetation cover and implementation of soil and water conservation measures soil erosion in qlmnp increased at a rate of 0 19 t ha 1 yr 1 p 0 05 fig 6a soil erosion in the potential scenario was notably higher than in the real scenario with the implementation of vegetation cover and soil conservation measures soil erosion reduced significantly p 0 05 compared to the potential scenario decreasing at a rate of 0 063 t ha 1 yr 1 fig 6b the implementation of vegetation protection and soil conservation measures contributed to reducing soil erosion 3 2 3 p fixed scenario the effects of soil conservation measures on soil erosion can be isolated by comparing the p fixed and real scenarios soil erosion in 1985 1990 1995 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 under the p fixed scenario were compared with actual soil erosion during the same years by extracting corresponding land use changes in areas with differences in soil erosion rates table 2 the results indicate that lucc had a substantial effect on soil erosion the soil erosion rates exhibited opposing trends under different lucc types decreased soil erosion reduction was concentrated in areas where bareland was transformed into land with vegetative cover grasslands forests and farmland snow ice wetlands or water the main lucc types with increased soil erosion were mainly grasslands transformed into bareland and construction areas as well as areas that changed from forests to grasslands and from snow ice to bareland in general grassland degradation glacial retreat deforestation and increased construction caused increased soil erosion measures such as nfcp gwp and restrictions on mining area development have contributed positively to soil conservation in qlmnp 3 3 driving factors detection factor detector was used to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of each factor that affected soil erosion in qlmnp the q values calculated for the different factors influencing soil erosion from 1985 to 2020 are shown in fig 7 the average q values decreased in the order of r12 frequency ndvi slope r12 intensity precipitation lucc soil type dem r12 frequency ndvi and slope were the three dominant contributing factors from 1985 to 2020 it was assumed that any changes in soil properties dem and slope would be minimal during the study period the results of the factor detection fig 7 indicate that the influence of each factor differed during different periods r12 frequency was consistently the largest factor contributing to soil erosion except in 1985 the contribution of vegetation cover ndvi to soil erosion was larger than that of lucc from 1985 to 2000 while the contribution of lucc was much larger than that of vegetation cover ndvi after 2000 this is due to the large changes in land use in qlmnp after 2000 which has increased the impact of lucc on soil erosion considering that soil erosion was not independently influenced by a single factor the combined effect of factors was greater than the effect of each individual factors the interaction detector module was used to estimate the effects of the interactions between the factors fig 8 although these effects varied during different periods the combination of r12 frequency and lucc was the most dominant interaction factor that explained soil erosion in qlmnp exhibiting a non linear enhancement except for r12 frequency and lucc the top three interactions affecting soil erosion were the combinations of r12 frequency and slope r12 frequency and r12 intensity and r12 intensity and lucc respectively 4 discussion since the beginning of the industrial revolution climate change has occurred due to greenhouse gas emissions and rapid economic and technological development bindoff et al 2007 precipitation in the northern hemisphere mid latitudes has increased since 1901 huang et al 2016 the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in north america europe and other continents have increased in the past few decades myhre et al 2019 more regions have experienced increases in intense precipitation events than those that have experienced decreases in extreme events boucher et al 2013 previous studies have shown that the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events have increased in the qilian mountain region lin et al 2017 soil erosion is directly caused by the dynamic action of raindrops on soil aggregates garcía ruiz et al 2015 and extreme precipitation events cause most water based erosion events herein we found that soil erosion in qlmnp was notably higher in 2012 than in other years while precipitation was not substantially higher figs 3b 5e however the intensities of the extreme precipitation events were notably higher in 2012 fig 5 according to the geographical detector model extreme precipitation plays a vital role in soil erosion in qlmnp fig 7 in the future extreme precipitation events in the qinghai tibet plateau may even double in number duan et al 2019 an increased number of extreme precipitation events will increase the risk of future soil erosion in qlmnp therefore it is crucial to implement anthropogenic soil conservation measures in qlmnp effective vegetation coverage is an important factor that affects soil erosion chen et al 2018 vegetation intercepts rainfall through its branches and leaves thereby decreasing the kinetic energy of the water droplets and reducing their effect on erosion vegetation also increases soil porosity through its root systems which accelerates water infiltration quinton et al 1997 further the root systems of vegetation consolidate the soil by preventing slope sliding and retaining water in the soil some studies have observed substantial improvements in soil and water conservation with increased vegetation cover after fencing yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 runoff and soil losses are relatively low in areas with high vegetation cover whereas surface runoff and soil losses are high in areas with low vegetation cover chen et al 2018 zheng et al 2008 in this study no obvious changes in land use patterns before 2000 were observed fig s1 and vegetation coverage had a larger impact on reducing soil erosion fig 7 human activities drive lucc affecting soil erosion borrelli et al 2017 land management and its associated lucc influence spatial patterns and the magnitudes of variations in soil erosion borrelli et al 2017 borrelli et al 2017 found that the conversion of forests to other land uses under the no soil and water conservation management scenario resulted in a 0 61 pg yr 1 increase in global soil erosion the destruction of forests also accelerates the rate of soil erosion since the implementation of the farmland to forests conversion policy by the chinese government particularly after 2000 substantial lucc has occurred large scale topographic construction vegetation planting and banning of cultivation have contributed to the survival of planted vegetation and the successful restoration of natural vegetation wang et al 2016a studies have suggested that increased forest area restoration will notably reduce soil erosion deng et al 2012 wang et al 2016b it was also found that converting other land use types to forests reduced soil erosion in qlmnp table 2 ecological restoration measures help slow soil erosion while some human activities accelerate soil erosion the overexploitation of mineral resources has resulted in deforestation and has exposed more land huang et al 2021 in addition increased glacial melting caused by anthropogenic warming has resulted in increased runoff and exposed ground thereby increasing soil erosion wan et al 2019 yang et al 2006 in recent years the intensification of warm and humid climate in qlmnp has led to glacial retreat peng et al 2021 therefore soil erosion has increased in the areas around glaciers fig 3d in general lucc caused by human significantly affects the rate of soil erosion therefore the risk of soil erosion due to climate change can be better mitigated by implementing appropriate conservation measures spring snowmelt or frequent winter melting is also an important source of erosion particularly in areas with high snowfall guo et al 2019 repeated snowmelt in winter and the formation of runoff from snowmelt in spring will damage the soil ala aho et al 2021 previous studies have combined erosion due to snowmelt into r values when applying the rusle model to reflect regional soil erosion studies have mainly obtained the sum of rainfall and snowmelt erosion mainly by dividing the year into warm and wet seasons wang et al 2020 2017 the percentage of snowfall erosion in these study areas was greater than 10 of the annual precipitation in most cases when the snowfall exceeded 10 of the annual precipitation the snowmelt runoff erosion force was considered jiao et al 2009 precipitation in the qilian mountain region occurs mainly as rainfall and is concentrated from may to september of each year tian et al 2016 the snowfall period in this study is identified as november to april based on the monthly average precipitation over 1982 2020 fig s2 the precipitation from november to april accounts for 9 94 of annual total precipitation in addition the daytime temperature in early november and april is higher than 0 therefore not all precipitation during this period is the solid phase hence the amount of snowfall is less than 10 of the annual precipitation therefore although the r factor used in this study does not consider snowmelt runoff erosion it can also better reflect the pattern of regional soil erosion changes undeniably despite the low snowfall percentage runoff from snowmelt will also affect regional soil erosion and not considering snowmelt erosion will result in an underestimations of regional soil erosion mouris et al 2022 wang et al 2021 particularly in the context of climatic warming the snowmelt rate will increase further in the future wang and qin 2017 in addition frequent winter snowmelt indeed leads to increased regional soil erosion and the repeated snowmelt freeze thaw process belongs to freeze thaw erosion wan et al 2019 wu et al 2018 moreover if freeze thaw erosion is taken into account while the study does not consider the melting effects of permanent glaciers in the region the resulting estimated soil erosion is not reasonable hence this study mainly considered hydraulic erosion and explored its driving factors to further improve the accuracy of soil erosion estimates the estimation of snowmelt runoff erosion and freeze thaw erosion should be evaluated in future studies 5 conclusion in this paper we made use of the to assess the soil erosion rate in qlmnp from 1982 to 2020 one realistic scenario and four idealized scenarios driven with different fixed rusle input parameters were compared to analyze the driving mechanisms the geodetector model was further used to quantify the contributions of each driving factors the results show that the annual average soil erosion in qlmnp was 7 90 t ha 1 yr 1 the average rate over qlmnp increased at 0 13 t ha 1 yr 1 from 1982 to 2020 although the slightly decrease was found in the majority 62 62 area extreme precipitation was the dominated driving factor for soil erosion in the past four decades in contrast land use cover change aiming at soil and water conservation contribute to mitigating soil erosion in qlmnp the results from the geodetector model indicate that the interaction between extreme precipitation frequency and lucc dominated soil erosion dynamics in qlmnp during 1982 2020 ecological projects are effective to mitigate the soil erosion and may partly counteract the side effect of climate change funding this study was supported by the national key research and development program

2020 panagos and katsoyiannis 2019 indicated that more than 2 01 105 km2 of the land area is at high risk of soil erosion 1000 t km 2 yr 1 increased erosion in soil may lead to soil fertility loss land degradation and eventually a large decrease in terrestrial ecosystem productivity alewell et al 2020 li et al 2021 in addition soil erosion causes secondary environmental problems such as river siltation and water pollution which may throw the ecosystem into utter chaos garcía ruiz et al 2015 ravi et al 2010 arabameri et al 2021 indicated that soil erosion causes will lead to an 8 billion loss in global gdp each year more environmental disasters and large economic losses are projected to occur in the warming world borrelli et al 2020 therefore understanding soil erosion dynamics give governmental sectors suggestions to map out damage mitigation strategies for land degradation which is essential for ecosystem security in the warming world almagro et al 2017 xia et al 2020 large scale and long term measurements for soil erosion are difficult to achieve due to expensive economic costs various models have been therefore developed to estimate soil erosion at both regional and global scales duan et al 2020 kinnell 2015 thomas et al 2018 models are generally classified as empirical statistical models e g the revised universal soil loss equation rusle and physical models e g the water erosion prediction project wepp model pan european soil erosion assessment pesera model lugato et al 2018 rosas and gutierrez 2020 the performance of physical models has been validated in many previous soil erosion studies liu et al 2006 wu and chen 2012 however massive data is required for driving the physical model which is challenging in some specific areas and also for long timescale studies borrelli et al 2017 garcía ruiz et al 2015 in contrast the empirical statistical model rusle has been widely used to assess long term soil erosion locally and globally kinnell 2015 thomas et al 2018 the performance of the family of r usle models has been well validated during the past 10 years borrelli et al 2021 gao and wang 2019 huang et al 2021 yang et al 2021 due to the lacking of observational data in the mountainous region rusle model may be a good choice to assess the soil erosion dynamics in qlmnp soil erosion is a complicated process that could be influenced by both natural factors e g precipitation topographic conditions soil properties vegetation and human activities e g land use cover change lucc chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the characteristics of precipitation amount intensity and spatial and temporal distribution are crucial to affect soil erosion process borrelli et al 2020 li and fang 2016 ma et al 2020 both enhanced intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation caused by climate change lead to the higher risk in soil erosion li and fang 2016 mullan et al 2012 soil characteristics and topographic properties also affect the separability and mobility of soil particles which affect soil erodibility gayen et al 2019 vegetation not only affects precipitation distribution and increases runoff resistance coefficients but also modifies the physical and chemical properties of the soil and can increase soil erodibility kinnell 2015 in addition to the environmental factors lucc induced by human activities may also have to do with soil erosion smith et al 2016 some studies indicated that lucc such as industrialization urbanization unsuitable agricultural management overgrazing and deforestation may largely enhance soil erosion rate amundson et al 2015 montgomery 2007 however the other studies focusing on other lucc e g humans build terraces implement ecological protection and restoration and forbid grazing found human activities are effective to prevent soil erosion wang et al 2016b zhang et al 2021 since soil erosion is influenced by multiple variables it is important for policy makers to understand the dominated factor and the driving mechanism for soil erosion at the regionals scale when formulating the soil and water conservation strategies li and fang 2016 smith et al 2016 some studies have quantified the contribution of each factor to soil erosion amount using multiple linear regression equations or partial least squares regression yao et al 2016 however these methods are aiming at the correlation between various factors and the magnitude of soil erosion but never quantify the interactions between these factors the geodetector model focusing on detecting the spatial relationships between factors and corresponding outcomes has been used to explore the complex impacts of various factors on soil erosion xu and zhang 2020 interestingly the response of soil erosion to different factors usually features substantial heterogeneous in spatial patterns and temporal evolutions borrelli et al 2020 panagos et al 2017 in mountainous areas the assessment for soil erosion involves further challenges due to the complex terrain huang et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to conduct analysis to understand the driving mechanisms of soil erosion in specific mountain areas qilian mountain is an important ecological barrier to the hexi corridor in china and qilian mountain national park qlmnp is developed for ecological and environmental protection in the qilian mountain over the past several decades the response of qilian mountain to climate change is stronger than the response in global average huai et al 2021 both the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events in the qilian mountain region is enhanced significantly which largely increase the risk of soil erosion in qlmnp lin et al 2017 in addition illegal human activities in qlmnp e g mining unauthorized construction of hydropower stations and irregular operation of tourist facilities further damage the mountain ecosystem qian et al 2018 more recently with more concerns about the ecological issues in china a series of restoration measures e g the natural forest conservation program nfcp grazing withdrawal program gwp grain to green program gtgp and the afforestation projects to conserve the soil and water in qlmnp deng et al 2012 yet the impacts of climate change and human activities on soil erosion in qlmnp are still largely uncertain thus there is a need to study the degree of influence of different factors on soil erosion to provide support for regional ecological security protection the main objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the variations in soil erosion dynamics in qlmnp from 1982 to 2020 and 2 understand the dominant factors affecting soil erosion in qlmnp 2 methodology 2 1 study area qlmnp 36 46 45 39 47 05 n 94 49 8 102 59 08 e fig 1a is located on the border of gansu and qinghai provinces in northwest china and covers an area of approximately 50 200 km2 with surface elevations ranging from 1765 to 5604 m the qlmnp has a continental plateau climate with a mean annual rainfall that ranges from 102 50 to 740 60 mm climatological data averaged from 1982 to 2020 in addition to local precipitation melting glaciers and snow in the mountains are another water sources in the study area that provide water for the mountain ecosystem exposed soil 59 75 in 2000 and grasslands 26 37 in 2000 are the two predominant land types in qlmnp fig 1b although sparse and scattered trees and glaciers also perform crucial roles in soil and water conservation roles in the mountain ecosystem 2 2 data collection and sources the topographic soil land use cover type vegetation and precipitation data used in the rusle model were obtained from multiple sources table 1 to minimize the impacts of differences in the spatial resolutions of the datasets the variables were re sampled to a 1 km x 1 km resolution using the nearest neighborhood method this study focuses on evaluating the extreme precipitation that can induce water erosion in qlmnp therefore the threshold for extreme precipitation is defined as the precipitation which larger than 12 mm day and can lead to soil loss the frequency of extreme precipitation is defined in this study as the number of days with daily precipitation that exceeded 12 mm r12 frequency extreme precipitation intensity r12 intensity was identified as mean daily precipitation values greater than 12 mm extreme precipitation frequency and intensity raster data were obtained based on daily precipitation raster data from 1982 to 2020 2 3 soil erosion estimates and scenarios setting 2 3 1 rusle model this study used the rusle model to estimate long term soil erosion variability in qlmnp the rusle model has been widely used to assess the spatial patterns and temporal evolution of soil erosion at regional and global scales borrelli et al 2017 godoi et al 2021 wuepper et al 2020 the model is as follows 1 a k r l s c p where a is the annual soil erosion t ha 1 yr 1 k is the soil erodibility factor t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 r is the rainfall runoff erosivity factor mj mm h 1 ha 1 yr 1 l is the slope length factor dimensionless s is the slope steepness factor dimensionless c is the cover and management factor dimensionless and p is the soil conservation or prevention practices factor dimensionless k is influenced by the soil texture structure organic content and hydraulic properties in this study the environmental policy integrated climate epic model morris 2000 was used to calculate the k factor as follows 2 k epic 0 2 0 3 exp 0 0256 sand 1 slit 100 silt s ilt clay 0 3 1 0 25 oc oc exp 3 72 2 95 oc 1 0 7 sn sn exp 22 9 sn 5 51 3 sn 1 s and 100 4 k 0 01317 0 01383 0 051575 k epic where sand silt clay and oc represent the sand silt clay and organic carbon contents respectively r represents the potential ability of rainfall runoff to erode the soil in this study the daily precipitation data were used to calculate r using a power function model zhang and fu 2003 which has been widely used in china and implemented by the national water resources investigation bureau duan et al 2020 lin et al 2020 the calculation equations are as follows 5 r hm α j 1 n p j β 6 r i 1 24 r hm i 7 β 0 8363 18 177 p d 12 24 455 p y 12 8 α 21 586 β 7 1891 where r is the annual rainfall runoff erosivity r hm is the semi monthly rainfall runoff erosivity p j is the daily erosive precipitation 12 mm on the j th day of half of a month p d12 is the average rainfall intensity when the daily precipitation is greater than 12 mm p y12 is the number of days with rainfall greater than 12 mm in a year the australian smooth spline function interpolation anusplin tool was used to interpolate daily precipitation into a dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km the l and s factors were derived from the digital elevation model dem data following the method of mccool et al 1989 9 l λ 22 1 m 10 m 0 2 θ 1 0 3 1 θ 3 0 4 3 θ 5 0 5 θ 5 11 s 10 8 sin θ 0 03 θ 5 16 8 sin θ 0 05 5 θ 10 21 9 sin θ 0 96 θ 10 where λ is the slope length m θ is the slope steepness and m is a dimensionless constant based on θ c was calculated from the fractional vegetation cover fvc the long term fvc data were derived using a dimidiate pixel model carlson and ripley 1997 ding et al 2016 with corrected normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data from 1982 to 2020 considering the differences and uncertainties of the different datasets a spatiotemporal stability analysis and the statistical downscaling technique were used to correct the two ndvi datasets during the overlapped period 2000 2015 lin et al 2020 c was calculated as follows cai et al 2000 12 c 1 fvc 0 0 6508 0 3436 lg fvc 0 fvc 78 3 0 fvc 78 3 p values have been defined using land use cover data in previous studies doulabian et al 2021 gayen et al 2019 in this study p values of 0 4 0 23 0 45 0 1 0 1 0 9 and 0 were used for farmland forest grassland wetland water bareland construction land and snow ice land use cover types respectively jin et al 2021 teng et al 2018 2 3 2 scenarios setting five scenarios were established separately to investigate the driving mechanisms of soil erosion in qlmnp including one realistic scenario and four idealized scenarios all of the scenarios used the same rusle model but different input data the real scenario estimated the actual soil erosion during 1982 2020 real scenario the potential scenario estimated the maximum soil erosion in qlmnp without vegetation coverage and soil and water conservation measures potential scenario the other three idealized scenarios c fixed r fixed and p fixed scenarios were designed to analyze the factors driving soil erosion in qlmnp through comparisons with the real scenario in the c fixed scenario the land cover and management factor c were set by fixing the fvc data averaged over 1982 2020 the differences between the real and the c fixed scenarios can quantify the effects of vegetation cover on regional soil erosion similarly the r fixed scenario used a fixed r value 1982 2020 average to reflects the effect of other factors on soil erosion in a constant precipitation scenario considering the timing of ecological project implementation in qlmnp based on an analysis of land cover use changes in qlmnp from 1982 to 2020 it is known that notable land use changes began in 2000 fig s1 therefore the p values in the p fixed scenario were set using the land use cover in 2000 2 4 trend analysis trend analysis was used in this study to detect changes in soil erosion during the period of 1982 2020 the formula is as follows 13 θ slope n i 1 n i x i i 2 n i i 1 n x i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where θ slope represents the slope of the trend n is the number of years in the study and x i is the factor value in the i th year 2 5 geographical detector model by comparing the differences in soil erosion in qlmnp under the different setting scenarios a general judgment regarding the dominant drivers can be made the geodetector model was used to quantify the relative contribution of multiple factors to soil erosion this tool contains four modules for geographical detection which have been widely used to detect spatial heterogeneity and potential factors affecting erosion rates ma et al 2020 wang et al 2010 based on the findings of many soil erosion studies borrelli et al 2021 li and fang 2016 ma et al 2021 the data required for soil erosion simulations and the results of scenario setting judgments soil type elevation slope land use cover vegetation cover ndvi precipitation and extreme precipitation frequency intensity r12 frequency and r12 intensity were used as driving factors in the contribution analysis this study applied the factor and interaction detectors to explore the independent and interaction interpretation abilities of the influencing factors on soil erosion respectively the q value in the factor detector indicates the extent to which a single factor affects soil erosion larger q values indicate larger impacts on soil erosion the q value in the interaction detector reflects the extent to which the two factor interaction affects soil erosion detailed calculation and description of the q values in the model can be found in reference wang et al 2010 3 results 3 1 variations in actual soil erosion the k r ls c and p values used in this study were calculated according to the descriptions in section 2 3 the k and ls factors were fixed while the r c and p factors varied over time the r and c factors in fig 2 are multi year averages and the p factor is the value in 2000 the spatial distribution of the average annual soil erosion rate in qlmnp during 1982 2020 is shown in fig 3a the soil erosion rate in qlmnp was light dominated by slight 0 10 t ha 1 yr 1 and low 10 25 t ha 1 yr 1 erosion the areas with high annual soil losses were mainly located in the steep slope areas at high altitudes the annual realistic soil erosion real scenario trends in qlmnp are shown in fig 3b the mean annual soil erosion in qlmnp was 7 90 t ha 1 yr 1 from 1982 to 2020 in which 2020 1 21 t ha 1 yr 1 and 2012 18 27 t ha 1 yr 1 had the weakest and strongest annual soil erosion rates respectively during the study period the annual soil erosion increased by 0 13 t ha 1 yr 1 p 0 05 the spatial annual soil erosion trend ranged from 4 89 t ha 1 yr 1 to 23 64 t ha 1 yr 1 fig 3c areas exhibiting decreased 62 62 soil erosion were more numerous than those exhibiting increased erosion 37 38 fig 3d areas with significant or slight decreases in erosion represented 56 92 and 5 70 of the total respectively significant and slight increases in erosion were observed in 12 54 and 24 84 of the areas respectively however the average soil erosion increased during the study period as the increased erosion values were much larger than the decreased erosion values 3 2 soil erosion in different scenarios 3 2 1 c fixed and r fixed scenarios to determine the degree to which precipitation and vegetation cover affected soil erosion two scenarios c fixed and r fixed scenarios were performed to simulate soil erosion compared to the actual soil erosion c and r fixed vs real scenario soil erosion under the r fixed scenario differed considerably from the real and c fixed scenarios fig 4 the changes in soil erosion under the c fixed scenario were similar to the actual changes in erosion annual soil erosion in the c fixed model increased at a rate of 0 12 t ha 1 yr 1 p 0 05 while the r fixed scenario increased at a rate of 0 0069 t ha 1 yr 1 therefore it is indicated that the r factor had a much greater effect on soil erosion in qlmnp than the c factor the r factor had an obvious effect on soil erosion as the r factor is closely related to precipitation and extreme precipitation events to further explore the factors affecting soil erosion changes under the c fixed scenario were compared with changes in the r factor extreme precipitation frequency and intensity and precipitation fig 5 the variations in soil erosion in the c fixed scenario and r exhibited similar fluctuations in addition years with maximum and minimum r factor values were similar to those with high and low extreme precipitation frequencies a difference was observed in 2012 however the maximum r factor was consistent with the maximum extreme precipitation intensity therefore while studying the impact of precipitation on soil erosion more attention should be paid to extreme precipitation events 3 2 2 potential scenario to evaluate the effectiveness of vegetation coverage and soil conservation measures for reducing soil erosion we compared soil erosion under the potential and real scenarios fig 6 in the scenario potential scenario without vegetation cover and implementation of soil and water conservation measures soil erosion in qlmnp increased at a rate of 0 19 t ha 1 yr 1 p 0 05 fig 6a soil erosion in the potential scenario was notably higher than in the real scenario with the implementation of vegetation cover and soil conservation measures soil erosion reduced significantly p 0 05 compared to the potential scenario decreasing at a rate of 0 063 t ha 1 yr 1 fig 6b the implementation of vegetation protection and soil conservation measures contributed to reducing soil erosion 3 2 3 p fixed scenario the effects of soil conservation measures on soil erosion can be isolated by comparing the p fixed and real scenarios soil erosion in 1985 1990 1995 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 under the p fixed scenario were compared with actual soil erosion during the same years by extracting corresponding land use changes in areas with differences in soil erosion rates table 2 the results indicate that lucc had a substantial effect on soil erosion the soil erosion rates exhibited opposing trends under different lucc types decreased soil erosion reduction was concentrated in areas where bareland was transformed into land with vegetative cover grasslands forests and farmland snow ice wetlands or water the main lucc types with increased soil erosion were mainly grasslands transformed into bareland and construction areas as well as areas that changed from forests to grasslands and from snow ice to bareland in general grassland degradation glacial retreat deforestation and increased construction caused increased soil erosion measures such as nfcp gwp and restrictions on mining area development have contributed positively to soil conservation in qlmnp 3 3 driving factors detection factor detector was used to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of each factor that affected soil erosion in qlmnp the q values calculated for the different factors influencing soil erosion from 1985 to 2020 are shown in fig 7 the average q values decreased in the order of r12 frequency ndvi slope r12 intensity precipitation lucc soil type dem r12 frequency ndvi and slope were the three dominant contributing factors from 1985 to 2020 it was assumed that any changes in soil properties dem and slope would be minimal during the study period the results of the factor detection fig 7 indicate that the influence of each factor differed during different periods r12 frequency was consistently the largest factor contributing to soil erosion except in 1985 the contribution of vegetation cover ndvi to soil erosion was larger than that of lucc from 1985 to 2000 while the contribution of lucc was much larger than that of vegetation cover ndvi after 2000 this is due to the large changes in land use in qlmnp after 2000 which has increased the impact of lucc on soil erosion considering that soil erosion was not independently influenced by a single factor the combined effect of factors was greater than the effect of each individual factors the interaction detector module was used to estimate the effects of the interactions between the factors fig 8 although these effects varied during different periods the combination of r12 frequency and lucc was the most dominant interaction factor that explained soil erosion in qlmnp exhibiting a non linear enhancement except for r12 frequency and lucc the top three interactions affecting soil erosion were the combinations of r12 frequency and slope r12 frequency and r12 intensity and r12 intensity and lucc respectively 4 discussion since the beginning of the industrial revolution climate change has occurred due to greenhouse gas emissions and rapid economic and technological development bindoff et al 2007 precipitation in the northern hemisphere mid latitudes has increased since 1901 huang et al 2016 the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in north america europe and other continents have increased in the past few decades myhre et al 2019 more regions have experienced increases in intense precipitation events than those that have experienced decreases in extreme events boucher et al 2013 previous studies have shown that the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events have increased in the qilian mountain region lin et al 2017 soil erosion is directly caused by the dynamic action of raindrops on soil aggregates garcía ruiz et al 2015 and extreme precipitation events cause most water based erosion events herein we found that soil erosion in qlmnp was notably higher in 2012 than in other years while precipitation was not substantially higher figs 3b 5e however the intensities of the extreme precipitation events were notably higher in 2012 fig 5 according to the geographical detector model extreme precipitation plays a vital role in soil erosion in qlmnp fig 7 in the future extreme precipitation events in the qinghai tibet plateau may even double in number duan et al 2019 an increased number of extreme precipitation events will increase the risk of future soil erosion in qlmnp therefore it is crucial to implement anthropogenic soil conservation measures in qlmnp effective vegetation coverage is an important factor that affects soil erosion chen et al 2018 vegetation intercepts rainfall through its branches and leaves thereby decreasing the kinetic energy of the water droplets and reducing their effect on erosion vegetation also increases soil porosity through its root systems which accelerates water infiltration quinton et al 1997 further the root systems of vegetation consolidate the soil by preventing slope sliding and retaining water in the soil some studies have observed substantial improvements in soil and water conservation with increased vegetation cover after fencing yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 runoff and soil losses are relatively low in areas with high vegetation cover whereas surface runoff and soil losses are high in areas with low vegetation cover chen et al 2018 zheng et al 2008 in this study no obvious changes in land use patterns before 2000 were observed fig s1 and vegetation coverage had a larger impact on reducing soil erosion fig 7 human activities drive lucc affecting soil erosion borrelli et al 2017 land management and its associated lucc influence spatial patterns and the magnitudes of variations in soil erosion borrelli et al 2017 borrelli et al 2017 found that the conversion of forests to other land uses under the no soil and water conservation management scenario resulted in a 0 61 pg yr 1 increase in global soil erosion the destruction of forests also accelerates the rate of soil erosion since the implementation of the farmland to forests conversion policy by the chinese government particularly after 2000 substantial lucc has occurred large scale topographic construction vegetation planting and banning of cultivation have contributed to the survival of planted vegetation and the successful restoration of natural vegetation wang et al 2016a studies have suggested that increased forest area restoration will notably reduce soil erosion deng et al 2012 wang et al 2016b it was also found that converting other land use types to forests reduced soil erosion in qlmnp table 2 ecological restoration measures help slow soil erosion while some human activities accelerate soil erosion the overexploitation of mineral resources has resulted in deforestation and has exposed more land huang et al 2021 in addition increased glacial melting caused by anthropogenic warming has resulted in increased runoff and exposed ground thereby increasing soil erosion wan et al 2019 yang et al 2006 in recent years the intensification of warm and humid climate in qlmnp has led to glacial retreat peng et al 2021 therefore soil erosion has increased in the areas around glaciers fig 3d in general lucc caused by human significantly affects the rate of soil erosion therefore the risk of soil erosion due to climate change can be better mitigated by implementing appropriate conservation measures spring snowmelt or frequent winter melting is also an important source of erosion particularly in areas with high snowfall guo et al 2019 repeated snowmelt in winter and the formation of runoff from snowmelt in spring will damage the soil ala aho et al 2021 previous studies have combined erosion due to snowmelt into r values when applying the rusle model to reflect regional soil erosion studies have mainly obtained the sum of rainfall and snowmelt erosion mainly by dividing the year into warm and wet seasons wang et al 2020 2017 the percentage of snowfall erosion in these study areas was greater than 10 of the annual precipitation in most cases when the snowfall exceeded 10 of the annual precipitation the snowmelt runoff erosion force was considered jiao et al 2009 precipitation in the qilian mountain region occurs mainly as rainfall and is concentrated from may to september of each year tian et al 2016 the snowfall period in this study is identified as november to april based on the monthly average precipitation over 1982 2020 fig s2 the precipitation from november to april accounts for 9 94 of annual total precipitation in addition the daytime temperature in early november and april is higher than 0 therefore not all precipitation during this period is the solid phase hence the amount of snowfall is less than 10 of the annual precipitation therefore although the r factor used in this study does not consider snowmelt runoff erosion it can also better reflect the pattern of regional soil erosion changes undeniably despite the low snowfall percentage runoff from snowmelt will also affect regional soil erosion and not considering snowmelt erosion will result in an underestimations of regional soil erosion mouris et al 2022 wang et al 2021 particularly in the context of climatic warming the snowmelt rate will increase further in the future wang and qin 2017 in addition frequent winter snowmelt indeed leads to increased regional soil erosion and the repeated snowmelt freeze thaw process belongs to freeze thaw erosion wan et al 2019 wu et al 2018 moreover if freeze thaw erosion is taken into account while the study does not consider the melting effects of permanent glaciers in the region the resulting estimated soil erosion is not reasonable hence this study mainly considered hydraulic erosion and explored its driving factors to further improve the accuracy of soil erosion estimates the estimation of snowmelt runoff erosion and freeze thaw erosion should be evaluated in future studies 5 conclusion in this paper we made use of the to assess the soil erosion rate in qlmnp from 1982 to 2020 one realistic scenario and four idealized scenarios driven with different fixed rusle input parameters were compared to analyze the driving mechanisms the geodetector model was further used to quantify the contributions of each driving factors the results show that the annual average soil erosion in qlmnp was 7 90 t ha 1 yr 1 the average rate over qlmnp increased at 0 13 t ha 1 yr 1 from 1982 to 2020 although the slightly decrease was found in the majority 62 62 area extreme precipitation was the dominated driving factor for soil erosion in the past four decades in contrast land use cover change aiming at soil and water conservation contribute to mitigating soil erosion in qlmnp the results from the geodetector model indicate that the interaction between extreme precipitation frequency and lucc dominated soil erosion dynamics in qlmnp during 1982 2020 ecological projects are effective to mitigate the soil erosion and may partly counteract the side effect of climate change funding this study was supported by the national key research and development program

which may exacerbate changes in the abnormal temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation chou and lan 2012 this phenomenon may lead to an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events and the intensity and time of precipitation in the basin lei et al 2021 gu et al 2017 in addition the water surface evaporation rate of large reservoirs will also increase which leads to an increase in the intensity and frequency of precipitation in the reservoir area pielke 2001 pizarro et al 2013 reservoirs play a crucial role in solving water shortages power generation shipping flood control and irrigation lehner et al 2011 over the last century tens of thousands of large reservoirs and dams have been built around the world vörösmarty et al 2003 chao et al 2008 however despite the

degu et al 2011 hossain et al 2010b make their existence controversial in addition the construction of reservoirs provides substantial social benefits but changes the natural state of the watershed and the surface hydrological situation which changes the original water cycle structure and may also affect near surface meteorological conditions and mesoscale or weather scale processes song et al 2017 wu et al 2012 as a huge artificial lake a reservoir has larger thermal inertia lower roughness and lower albedo than land bonan 1995 the climatic effect of the reservoir is mainly reflected in the change in the underlying surface of the ground from the original land to the water surface which increases the local humidity in addition the thermal properties radiation balance heat balance and surface roughness of the area have also changed affecting the local microclimate in and around the reservoir area niyogi et al 2010 takata et al 2009 these changes are for example those in the local precipitation pattern and daily temperature range pielke et al 2009 boulange et al 2021 studies have shown that changes in regional temperature and precipitation caused by changes in the underlying surface are equivalent to or greater than the effects of greenhouse gases pielke 2005 pielke et al 2017 the mechanism of climate change caused by underlying surface changes cannot be ignored feddema et al 2005 astorga 1994 demonstrated that the establishment of reservoirs in the spanish mountain watershed may have a significant effect on precipitation temperature and fog thus inferring local scale microclimate changes in the reservoir area clark and arritt 1995 used a one dimensional column version of a primitive equation model to find that an increase in the underlying surface moisture can promote convection which leads to an increase in precipitation to a certain extent hossain et al 2009 analyzed the empirical quantiles of 92 precipitation stations covering 633 large dams and confirmed that large reservoirs affect extreme precipitation in the reservoir area i e that after the completion of the dam precipitation in the 99th percentile increased by an average of 4 per year the change of precipitation structure provides the possibility for the formation of drought and flood events huang et al 2019 wei et al 2021 as extreme weather drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa is more likely to cause varying degrees of damage to global agriculture ecology and the environment than other weather conditions fang et al 2020 liu et al 2015 therefore analyzing the change characteristics of regional precipitation concentration and drought events is of substantial significance for the prevention of dfaa events and the regulation of water resources under the influence of large scale water conservancy projects there have been some attempts to study the relationship between precipitation concentration and dfaa in regions or river basins zheng et al 2017 huang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 guo et al 2020 shi et al 2021 for instance guo et al 2020 analyzed the precipitation concentration and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index in mainland china and explored the potential relationship between precipitation concentration and drought zheng et al 2017 studied the correlation between precipitation concentration and elevation in the pearl river basin and identified the contribution of atmospheric circulation factors to precipitation concentration shi et al 2021 defined the long period abrupt alternation index and analyzed the evolving law and driving factors of dfaa events in the wei river basin the previous studies are based on the analysis of the temporal and spatial laws of precipitation structures in medium and large scale watersheds or an analysis of dfaa events but only a few have analyzed the precipitation structure in watersheds affected by local climate changes in the reservoir area and explored its potential connection with dfaa events three gorges reservoir tgr is the world s largest dam and huge artificial lakes formed by anti seasonal regulation after its operation may change the regional climate of the reservoir area wang et al 2011 as the combined influence of climate change human activities and water conservancy project storage increases the likelihood of extreme precipitation events and drought events in the reservoir area especially droughts and floods causing serious losses to the regional economy and agriculture increases therefore the tgr area was selected as the research object to explore the change characteristics of its precipitation concentration and analyze its potential correlation with drought and flood events progress has been made in the study of precipitation structure and dfaa events but the following limitations in the literature have necessitated further research 1 studies have focused on a large scale or basin scale and not analyzed changes in precipitation structure before and after water storage in the reservoir area 2 due to the absence of research on long sequence scale dfaa no detailed analysis of its spatiotemporal scale has been conducted 3 the research has mainly focused on the analysis of the evolution of precipitation structure single cause analysis and the study of its evolution and coping mechanism however previous studies did not establish a relationship between precipitation structure and dfaa this research has formed a systematic research method of precipitation structure and the occurrence of drought and flooding in synchrony hence the research objectives are as follows 1 explore the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation concentration under the influence of climate change and the operation of large scale reservoirs 2 analyze the temporal and spatial distribution frequency and characteristics of dfaa events before and after the impoundment of the tgr and 3 using the multi time scale mutual information entropy mtsmie method proposed in this study explore the potential correlation and synchronization between multi scale drought and flood sharp transitions and precipitation concentration and atmospheric circulation factors the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study area and data sources section 3 introduces the research ideas and methods section 4 presents the results and discussion and section 5 summarizes the main findings 2 study area and data source 2 1 study area the tgr region lies within the catchment range between the dam location and the tail of the backwater of the supply after the impoundment of the tgr wang et al 2019 it is located at the end of the upper reaches of the yangtze river 28 26 31 73 n 105 43 111 13 e fig 1 its main channel is 658 km long and covers an area of 59326 km2 in terms of geography the terrain is undulating and the regional elevation increases from southeast to northwest with a height difference of about 1000 2500 m the tgr area is in a subtropical monsoon climate mainly influenced by canyon landforms this climatic feature combined with the local undulating topography has shaped the complex rainfall conditions in the tgr area lü et al 2018 the annual average precipitation is between 820 mm and 1420 mm the annual average evapotranspiration is between 560 mm and 1000 mm the annual average relative humidity in the reservoir area was high at 70 80 we divided the tgr area into three sub areas according to the distance from the dam and the administrative area the head of the reservoir area is located in the northeast of the tgr area the tail of the reservoir area is located in the southwest of the tgr area and the middle of the reservoir area is between them 2 2 data data used in this research are from 18 national meteorological stations in the tgr area namely the daily precipitation data from 1959 to 2019 under quality control fig 1 and table s1 daily precipitation data were downloaded from the website provided by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration http data cma cn all meteorological data have undergone strict quality control by china meteorological administration including checks of extreme values internal consistency and spatial consistency zhang et al 2020 for stations with missing data less than two months we select at least three adjacent stations for interpolation to fill in the missing data the long term annual average standard deviation maximum and minimum values of the observed precipitation at each station are shown in table 1 low frequency climate factors north pacific oscillation npo pacific decadal oscillation pdo arctic oscillation ao and southern oscillation index soi were selected as the influencing factors of global climate change the previous studies have shown that npo pdo ao and soi are significantly correlated with extreme precipitation in southern china zhang et al 2019 gao et al 2018 hao et al 2019 the low frequency climate factor data were downloaded from the noaa oar esrl psl boulder colorado usa http psl noaa gov more details of these datasets can be found in table 2 3 methodology the main innovative contribution of this research is the systematic analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution trend of precipitation concentration before and after the impoundment of the tgr area on the basis of the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise method ceemdan colominas et al 2014 and the theory of mutual information entropy the concept of mtsmie is proposed to reveal the relevant information among the multi scale dfaa precipitation concentration and climatic factors in the tgr area for analysis fig 2 1 precipitation directly affects the drought process in the region and has a direct impact on the frequency of sudden drought and flood events this part is based on the precipitation meteorological data of the tgr area from 1959 to 2019 we calculated the change in precipitation concentration in the reservoir area over the 60 year period to assess the temporal and spatial changes in precipitation concentration in the tgr area 2 dfaa in the reservoir area was investigated ceemdan trend decomposition was used to calculate dfaa and low frequency climate factors precipitation concentration degree pcd and precipitation concentration period pcp next the information entropy theory was used to calculate the relative synchronization we also evaluated the ability of pcd pcp and low frequency climate factors to characterize dfaa events and provide evaluation support for preventing dfaa disasters 3 1 precipitation concentration degree pcd and precipitation concentration period pcp the pcp and pcd calculation methods were proposed by zhang and qian 2003 in the study of drought and flood in the yangtze and yellow river basins this method can quantitatively describe the spatial and temporal characteristics of regional precipitation the concept of pcd and pcp calculation methods is to characterize the total monthly precipitation as a vector quantity with magnitude and direction li et al 2010 in our study one day is corresponding to 360 365 0 986 the angle corresponding to the mid day of each month is considered to be the monthly direction angle the procedure used in this study to calculate pcp and pcd is as follows zhang and qian 2003 1 p c p u v arctan r x u r y u 2 p c d u v r x u 2 r y u 2 r u 3 r u r u v 4 r x u r u v sin θ v 5 r y u r u v cos θ v where u and v are the year u 1959 1960 2019 and period v 1 2 72 respectively r xu represents the sum of the vertical components of precipitation r yu represents the sum of the horizontal components of precipitation and r u represents the total amount of precipitation during the study period u th year of a station r uv represents the v th period of precipitation in the u th year θ v denotes the azimuth angle corresponding to each v th period pcd uv represents the degree of precipitation concentration in the u th year and pcp uv represents the most concentrated period of precipitation in the u th year 3 2 long cycle drought flood abrupt alternation index ldfai the ldfai index method used in this paper to calculate dfaa was used in yang et al 2019 who defined ldfai as 6 l d f a i u q u p u p u q u α p u q u where u represents the year u 1959 1960 2019 ldfai u is the index of dfaa in the u th year p u is the standardized precipitation in the pre flood period of u th year q u is the standardized precipitation in the post flood period of u th year q u p u is the dfaa intensity term p u q u is the drought and flood intensity term α p u q u is the weight coefficient and the value of α is defined as 1 8 the role of α is to increase the weight of dfaa events and reduce the weight of a single drought or flood event the time scale calculated by the ldfai method was defined as the first and second flood seasons based on the hydrological and meteorological characteristics of the yangtze river basin the pre flood period is from may and june and the post flood period is from july and august the classification of ldfai grades is shown in table 3 3 3 complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise method ceemdan ceemdan is a decomposition method based on the eemd method to eliminate modular aliasing colominas et al 2014 huang et al 1998 proposed the empirical mode decomposition emd method to decompose the data signal into periodic fluctuations of different scales but this method may produce modal confusion and end point effects in the calculation wu and huang 2009 proposed an improved ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd which solves the problem of mode confusion in the emd method but produces redundant noise in the reconstructed signal then huang et al further improved the eemd method by adding auxiliary noise to reduce the residual noise of the reconstructed signal ceemdan is a decomposition method based on the eemd method to eliminate modular aliasing torres et al 2011 colominas et al 2014 ceemdan can decompose sequence data into data analysis methods with different period scales after smoothing this algorithm requires fewer iterations than other decomposition algorithms to obtain good convergence and is suitable for nonstationary signals in ceemdan decomposition adaptive white noise is introduced into each residual component which can better decompose the data a schematic flow diagram and decomposition example of the ceemdan method are in the supporting information fig s1 and fig s2 the algorithm process steps of ceemdan are as follows add noise w l t to the original signal x t 7 x l t x t w l t in the formula t represents the original time series to be decomposed pcd pcp ldfai and low frequency climate factors w l t l 1 2 n satisfies the gaussian distribution and n is the number of samples use emd to decompose x l t into imf f l 1 by averaging f l 1 the first component of the intrinsic mode function imf in eq 8 can be obtained 8 f 1 t 1 n i 1 n f 1 l calculate the first residual component r 1 t 9 r 1 t x t f 1 t calculate the second imf 10 f 2 t 1 n i 1 n e 1 r 1 t ε 1 e 1 w l t where e k represents the imf of the k th signal and ε k is the white noise power parameter calculate the k th residual component 11 r k t r k 1 t f k t where k 2 3 k k represents the highest order of imf the k 1 th imf component is calculated as follows 12 f k 1 t 1 n i 1 n e 1 r k t ε k e k w l t repeat formulas 11 and 12 until the remaining part can no longer be subdivided the final residual component g t can be described as 13 g t x t k 1 k f k t the final signal decomposition is as follows 14 x t k 1 k f k t g t 3 4 multi time scale mutual information entropy mtsmie for different time series the mtsmie method is used to decompose the original series into imf components to obtain imf trend changes at different scales the imf of the same scale can express the information value of the entropy shared by the two by calculating the mutual information value to calculate the mutual information of any two time series we first calculate the entropy of a time series f k t as 15 s t i 1 k p f k t log 2 p f k t where s t is the entropy of the time series and p f k t is the probability that t takes the value f k t and estimates the proportion of f k t in the time series the joint entropy of any two time series then is 16 s t 1 t 2 i 1 k j 1 k p f k t 1 f k t 2 log 2 p f k t 1 f k t 2 where p f k t 1 f k t 2 is the probability of simultaneously observing f k t 1 and f k t 2 in the series given the joint entropy of any two transformed time series we can calculate the mutual information of any two time series 17 m i s m i e t 1 t 2 s t 1 s t 2 s t 1 t 2 entropy represents the amount of information carried by a data source in information theory m i s m i e t 1 t 2 represents the multi scale information entropy of each t 1 and t 2 decomposition sequence s t 1 and s t 2 are the entropy of the symbolic series t 1 and t 2 and s t 1 t 2 is their joint entropy 4 results and discussions 4 1 spatial and temporal variations in annual precipitation first a statistical analysis of the annual average precipitation in the head middle and tail of the tgr area is carried out fig 3 a shows the precipitation statistics from the head to the tail of the tgr area the average annual precipitation in the tgr area shows a low high low gradient from the head of the reservoir to the middle of the reservoir to the tail of the reservoir fig 3 b depicts the spatial distribution of precipitation in the tgr area indicating that precipitation exhibits clear stratified distribution throughout the region the low precipitation of 900 1050 mm mainly occurs in the head and tail of the reservoir the moderate precipitation of 1050 1200 mm covers most of the head central transition zone and the central storage tail transition zone and the height of 1200 1400 mm precipitation occurs in the reservoir and increases to the south from the perspective of spatial variation in precipitation the tgr area is an area with large precipitation changes the spatial gradient along the precipitation from the head and tail of the reservoir to the reservoir has an average increase of approximately 1 8 2 5 mm km on the time scale fig 3c the annual precipitation at the head of the reservoir displays a downward trend and the annual precipitation in the middle and the tail of the reservoir shows an upward trend 4 2 spatial patterns of precipitation concentration fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the inter annual average pcd and pcp values of the 18 sites in the study area from 1959 to 2019 and the gradients of pcd and pcp changes fig 4 a depicts that the pcd value of the tgr area has a decreasing gradient from northwest to southeast and the pcd value varies slightly between 0 41 and 0 56 among the values the pcd value of the qij station and its vicinity was the smallest and the pcd value of the wy station was the largest the pcp value mainly varied between 170 5 and 180 as shown in fig 4 b the pcp value exhibits a decreasing gradient from northwest to southeast which is consistent with the spatial distribution of pcd we compared the spatial distribution of the two indicators and found that the spatial distributions of pcd and pcp in the tgr area are relatively consistent different climate oscillations may affect the spatio temporal variations in pcd and pcp however our results cannot be used for attribution analysis this an unsettled matter is discussed next in the context of the potential atmospheric circulation index the mann kendall mk test was employed to implement the detection of change in the trend of pcd and pcp series fig 4 c shows the spatial distribution of the pcd trends the head of the reservoir and the middle of the reservoir showed an upward trend and most of the stations at the tail of the reservoir show a downward trend although the trend of pcd in the head of the reservoir is opposite that of the tail of the reservoir the related change rate was extremely small and the significance test was not passed only the wy station revealed a significant increasing trend passing the significance test at the level of 0 05 fig 4 d indicates the spatial distribution of pcp trends the pcp values of most stations in the tgr area showed a nonsignificant downward trend and none of them passed the significance test only the hc station presented a significant downward trend and passed the significance test at the level of 0 05 based on the downward trend of stations in the reservoir area a conclusion is that the rainy season in the reservoir area has moved forward 4 3 temporal patterns of precipitation concentration figs 5 and 6 show the time series of the inter annual average pcd and pcp values in the head middle and tail regions of the reservoir from 1959 to 2019 in the study area and the trend of changes before and after the impoundment of the tgr as shown in fig 5 a the annual average pcd of the reservoir head in the tgr area displays an upward trend the average pcd values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir were 0 440 and 0 464 respectively the pcd at the head of the tgr increased by 5 5 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment fig 5 b reveals that the average annual pcd in the tgr area showed a slight downward trend and the average annual pcd values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir did not change significantly with values of 0 451 and 0 450 respectively fig 5 c depicts that the average annual pcd at the tail of the tgr area shows a downward trend the average pcd values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir were 0 429 and 0 394 respectively the pcd at the end of the tgr decreased by 8 2 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment the coefficient of variation cv of pcd in table 4 shows that the variation degree of pcd at the head and in the reservoir decreases after impoundment and the variation degree at the tail of the reservoir increases from the overall perspective of fig 5 d the pcd value shows a gradual decrease in the head middle and tail of the tgr area as shown in fig 6 a the annual average pcp of the reservoir head in the tgr area shows a slight downward trend the average pcp values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir were 176 2 and 175 3 respectively the pcp at the head of the tgr decreased by 0 5 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment fig 6 b shows that the average annual pcp at the middle of the tgr area showed a slight upward trend and the average annual pcp values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir did not change significantly at 175 6 and 175 8 respectively the pcp value at the middle of the tgr increased slightly after the impoundment of the reservoir fig 6 c shows that the annual average pcp at the tail of the tgr area shows a downward trend the average pcp values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir were 174 3 and 171 9 respectively the pcp at the tail of the tgr decreased by 1 4 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment the cv index of pcp in table 4 shows that the variation degree of the head and middle of the reservoir increases after the impoundment and the variation degree of the tail decreases overall as shown in fig 6 d the pcp value shows a gradual decrease in the head middle and tail of the tgr area due to the complexity of the climate system distinguishing the impact of climate change and reservoir impoundment on precipitation changes in the reservoir area is difficult lü et al 2018 compared and analyzed the changes in extreme precipitation before and after the establishment of the tgr database and demonstrated that heavy precipitation showed an increasing trend and weak precipitation decreased this phenomenon may be due to the effects of climate warming and the adjustment effect on temperature after the impoundment of the tgr song et al 2017 which has changed the precipitation structure 4 4 dynamic evolution of dfaa events in addition the analysis of the inter annual change trend of ldfai and the diagnosis of dfaa intensity fig 7 revealed the time series trend characteristics of dfaa events in the tgr as shown in fig 7 the ftd events in the head and tail of the reservoir area occur more frequently than in the middle of the reservoir area in contrast to the ftd events the dtf events in the middle of the reservoir area occur more frequently than in the head and tail of the reservoir area among these events the number of ftd events at the tail of the reservoir area was significantly greater than that at the head of the reservoir the ldfai in the head of the reservoir and the middle of the reservoir indicated an upward trend and the tail of the reservoir revealed a downward trend as shown in table 5 the ldfai in the head of the reservoir and the middle of the reservoir showed an upward trend of 0 103 10 yr and 0 080 10 yr respectively in addition at the end of the reservoir area ldfai showed a downward trend of 0 030 10 yr this study calculated the ldfai of each area of the tgr from 1959 to 2019 next the spatial pattern and frequency location of dfaa event frequency were further analyzed fig 8 a and b the frequency of dfaa events varies substantially on a spatial scale especially in ftd events spatial distributions of dtf and ftd exhibited opposite gradients overall the frequency of dtf events shows the characteristics of more less from the head of the reservoir area to the tail of the reservoir area and its spatial difference is nonsignificant the frequency of ftd events and dtf events showed opposite gradients in spatial distribution and the difference was significant on the basis of the frequency of dfaa events at the site in fig 8 c ftd events mainly occur in the tail of the reservoir approximately 18 times and the frequency of ftd events in the head and middle of the reservoir is approximately 12 and 9 times respectively similarly dtf events mainly occur in the middle of the reservoir approximately seven times and the frequency of dtf events in the head and tail of the reservoir is approximately five times and three times respectively notably since the storage impoundment of the tgr the frequency of dtf events is less than that before the impoundment of the reservoir the frequency of ftd events in the head and tail of the reservoir area was higher than that before the impoundment of the reservoir among these events the frequency of ftd events at the tail of the reservoir area increased more than before the impoundment fig 9 regional water resource management should increase its attention to the impact of ftd events on regional agriculture 4 5 potential synchronization between ldfai and precipitation concentration atmospheric circulation indices using the ceemdan method the original data sequence of ldfai pcd pcp and low frequency climate factors soi ao pdo npo was decomposed fig 10 fig 10 shows the following 1 the time series of ldfai pcd pcp and low frequency climate factors can be decomposed into five imfs and one residual component g thus they involve cyclical fluctuations on multiple scales and development trends at the micro trend level 2 the quasi fluctuation cycles of pcd and pcp are relatively consistent with fluctuation cycles of 3 5 7 12 17 and 35 years the ldfai has quasi cyclical fluctuations of 2 4 7 9 15 and 30 years notably in short fluctuation cycles the ldfai has greater uncertainty than in long fluctuation there is a certain degree of volatility in the short term dfaa event cycle mutual information values of time lags according to the calculation method of mtsmie are shown in fig 11 fig 11 shows the following at different lag scales the synchronization between ldfai and pcd soi and ao in item g is relatively high as the scale of the lag time increases the synchronization of the g item increases and the predictability becomes stronger therefore we should also consider the rapid changes in drought and flood and its development trend in addition the original and imf components have strong randomness on the short period time scale their correlation synchronization is low and the predictability is low in the five imf stages the largest mtsmie appeared in imf4 of the ldfai pcd this finding indicates the medium and long term scales carry more synchronized information than the short term scale components thereby the tracking and research period for the dfaa and precipitation structure in the tgr area is approximately 15 17 years more reliable 4 6 discussions in the actual climate service in the yangtze river basin the government and relevant departments often focus on the concentrated precipitation period in the pre flood season from may to june and the concentrated precipitation period in the post flood season from july to august and require precipitation forecasts for these two periods respectively however most studies on flood season precipitation in china are divided into two stages pre flood season and post flood season wu et al 2006 cai et al 2020 shi et al 2021 so this paper is based on clarifying that the dfaa occurred in may and june to july and august but in fact some situations do not only change from may june to july august and some may start to change from june therefore according to the historical measured data determine the month when the dfaa occurring and then analyze the normalized precipitation before and after the change the changes may be more in line with the real situation of the dfaa in addition under the background of global climate change china s future drought and flood trends will evolve and the next step will be to strengthen multi scale research on the future regional dfaa evolution trends annual precipitation in the tgr displays both spatial and temporal variations the precipitation time series at the head of the reservoir area shows a downward trend which may be due to the inhibition of surface convection caused by the cooling of the water surface after the impoundment of the reservoir li et al 2017 used empirical orthogonal function eof to compare and analyze the observed precipitation in 1984 2003 and 2004 2013 the results show that there is little difference in precipitation between the two periods before and after the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir when the reservoir water level rises to 175 m the precipitation in the reservoir area may decrease slightly in the northwest of the reservoir area the sichuan basin and the high mountains surrounding the basin have enhanced convection which increases the precipitation in this area to a certain extent huang et al 2018 making the pcd value higher than other areas it is worth noting that the changes of pcd at the head and tail of the reservoir before and after impoundment showed opposite gradients the rosenfeld 2000 study shows that urbanization and industrial pollution can have an impact on rainfall patterns downstream of cities to a certain extent this is consistent with our research results with the rapid construction of the main urban area of chongqing at the end of the reservoir area and the operation of the tgr the pcd of the head of the reservoir area increased compared with that before the impoundment low frequency climate variability plays an important role in regional precipitation shepherd 2014 gong and wang 2003 pointed out that ao has a strong influence on winter precipitation changes in most of southern china hao et al 2019 concluded that soi is an important predictor of the number of very heavy precipitation days r20 by studying the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river this is partly consistent with our findings by analyzing the synchronicity of precipitation concentration and low frequency climatic factors we found that dfaa events have a high positive correlation and synchronicity with soi and ao on medium and long scales in addition we found that pcd and ldfai had lagged synchronization with various low frequency climate factors but the differences were obvious at different scales these results reflect the complexity of regional precipitation changes and the specific mechanisms need to be further studied 5 conclusions the research aim was to assess the temporal and spatial changes in precipitation concentration and their potential correlation with dfaa and low frequency climate factors in the tgr area from 1959 to 2019 the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 on the spatial scale pcd and pcp showed a decreasing gradient from northwest to southeast and their spatial distribution was relatively consistent on the temporal scale the pcd at the head of the tgr increased by 5 5 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment and the pcd at the end of the tgr decreased by 8 2 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment the pcp at the head and tail of the tgr decreased by 0 5 and 1 4 after the impoundment respectively compared with before the impoundment the pcp and pcd changed slightly before and after the impoundment in the middle of the tgr 2 significant spatial differences were in the frequency of dfaa events in the tgr the frequency of dtf events from the head of the reservoir area to the tail of the reservoir area presents a more less feature nevertheless ftd events show a spatial distribution pattern opposite to that of dtf events overall the frequency of ftd was higher than that of dtf after tgr impoundment ftd events increased except for those of the middle of the reservoir the frequency of dtf events was less than before impoundment notably ftd events increased significantly after the impoundment of the tgr at the tail of the reservoir 3 the quasi fluctuation periods of pcd and pcp are relatively consistent on different lagging scales the synchronization between ldfai and pcd soi and ao in item g is relatively high as the scale of the lag time increases the synchronization of the g term increases and the predictability becomes stronger 4 the results of mtsmie analysis show that in the medium and long term the mutual information values of ldfai pcd and ao are all above 0 6 a high mutual information value indicates that it carries more synchronization information in the zero lag scale medium and long term scales carry more information than short time scale components therefore the reliable research and monitoring period for dfaa and precipitation concentration in the tgr area is approximately 15 17 years 5 our results advance the understanding of the characteristics of precipitation concentration in the tgr area and its potential synchronization with dfaa in further research cmip6 climate model data will be used to study the impact of climate change exploring the relationship between precipitation concentration and changes in precipitation concentration in a small area and the underlying mechanism of the dfaa is necessary credit authorship contribution statement hao cui methodology conceptualization writing original draft shanhu jiang supervision writing review editing funding

7911,study region three gorges reservoir area the largest reservoir area in china study focus the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events increase with climate warming and the local climate effects in the large reservoir area may also change the local precipitation structure therefore based on the precipitation sequence data in the three gorges reservoir tgr area from 1959 to 2019 the proposed multi time scale mutual information entropy mtsmie method was used to reveal the cyclic synchronous changes of drought flood abrupt alternation and precipitation concentration new hydrological insights the results demonstrate that 1 the spatial distribution of the precipitation concentration index in the tgr area has obvious regional variability on the temporal scale the precipitation concentration increased by 5 5 and decreased by 8 2 after impoundment at the head and tail of the tgr respectively 2 the frequency of drought to flood dtf events from the head of the reservoir area to the tail of the reservoir area presents a more less feature the frequency of dtf events after impoundment was less than that before the impoundment of the reservoir however the flood to drought ftd events are the opposite 3 the period of reliable research and monitoring of dfaa and precipitation concentration in the three gorges region is about 15 17 years through the mtsmie

mode decomposition with adaptive noise method mtsmie multi time scale mutual information entropy 1 introduction global warming and the construction of water conservancy projects have changed the water cycle speed and reduced system stability leading to changes in global and regional precipitation characteristics gao et al 2014 huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 the sixth assessment report ar6 of the ipcc stated that climate system warming is an unquestionable fact ipcc 2021 global warming will increase the water holding capacity of the atmosphere at a rate of 7 which may exacerbate changes in the abnormal temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation chou and lan 2012 this phenomenon may lead to an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events and the intensity and time of precipitation in the basin lei et al 2021 gu et al 2017 in addition the water surface evaporation rate of large reservoirs will also increase which leads to an increase in the intensity and frequency of precipitation in the reservoir area pielke 2001 pizarro et al 2013 reservoirs play a crucial role in solving water shortages power generation shipping flood control and irrigation lehner et al 2011 over the last century tens of thousands of large reservoirs and dams have been built around the world vörösmarty et al 2003 chao et al 2008 however despite the substantial social benefits of large scale reservoirs various concerns related to ecology shen and xie 2004 stone 2008 wu et al 2003 yu et al 2011 and climate woldemichael et al 2012 hossain 2010a degu et al 2011 hossain et al 2010b make their existence controversial in addition the construction of reservoirs provides substantial social benefits but changes the natural state of the watershed and the surface hydrological situation which changes the original water cycle structure and may also affect near surface meteorological conditions and mesoscale or weather scale processes song et al 2017 wu et al 2012 as a huge artificial lake a reservoir has larger thermal inertia lower roughness and lower albedo than land bonan 1995 the climatic effect of the reservoir is mainly reflected in the change in the underlying surface of the ground from the original land to the water surface which increases the local humidity in addition the thermal properties radiation balance heat balance and surface roughness of the area have also changed affecting the local microclimate in and around the reservoir area niyogi et al 2010 takata et al 2009 these changes are for example those in the local precipitation pattern and daily temperature range pielke et al 2009 boulange et al 2021 studies have shown that changes in regional temperature and precipitation caused by changes in the underlying surface are equivalent to or greater than the effects of greenhouse gases pielke 2005 pielke et al 2017 the mechanism of climate change caused by underlying surface changes cannot be ignored feddema et al 2005 astorga 1994 demonstrated that the establishment of reservoirs in the spanish mountain watershed may have a significant effect on precipitation temperature and fog thus inferring local scale microclimate changes in the reservoir area clark and arritt 1995 used a one dimensional column version of a primitive equation model to find that an increase in the underlying surface moisture can promote convection which leads to an increase in precipitation to a certain extent hossain et al 2009 analyzed the empirical quantiles of 92 precipitation stations covering 633 large dams and confirmed that large reservoirs affect extreme precipitation in the reservoir area i e that after the completion of the dam precipitation in the 99th percentile increased by an average of 4 per year the change of precipitation structure provides the possibility for the formation of drought and flood events huang et al 2019 wei et al 2021 as extreme weather drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa is more likely to cause varying degrees of damage to global agriculture ecology and the environment than other weather conditions fang et al 2020 liu et al 2015 therefore analyzing the change characteristics of regional precipitation concentration and drought events is of substantial significance for the prevention of dfaa events and the regulation of water resources under the influence of large scale water conservancy projects there have been some attempts to study the relationship between precipitation concentration and dfaa in regions or river basins zheng et al 2017 huang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 guo et al 2020 shi et al 2021 for instance guo et al 2020 analyzed the precipitation concentration and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index in mainland china and explored the potential relationship between precipitation concentration and drought zheng et al 2017 studied the correlation between precipitation concentration and elevation in the pearl river basin and identified the contribution of atmospheric circulation factors to precipitation concentration shi et al 2021 defined the long period abrupt alternation index and analyzed the evolving law and driving factors of dfaa events in the wei river basin the previous studies are based on the analysis of the temporal and spatial laws of precipitation structures in medium and large scale watersheds or an analysis of dfaa events but only a few have analyzed the precipitation structure in watersheds affected by local climate changes in the reservoir area and explored its potential connection with dfaa events three gorges reservoir tgr is the world s largest dam and huge artificial lakes formed by anti seasonal regulation after its operation may change the regional climate of the reservoir area wang et al 2011 as the combined influence of climate change human activities and water conservancy project storage increases the likelihood of extreme precipitation events and drought events in the reservoir area especially droughts and floods causing serious losses to the regional economy and agriculture increases therefore the tgr area was selected as the research object to explore the change characteristics of its precipitation concentration and analyze its potential correlation with drought and flood events progress has been made in the study of precipitation structure and dfaa events but the following limitations in the literature have necessitated further research 1 studies have focused on a large scale or basin scale and not analyzed changes in precipitation structure before and after water storage in the reservoir area 2 due to the absence of research on long sequence scale dfaa no detailed analysis of its spatiotemporal scale has been conducted 3 the research has mainly focused on the analysis of the evolution of precipitation structure single cause analysis and the study of its evolution and coping mechanism however previous studies did not establish a relationship between precipitation structure and dfaa this research has formed a systematic research method of precipitation structure and the occurrence of drought and flooding in synchrony hence the research objectives are as follows 1 explore the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation concentration under the influence of climate change and the operation of large scale reservoirs 2 analyze the temporal and spatial distribution frequency and characteristics of dfaa events before and after the impoundment of the tgr and 3 using the multi time scale mutual information entropy mtsmie method proposed in this study explore the potential correlation and synchronization between multi scale drought and flood sharp transitions and precipitation concentration and atmospheric circulation factors the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study area and data sources section 3 introduces the research ideas and methods section 4 presents the results and discussion and section 5 summarizes the main findings 2 study area and data source 2 1 study area the tgr region lies within the catchment range between the dam location and the tail of the backwater of the supply after the impoundment of the tgr wang et al 2019 it is located at the end of the upper reaches of the yangtze river 28 26 31 73 n 105 43 111 13 e fig 1 its main channel is 658 km long and covers an area of 59326 km2 in terms of geography the terrain is undulating and the regional elevation increases from southeast to northwest with a height difference of about 1000 2500 m the tgr area is in a subtropical monsoon climate mainly influenced by canyon landforms this climatic feature combined with the local undulating topography has shaped the complex rainfall conditions in the tgr area lü et al 2018 the annual average precipitation is between 820 mm and 1420 mm the annual average evapotranspiration is between 560 mm and 1000 mm the annual average relative humidity in the reservoir area was high at 70 80 we divided the tgr area into three sub areas according to the distance from the dam and the administrative area the head of the reservoir area is located in the northeast of the tgr area the tail of the reservoir area is located in the southwest of the tgr area and the middle of the reservoir area is between them 2 2 data data used in this research are from 18 national meteorological stations in the tgr area namely the daily precipitation data from 1959 to 2019 under quality control fig 1 and table s1 daily precipitation data were downloaded from the website provided by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration http data cma cn all meteorological data have undergone strict quality control by china meteorological administration including checks of extreme values internal consistency and spatial consistency zhang et al 2020 for stations with missing data less than two months we select at least three adjacent stations for interpolation to fill in the missing data the long term annual average standard deviation maximum and minimum values of the observed precipitation at each station are shown in table 1 low frequency climate factors north pacific oscillation npo pacific decadal oscillation pdo arctic oscillation ao and southern oscillation index soi were selected as the influencing factors of global climate change the previous studies have shown that npo pdo ao and soi are significantly correlated with extreme precipitation in southern china zhang et al 2019 gao et al 2018 hao et al 2019 the low frequency climate factor data were downloaded from the noaa oar esrl psl boulder colorado usa http psl noaa gov more details of these datasets can be found in table 2 3 methodology the main innovative contribution of this research is the systematic analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution trend of precipitation concentration before and after the impoundment of the tgr area on the basis of the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise method ceemdan colominas et al 2014 and the theory of mutual information entropy the concept of mtsmie is proposed to reveal the relevant information among the multi scale dfaa precipitation concentration and climatic factors in the tgr area for analysis fig 2 1 precipitation directly affects the drought process in the region and has a direct impact on the frequency of sudden drought and flood events this part is based on the precipitation meteorological data of the tgr area from 1959 to 2019 we calculated the change in precipitation concentration in the reservoir area over the 60 year period to assess the temporal and spatial changes in precipitation concentration in the tgr area 2 dfaa in the reservoir area was investigated ceemdan trend decomposition was used to calculate dfaa and low frequency climate factors precipitation concentration degree pcd and precipitation concentration period pcp next the information entropy theory was used to calculate the relative synchronization we also evaluated the ability of pcd pcp and low frequency climate factors to characterize dfaa events and provide evaluation support for preventing dfaa disasters 3 1 precipitation concentration degree pcd and precipitation concentration period pcp the pcp and pcd calculation methods were proposed by zhang and qian 2003 in the study of drought and flood in the yangtze and yellow river basins this method can quantitatively describe the spatial and temporal characteristics of regional precipitation the concept of pcd and pcp calculation methods is to characterize the total monthly precipitation as a vector quantity with magnitude and direction li et al 2010 in our study one day is corresponding to 360 365 0 986 the angle corresponding to the mid day of each month is considered to be the monthly direction angle the procedure used in this study to calculate pcp and pcd is as follows zhang and qian 2003 1 p c p u v arctan r x u r y u 2 p c d u v r x u 2 r y u 2 r u 3 r u r u v 4 r x u r u v sin θ v 5 r y u r u v cos θ v where u and v are the year u 1959 1960 2019 and period v 1 2 72 respectively r xu represents the sum of the vertical components of precipitation r yu represents the sum of the horizontal components of precipitation and r u represents the total amount of precipitation during the study period u th year of a station r uv represents the v th period of precipitation in the u th year θ v denotes the azimuth angle corresponding to each v th period pcd uv represents the degree of precipitation concentration in the u th year and pcp uv represents the most concentrated period of precipitation in the u th year 3 2 long cycle drought flood abrupt alternation index ldfai the ldfai index method used in this paper to calculate dfaa was used in yang et al 2019 who defined ldfai as 6 l d f a i u q u p u p u q u α p u q u where u represents the year u 1959 1960 2019 ldfai u is the index of dfaa in the u th year p u is the standardized precipitation in the pre flood period of u th year q u is the standardized precipitation in the post flood period of u th year q u p u is the dfaa intensity term p u q u is the drought and flood intensity term α p u q u is the weight coefficient and the value of α is defined as 1 8 the role of α is to increase the weight of dfaa events and reduce the weight of a single drought or flood event the time scale calculated by the ldfai method was defined as the first and second flood seasons based on the hydrological and meteorological characteristics of the yangtze river basin the pre flood period is from may and june and the post flood period is from july and august the classification of ldfai grades is shown in table 3 3 3 complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise method ceemdan ceemdan is a decomposition method based on the eemd method to eliminate modular aliasing colominas et al 2014 huang et al 1998 proposed the empirical mode decomposition emd method to decompose the data signal into periodic fluctuations of different scales but this method may produce modal confusion and end point effects in the calculation wu and huang 2009 proposed an improved ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd which solves the problem of mode confusion in the emd method but produces redundant noise in the reconstructed signal then huang et al further improved the eemd method by adding auxiliary noise to reduce the residual noise of the reconstructed signal ceemdan is a decomposition method based on the eemd method to eliminate modular aliasing torres et al 2011 colominas et al 2014 ceemdan can decompose sequence data into data analysis methods with different period scales after smoothing this algorithm requires fewer iterations than other decomposition algorithms to obtain good convergence and is suitable for nonstationary signals in ceemdan decomposition adaptive white noise is introduced into each residual component which can better decompose the data a schematic flow diagram and decomposition example of the ceemdan method are in the supporting information fig s1 and fig s2 the algorithm process steps of ceemdan are as follows add noise w l t to the original signal x t 7 x l t x t w l t in the formula t represents the original time series to be decomposed pcd pcp ldfai and low frequency climate factors w l t l 1 2 n satisfies the gaussian distribution and n is the number of samples use emd to decompose x l t into imf f l 1 by averaging f l 1 the first component of the intrinsic mode function imf in eq 8 can be obtained 8 f 1 t 1 n i 1 n f 1 l calculate the first residual component r 1 t 9 r 1 t x t f 1 t calculate the second imf 10 f 2 t 1 n i 1 n e 1 r 1 t ε 1 e 1 w l t where e k represents the imf of the k th signal and ε k is the white noise power parameter calculate the k th residual component 11 r k t r k 1 t f k t where k 2 3 k k represents the highest order of imf the k 1 th imf component is calculated as follows 12 f k 1 t 1 n i 1 n e 1 r k t ε k e k w l t repeat formulas 11 and 12 until the remaining part can no longer be subdivided the final residual component g t can be described as 13 g t x t k 1 k f k t the final signal decomposition is as follows 14 x t k 1 k f k t g t 3 4 multi time scale mutual information entropy mtsmie for different time series the mtsmie method is used to decompose the original series into imf components to obtain imf trend changes at different scales the imf of the same scale can express the information value of the entropy shared by the two by calculating the mutual information value to calculate the mutual information of any two time series we first calculate the entropy of a time series f k t as 15 s t i 1 k p f k t log 2 p f k t where s t is the entropy of the time series and p f k t is the probability that t takes the value f k t and estimates the proportion of f k t in the time series the joint entropy of any two time series then is 16 s t 1 t 2 i 1 k j 1 k p f k t 1 f k t 2 log 2 p f k t 1 f k t 2 where p f k t 1 f k t 2 is the probability of simultaneously observing f k t 1 and f k t 2 in the series given the joint entropy of any two transformed time series we can calculate the mutual information of any two time series 17 m i s m i e t 1 t 2 s t 1 s t 2 s t 1 t 2 entropy represents the amount of information carried by a data source in information theory m i s m i e t 1 t 2 represents the multi scale information entropy of each t 1 and t 2 decomposition sequence s t 1 and s t 2 are the entropy of the symbolic series t 1 and t 2 and s t 1 t 2 is their joint entropy 4 results and discussions 4 1 spatial and temporal variations in annual precipitation first a statistical analysis of the annual average precipitation in the head middle and tail of the tgr area is carried out fig 3 a shows the precipitation statistics from the head to the tail of the tgr area the average annual precipitation in the tgr area shows a low high low gradient from the head of the reservoir to the middle of the reservoir to the tail of the reservoir fig 3 b depicts the spatial distribution of precipitation in the tgr area indicating that precipitation exhibits clear stratified distribution throughout the region the low precipitation of 900 1050 mm mainly occurs in the head and tail of the reservoir the moderate precipitation of 1050 1200 mm covers most of the head central transition zone and the central storage tail transition zone and the height of 1200 1400 mm precipitation occurs in the reservoir and increases to the south from the perspective of spatial variation in precipitation the tgr area is an area with large precipitation changes the spatial gradient along the precipitation from the head and tail of the reservoir to the reservoir has an average increase of approximately 1 8 2 5 mm km on the time scale fig 3c the annual precipitation at the head of the reservoir displays a downward trend and the annual precipitation in the middle and the tail of the reservoir shows an upward trend 4 2 spatial patterns of precipitation concentration fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the inter annual average pcd and pcp values of the 18 sites in the study area from 1959 to 2019 and the gradients of pcd and pcp changes fig 4 a depicts that the pcd value of the tgr area has a decreasing gradient from northwest to southeast and the pcd value varies slightly between 0 41 and 0 56 among the values the pcd value of the qij station and its vicinity was the smallest and the pcd value of the wy station was the largest the pcp value mainly varied between 170 5 and 180 as shown in fig 4 b the pcp value exhibits a decreasing gradient from northwest to southeast which is consistent with the spatial distribution of pcd we compared the spatial distribution of the two indicators and found that the spatial distributions of pcd and pcp in the tgr area are relatively consistent different climate oscillations may affect the spatio temporal variations in pcd and pcp however our results cannot be used for attribution analysis this an unsettled matter is discussed next in the context of the potential atmospheric circulation index the mann kendall mk test was employed to implement the detection of change in the trend of pcd and pcp series fig 4 c shows the spatial distribution of the pcd trends the head of the reservoir and the middle of the reservoir showed an upward trend and most of the stations at the tail of the reservoir show a downward trend although the trend of pcd in the head of the reservoir is opposite that of the tail of the reservoir the related change rate was extremely small and the significance test was not passed only the wy station revealed a significant increasing trend passing the significance test at the level of 0 05 fig 4 d indicates the spatial distribution of pcp trends the pcp values of most stations in the tgr area showed a nonsignificant downward trend and none of them passed the significance test only the hc station presented a significant downward trend and passed the significance test at the level of 0 05 based on the downward trend of stations in the reservoir area a conclusion is that the rainy season in the reservoir area has moved forward 4 3 temporal patterns of precipitation concentration figs 5 and 6 show the time series of the inter annual average pcd and pcp values in the head middle and tail regions of the reservoir from 1959 to 2019 in the study area and the trend of changes before and after the impoundment of the tgr as shown in fig 5 a the annual average pcd of the reservoir head in the tgr area displays an upward trend the average pcd values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir were 0 440 and 0 464 respectively the pcd at the head of the tgr increased by 5 5 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment fig 5 b reveals that the average annual pcd in the tgr area showed a slight downward trend and the average annual pcd values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir did not change significantly with values of 0 451 and 0 450 respectively fig 5 c depicts that the average annual pcd at the tail of the tgr area shows a downward trend the average pcd values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir were 0 429 and 0 394 respectively the pcd at the end of the tgr decreased by 8 2 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment the coefficient of variation cv of pcd in table 4 shows that the variation degree of pcd at the head and in the reservoir decreases after impoundment and the variation degree at the tail of the reservoir increases from the overall perspective of fig 5 d the pcd value shows a gradual decrease in the head middle and tail of the tgr area as shown in fig 6 a the annual average pcp of the reservoir head in the tgr area shows a slight downward trend the average pcp values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir were 176 2 and 175 3 respectively the pcp at the head of the tgr decreased by 0 5 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment fig 6 b shows that the average annual pcp at the middle of the tgr area showed a slight upward trend and the average annual pcp values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir did not change significantly at 175 6 and 175 8 respectively the pcp value at the middle of the tgr increased slightly after the impoundment of the reservoir fig 6 c shows that the annual average pcp at the tail of the tgr area shows a downward trend the average pcp values before and after the impoundment of the reservoir were 174 3 and 171 9 respectively the pcp at the tail of the tgr decreased by 1 4 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment the cv index of pcp in table 4 shows that the variation degree of the head and middle of the reservoir increases after the impoundment and the variation degree of the tail decreases overall as shown in fig 6 d the pcp value shows a gradual decrease in the head middle and tail of the tgr area due to the complexity of the climate system distinguishing the impact of climate change and reservoir impoundment on precipitation changes in the reservoir area is difficult lü et al 2018 compared and analyzed the changes in extreme precipitation before and after the establishment of the tgr database and demonstrated that heavy precipitation showed an increasing trend and weak precipitation decreased this phenomenon may be due to the effects of climate warming and the adjustment effect on temperature after the impoundment of the tgr song et al 2017 which has changed the precipitation structure 4 4 dynamic evolution of dfaa events in addition the analysis of the inter annual change trend of ldfai and the diagnosis of dfaa intensity fig 7 revealed the time series trend characteristics of dfaa events in the tgr as shown in fig 7 the ftd events in the head and tail of the reservoir area occur more frequently than in the middle of the reservoir area in contrast to the ftd events the dtf events in the middle of the reservoir area occur more frequently than in the head and tail of the reservoir area among these events the number of ftd events at the tail of the reservoir area was significantly greater than that at the head of the reservoir the ldfai in the head of the reservoir and the middle of the reservoir indicated an upward trend and the tail of the reservoir revealed a downward trend as shown in table 5 the ldfai in the head of the reservoir and the middle of the reservoir showed an upward trend of 0 103 10 yr and 0 080 10 yr respectively in addition at the end of the reservoir area ldfai showed a downward trend of 0 030 10 yr this study calculated the ldfai of each area of the tgr from 1959 to 2019 next the spatial pattern and frequency location of dfaa event frequency were further analyzed fig 8 a and b the frequency of dfaa events varies substantially on a spatial scale especially in ftd events spatial distributions of dtf and ftd exhibited opposite gradients overall the frequency of dtf events shows the characteristics of more less from the head of the reservoir area to the tail of the reservoir area and its spatial difference is nonsignificant the frequency of ftd events and dtf events showed opposite gradients in spatial distribution and the difference was significant on the basis of the frequency of dfaa events at the site in fig 8 c ftd events mainly occur in the tail of the reservoir approximately 18 times and the frequency of ftd events in the head and middle of the reservoir is approximately 12 and 9 times respectively similarly dtf events mainly occur in the middle of the reservoir approximately seven times and the frequency of dtf events in the head and tail of the reservoir is approximately five times and three times respectively notably since the storage impoundment of the tgr the frequency of dtf events is less than that before the impoundment of the reservoir the frequency of ftd events in the head and tail of the reservoir area was higher than that before the impoundment of the reservoir among these events the frequency of ftd events at the tail of the reservoir area increased more than before the impoundment fig 9 regional water resource management should increase its attention to the impact of ftd events on regional agriculture 4 5 potential synchronization between ldfai and precipitation concentration atmospheric circulation indices using the ceemdan method the original data sequence of ldfai pcd pcp and low frequency climate factors soi ao pdo npo was decomposed fig 10 fig 10 shows the following 1 the time series of ldfai pcd pcp and low frequency climate factors can be decomposed into five imfs and one residual component g thus they involve cyclical fluctuations on multiple scales and development trends at the micro trend level 2 the quasi fluctuation cycles of pcd and pcp are relatively consistent with fluctuation cycles of 3 5 7 12 17 and 35 years the ldfai has quasi cyclical fluctuations of 2 4 7 9 15 and 30 years notably in short fluctuation cycles the ldfai has greater uncertainty than in long fluctuation there is a certain degree of volatility in the short term dfaa event cycle mutual information values of time lags according to the calculation method of mtsmie are shown in fig 11 fig 11 shows the following at different lag scales the synchronization between ldfai and pcd soi and ao in item g is relatively high as the scale of the lag time increases the synchronization of the g item increases and the predictability becomes stronger therefore we should also consider the rapid changes in drought and flood and its development trend in addition the original and imf components have strong randomness on the short period time scale their correlation synchronization is low and the predictability is low in the five imf stages the largest mtsmie appeared in imf4 of the ldfai pcd this finding indicates the medium and long term scales carry more synchronized information than the short term scale components thereby the tracking and research period for the dfaa and precipitation structure in the tgr area is approximately 15 17 years more reliable 4 6 discussions in the actual climate service in the yangtze river basin the government and relevant departments often focus on the concentrated precipitation period in the pre flood season from may to june and the concentrated precipitation period in the post flood season from july to august and require precipitation forecasts for these two periods respectively however most studies on flood season precipitation in china are divided into two stages pre flood season and post flood season wu et al 2006 cai et al 2020 shi et al 2021 so this paper is based on clarifying that the dfaa occurred in may and june to july and august but in fact some situations do not only change from may june to july august and some may start to change from june therefore according to the historical measured data determine the month when the dfaa occurring and then analyze the normalized precipitation before and after the change the changes may be more in line with the real situation of the dfaa in addition under the background of global climate change china s future drought and flood trends will evolve and the next step will be to strengthen multi scale research on the future regional dfaa evolution trends annual precipitation in the tgr displays both spatial and temporal variations the precipitation time series at the head of the reservoir area shows a downward trend which may be due to the inhibition of surface convection caused by the cooling of the water surface after the impoundment of the reservoir li et al 2017 used empirical orthogonal function eof to compare and analyze the observed precipitation in 1984 2003 and 2004 2013 the results show that there is little difference in precipitation between the two periods before and after the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir when the reservoir water level rises to 175 m the precipitation in the reservoir area may decrease slightly in the northwest of the reservoir area the sichuan basin and the high mountains surrounding the basin have enhanced convection which increases the precipitation in this area to a certain extent huang et al 2018 making the pcd value higher than other areas it is worth noting that the changes of pcd at the head and tail of the reservoir before and after impoundment showed opposite gradients the rosenfeld 2000 study shows that urbanization and industrial pollution can have an impact on rainfall patterns downstream of cities to a certain extent this is consistent with our research results with the rapid construction of the main urban area of chongqing at the end of the reservoir area and the operation of the tgr the pcd of the head of the reservoir area increased compared with that before the impoundment low frequency climate variability plays an important role in regional precipitation shepherd 2014 gong and wang 2003 pointed out that ao has a strong influence on winter precipitation changes in most of southern china hao et al 2019 concluded that soi is an important predictor of the number of very heavy precipitation days r20 by studying the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river this is partly consistent with our findings by analyzing the synchronicity of precipitation concentration and low frequency climatic factors we found that dfaa events have a high positive correlation and synchronicity with soi and ao on medium and long scales in addition we found that pcd and ldfai had lagged synchronization with various low frequency climate factors but the differences were obvious at different scales these results reflect the complexity of regional precipitation changes and the specific mechanisms need to be further studied 5 conclusions the research aim was to assess the temporal and spatial changes in precipitation concentration and their potential correlation with dfaa and low frequency climate factors in the tgr area from 1959 to 2019 the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 on the spatial scale pcd and pcp showed a decreasing gradient from northwest to southeast and their spatial distribution was relatively consistent on the temporal scale the pcd at the head of the tgr increased by 5 5 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment and the pcd at the end of the tgr decreased by 8 2 after the impoundment compared with before the impoundment the pcp at the head and tail of the tgr decreased by 0 5 and 1 4 after the impoundment respectively compared with before the impoundment the pcp and pcd changed slightly before and after the impoundment in the middle of the tgr 2 significant spatial differences were in the frequency of dfaa events in the tgr the frequency of dtf events from the head of the reservoir area to the tail of the reservoir area presents a more less feature nevertheless ftd events show a spatial distribution pattern opposite to that of dtf events overall the frequency of ftd was higher than that of dtf after tgr impoundment ftd events increased except for those of the middle of the reservoir the frequency of dtf events was less than before impoundment notably ftd events increased significantly after the impoundment of the tgr at the tail of the reservoir 3 the quasi fluctuation periods of pcd and pcp are relatively consistent on different lagging scales the synchronization between ldfai and pcd soi and ao in item g is relatively high as the scale of the lag time increases the synchronization of the g term increases and the predictability becomes stronger 4 the results of mtsmie analysis show that in the medium and long term the mutual information values of ldfai pcd and ao are all above 0 6 a high mutual information value indicates that it carries more synchronization information in the zero lag scale medium and long term scales carry more information than short time scale components therefore the reliable research and monitoring period for dfaa and precipitation concentration in the tgr area is approximately 15 17 years 5 our results advance the understanding of the characteristics of precipitation concentration in the tgr area and its potential synchronization with dfaa in further research cmip6 climate model data will be used to study the impact of climate change exploring the relationship between precipitation concentration and changes in precipitation concentration in a small area and the underlying mechanism of the dfaa is necessary credit authorship contribution statement hao cui methodology conceptualization writing original draft shanhu jiang supervision writing review editing funding

7912,study region the são francisco river basin sfrb in brazil study focus in semi arid regions interannual variability of seasonal rainfall and climate change is expected to stress water availability and increase the recurrence and intensity of extreme events such as droughts or floods local decision makers therefore need reliable long term hydro meteorological forecasts to support the seasonal management of water resources reservoir operations and agriculture in this context an ensemble kalman filter framework is applied to predict sub basin scale runoff employing global freely available datasets of reanalysis precipitation era5 land as well as bias corrected and spatially disaggregated seasonal forecasts seas5 bcsd runoff is estimated using least squares predictions exploiting the covariance structures between runoff and precipitation the performance of the assimilation framework was assessed using different ensemble skill scores new hydrological insights for the region our results show that the quality of runoff predictions are closely linked to the performance of the rainfall seasonal predictions and allows skillful predictions up to two months ahead in most sub basins the anthropogenic conditions such as in the western bahia state however must be taken under consideration since non stationary runoff time series have poorer skill as such unnatural variations can not be captured by long term covariances in sub basins which are dominated by little anthropogenic influence the presented framework provides a promising and easily transferable approach for skillful operational seasonal runoff predictions on sub basin scale keywords hydro meteorology seasonal forecast river basin management data assimilation 1 introduction the effect of global warming on climatic extreme events such as droughts combined with the growing water demand for cities and irrigation can result in intense water scarcity in certain regions of the world schewe et al 2014 stocker et al 2014 du et al 2018 mostly impacted are semi arid regions due to limited water availability accumulation and intensification of drought periods and increasing sedimentation of water reservoirs especially in those regions observational data is sparse and the number of reliable and long term operating measurement stations is decreasing lorenz and kunstmann 2012 this does not allow decision makers to rely on local statistics to anticipate those hardly predictable extreme events and thus to plan for a proactive water allocation during droughts and to manage reservoir levels during floods climatic information on seasonal scales are therefore particularly important and fortunately semi arid climates near or at the tropics can offer reasonable predictability on seasonal timescales in fact the climate variability in these regions is mainly affected by large scale forcing of thermal and dynamical atmosphere ocean interaction from intraseasonal to multidecadal timescale e g madden julian oscillation el nião southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation atlantic multi decadal oscillation quasi biennal oscillation kayano and andreoli 2004 de souza and ambrizzi 2006 taschetto and ambrizzi 2012 taschetto and wainer 2008 he et al 2017 li et al 2020 or long term interactions like inertial memory soil moisture sea surface temperatures koster et al 2000 that are well represented in state of the art seasonal predictions systems johnson et al 2019 hence an adjustment of policies to sustainable water management and the development of tools to make global information usable for individual regions is required in this context seasonal sub basin scale runoff is proposed to be estimated applying a hydro meteorological enkf framework using the statistics of global freely available datasets and global model predictions this approach is derived from a previous study lorenz et al 2015 where enkf based basin scale runoff estimations proved to provide promising results on monthly time scales more specifically we focus on the application of publicly available global hydrometeorological datasets and exploit the joint temporal and regional covariance structures to generate least square estimated predictions the motivation is to develop a similar framework for seasonal runoff predictions using seasonal precipitation predictions from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf latest seasonal forecasting system seas5 as well as reanalysis based reference precipitation from era5 land which is an offline re run of the land surface component from ecmwf s latest atmospheric reanalysis era5 we further use runoff observation data from the brazilian national water agency ana in fact different studies showed the potential of seasonal forecasts to predict extreme events like droughts and to support water management in semi arid regions changnon and vonnhame 1986 garbrecht et al 2006 portele et al 2021 in this regard various statistical rainfall runoff models misumi et al 2001 garbrecht et al 2006 ajami et al 2016 de paiva et al 2020 or process based hydrological models yuan et al 2016 crochemore et al 2016 meißner et al 2017 foster et al 2018 sehgal and sridhar 2019 wanders et al 2019 which convert climate or seasonal precipitation forecasts into stream flows adapted for real time basin monitoring already exist in comparison our proposed framework uses high resolution precipitation forecasts within a statistical rainfall runoff enkf framework to predict computationally efficient seasonal runoff at sub catchment level in this study the são francisco river basin sfrb in brazil is investigated being disposed to have increasing water related problems in the future cunha et al 2018 the sfrb requires sustainable mitigation strategies and therefore provides a suitable testbed for the enkf based seasonal hydrological forecasting system 2 material 2 1 study area with a total surface area of 636 851 km2 the sfrb fig 1 is a very multifaceted region both in terms of its climatic and physical characterization as well as its environmental diversity with its 2860 km of length the river originates in the canastra mountain in the central part of the southeast region and flows into the atlantic ocean in the northeast part of the catchment the main course of the river is supplied by the tributaries of several sub basins with 75 of the water flow generated in the upper reach of the state of minas gerais maneta et al 2009 traini et al 2012 de jong et al 2018 the sfrb unites regions with two different climate regimes between the upper and lower basin in the southern part of the basin regions 3 11 in fig 1 the rainy season is during november december january ndj and its variability is strongly influenced by the south atlantic convergence zone sacz kodama 1992 kodama 1993 carvalho et al 2002 carvalho et al 2004 the rainy season over the northern part regions 0 2 in fig 1 is observed during january apr jfma and is mainly linked to the high activity of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the emergence of easterly waves and squall lines derived by the sea breeze paredestrejo et al 2016 sun et al 2016 because of its high population of approx 17 million people the region incorporates important economic activities increasing the stress on the environment and the water resources ioris 2001 maneta et al 2009 apart from drinking water freshwater resources are mainly used for electricity generation urban and industrial services intensive irrigation and mining activities this involves a high concentration of dams and water abstractions all along the sfrb river de jong et al 2018 do vasco et al 2019 dos santos et al 2020 the western bahia state regions 5 6 and 7 in fig 1 in particular is a very active agricultural area which is subject to significant reduction in river discharge rainfall and ground water level since the 1980s pousa et al 2019 santos et al 2020 in addition to the significant environmental impact of these activities on biodiversity soil erosion and land desertification cunha et al 2015 tomasella et al 2018 the north east of the region was recently hit by an intense multi year drought that caused a significant lack of water in the region and emptied most reservoirs marengo et al 2018 martins et al 2018 2 2 data the study is based on 11 sub basins of the sfrb fig 1 and monthly time series over a total period of 30 years between 1981 and 2011 the 11 sub basins were delineated and associated with runoff gauges given the spatial distribution of the gauges and the spatial resolution of the precipitation products information about the different data sets used for this study are summarized in table 1 more detailed information about the runoff gauges and missing values can be found in table 2 2 2 1 runoff the gauges located at the sub basins outlet were used to quantify the runoff of each sub basin red triangles in fig 1 the daily discharge data of the 11 selected gauges were obtained from the brazilian national water agency ana database which contains all information collected by the national hydrometeorological network rhn in brazil the data are averaged monthly and the few missing values see table 2 are filled using the climatology because of the high dam concentration in region 0 fig 1 which denies the description of the natural relationship between precipitation and runoff through simple covariances or correlations only the n 1 11 sub basins are considered in this study 2 2 2 precipitation reference precipitation is taken from the era5 land climate reanalysis muñoz sabater et al 2021 dataset of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf integrated forecasting system ifs this dataset is derived from a re run of the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis hersbach 2016 and contains gridded daily global land surface precipitation at 9 km resolution from 1950 onwards era5 land has the particular advantage of including a representation of the hydrological cycle which improves the agreement between river discharge estimates and available observations the hydro meteorological consistency and high spatial resolution of era5 land makes it an ideal dataset for hydrological research purposes the gridded data were monthly and spatially averaged over the different sub basins to obtain basin scale rainfall estimates 2 2 3 bias corrected and spatially disaggregated seasonal forecasts seas5 bcsd monthly seasonal forecasts for precipitation are obtained from ecmwfs latest seasonal forecasting system seas5 which are bias corrected and spatially disaggregated towards era5 land lorenz et al 2021 the forecasts cover the whole re forecast period from 1981 to 2019 and include bias corrected and spatially disaggregated daily and monthly ensemble forecasts for precipitation average minimum and maximum temperature as well as for shortwave radiation from the issue date to the next 215 days and have a spatial resolution of 0 1 they consist of an ensemble of 25 until 2016 and 51 from 2017 members that are corrected towards era5 land using a quantile mapping approach for estimating a temporally consistent set of land surface variables the bias correction of precipitation forecasts further includes a correction of precipitation intermittency to ensure the agreement of the wet and dry day frequencies from era5 land and seas5 bcsd compared to the raw seas5 forecasts seas5 bcsd has a higher spatial resolution lower biases with respect to era5 land and substantially reduced model drifts with forecast lead time and are hence more suitable for regional applications because this study focuses on a time period prior 2016 the seas5 bcsd ensemble size has only 25 members 3 methods 3 1 prediction model for this enkf framework the state of the system is represented as a multi dimensional vector x of size 2 n reg with n reg being the number of sub basins containing the runoff r and the precipitation p state vectors to be estimated at each time step t 1 x t p t t r t t t the prediction equation has been derived under the assumption that the time evolution of the precipitation and runoff anomalies can be written as a first order stochastic process 2 r t a r t 1 ϵ with the monthly residual r at time step t 3 r t x t x m p t p m r t r m and the long term mean annual cycle for the state vector x at month m over a total period of τ months 4 x m 1 τ 12 i m τ 12 x i m the prediction is characterized by the matrix of the process dynamics a and is supposed to model the dynamics and statistical relationship of the temporal evolution of the two water cycle variables the zero mean normally distributed white prediction noise ϵ n 0 q p represents errors coming from the model data parameters and physics with q p being the prediction error covariance matrix because of the complexity and the lack of physical knowledge about the dynamics of the process model a is considered as unknown nevertheless an estimation a can be obtained with least square prediction methods making use of the process stochastic information for a complete and detailed derivation of the methodology see moritz 1980 kurtenbach et al 2012 tourian 2013 lorenz et al 2015 we are looking for an approximation a as a linear estimator of r t given r t 1 5 r t a r t 1 where r is the predicted state the estimated prediction matrix a should minimize the prediction error e r t r t i e minimize the trace of the error covariance matrix q p the total error can be developed as follow 6 q p e e e t e r t r t r t r t t σ σ δ a t a σ δ t a σ a t and is thus minimized for 7 a σ δ σ 1 by inserting 7 into 6 we finally obtain the error covariance of the prediction matrix a 8 q p σ σ δ σ 1 σ t where σ e r t r t t and σ δ e r t r t 1 t are the spatio temporal auto and cross covariance matrices respectively these covariance matrices are approximated with the empirical sample covariance matrices σ and σ δ between anomalies of precipitation and runoff over the total time period of τ months 9 σ σ 1 τ 1 t 1 τ r t r t t 10 σ δ σ δ 1 τ 2 t 2 τ r t r t 1 t 3 2 the ensemble kalman filter framework according to the previous derived least square prediction estimate the prediction equation can be developed by substituting 3 in 2 11 x t d f a x t 1 d a b u t 1 ϵ d where b and u represent the control input terms 12 b a i a n d u t x t 1 x t t as a result the predicted state vector x t f at time t can be estimated using the analysis state x t 1 a at time t 1 the prediction matrix a describing the variables spatio temporal relationships and the control input u that represents the mean annual cycle i stands for the identity matrix i σς 1 and the index d refers to the ensemble member from an ensemble of size n ens the prediction and observation covariance matrices are estimated by the sample covariance matrix from the ensemble prediction of size n ens 13 σ t f 1 n e n s 1 d 1 n e n s x t d f x t f x t d f x t f t with x t f the ensemble mean these covariance matrices describe the uncertainity in the predicted and corrected states in the innovation step the analysis state x t d a and its associated covariance matrix σ x t a are obtained by updating the gain weighted difference between the observed state y t and the predicted state x t d f the correction step is formulated as follow 14 x t d a x t d f k t y t h t x t d f ν d with the observation relation matrix h t that maps the predicted state to the observed space and the zero mean normally distributed observation noise ν n 0 q t o b s the kalman gain matrix k t represents the optimal weighting between the error covariance of the predicted state σ x t and the errors of the observed state q t obs it is defined as 15 k t σ x t f h t t h t σ x t f h t t q t o b s 1 the model is then integrated recursively forward in time from the innovation until the next update cycle 3 3 observation update generally the observation vector y t and associated observation error covariance matrix q t obs are given by 16 y t p t o b s r t o b s 17 q t o b s σ p t 0 σ r t where p t obs and r t obs are the observation vectors of precipitation and runoff at time t with σ p t and σ r t their corresponding error covariance matrices for the forecast initialization the observation vector y t of size 2 n reg includes the historical precipitation era5 land and runoff ana vectors at time t since we assume perfect observations during the initialization the corresponding error covariance is set to zero during the forecast the predicted state is updated at each time step t using the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts at the corresponding forecast lead time since runoff observations are not assimilated the observation vector reduces to 18 y t p t o b s where p t obs represents the precipitation observation vector at time t including all seas5 bcsd ensemble members this gives y t a total size of n reg n bcsd with n bcsd the seas5 bcsd ensemble size indeed the whole ensemble is assimilated in order to benefit from all the information contained in the forecasts each element of the observation vector has an associated observation error covariance contained in q t obs σ p t which is estimated from the squared ensemble spread of the seas5 bcsd precipitation ensemble forecasts for the given region and forecast horizon 3 4 further assumptions no spin up is applied to the model states as this reduces the prediction performance possible reasons could be that the observation covariance matrices generated by a probabilistic climatology are not well conditioned or that the convergence to the optimal error level is too slow and would require more data various ensemble sensitivity tests not shown here suggest that an ensemble size of n ens 200 members is a robust choice for the enkf runs 3 5 evaluation framework four different skill scores namely the inter quantile range skill score iqrss between the 95th and 5th percentiles the mean absolute error skill score maess the continuous ranked probability skill score crpss and the brier skill score bss for above and below normal conditions were computed a detailed description of the used score metrics can be found in appendix a the reference ensemble forecast for runoff and precipitation are leave one year out climatology based ensemble forecasts generated from the ana runoff and the era5 land precipitation data respectively for a given year this established method consists of combining the observations of all other years to create an ensemble forecast so that the validation is done with independent data the performance scores are then derived for both runoff and seas5 bcsd precipitation predictions and are computed for each region time step and lead time over the evaluation period in this study we focus only on the first four lead times with lead 0 referring to the current month s forecast and lead 3 to the fourth month s forecast an overview of the size of the different parameters used in the enkf framework can be found in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 annual cycle fig 2 shows the rainy season of the whole sfrb and its 12 sub basins the two maxima visible in december regions 3 11 and march regions 0 2 shows the entanglement of the two different climate regimes between the upper and lower basin the main rainy season in the lower basin is observed during january april jfma and in the upper portion of the basin it is during november january ndj in this study we consider the period from november to march as a good compromise between the two climate zones to describe the wet season of the entire sfrb folland et al 2001 misra 2006 and kulikova et al 2014 presented evidence of a relationship between pacific and tropical atlantic sst anomaly patterns and seasonal precipitation in northeast brazil contributing to the long term predictability over the sfrb this is confirmed by the good level of agreement between the first lead times of seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts and era5 land precipitation in fig 2 similarities in the spatio temporal relationship between runoff and rainfall can also be observed however regions 5 6 and 7 do not seem to follow the typical rainy season cycle it is expected therefore that predicting runoff in those regions may be more difficult 4 2 prediction performance the runoff of the 11 sfrb sub basins is reforecasted on a monthly basis over the evaluation period 1981 2011 fig 3 shows the reforecasts of lead time 0 blue and corresponding runoff gauge observations red in most cases the forecasts can reproduce the observed stream flow in particular the upper basin region 8 11 and lower basin region 1 4 show the best agreement with a good concordance between the predicted and observed runoff peaks however predictions for the western bahia state regions 5 7 have a lower quality compared to observations with a noisy behavior and a general underestimation of the baseflow during the first 15 years correspondingly the reduction of the river streamflow described in section 2 1 is visible in these regions over the same period since the control input term u eq 12 carries information on the mean annual cycle an abnormal structure of the annual cycle of those regions can explain the observed underestimation of the runoff predictions while most events in the catchment are well predicted a few seem to be more difficult to predict e g fig 3 region 11 in 1991 or region 8 in 1982 it is therefore important to determine the origin of the performance whether it derives from the algorithm the quality of the driving data or the quality of the seas5 bcsd rainfall predictions therefore a deeper analysis was initiated where the different performance metrics described in the methods section were calculated figs 4 and 5 show the monthly and seasonally averaged skill scores respectively of the enkf runoff reforecasts and corresponding seas5 bcsd precipitation predictions during the main rainy season november march for the first four lead months in all regions the skill of the predictions is shown in colors from blue better skill than the reference forecast to orange worse skill than the reference forecast in both figures an overall good agreement of the three skill scores for the runoff predictions and the seas5 bcsd precipitation predictions can be seen with similar patterns over months lead times and regions and a general trend of decreasing skill with lead time additionally for both the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts and the runoff forecasts an improved skill during the first months of the rainy season nov dec jan is evident compared to the last months of the rainy season feb march this monthly trend is more pronounced for the runoff forecasts especially at higher lead times lead 2 and 3 the forecast sharpness accuracy and overall performance of both the runoff and seas5 bcsd forecasts decrease similarly for the first two lead times the good iqrss and maess and crpss values for these lead times imply that the predictions are very accurate only slightly deviate from the reference and have a more representative distribution with respect to climatology however for higher lead times the seas5 bcsd predictions performance remains more uniform compared to the runoff predictions which decrease more linearly in fig 4 where all three skill scores of the runoff forecasts are positive for most of the upper and lower basin regions 5 6 and 7 show poorer performance affecting all different lead times and months this can also be seen in fig 5 where the maess and iqrss of the runoff forecasts over the rainy season are negative for all lead times in region 5 and negative for regions 6 7 from lead time 2 on this trend which isn t visible in the seas5 bcsd precipitation predictions skill scores is concordant with the previously mentioned erratic behavior in the runoff time series in those regions fig 3 interestingly the lead 2 forecasts in february have a lower skill compared to the lead 3 forecast this is also associated with a lower skill in the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts this finding is counter intuitive since a monotonically decreasing performance with lead time was expected it has however been shown by several studies that central eastern brazil can show low predictability on a seasonal scale during the austral summer as rainfall variability is related to complex land atmosphere interactions that are not well captured by models marengo et al 2003 grimm et al 2007 to assess the ability of the enkf framework to forecast events above or below the seasonal average the bss was calculated to investigate which part of the skill is directly engendered by the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecast and which part is inherent to the enkf framework the bss was also computed for seas5 bcsd precipitation forecast against the era5 land product fig 6 shows the bss for both mentioned cases for lead 0 over the different regions and months of the rainy season for both cases of above normal and below normal we can see positive bss above 0 3 for most months and regions even for the regions of the western bahia state in addition fig 7 shows the bss for each month averaged over the whole rainy season and for the first four lead times in both cases the upper and lower tercile show better skill for lead 0 compared to higher lead times with scores close to zero furthermore lead 0 has higher skill scores in the lower basin compared to the upper basin the features visible here show that the precipitation events in the above and below normal categories of the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecast match that of the predicted runoff with higher scores in lead 0 compared to higher leads the skill score analysis illustrates how this framework is able to exploit the simple rainfall runoff relationship which in combination with the quality of the seas5 bcsd provides skillful runoff predictions up to two months ahead in most cases the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts outperform or are close to the runoff forecasts but in some cases the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts also outperform the runoff forecasts greuell et al 2019 crochemore et al 2016 and yossef et al 2013 have shown that in european catchments most frameworks using process based hydrological models and post processed seasonal forecasts ecmwf seasonal forecast systems 3 seas3 and 4 seas4 as input hardly show skill beyond one lead month yossef et al 2013 showed that in the tropical catchments of south america the accuracy of runoff forecasts from the fews world global seasonal runoff forecasting system driven by seas3 precipitation forecasts is limited to 1 2 months lead time during most of the year the presented enkf framework shows similar performance with skillful runoff predictions of 1 2 months ahead during the rainy season in most of the sf sub basins consequently the severe recurrent droughts in northeastern brazil in 2011 2016 cunha et al 2019 marengo et al 2017 erfanian et al 2017 could have been anticipated 1 2 months in advance corresponding to sub basins 1 2 and 3 however a direct comparison is inherently delicate as the forecast performance can depend on many factors e g the hydrological model employed the seasonal forecasts product the post processing techniques applied the different geographical locations or the different regional and seasonal weather regimes affecting the study area enso mjo north atlantic oscillation nao finally this framework does not require prior knowledge of local hydrological initial conditions generally necessary to run a model soil moisture snowpack groundwater storage regulation of lakes and dams which makes this approach very suitable for regions where hydrological information is lacking furthermore it is a transferable approach that can complement other types of statistical or more physically based models to easily monitor a single catchment at sub basin level the number of input variables such as evapotranspiration or temperature is also expandable allowing for more robust correlations between all variables and thus improving prediction quality as shown in lorenz et al 2015 this approach for global sub basin forecasts can be extended to other regions as seas5 bcsd forecasts for other regions already exist lorenz et al 2021 5 summary and conclusion in this study a hydro meteorological ensemble kalman filter enkf based data assimilation framework is developed with which sub basin scale runoff time series are predicted a least squares prediction method has been applied for the prediction scheme in order to exploit the spatio temporal relationship between precipitation and runoff besides reference runoff ana and precipitation era5 land bias corrected and spatially disaggregated seasonal precipitation forecasts seas5 bcsd are used in order to predict runoff several months ahead the performance of the framework was assessed for 11 sub basins of the rio são francisco basin by comparing predicted against a reference leave one year out climatology based ensemble forecast overall the enkf runoff predictions have a good performance over most months with a general decrease of the skill with lead time the positive performance in the runoff predictions for all skill scores demonstrated the ability of the assimilation framework to capture the concurrent precipitation runoff relationship on sub basin scale and to provide skillful estimates of runoff up to 2 months ahead this framework however also suffers from a number of limitations 1 the skill of the seas5 bcsd predictions is the primary constraining factor for the performance of runoff forecasts as these are used as input to the model 2 the simplicity of the least squares prediction method is limited by the insufficient knowledge of the model physics the catchment characteristics and the local hydroclimatic conditions for example our current model cannot describe regions where runoff is disturbed by anthropogenic activities such as in the western state of bahia regions 5 6 and 7 on the other hand the framework is very suitable for regions where the key parameters for hydrological modeling as well as the initial and boundary conditions are missing 3 the set of input variables which can be extended to further variables in the seas5 bcsd dataset such as evapotranspiration or temperature could provide additional correlation statistics that have the potential to further improve the skill of the runoff predictions future work could include comparisons and implementation of this methodology to process based hydrological models with more input variables and a wider range of regions finally this approach which relies on global freely available information for regional runoff forecasting has great potential for regional decision support as well as seasonal water resource management and can complement other existing operational hydrological models this includes the development of institutional systems and national strategies for drought preparedness plans long term flood awareness and sustainable reservoir management with a computationally cost effective and easily transferable approach credit authorship contribution

data of this study are available under the doi 10 35097 600 in the radar4kit repository appendix a score metrics the forecasts are evaluated by comparing the performance of a given forecast against a reference forecast in general the skill score of a given region month and lead time is expressed as a 1 s k i l l s c o r e 1 s k i l l f s k i l l r skill scores are obtained by the median of the individual scores and range from to 1 with scores larger smaller than zero indicating that the forecast system is more less skillful than the reference forecast a 1 inter quantile range iqr sharpness is an intrinsic property of the forecast and indicates the spread of the ensemble forecast when the ensemble spread is too large it indicates uncertain predictions when the ensemble spread is small

7912,study region the são francisco river basin sfrb in brazil study focus in semi arid regions interannual variability of seasonal rainfall and climate change is expected to stress water availability and increase the recurrence and intensity of extreme events such as droughts or floods local decision makers therefore need reliable long term hydro meteorological forecasts to support the seasonal management of water resources reservoir operations and agriculture in this context an ensemble kalman filter framework is applied to predict sub basin scale runoff employing global freely available datasets of reanalysis precipitation era5 land as well as bias corrected and spatially disaggregated seasonal forecasts seas5 bcsd runoff is estimated using least squares predictions exploiting the covariance structures between runoff and precipitation the performance of the assimilation framework was assessed using different ensemble skill scores new hydrological insights for the region our results show that the quality of runoff predictions are closely linked to the performance of the rainfall seasonal predictions and allows skillful predictions up to two months ahead in most sub basins the anthropogenic conditions such as in the western bahia state however must be taken under consideration since non stationary runoff time series have poorer skill as such unnatural variations can not be captured by long term covariances in sub basins which are dominated by little anthropogenic influence the presented framework provides a promising and easily transferable approach for skillful operational seasonal runoff predictions on sub basin scale keywords hydro meteorology seasonal forecast river basin management data assimilation 1 introduction the effect of global warming on climatic extreme events such as droughts combined with the growing water demand for cities and irrigation can result in intense water scarcity in certain regions of the world schewe et al 2014 stocker et al 2014 du et al 2018 mostly impacted are semi arid regions due to limited water availability accumulation and intensification of drought periods and increasing sedimentation of water reservoirs especially in those regions observational data is sparse and the number of reliable and long term operating measurement stations is decreasing lorenz and kunstmann 2012 this does not allow decision makers to rely on local statistics to anticipate those hardly predictable extreme events and thus to plan for a proactive water allocation during droughts and to manage reservoir levels during floods climatic information on seasonal scales are therefore particularly important and fortunately semi arid climates near or at the tropics can offer reasonable predictability on seasonal timescales in fact the climate variability in these regions is mainly affected by large scale forcing of thermal and dynamical atmosphere ocean interaction from intraseasonal to multidecadal timescale e g madden

represented in state of the art seasonal predictions systems johnson et al 2019 hence an adjustment of policies to sustainable water management and the development of tools to make global information usable for individual regions is required in this context seasonal sub basin scale runoff is proposed to be estimated applying a hydro meteorological enkf framework using the statistics of global freely available datasets and global model predictions this approach is derived from a previous study lorenz et al 2015 where enkf based basin scale runoff estimations proved to provide promising results on monthly time scales more specifically we focus on the application of publicly available global hydrometeorological datasets and exploit the joint temporal and regional covariance structures to generate least square estimated predictions the motivation is to develop a similar framework for seasonal runoff predictions using seasonal precipitation predictions from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf latest seasonal forecasting system seas5 as well as reanalysis based reference precipitation from era5 land which is an offline re run of the land surface component from ecmwf s latest atmospheric reanalysis era5 we further use runoff observation data from the brazilian national water agency ana in fact different studies showed the potential of seasonal forecasts to predict extreme events like droughts and to support water management in semi arid regions changnon and vonnhame 1986 garbrecht et al 2006 portele et al 2021 in this regard various statistical rainfall runoff models misumi et al 2001 garbrecht et al 2006 ajami et al 2016 de paiva et al 2020 or process based hydrological models yuan et al 2016 crochemore et al 2016 meißner et al 2017 foster et al 2018 sehgal and sridhar 2019 wanders et al 2019 which convert climate or seasonal precipitation forecasts into stream flows adapted for real time basin monitoring already exist in comparison our proposed framework uses high resolution precipitation forecasts within a statistical rainfall runoff enkf framework to predict computationally efficient seasonal runoff at sub catchment level in this study the são francisco river basin sfrb in brazil is investigated being disposed to have increasing water related problems in the future cunha et al 2018 the sfrb requires sustainable mitigation strategies and therefore provides a suitable testbed for the enkf based seasonal hydrological forecasting system 2 material 2 1 study area with a total surface area of 636 851 km2 the sfrb fig 1 is a very multifaceted region both in terms of its climatic and physical characterization as well as its environmental diversity with its 2860 km of length the river originates in the canastra mountain in the central part of the southeast region and flows into the atlantic ocean in the northeast part of the catchment the main course of the river is supplied by the tributaries of several sub basins with 75 of the water flow generated in the upper reach of the state of minas gerais maneta et al 2009 traini et al 2012 de jong et al 2018 the sfrb unites regions with two different climate regimes between the upper and lower basin in the southern part of the basin regions 3 11 in fig 1 the rainy season is during november december january ndj and its variability is strongly influenced by the south atlantic convergence zone sacz kodama 1992 kodama 1993 carvalho et al 2002 carvalho et al 2004 the rainy season over the northern part regions 0 2 in fig 1 is observed during january apr jfma and is mainly linked to the high activity of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the emergence of easterly waves and squall lines derived by the sea breeze paredestrejo et al 2016 sun et al 2016 because of its high population of approx 17 million people the region incorporates important economic activities increasing the stress on the environment and the water resources ioris 2001 maneta et al 2009 apart from drinking water freshwater resources are mainly used for electricity generation urban and industrial services intensive irrigation and mining activities this involves a high concentration of dams and water abstractions all along the sfrb river de jong et al 2018 do vasco et al 2019 dos santos et al 2020 the western bahia state regions 5 6 and 7 in fig 1 in particular is a very active agricultural area which is subject to significant reduction in river discharge rainfall and ground water level since the 1980s pousa et al 2019 santos et al 2020 in addition to the significant environmental impact of these activities on biodiversity soil erosion and land desertification cunha et al 2015 tomasella et al 2018 the north east of the region was recently hit by an intense multi year drought that caused a significant lack of water in the region and emptied most reservoirs marengo et al 2018 martins et al 2018 2 2 data the study is based on 11 sub basins of the sfrb fig 1 and monthly time series over a total period of 30 years between 1981 and 2011 the 11 sub basins were delineated and associated with runoff gauges given the spatial distribution of the gauges and the spatial resolution of the precipitation products information about the different data sets used for this study are summarized in table 1 more detailed information about the runoff gauges and missing values can be found in table 2 2 2 1 runoff the gauges located at the sub basins outlet were used to quantify the runoff of each sub basin red triangles in fig 1 the daily discharge data of the 11 selected gauges were obtained from the brazilian national water agency ana database which contains all information collected by the national hydrometeorological network rhn in brazil the data are averaged monthly and the few missing values see table 2 are filled using the climatology because of the high dam concentration in region 0 fig 1 which denies the description of the natural relationship between precipitation and runoff through simple covariances or correlations only the n 1 11 sub basins are considered in this study 2 2 2 precipitation reference precipitation is taken from the era5 land climate reanalysis muñoz sabater et al 2021 dataset of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf integrated forecasting system ifs this dataset is derived from a re run of the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis hersbach 2016 and contains gridded daily global land surface precipitation at 9 km resolution from 1950 onwards era5 land has the particular advantage of including a representation of the hydrological cycle which improves the agreement between river discharge estimates and available observations the hydro meteorological consistency and high spatial resolution of era5 land makes it an ideal dataset for hydrological research purposes the gridded data were monthly and spatially averaged over the different sub basins to obtain basin scale rainfall estimates 2 2 3 bias corrected and spatially disaggregated seasonal forecasts seas5 bcsd monthly seasonal forecasts for precipitation are obtained from ecmwfs latest seasonal forecasting system seas5 which are bias corrected and spatially disaggregated towards era5 land lorenz et al 2021 the forecasts cover the whole re forecast period from 1981 to 2019 and include bias corrected and spatially disaggregated daily and monthly ensemble forecasts for precipitation average minimum and maximum temperature as well as for shortwave radiation from the issue date to the next 215 days and have a spatial resolution of 0 1 they consist of an ensemble of 25 until 2016 and 51 from 2017 members that are corrected towards era5 land using a quantile mapping approach for estimating a temporally consistent set of land surface variables the bias correction of precipitation forecasts further includes a correction of precipitation intermittency to ensure the agreement of the wet and dry day frequencies from era5 land and seas5 bcsd compared to the raw seas5 forecasts seas5 bcsd has a higher spatial resolution lower biases with respect to era5 land and substantially reduced model drifts with forecast lead time and are hence more suitable for regional applications because this study focuses on a time period prior 2016 the seas5 bcsd ensemble size has only 25 members 3 methods 3 1 prediction model for this enkf framework the state of the system is represented as a multi dimensional vector x of size 2 n reg with n reg being the number of sub basins containing the runoff r and the precipitation p state vectors to be estimated at each time step t 1 x t p t t r t t t the prediction equation has been derived under the assumption that the time evolution of the precipitation and runoff anomalies can be written as a first order stochastic process 2 r t a r t 1 ϵ with the monthly residual r at time step t 3 r t x t x m p t p m r t r m and the long term mean annual cycle for the state vector x at month m over a total period of τ months 4 x m 1 τ 12 i m τ 12 x i m the prediction is characterized by the matrix of the process dynamics a and is supposed to model the dynamics and statistical relationship of the temporal evolution of the two water cycle variables the zero mean normally distributed white prediction noise ϵ n 0 q p represents errors coming from the model data parameters and physics with q p being the prediction error covariance matrix because of the complexity and the lack of physical knowledge about the dynamics of the process model a is considered as unknown nevertheless an estimation a can be obtained with least square prediction methods making use of the process stochastic information for a complete and detailed derivation of the methodology see moritz 1980 kurtenbach et al 2012 tourian 2013 lorenz et al 2015 we are looking for an approximation a as a linear estimator of r t given r t 1 5 r t a r t 1 where r is the predicted state the estimated prediction matrix a should minimize the prediction error e r t r t i e minimize the trace of the error covariance matrix q p the total error can be developed as follow 6 q p e e e t e r t r t r t r t t σ σ δ a t a σ δ t a σ a t and is thus minimized for 7 a σ δ σ 1 by inserting 7 into 6 we finally obtain the error covariance of the prediction matrix a 8 q p σ σ δ σ 1 σ t where σ e r t r t t and σ δ e r t r t 1 t are the spatio temporal auto and cross covariance matrices respectively these covariance matrices are approximated with the empirical sample covariance matrices σ and σ δ between anomalies of precipitation and runoff over the total time period of τ months 9 σ σ 1 τ 1 t 1 τ r t r t t 10 σ δ σ δ 1 τ 2 t 2 τ r t r t 1 t 3 2 the ensemble kalman filter framework according to the previous derived least square prediction estimate the prediction equation can be developed by substituting 3 in 2 11 x t d f a x t 1 d a b u t 1 ϵ d where b and u represent the control input terms 12 b a i a n d u t x t 1 x t t as a result the predicted state vector x t f at time t can be estimated using the analysis state x t 1 a at time t 1 the prediction matrix a describing the variables spatio temporal relationships and the control input u that represents the mean annual cycle i stands for the identity matrix i σς 1 and the index d refers to the ensemble member from an ensemble of size n ens the prediction and observation covariance matrices are estimated by the sample covariance matrix from the ensemble prediction of size n ens 13 σ t f 1 n e n s 1 d 1 n e n s x t d f x t f x t d f x t f t with x t f the ensemble mean these covariance matrices describe the uncertainity in the predicted and corrected states in the innovation step the analysis state x t d a and its associated covariance matrix σ x t a are obtained by updating the gain weighted difference between the observed state y t and the predicted state x t d f the correction step is formulated as follow 14 x t d a x t d f k t y t h t x t d f ν d with the observation relation matrix h t that maps the predicted state to the observed space and the zero mean normally distributed observation noise ν n 0 q t o b s the kalman gain matrix k t represents the optimal weighting between the error covariance of the predicted state σ x t and the errors of the observed state q t obs it is defined as 15 k t σ x t f h t t h t σ x t f h t t q t o b s 1 the model is then integrated recursively forward in time from the innovation until the next update cycle 3 3 observation update generally the observation vector y t and associated observation error covariance matrix q t obs are given by 16 y t p t o b s r t o b s 17 q t o b s σ p t 0 σ r t where p t obs and r t obs are the observation vectors of precipitation and runoff at time t with σ p t and σ r t their corresponding error covariance matrices for the forecast initialization the observation vector y t of size 2 n reg includes the historical precipitation era5 land and runoff ana vectors at time t since we assume perfect observations during the initialization the corresponding error covariance is set to zero during the forecast the predicted state is updated at each time step t using the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts at the corresponding forecast lead time since runoff observations are not assimilated the observation vector reduces to 18 y t p t o b s where p t obs represents the precipitation observation vector at time t including all seas5 bcsd ensemble members this gives y t a total size of n reg n bcsd with n bcsd the seas5 bcsd ensemble size indeed the whole ensemble is assimilated in order to benefit from all the information contained in the forecasts each element of the observation vector has an associated observation error covariance contained in q t obs σ p t which is estimated from the squared ensemble spread of the seas5 bcsd precipitation ensemble forecasts for the given region and forecast horizon 3 4 further assumptions no spin up is applied to the model states as this reduces the prediction performance possible reasons could be that the observation covariance matrices generated by a probabilistic climatology are not well conditioned or that the convergence to the optimal error level is too slow and would require more data various ensemble sensitivity tests not shown here suggest that an ensemble size of n ens 200 members is a robust choice for the enkf runs 3 5 evaluation framework four different skill scores namely the inter quantile range skill score iqrss between the 95th and 5th percentiles the mean absolute error skill score maess the continuous ranked probability skill score crpss and the brier skill score bss for above and below normal conditions were computed a detailed description of the used score metrics can be found in appendix a the reference ensemble forecast for runoff and precipitation are leave one year out climatology based ensemble forecasts generated from the ana runoff and the era5 land precipitation data respectively for a given year this established method consists of combining the observations of all other years to create an ensemble forecast so that the validation is done with independent data the performance scores are then derived for both runoff and seas5 bcsd precipitation predictions and are computed for each region time step and lead time over the evaluation period in this study we focus only on the first four lead times with lead 0 referring to the current month s forecast and lead 3 to the fourth month s forecast an overview of the size of the different parameters used in the enkf framework can be found in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 annual cycle fig 2 shows the rainy season of the whole sfrb and its 12 sub basins the two maxima visible in december regions 3 11 and march regions 0 2 shows the entanglement of the two different climate regimes between the upper and lower basin the main rainy season in the lower basin is observed during january april jfma and in the upper portion of the basin it is during november january ndj in this study we consider the period from november to march as a good compromise between the two climate zones to describe the wet season of the entire sfrb folland et al 2001 misra 2006 and kulikova et al 2014 presented evidence of a relationship between pacific and tropical atlantic sst anomaly patterns and seasonal precipitation in northeast brazil contributing to the long term predictability over the sfrb this is confirmed by the good level of agreement between the first lead times of seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts and era5 land precipitation in fig 2 similarities in the spatio temporal relationship between runoff and rainfall can also be observed however regions 5 6 and 7 do not seem to follow the typical rainy season cycle it is expected therefore that predicting runoff in those regions may be more difficult 4 2 prediction performance the runoff of the 11 sfrb sub basins is reforecasted on a monthly basis over the evaluation period 1981 2011 fig 3 shows the reforecasts of lead time 0 blue and corresponding runoff gauge observations red in most cases the forecasts can reproduce the observed stream flow in particular the upper basin region 8 11 and lower basin region 1 4 show the best agreement with a good concordance between the predicted and observed runoff peaks however predictions for the western bahia state regions 5 7 have a lower quality compared to observations with a noisy behavior and a general underestimation of the baseflow during the first 15 years correspondingly the reduction of the river streamflow described in section 2 1 is visible in these regions over the same period since the control input term u eq 12 carries information on the mean annual cycle an abnormal structure of the annual cycle of those regions can explain the observed underestimation of the runoff predictions while most events in the catchment are well predicted a few seem to be more difficult to predict e g fig 3 region 11 in 1991 or region 8 in 1982 it is therefore important to determine the origin of the performance whether it derives from the algorithm the quality of the driving data or the quality of the seas5 bcsd rainfall predictions therefore a deeper analysis was initiated where the different performance metrics described in the methods section were calculated figs 4 and 5 show the monthly and seasonally averaged skill scores respectively of the enkf runoff reforecasts and corresponding seas5 bcsd precipitation predictions during the main rainy season november march for the first four lead months in all regions the skill of the predictions is shown in colors from blue better skill than the reference forecast to orange worse skill than the reference forecast in both figures an overall good agreement of the three skill scores for the runoff predictions and the seas5 bcsd precipitation predictions can be seen with similar patterns over months lead times and regions and a general trend of decreasing skill with lead time additionally for both the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts and the runoff forecasts an improved skill during the first months of the rainy season nov dec jan is evident compared to the last months of the rainy season feb march this monthly trend is more pronounced for the runoff forecasts especially at higher lead times lead 2 and 3 the forecast sharpness accuracy and overall performance of both the runoff and seas5 bcsd forecasts decrease similarly for the first two lead times the good iqrss and maess and crpss values for these lead times imply that the predictions are very accurate only slightly deviate from the reference and have a more representative distribution with respect to climatology however for higher lead times the seas5 bcsd predictions performance remains more uniform compared to the runoff predictions which decrease more linearly in fig 4 where all three skill scores of the runoff forecasts are positive for most of the upper and lower basin regions 5 6 and 7 show poorer performance affecting all different lead times and months this can also be seen in fig 5 where the maess and iqrss of the runoff forecasts over the rainy season are negative for all lead times in region 5 and negative for regions 6 7 from lead time 2 on this trend which isn t visible in the seas5 bcsd precipitation predictions skill scores is concordant with the previously mentioned erratic behavior in the runoff time series in those regions fig 3 interestingly the lead 2 forecasts in february have a lower skill compared to the lead 3 forecast this is also associated with a lower skill in the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts this finding is counter intuitive since a monotonically decreasing performance with lead time was expected it has however been shown by several studies that central eastern brazil can show low predictability on a seasonal scale during the austral summer as rainfall variability is related to complex land atmosphere interactions that are not well captured by models marengo et al 2003 grimm et al 2007 to assess the ability of the enkf framework to forecast events above or below the seasonal average the bss was calculated to investigate which part of the skill is directly engendered by the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecast and which part is inherent to the enkf framework the bss was also computed for seas5 bcsd precipitation forecast against the era5 land product fig 6 shows the bss for both mentioned cases for lead 0 over the different regions and months of the rainy season for both cases of above normal and below normal we can see positive bss above 0 3 for most months and regions even for the regions of the western bahia state in addition fig 7 shows the bss for each month averaged over the whole rainy season and for the first four lead times in both cases the upper and lower tercile show better skill for lead 0 compared to higher lead times with scores close to zero furthermore lead 0 has higher skill scores in the lower basin compared to the upper basin the features visible here show that the precipitation events in the above and below normal categories of the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecast match that of the predicted runoff with higher scores in lead 0 compared to higher leads the skill score analysis illustrates how this framework is able to exploit the simple rainfall runoff relationship which in combination with the quality of the seas5 bcsd provides skillful runoff predictions up to two months ahead in most cases the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts outperform or are close to the runoff forecasts but in some cases the seas5 bcsd precipitation forecasts also outperform the runoff forecasts greuell et al 2019 crochemore et al 2016 and yossef et al 2013 have shown that in european catchments most frameworks using process based hydrological models and post processed seasonal forecasts ecmwf seasonal forecast systems 3 seas3 and 4 seas4 as input hardly show skill beyond one lead month yossef et al 2013 showed that in the tropical catchments of south america the accuracy of runoff forecasts from the fews world global seasonal runoff forecasting system driven by seas3 precipitation forecasts is limited to 1 2 months lead time during most of the year the presented enkf framework shows similar performance with skillful runoff predictions of 1 2 months ahead during the rainy season in most of the sf sub basins consequently the severe recurrent droughts in northeastern brazil in 2011 2016 cunha et al 2019 marengo et al 2017 erfanian et al 2017 could have been anticipated 1 2 months in advance corresponding to sub basins 1 2 and 3 however a direct comparison is inherently delicate as the forecast performance can depend on many factors e g the hydrological model employed the seasonal forecasts product the post processing techniques applied the different geographical locations or the different regional and seasonal weather regimes affecting the study area enso mjo north atlantic oscillation nao finally this framework does not require prior knowledge of local hydrological initial conditions generally necessary to run a model soil moisture snowpack groundwater storage regulation of lakes and dams which makes this approach very suitable for regions where hydrological information is lacking furthermore it is a transferable approach that can complement other types of statistical or more physically based models to easily monitor a single catchment at sub basin level the number of input variables such as evapotranspiration or temperature is also expandable allowing for more robust correlations between all variables and thus improving prediction quality as shown in lorenz et al 2015 this approach for global sub basin forecasts can be extended to other regions as seas5 bcsd forecasts for other regions already exist lorenz et al 2021 5 summary and conclusion in this study a hydro meteorological ensemble kalman filter enkf based data assimilation framework is developed with which sub basin scale runoff time series are predicted a least squares prediction method has been applied for the prediction scheme in order to exploit the spatio temporal relationship between precipitation and runoff besides reference runoff ana and precipitation era5 land bias corrected and spatially disaggregated seasonal precipitation forecasts seas5 bcsd are used in order to predict runoff several months ahead the performance of the framework was assessed for 11 sub basins of the rio são francisco basin by comparing predicted against a reference leave one year out climatology based ensemble forecast overall the enkf runoff predictions have a good performance over most months with a general decrease of the skill with lead time the positive performance in the runoff predictions for all skill scores demonstrated the ability of the assimilation framework to capture the concurrent precipitation runoff relationship on sub basin scale and to provide skillful estimates of runoff up to 2 months ahead this framework however also suffers from a number of limitations 1 the skill of the seas5 bcsd predictions is the primary constraining factor for the performance of runoff forecasts as these are used as input to the model 2 the simplicity of the least squares prediction method is limited by the insufficient knowledge of the model physics the catchment characteristics and the local hydroclimatic conditions for example our current model cannot describe regions where runoff is disturbed by anthropogenic activities such as in the western state of bahia regions 5 6 and 7 on the other hand the framework is very suitable for regions where the key parameters for hydrological modeling as well as the initial and boundary conditions are missing 3 the set of input variables which can be extended to further variables in the seas5 bcsd dataset such as evapotranspiration or temperature could provide additional correlation statistics that have the potential to further improve the skill of the runoff predictions future work could include comparisons and implementation of this methodology to process based hydrological models with more input variables and a wider range of regions finally this approach which relies on global freely available information for regional runoff forecasting has great potential for regional decision support as well as seasonal water resource management and can complement other existing operational hydrological models this includes the development of institutional systems and national strategies for drought preparedness plans long term flood awareness and sustainable reservoir management with a computationally cost effective and easily transferable approach credit authorship contribution

data of this study are available under the doi 10 35097 600 in the radar4kit repository appendix a score metrics the forecasts are evaluated by comparing the performance of a given forecast against a reference forecast in general the skill score of a given region month and lead time is expressed as a 1 s k i l l s c o r e 1 s k i l l f s k i l l r skill scores are obtained by the median of the individual scores and range from to 1 with scores larger smaller than zero indicating that the forecast system is more less skillful than the reference forecast a 1 inter quantile range iqr sharpness is an intrinsic property of the forecast and indicates the spread of the ensemble forecast when the ensemble spread is too large it indicates uncertain predictions when the ensemble spread is small the ensemble members are consistent and the forecast is more confident in this study sharpness is evaluated as the difference between the 95th and 5th percentiles of the forecast distribution defined as the inter quantile range iqr a 2 mean absolute error mae the accuracy of the forecasts is assessed with the mean absolute error mae the mae computes the absolute difference between the forecast ensemble mean and the observed value and is expressed as a 2 m a e 1 d d 1 d x f d x o where x f is the ensemble forecast of size d and x o denotes the associated observation smaller mae values correspond to more accurate forecasts a 3 brier score bs the brier score bs is generally used for scoring binary forecasts and is defined as the mean squared error of the forecast probability and a observed category a 3 b s 1 t t 1 t x f t x o t 2 where x o t is the actual observed category at instance t and x f t is the categorical forecast probability of that same event the bs indicates how a

7913,study region the usutu mhlatuze water management area located in northern kwazulu natal province south africa study focus recent studies have indicated a steady decline in groundwater levels in the usutu mhlatuze water management area however the absence of representative aquifer storage parameter values including storativity and specific yield lack of sufficient groundwater monitoring wells and inconsistent and erratic groundwater level observation data from existing limited networks make it difficult to understand groundwater storage changes in the region therefore this study analyses groundwater storage change of the primary and secondary aquifers within the usutu mhlatuze water management area using grace satellite derived terrestrial water storage data global land data assimilation system gldas soil moisture data and in situ measured surface water storage information new hydrological insights for the region the grace derived groundwater storage anomalies for the usutu mhlatuze water management area showed good agreement with in situ groundwater storage anomalies observed from the limited groundwater level monitoring piezometers in the primary and secondary aquifers the goodness of fit r2 between the grace derived and the observed groundwater storage changes in the primary and secondary aquifers were 0 79 and 0 74 respectively the grace derived groundwater storage change data for the entire study period between 2002 and 2020 indicated that the primary and secondary aquifers experienced a groundwater storage loss of 925 106 m3 and 3614 106 m3 respectively keywords terrestrial water storage groundwater storage depletion primary and secondary aquifers remote sensing land use and climate changes 1 introduction groundwater is the primary water supply source in africa where according to unesco 2020 up to 75 of the population rely on groundwater for daily use in the south african context approximately 80 of the rural communities depend on groundwater for their water supply igrac 2013 this percentage of groundwater use is much higher in the usutu mhlathuze water management area wma located in north eastern south africa where the provision of reticulated surface water supply schemes are very costly braune 2000 kelbe et al 2016 however groundwater levels in the usutu mhlathuze wma have been reported to be declining ndlovu and demlie 2018 for instance groundwater level monitoring boreholes in the vicinity of the tembe and mbazwana areas located in the north eastern part of the wma experienced a groundwater level decline of 0 7 m and 2 7 m respectively between 2004 and 2015 ndlovu and demlie 2018 additionally areas located in the southern part of the wma including richards bay experienced reductions in groundwater levels ranging from 0 7 m to 6 3 m for the same period ndlovu and demlie 2018 notwithstanding these groundwater level declines quantitative evaluation of the groundwater storage gws change across the entire wma is limited in recent years the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite based product has been widely used to determine groundwater storage changes in many regions rodell et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2010 bhanja et al 2018 tangdamrongsub et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 melati et al 2019 rahaman et al 2019 these studies have highlighted that terrestrial water storage from grace coupled with ancillary data provide invaluable information on groundwater storage changes rodell et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2010 bhanja et al 2018 similarly abiy and melesse 2017 bhanja et al 2018 and zhong et al 2018 have highlighted the potential of grace in monitoring groundwater storage changes at regional scales abiy and melesse 2017 interpreted grace data for the lake tana basin in ethiopia for the period from 2003 to 2013 and reported that soil moisture and groundwater storages declined by 0 18 m bhanja et al 2018 analysed grace satellite data in alberta canada and demonstrated that the rate of groundwater depletion in the athabasca river basin is 0 20 cm yr zhong et al 2018 showed that grace derived groundwater storage for the west liaohe river basin in china declined at a rate of 0 92 0 49 km3 yr from 2005 to 2011 whilst huang et al 2016 and scanlon et al 2012 indicated the challenges of linking grace based groundwater storage change estimates to point scale in situ ground observations or to areas smaller than the grace footprint however in regions where the availability of groundwater monitoring networks are limited and uncertainties in the estimation of aquifer storage coefficients are high analysis of grace data provides an opportunity to determine the spatial and temporal groundwater storage changes for large catchment areas in this regard the usutu mhlathuze wma is a good candidate for the application of grace derived data in studying groundwater storage changes where preliminary analysis of scattered in situ groundwater level measurements showed a decline in groundwater storage across the wma therefore the objective of this study is to validate grace derived groundwater storage changes against in situ measured groundwater storages and evaluate the groundwater storage gws changes in the wma the application of grace derived data analysis in the wma under consideration will be the first of its kind in south african catchments as such the results of this study will aid in validating more regional scale studies furthermore understanding the spatial and temporal changes in the gws in the wma will inform policy for sustainable water resources management in an ecologically important and environmentally sensitive region 2 description of study area 2 1 location and climate the study area covers the entire usutu mhlatuze wma located in northern kwazulu natal and southern parts of mpumalanga provinces in south arica fig 1 the basin is transboundary with a small part of the drainage basin extending into the republic of mozambique and the kingdom of swaziland now eswatini these transboundary portions are not considered in this study the usutu mhlatuze wma is approximately 270 km wide and 350 km in length covering an area of about 41 240 km2 the wma has a population of approximately 2 5 million people where the north eastern region of the wma is described as one of the most underdeveloped areas in south africa statistics sa 2016 the landcover of the study area is diverse and comprises of barren land built up areas cultivated land forested land grasslands mines shrubland waterbodies and wetlands fig 2c commercial and subsistence farming is a primary source of income for many and is distributed throughout the study area with a high concentration of irrigated and rainfed sugarcane found in the south a high concentration of commercial plantations is prevalent in the north western region and can be found distributed along the coastal plain fig 2c the wma can be described as having a subtropical climate and receives summer rainfall between october and march the rainfall is temporally and spatially variable ranging from 1682 mm yr along the southern coastal area to 487 mm yr in the central interior fig 2a the mean daily temperatures for the wma vary from 21 0 c to 32 1 c in summer and from 10 9 c to 26 4 c in winter saws 2018 the mean potential evaporation is approximately 1458 mm yr dws 2018 2 2 topography and drainage the highest elevation in the wma is approximately 2200 m above mean sea level amsl in the western region of the area fig 2b from where the elevation drops to sea level along the coast the topography in the north eastern part of the study area is relatively flat the main rivers that drain the wma are the usutu pongola mkuze mfolozi and mhlathuze rivers which all flow in a general eastward direction fig 2b the usutu river flows from the north western part of the wma into swaziland the pongola river flows from the western boundary of the wma into pongolapoort dam and flows towards mozambique and joins the usutu river to form the maputo river where it discharges into maputo bay in mozambique dennis and dennis 2009 kelbe and germishuyse 2010 the mkuze river drains into the indian ocean via lake st lucia while the mfolozi and mhlathuze rivers discharge directly into the indian ocean the north eastern sector of the wma has no significant rivers but consists of key surface water bodies including lake sibayi and the lake kosi bay system which are predominately groundwater driven kelbe and germishuyse 2010 ndlovu and demlie 2016 2 3 hydrogeological setting groundwater in the wma occurs in primary intergranular and secondary fractured and weathered aquifers the main primary aquifer is the largest primary aquifer in south africa and occurs in the extensive maputaland coastal plain located along the indian ocean coast fig 2d kelbe et al 2001 weitz and demlie 2014 ndlovu and demlie 2016 2018 these primary aquifers are made up of the miocene to holocene age maputaland group rocks including from oldest to youngest the uloa port dunford kosi bay kwambonambi and sibayi formations these aquifers are characterized by similar mean hydraulic conductivities of 4 5 4 3 4 3 5 and 8 6 m day respectively worthington 1978 meyer and godfrey 1995 the basal uloa formation is known to be the highest yielding aquifer within the maputaland sediments meyer et al 2001 weitz and demlie 2015 table 1 provides a summary of the hydraulic properties for the primary aquifers the secondary weathered and fractured aquifers cover a wide area in the interior and western part of the wma fig 2d these weathered and fractured rock aquifers are made up of a complex group of rocks spanning in age from swazian basement rocks of the kaapvaal craton to the cretaceous zululand group rocks mccarthy and rubidge 2005 the weathered and fractured aquifers are made up of the pongola supergroup rocks the empangeni metamorphic suite rocks of the natal metamorphic province the karoo supergroup and the zululand group rocks these weathered and fractured aquifers are characterised by variable aquifer hydraulic characteristics table 2 and consequently variable groundwater potential the fractured aquifers consist mainly of the natal group sandstones and to a lesser extent the dwyka group rocks where the former is reported to have high groundwater potential due to extensive fracturing and faulting demlie and titus 2015 the estimated groundwater recharge rate for the coastal region ranges from 50 to 100 mm a while the central inland area experiences an estimated groundwater recharge rate of between 10 and 25 mm a dws 2006 surface water groundwater interactions in the eastern part of the wma along the maputaland coastal plain means that the surface water systems are dependent on groundwater to varying degrees kelbe and germishuyse 2010 weitz and demlie 2014 ndlovu and demlie 2016 several streams lakes and wetlands located along the coastal plain are predominantly groundwater dependent kelbe and germishuyse 2010 barath 2015 3 data and methodology groundwater storage anomalies gwsa for the usutu mhlatuze wma were determined using grace derived terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa soil moisture anomalies sma derived from gldas and measured surface water anomalies swa the gwsa was then validated using in situ measured groundwater level data at a number of observation boreholes located across the primary and secondary aquifer regions of the wma 3 1 grace derived terrestrial water storage anomaly the grace mission was launched in march 2002 and operated until october 2017 nasa 2012 cooley and landerer 2019 during its 15 year operation grace provided valuable earth observation data which contributed to the understanding of ocean mass distribution changes in polar ice soil moisture surface water and ground water storage at large scales rodell et al 2007 nasa 2012 cooley and landerer 2019 subsequently the gravity recovery and climate experiment follow on grace fo mission was launched in may 2018 grace consists of two satellites which follow each other around the earth with a distance of 220 km between them where the earth s gravitational force affects the lead satellite a small change in distance between the two satellites occurs rodell et al 2007 nasa 2012 cooley and landerer 2019 the satellites microwave ranging system can detect minute changes in the distance between the satellites an accelerometer located on each satellite and a global positioning systems gps determine the non gravitational acceleration and the exact positions of the satellites above the earth s surface respectively nasa 2012 cooley and landerer 2019 this information is used to construct monthly maps of the earth s average gravity field which provides details of how mass mostly water is moving on earth nasa 2012 cooley and landerer 2019 in this study the grace jet propulsion laboratory jpl rl06 mass concentration mascon dataset was used to obtain twsa for the period from april 2002 to february 2020 the jpl rl06 mascon was used in this study as it uses a priori constraints in time and space to minimise measurement errors wiese et al 2019 the data is available at a monthly temporal resolution with a grid size of 0 5 degrees each monthly grace tellus grid represents the surface mass deviation for that month relative to a baseline temporal average wiese et al 2019 the baseline temporal average is the average between 2004 and 2009 this baseline temporal average is subtracted from all other monthly grids to provide terrestrial water storage anomalies wiese et al 2019 the rl06 mascon uses a newly defined grid which split tiles along the coastline to minimize the leakage between land and ocean signals wiese et al 2019 since the current study area is located along the coast the dataset which includes the coastal resolution improvement cri filter was used to correct the signal leakage along the coastlines in accordance with wiese et al 2019 furthermore a gain factor which is used to enhance the spatial resolution was applied to the dataset as recommended for hydrological studies swenson and wahr 2007 landerer et al 2010 wiese et al 2019 notable gaps are present in the grace dataset related to the active battery management which began in 2011 due to the aging batteries of the grace satellites these gaps occur approximately every 5 6 months and last for 4 5 weeks cooley and landerer 2019 a further gap in the dataset corresponds to the time period between the decommissioning of grace october 2017 and launch of grace fo may 2018 these time periods which contained gaps were treated as missing data which was not infilled 3 2 global land data assimilation system gldas derived soil moisture data monthly soil moisture data was obtained from gldas gldas is a joint program between the national aeronautics space administration nasa and the national centre for environmental prediction and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa rahaman et al 2019 gldas produces hydrologic components by integrating satellite based and in situ observations rahaman et al 2019 the gldas monthly soil moisture data from the noah lsm with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees was used in this study the monthly soil moisture data with an average depth of 10 cm was produced using the gldas 2 1 noah 3 hourly lsm data simulated in the noah 3 6 land information system beaudoing et al 2020 3 3 surface water level data monthly surface water level data for the period between 2002 and 2020 was obtained for the three main lakes and nine dams located within the study area from the south african department of water and sanitation dws the location of the dams and lakes within the wma are shown in fig 1 3 4 in situ observed groundwater level data groundwater level data measured from monitoring boreholes located within and around the usutu mhlatuze wma was obtained from dws the location of the monitoring boreholes are indicated in fig 1 these boreholes were selected based on the length and quality of the data record since groundwater storage changes in primary and secondary aquifers are different due to variation in their hydrogeological characteristics the groundwater storage changes in the water management area are analysed by grouping the primary and secondary aquifers separately these primary and secondary aquifers have an approximate area of 6 520 km2 and 34 290 km2 respectively reliable groundwater level data within the usutu mhlatuze wma was obtained from nine monitoring boreholes located in the primary aquifers and only one monitoring borehole in the secondary aquifer as a result five additional boreholes located in the immediate vicinity of the usutu mhlatuze wma that monitor similar secondary aquifers were used to compliment the limited data relatively continuous groundwater level data was found for the period between 2010 and 2016 and as such the measured groundwater level data was pre processed and used to validate the grace derived gwsa for this period the groundwater level data collected from each monitoring well was adjusted for variability of measurement reference surfaces by subtracting the collar height of each monitoring borehole from the measured depth to groundwater the in situ gwsa was determined using eq 1 bhanja et al 2018 1 gwsa hm hi s where hm is the mean depth to groundwater level for the measurement period hi is the groundwater level depth at time period i and sy is the storativity or specific yield of the respective aquifers most of the storativity and or the specific yield data for the primary and secondary aquifers were obtained from the kwazulu natal groundwater characterization and mapping project undertaken by martinelli and associates 1994 groundwater development services 1995 martinelli and associates 1994 and vsa earth science consultants 1995 the storativity and or the specific yield data obtained for the various primary and secondary aquifers in the wma are limited and are highly variable the mean storativity values of 0 04 and 0 015 for the primary and secondary aquifers respectively are used in this study which are obtained from the mean values reported in martinelli and associates 1994 groundwater development services 1995 vsa earth science consultants 1995 meyer and godfrey 2003 barath 2015 and weitz and demlie 2015 a standard deviation of the mean in situ gwsa for the primary aquifer was calculated based on the groundwater level data from the nine boreholes and the mean in situ gwsa for the secondary aquifer were determined based on the groundwater level data from the six monitoring boreholes 3 5 determination of grace derived groundwater storage anomalies grace provides total terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa therefore to derive the gwsa the soil moisture and surface water data anomalies have to be determined the anomalies are determined using the mean for the period between january 2004 and december 2009 cooley and landerer 2019 the anomalies are calculated by subtracting the mean from all monthly observations of the respective data cooley and landerer 2019 eventually the gwsa is determined by removing the sma and swa from the grace derived twsa using eq 2 and based on the datasets summarised in table 3 2 gwsa twsa sma swa 3 6 trend analysis the nonparametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 has been widely used in the field of water resources and climatic studies for trend detection patle et al 2015 pathak and dodamani 2019 ndlovu and demlie 2020 the mann kendall trend test was used to identify trends of the twsa sma and gwsa data in the study area at a 95 confidence level the purpose of the mann kendall test is to determine whether an upward or downward trend is present in a time series in the mann kendall test the null hypothesis ho is tested against the alternative hypothesis h1 where ho indicates that there is no trend and h1 indicates the presence of a trend the mann kendall statistic s is defined using eq 3 as mann 1945 kendall 1975 3 s n 1 i 1 n j i 1 sgn x j x i where n is the length of the sample xi is a time series ranked from i 1 2 n 1 and xj is ranked from j i 1 2 n sgn is the signum function defined in eq 4 4 sgn x j x i 1 if sgn x j x i 0 0 if sgn x j x i 0 1 if sgn x j x i 0 a positive s value indicates an increasing trend and a negative s value indicates a decreasing trend the mean of s is 0 and the variance of s can be acquired using eq 5 5 var s n n 1 2 n 5 σ t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where ti is the number of ties present with i as extent the standardized statistic z indicates whether a variable has an increasing decreasing or no trend and defined using eq 6 6 z s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 where z 0 indicates an increasing trend and z 0 indicates a decreasing trend the sen s slope estimator test is a simple non parametric procedure used to determine the true slope and magnitude of time series data sen 1968 this method is very robust against outliers and applied in this study the sen s slope estimator q is defined using eq 7 7 q x j x k j k for i 1 2 n where xj and xk are data values at times j and k j k respectively a positive q value indicates an increasing trend and a negative q value indicates a decreasing trend in addition trend images were extracted by fitting a time series at each grid point using a linear trend ahmed et al 2014 3 7 validation of grace derived groundwater storage anomalies models used to understand processes in hydrological and other environmental sciences must be evaluated to assess their performance model performance is evaluated by comparing the calculated data to the corresponding measured data and it is suggested that several statistical error criteria be used ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 in this study the grace gwsa data is compared against the in situ gwsa data using standard regression and error indices standard regression statistics coefficient of determination and pearson s correlation coefficient determine the strength of the linear relationship between modelled and measured data and error indices mean absolute error and root mean square error quantify the deviation of the modelled data from the measured data legates and mccabe 1999 the coefficient of determination r2 also known as the goodness of fit is a statistical measure in a regression model and determines the proportion of variance the values of r2 greater than 0 7 are regarded as good statistics 2021 pearson s correlation coefficient r values range from 1 to 1 the r values between 0 50 and 1 are said to be within acceptable range with higher values of the range preferable statistics 2021 although there is no absolute threshold mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse close to zero are regarded as excellent ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the r2 r mae and rmse was used to evaluate the validation of the grace derived gwsa 4 results 4 1 surface water storage anomalies the surface water anomalies were derived for the period from 2002 to 2020 based on data analysed from the three lakes and nine reservoirs of the usutu mhlatuze wma fig 3 the swa for some of the surface water bodies remained relatively constant throughout the study period expect for lake sibayi bivane dam heyshope dam geodertrouw dam morgenstond dam pongolapoort dam and klipfontein dam where a decrease in storage occurred between 2014 and 2020 the geodertrouw dam experienced the greatest reduction in storage from the mean swa 0 0089 m followed by lake sibayi swa 0 0057 m pongolapoort dam swa 0 0032 m klipfontein dam swa 0 003 m morgenstond dam swa 0 0014 m heyshope dam swa 0 0006 m and bivane dam swa 0 00055 m which occurred between 2016 and 2020 4 2 precipitation data between 2002 and 2020 precipitation data obtained from the makatini research centre for the period between 2002 and 2020 is presented in fig 5 the mann kendall trend test for precipitation in the usutu mhlatuze wma indicated an increasing trend for the period between 2002 and 2014 with a sen s slope of 6 74 while between 2014 and 2020 precipitation showed a decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 13 5 the mann kendall trend test for precipitation for the entire study period i e between 2002 and 2020 indicates an overall decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 10 table 4 provides a summary of the statistical analysis results of the mann kendall trend test and sens s slope for precipitation 4 3 terrestrial water storage anomalies derived from grace and its trend the results of the twsa trend map and time series data for the usutu mhlatuze wma derived from the grace satellite data for the period between april 2002 and february 2020 is presented in figs 4a and 5a respectively the twsa for the primary and secondary aquifers were similar through the study period it is observed that twsa decreased over time for both aquifers the highest and lowest twsa values were 0 098 m and 0 12 m recorded in 2013 and 2019 respectively the mann kendall trend test of the twsa in the usutu mhlatuze wma indicated an increasing trend for the period between 2002 and 2016 with a sen s slope of 0 047 while between 2016 and 2020 the twsa showed a decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 0 187 the mann kendall trend test of the twsa for the entire study period i e between 2002 and 2020 indicates an overall decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 0 001 the standard deviated was 5 8 and was used to determine the upper and lower error band fig 5a table 4 provides a summary of the statistical analysis results of the mann kendall trend test and sens s slope for the twsa 4 4 soil moisture anomalies sma derived from gldas the sma were derived from gldas data for the period between 2002 and 2020 the sma trend map and time series data for the sma is depicted in figs 4b and 5b respectively spatially the secondary aquifer had higher sma than the primary aquifer throughout the study period from 2002 2014 the mann kendall trend test indicated that there was an increasing trend with a sen s slope of 0 001 for this period the highest sma was 0 0084 m and the lowest was 0 008 m from 2014 2020 lower sma values were observed the mann kendall trend test for this latest period indicated a decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 0 001 the maximum and minimum sma values of 0 0048 m and 0 0094 m respectively were noted in 2014 and 2019 the overall sma trend for the entire study period between 2002 and 2020 is decreasing with a sen s slope of 0 001 the standard deviated was 0 43 and was used to determine the upper and lower error band fig 5b table 4 provides a summary of the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope for sma 4 5 grace derived groundwater storage anomalies and its validation the trend map of the grace derived gwsa is depicted in fig 4c the overall trend indicated that gwsa decreased over time for the primary and secondary aquifers the monthly grace derived groundwater storage anomalies for the primary and secondary aquifers were compared against monthly in situ observed groundwater storage anomalies fig 5c and d the period between 2010 and 2016 was used for the validation exercise as it contained a relatively continuous measured groundwater level data the r2 r mae and rmse are used to evaluate the validation the grace derived gwsa data and the measured gwsa data follow a very similar trend with r2 and r for the primary and secondary aquifers fall within acceptable ranges table 5 the r2 values between the grace derived and measured gwsa for the primary and secondary aquifers are 0 79 and 0 74 respectively the r values between grace derived and measured groundwater storage anomalies for the primary and secondary aquifers are 0 89 and 0 86 respectively the mae and the rmse values for the primary aquifer are 0 041 m and 0 035 m respectively while for the secondary aquifer are 0 025 m and 0 046 m respectively the calculated mae and rmse values for both aquifers are within acceptable limits the standard deviation for the in situ gwsa was determined to be 2 29 and 0 92 for the primary and secondary aquifer respectively and was used to determine the upper and lower error band fig 5c and d the standard deviation for the grace derived gwsa was determined to be 4 8 and 4 1 for the primary and secondary aquifer respectively and was used to determine the upper and lower error band fig 5c and d the statistical validation error criteria values of the grace derived gwsa are presented in table 5 4 6 results of long term grace derived groundwater storage change for the study area and its trends the grace based gwsa information derived for the primary and secondary aquifers of the study area for the period between 2002 and 2020 is presented in fig 6 the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope was used to identify trends and its magnitude in the grace derived gwsa the mann kendall trend test indicated an increasing trend in gwsa from 2002 to early 2014 for both aquifers during this period the sen s slope for the primary and secondary aquifers were 0 018 and 0 046 respectively both aquifers recorded the highest gwsa in march 2014 following this period a drastic decrease in gwsa is experienced for both aquifers up until 2020 where the sen s slope for the primary and secondary aquifers were 0 424 and 0 349 respectively the greatest decrease in gwsa occurred in november 2019 where the primary and secondary aquifers decreased by about 0 15 m and 0 13 m respectively table 6 provides a summary of the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope for the gwsa in the study area the mann kendall trend test revealed an overall decrease in the gwsa for the entire study period with sen s slope of 0 04 and 0 024 for the primary and secondary aquifers respectively during this period the primary and secondary aquifers experienced a groundwater storage loss of 925 106 m3 and 3614 106 m3 respectively 5 discussion the grace twsa gldas soil moisture anomaly and in situ observed surface water anomaly data were used to produce grace derived gwsa for the primary and secondary aquifers for the usutu mhlatuze wma the mann kendall trend test analyses for the twsa and sma indicated increasing trends between 2002 and 2014 with sen s slope of 0 47 and 0 001 respectively from 2014 2020 the twsa and sma showed decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 0 187 and 0 001 respectively during this latest period seven of the twelve surface water reservoirs lakes and dams in the study area experienced storage reduction 5 1 validation of the grace derived groundwater storage anomaly the grace derived gwsa for the period from 2010 to 2016 is validated against in situ measured gwsa for the same period the validation error criteria values for both the primary and secondary aquifers are within acceptable ranges and compared favourably to values reported in literature including rahaman et al 2019 who suggested that r2 values between 0 55 and 0 75 indicate good correlations between grace derived and measured gwsa furthermore moiwo et al 2009 liesch and ohmer 2016 and rahaman et al 2019 reported r2 values ranging from 0 55 to 0 75 for studies in northern china jordan and the california river basin respectively the r2 values of 0 79 and 0 74 achieved in the present study for the primary and secondary aquifers respectively are well above the range reported in literature the pearson s correlation coefficient of grace derived gwsa against measured gwsa reported in many studies across the world strassberg et al 2007 nanteza et al 2016 tangdamrongsub et al 2018 huang et al 2019 neves et al 2020 range from 0 41 to 0 91 the correlation of grace derived gwsa against measured gwsa returned a correlation coefficient of 0 89 and 0 86 for the primary and secondary aquifer respectively which are better than reported elsewhere in the world implying that the grace derived gwsa for the study area is deemed suitably validated similarly the rmse for the primary aquifer 0 035 m and secondary aquifer 0 046 m compare favourably to the rmse values of 0 044 m and 0 042 m reported in nanteza et al 2016 and huang et al 2019 respectively thus the validation results of this study indicate good comparison between the in situ measured gwsa and grace derived gwsa for both the primary and secondary aquifers consequently the grace derived gwsa can be used to understand groundwater storage changes over the study area comparison of the r2 correlation coefficients mae and rmse values for the primary and secondary aquifers indicate that groundwater storage changes in the primary aquifer was relatively better estimated by the grace satellite derived information it is important to note that according to ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 statistical results such as the validation error criteria can be influenced by outliers magnitude and number of data points the discrepancies between grace derived gwsa and observed gwsa reported in this study may be attributed to the uncertainties associated in the determination of both anomalies these anomalies are related to the determination of grace derived twsa gldas derived sma in situ swa and the observed gwsa all grace and grace fo data have errors and uncertainties inherited from the satellite level measurements and processing in particular the grace derived twsa estimates are prone to signal degradation due to measurement errors and noise landerer and swenson 2012 reported that higher measurement errors occurred near the equator and decreased towards the poles in addition the monthly grids have higher errors when the orbit is near exact repeat including the months between july to december 2004 and january and february 2015 furthermore during the latter part of the grace data record several months contain accelerometer measurements from only a single satellite which necessitated a special accelerometer transplant solution but resulted in the degradation of data quality with higher noise for the period between november 2016 to june 2017 cooley and landerer 2019 gldas land surface models lsm have been successfully applied in a number of studies scanlon et al 2012 chen and yuan 2020 hu et al 2021 however uncertainty in the model structure input parameters and forcing data may influence the soil moisture estimates bi et al 2016 lsm use one dimensional water balance formulation to describe soil moisture and evapotranspiration processes in the vertical direction ignoring horizontal processes which are controlled by geomorphology topography and lateral subsurface flow estimates bi et al 2016 in addition the accuracy of the input parameters such as soil properties vegetation types and elevation have a major influence on soil moisture estimates soil properties data directly influences soil moisture estimates gldas uses soil properties data derived from the food and agriculture organization fao where some studies have highlighted uncertainties in the soil properties data in fao may influence the accuracy of gldas soil moisture estimates bi et al 2016 the accuracy of surface water level data is attributed to several factors such as poor calibration of instruments instrument malfunction errors in data storage and inaccurate data patching in addition the accuracy can be affected by severe storm events wind and barometric changes ridolfi and manciola 2018 the uncertainties in the observed gwsa are mainly attributed to the number of groundwater level monitoring boreholes and their spatial distribution and the uncertainties associated with the specific yield information used thus using an increased number of monitoring boreholes that are distributed evenly across the wma and associated improved specific yield values may improve the validation results furthermore the spatial scale of the grace pixels is a major issue where many researchers for example huang et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 indicated that linking the grace estimates to point scale in situ ground observations or to areas smaller than the grace footprint are challenging in addition the discrepancies regarding in situ gwsa may originate from the uncertainty related to the specific yield values used the storativity and or the specific yield data obtained for the primary and secondary aquifers in the wma are limited and are variable the mean specific yield value was 0 04 with a standard deviation of 0 015 for the primary aquifers the secondary aquifer had a mean specific yield value of 0 015 with a standard deviation of 0 0037 the estimation of specific yield is dependent on several factors such as spatial variability depth to water table or delayed drainage dietrich et al 2018 greater accuracy of the specific yield values can be attained through detailed in situ measurements which may improve the comparison between the in situ gwsa and grace derived gwsa 5 2 groundwater storage changes and its drivers in the usuthu mhlatuze wma the grace derived gwsa for the primary and secondary aquifers show an increasing trend for the period from 2002 to early 2014 the primary aquifer storage increased by 0 054 m from the mean and the secondary aquifer storage increased by 0 069 m from the mean a significant decrease in the grace derived gwsa was observed from 2014 to 2020 in which the primary and secondary aquifer storages declined by 0 19 m and 0 17 m from the mean respectively during the entire study period the primary and secondary aquifers experienced a net groundwater storage loss of 9 25 108 m3 and 3 61 109 m3 respectively these groundwater storage depletions identified from the grace data analysis brings about serious water resources and environmental concern especially in the primary aquifer region where several key lakes and wetlands are located many studies conducted in the region indicated that the lakes and the groundwater are closely related due to the nature of the geological formations forming the local aquifers and the flat nature of the terrain meyer et al 2001 kelbe and germishuyse 2010 smithers et al 2017 dws 2020 this is particularly evident in the lake sibayi system where lake levels dropped from approximately 20 m amsl in 2000 to below 14 m amsl in 2020 dws 2020 furthermore recent studies on the maputaland coastal plain of the study area smithers et al 2017 ndlovu and demlie 2018 everson et al 2019 ramjeawon et al 2020 have highlighted that a change in land use groundwater pumping and climate change are attributed to be driving the decline in groundwater storage and consequent reduction in the levels of groundwater dependent lakes and the extent of wetlands thus changes in land use surface water and groundwater pumping increased evaporation and evapotranspiration and rainfall reduction appears to derive the groundwater storage loss highlighted in this study 5 3 impact of land use change on groundwater storage depletion in the usutu mhlatuze wma different land use practices influence groundwater recharge and storage in different ways gwp 2014 in the usutu mhlatuze wma commercial forestry in the coastal plain has been reported to have influenced groundwater resources negatively smithers et al 2017 ndlovu and demlie 2018 everson et al 2019 since groundwater resources in many catchments including in the study area are interconnected with surface water systems changes that occur on the groundwater due to anthropogenic stresses will directly affect the amount of water that would flow to surface waters such as rivers lakes and wetlands lerner and harris 2009 mishra et al 2014 everson et al 2019 investigated the water use of commercial plantations and agroforestry systems in the north eastern region of the study area and reported that eucalyptus trees use more water in a day compared to the indigenous vegetation modelling results from the study indicated that the removal of forest plantations from the vasi area located within the present study area will result in a 2 m increase in the groundwater table additionally smithers et al 2017 indicated that 35 of the total decrease in the level of lake sibayi was a result of forest plantations impacting groundwater storage surrounding the lake furthermore land use and cover change analyses conducted by ramjeawon et al 2020 in the study area reported that between 2001 and 2019 commercial plantations increased at a rate of over 1000 ha yr the present study shows that the grace derived gwsa of the primary aquifer declined by 0 11 during the same period thus an increase in commercial plantations particularly those located in the primary aquifer region is a major concern in the usutu mhlatuze wma similarly between 2001 and 2019 wetlands and surface water bodies along the coastal plain of the study area decreased at rates of approximately 750 ha yr and 150 ha yr respectively ramjeawon et al 2020 since the surface and groundwater system of the primary aquifer region are interconnected any stress on the groundwater systems will impact on surface water bodies and wetlands ramjeawon et al 2020 thus the grace derived groundwater storage depletion reported in this paper is consistent with previous studies and appears to be driven to a considerable extent by land use changes 5 4 impact of climate on groundwater storage change in the usutu mhlatuze wma groundwater is known to fluctuate in response to seasonal and interannual variations in precipitation abdullah and garba 2015 similar trends are observed in this study where the grace derived gws were higher at the end of the rainy summer seasons and lower at the end of the dry winter seasons at a longer temporal scale below average rainfall has been experienced in the study area since 2001 blamey et al 2018 ndlovu and demlie 2020 the mann kendall trend test for precipitation in the usutu mhlatuze wma indicated an increasing trend for the period between 2002 and 2014 with a sen s slope of 6 74 this trend is consistent with grace derived gwsa where the mann kendall trend test indicated an increase during this period and an increase in sen s slope of 0 018 and 0 046 for the primary and secondary aquifers respectively during 2014 and 2020 the mann kendall trend test indicated a decreasing trend for precipitation and grace gwsa the sen s slope during this period was 13 5 0 424 and 0 349 for precipitation and gwsa for the primary and secondary aquifer respectively for the entire study period between 2002 and 2020 the mann kendall trend test indicated a decreasing trend for precipitation and grace gwsa the sen s slope during this period was 10 0 04 and 0 024 for precipitation and gwsa for the primary and secondary aquifer respectively ndlovu and demlie 2018 highlighted the correlation between rainfall and groundwater recharge in the usutu mhlatuze wma and indicated that a decline in rainfall brought about a decline in groundwater levels similarly the significant decrease in the grace derived gws observed between 2014 and 2020 is associated with the impact of the most intense droughts experienced in the southern african region including the usutu mhlatuze wma blamey et al 2018 ndlovu and demlie 2020 the dry conditions in the region which is associated with el nino peaked in 2014 2015 with rainfall records for the interior and eastern part of south africa experiencing its lowest totals since 1950 blamey et al 2018 this period of reduced rainfall might have contributed to the highest grace derived gws reduction similarly recent studies have indicated that the total number of rainy days per annum between 1968 and 2004 has decreased in northern kwazulu natal while the number of consecutive dry days have increased ndlovu and demlie 2020 consequently affecting the amount of recharge reaching the aquifers therefore climate change related rainfall reduction which translates into a reduction in groundwater recharge may be partly responsible for the grace derived groundwater storage depletion in the primary and secondary aquifers of the wma investigated 6 conclusions the lack of representative aquifer storage parameter values such as storativity and specific yield lack of sufficient groundwater monitoring wells and inconsistent and erratic groundwater observation data in the usutu mhlatuze wma prompted the application of the grace satellite product to determine gwsa over a large region and provided the opportunity to understand groundwater storage changes and its drivers the grace satellite data for the usutu mhlatuze wma was successfully processed and analysed to determine the gwsa by removing the sma and swa from the twsa the grace derived gwsa was validated using limited in situ groundwater level data measured from piezometers located in the primary and secondary aquifers the comparison of grace derived gwsa with in situ measured gwsa as part of the validation process was evaluated against various statistical error criteria and the results are satisfactory the long term grace derived gwsa for the period from 2002 to 2020 indicated that the primary and secondary aquifers have been experiencing significant groundwater storage depletions and confirmed previous reports that groundwater storage in the usutu mhlatuze wma has been decreasing the overall grace based net groundwater storage losses for the period between 2002 and 2020 in the primary and secondary aquifers of the wma are 9 25 108 m3 and 3 61 109 m3 respectively this groundwater storage loss is attributed to the combined effects of land use change groundwater abstraction and decrease in precipitation related to regional climatic changes the study further demonstrated that the grace satellite data has the potential to determine groundwater storage changes at the basin scale in areas where groundwater monitoring networks are limited which in turn will assist policy makers and water resources managers in land use planning resource monitoring and licensing authors

7913,study region the usutu mhlatuze water management area located in northern kwazulu natal province south africa study focus recent studies have indicated a steady decline in groundwater levels in the usutu mhlatuze water management area however the absence of representative aquifer storage parameter values including storativity and specific yield lack of sufficient groundwater monitoring wells and inconsistent and erratic groundwater level observation data from existing limited networks make it difficult to understand groundwater storage changes in the region therefore this study analyses groundwater storage change of the primary and secondary aquifers within the usutu mhlatuze water management area using grace satellite derived terrestrial water storage data global land data assimilation system gldas soil moisture data and in situ measured surface water storage information new hydrological insights for the region the grace derived groundwater storage anomalies for the usutu mhlatuze water management area showed good agreement with in situ groundwater storage anomalies observed from the limited groundwater level monitoring piezometers in the primary and secondary aquifers the goodness of fit r2 between the grace derived and the observed groundwater storage changes in the primary and secondary aquifers were 0 79 and 0 74 respectively the grace derived groundwater storage change data for the entire study period between 2002 and 2020 indicated that the primary and secondary aquifers experienced a groundwater storage loss of 925 106 m3 and 3614 106 m3 respectively keywords terrestrial water storage groundwater storage depletion primary and secondary aquifers remote sensing land use and climate changes 1 introduction groundwater is the primary water supply source in africa where according to unesco 2020 up to 75 of the population rely on groundwater for daily use in the south african context approximately 80 of the rural communities depend on groundwater for their water supply igrac 2013 this percentage of groundwater use is much higher in the usutu mhlathuze water management area wma located in north eastern south africa where the provision of reticulated surface water supply schemes are very costly braune 2000 kelbe et al 2016 however groundwater levels in the usutu mhlathuze wma have been reported to be declining ndlovu and demlie 2018 for instance groundwater level monitoring boreholes in the vicinity of the tembe and mbazwana areas located in the north eastern part of the wma experienced a groundwater level decline of 0 7 m and 2 7 m respectively between 2004 and 2015 ndlovu and demlie 2018 additionally areas located in the southern part of the wma including richards bay experienced reductions in groundwater levels ranging from 0 7 m to 6 3 m for the same period ndlovu and demlie 2018 notwithstanding these groundwater level declines quantitative evaluation of the groundwater storage gws change across the entire wma is limited in recent years the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite based product has been widely used to determine groundwater storage changes in many regions rodell et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2010 bhanja et al 2018 tangdamrongsub et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 melati et al 2019 rahaman et al 2019 these studies have highlighted that terrestrial water storage from grace coupled with ancillary data provide invaluable information on groundwater storage changes rodell et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2010 bhanja et al 2018 similarly abiy and melesse 2017 bhanja et al 2018 and zhong et al 2018 have highlighted the potential of grace in monitoring groundwater storage changes at regional scales abiy and melesse 2017 interpreted grace data for the lake tana basin in ethiopia for the period from 2003 to 2013 and reported that soil moisture and groundwater storages declined by 0 18 m bhanja et al 2018 analysed grace satellite data in alberta canada and demonstrated that the rate of groundwater depletion in the athabasca river basin is 0 20 cm yr zhong et al 2018 showed that grace derived groundwater storage for the west liaohe river basin in china declined at a rate of 0 92 0 49 km3 yr from 2005 to 2011 whilst huang et al 2016 and scanlon et al 2012 indicated the challenges of linking grace based groundwater storage change estimates to point scale in situ ground observations or to areas smaller than the grace footprint however in regions where the availability of groundwater monitoring networks are limited and uncertainties in the estimation of aquifer storage coefficients are high analysis of grace data provides an opportunity to determine the spatial and temporal groundwater storage changes for large catchment areas in this regard the usutu mhlathuze wma is a good candidate for the application of grace derived data in studying groundwater storage changes where preliminary analysis of scattered in situ groundwater level measurements showed a decline in groundwater storage across the wma therefore the objective of this study is to validate grace derived groundwater storage changes against in situ measured groundwater storages and evaluate the groundwater storage gws changes in the wma the application of grace derived data analysis in the wma under consideration will be the first of its kind in south african catchments as such the results of this study will aid in validating more regional scale studies furthermore understanding the spatial and temporal changes in the gws in the wma will inform policy for sustainable water resources management in an ecologically important and environmentally sensitive region 2 description of study area 2 1 location and climate the study area covers the entire usutu mhlatuze wma located in northern kwazulu natal and southern parts of mpumalanga provinces in south arica fig 1 the basin is transboundary with a small part of the drainage basin extending into the republic of mozambique and the kingdom of swaziland now eswatini these transboundary portions are not considered in this study the usutu mhlatuze wma is approximately 270 km wide and 350 km in length covering an area of about 41 240 km2 the wma has a population of approximately 2 5 million people where the north eastern region of the wma is described as one of the most underdeveloped areas in south africa statistics sa 2016 the landcover of the study area is diverse and comprises of barren land built up areas cultivated land forested land grasslands mines shrubland waterbodies and wetlands fig 2c commercial and subsistence farming is a primary source of income for many and is distributed throughout the study area with a high concentration of irrigated and rainfed sugarcane found in the south a high concentration of commercial plantations is prevalent in the north western region and can be found distributed along the coastal plain fig 2c the wma can be described as having a subtropical climate and receives summer rainfall between october and march the rainfall is temporally and spatially variable ranging from 1682 mm yr along the southern coastal area to 487 mm yr in the central interior fig 2a the mean daily temperatures for the wma vary from 21 0 c to 32 1 c in summer and from 10 9 c to 26 4 c in winter saws 2018 the mean potential evaporation is approximately 1458 mm yr dws 2018 2 2 topography and drainage the highest elevation in the wma is approximately 2200 m above mean sea level amsl in the western region of the area fig 2b from where the elevation drops to sea level along the coast the topography in the north eastern part of the study area is relatively flat the main rivers that drain the wma are the usutu pongola mkuze mfolozi and mhlathuze rivers which all flow in a general eastward direction fig 2b the usutu river flows from the north western part of the wma into swaziland the pongola river flows from the western boundary of the wma into pongolapoort dam and flows towards mozambique and joins the usutu river to form the maputo river where it discharges into maputo bay in mozambique dennis and dennis 2009 kelbe and germishuyse 2010 the mkuze river drains into the indian ocean via lake st lucia while the mfolozi and mhlathuze rivers discharge directly into the indian ocean the north eastern sector of the wma has no significant rivers but consists of key surface water bodies including lake sibayi and the lake kosi bay system which are predominately groundwater driven kelbe and germishuyse 2010 ndlovu and demlie 2016 2 3 hydrogeological setting groundwater in the wma occurs in primary intergranular and secondary fractured and weathered aquifers the main primary aquifer is the largest primary aquifer in south africa and occurs in the extensive maputaland coastal plain located along the indian ocean coast fig 2d kelbe et al 2001 weitz and demlie 2014 ndlovu and demlie 2016 2018 these primary aquifers are made up of the miocene to holocene age maputaland group rocks including from oldest to youngest the uloa port dunford kosi bay kwambonambi and sibayi formations these aquifers are characterized by similar mean hydraulic conductivities of 4 5 4 3 4 3 5 and 8 6 m day respectively worthington 1978 meyer and godfrey 1995 the basal uloa formation is known to be the highest yielding aquifer within the maputaland sediments meyer et al 2001 weitz and demlie 2015 table 1 provides a summary of the hydraulic properties for the primary aquifers the secondary weathered and fractured aquifers cover a wide area in the interior and western part of the wma fig 2d these weathered and fractured rock aquifers are made up of a complex group of rocks spanning in age from swazian basement rocks of the kaapvaal craton to the cretaceous zululand group rocks mccarthy and rubidge 2005 the weathered and fractured aquifers are made up of the pongola supergroup rocks the empangeni metamorphic suite rocks of the natal metamorphic province the karoo supergroup and the zululand group rocks these weathered and fractured aquifers are characterised by variable aquifer hydraulic characteristics table 2 and consequently variable groundwater potential the fractured aquifers consist mainly of the natal group sandstones and to a lesser extent the dwyka group rocks where the former is reported to have high groundwater potential due to extensive fracturing and faulting demlie and titus 2015 the estimated groundwater recharge rate for the coastal region ranges from 50 to 100 mm a while the central inland area experiences an estimated groundwater recharge rate of between 10 and 25 mm a dws 2006 surface water groundwater interactions in the eastern part of the wma along the maputaland coastal plain means that the surface water systems are dependent on groundwater to varying degrees kelbe and germishuyse 2010 weitz and demlie 2014 ndlovu and demlie 2016 several streams lakes and wetlands located along the coastal plain are predominantly groundwater dependent kelbe and germishuyse 2010 barath 2015 3 data and methodology groundwater storage anomalies gwsa for the usutu mhlatuze wma were determined using grace derived terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa soil moisture anomalies sma derived from gldas and measured surface water anomalies swa the gwsa was then validated using in situ measured groundwater level data at a number of observation boreholes located across the primary and secondary aquifer regions of the wma 3 1 grace derived terrestrial water storage anomaly the grace mission was launched in march 2002 and operated until october 2017 nasa 2012 cooley and landerer 2019 during its 15 year operation grace provided valuable earth observation data which contributed to the understanding of ocean mass distribution changes in polar ice soil moisture surface water and ground water storage at large scales rodell et al 2007 nasa 2012 cooley and landerer 2019 subsequently the gravity recovery and climate experiment follow on grace fo mission was launched in may 2018 grace consists of two satellites which follow each other around the earth with a distance of 220 km between them where the earth s gravitational force affects the lead satellite a small change in distance between the two satellites occurs rodell et al 2007 nasa 2012 cooley and landerer 2019 the satellites microwave ranging system can detect minute changes in the distance between the satellites an accelerometer located on each satellite and a global positioning systems gps determine the non gravitational acceleration and the exact positions of the satellites above the earth s surface respectively nasa 2012 cooley and landerer 2019 this information is used to construct monthly maps of the earth s average gravity field which provides details of how mass mostly water is moving on earth nasa 2012 cooley and landerer 2019 in this study the grace jet propulsion laboratory jpl rl06 mass concentration mascon dataset was used to obtain twsa for the period from april 2002 to february 2020 the jpl rl06 mascon was used in this study as it uses a priori constraints in time and space to minimise measurement errors wiese et al 2019 the data is available at a monthly temporal resolution with a grid size of 0 5 degrees each monthly grace tellus grid represents the surface mass deviation for that month relative to a baseline temporal average wiese et al 2019 the baseline temporal average is the average between 2004 and 2009 this baseline temporal average is subtracted from all other monthly grids to provide terrestrial water storage anomalies wiese et al 2019 the rl06 mascon uses a newly defined grid which split tiles along the coastline to minimize the leakage between land and ocean signals wiese et al 2019 since the current study area is located along the coast the dataset which includes the coastal resolution improvement cri filter was used to correct the signal leakage along the coastlines in accordance with wiese et al 2019 furthermore a gain factor which is used to enhance the spatial resolution was applied to the dataset as recommended for hydrological studies swenson and wahr 2007 landerer et al 2010 wiese et al 2019 notable gaps are present in the grace dataset related to the active battery management which began in 2011 due to the aging batteries of the grace satellites these gaps occur approximately every 5 6 months and last for 4 5 weeks cooley and landerer 2019 a further gap in the dataset corresponds to the time period between the decommissioning of grace october 2017 and launch of grace fo may 2018 these time periods which contained gaps were treated as missing data which was not infilled 3 2 global land data assimilation system gldas derived soil moisture data monthly soil moisture data was obtained from gldas gldas is a joint program between the national aeronautics space administration nasa and the national centre for environmental prediction and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa rahaman et al 2019 gldas produces hydrologic components by integrating satellite based and in situ observations rahaman et al 2019 the gldas monthly soil moisture data from the noah lsm with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees was used in this study the monthly soil moisture data with an average depth of 10 cm was produced using the gldas 2 1 noah 3 hourly lsm data simulated in the noah 3 6 land information system beaudoing et al 2020 3 3 surface water level data monthly surface water level data for the period between 2002 and 2020 was obtained for the three main lakes and nine dams located within the study area from the south african department of water and sanitation dws the location of the dams and lakes within the wma are shown in fig 1 3 4 in situ observed groundwater level data groundwater level data measured from monitoring boreholes located within and around the usutu mhlatuze wma was obtained from dws the location of the monitoring boreholes are indicated in fig 1 these boreholes were selected based on the length and quality of the data record since groundwater storage changes in primary and secondary aquifers are different due to variation in their hydrogeological characteristics the groundwater storage changes in the water management area are analysed by grouping the primary and secondary aquifers separately these primary and secondary aquifers have an approximate area of 6 520 km2 and 34 290 km2 respectively reliable groundwater level data within the usutu mhlatuze wma was obtained from nine monitoring boreholes located in the primary aquifers and only one monitoring borehole in the secondary aquifer as a result five additional boreholes located in the immediate vicinity of the usutu mhlatuze wma that monitor similar secondary aquifers were used to compliment the limited data relatively continuous groundwater level data was found for the period between 2010 and 2016 and as such the measured groundwater level data was pre processed and used to validate the grace derived gwsa for this period the groundwater level data collected from each monitoring well was adjusted for variability of measurement reference surfaces by subtracting the collar height of each monitoring borehole from the measured depth to groundwater the in situ gwsa was determined using eq 1 bhanja et al 2018 1 gwsa hm hi s where hm is the mean depth to groundwater level for the measurement period hi is the groundwater level depth at time period i and sy is the storativity or specific yield of the respective aquifers most of the storativity and or the specific yield data for the primary and secondary aquifers were obtained from the kwazulu natal groundwater characterization and mapping project undertaken by martinelli and associates 1994 groundwater development services 1995 martinelli and associates 1994 and vsa earth science consultants 1995 the storativity and or the specific yield data obtained for the various primary and secondary aquifers in the wma are limited and are highly variable the mean storativity values of 0 04 and 0 015 for the primary and secondary aquifers respectively are used in this study which are obtained from the mean values reported in martinelli and associates 1994 groundwater development services 1995 vsa earth science consultants 1995 meyer and godfrey 2003 barath 2015 and weitz and demlie 2015 a standard deviation of the mean in situ gwsa for the primary aquifer was calculated based on the groundwater level data from the nine boreholes and the mean in situ gwsa for the secondary aquifer were determined based on the groundwater level data from the six monitoring boreholes 3 5 determination of grace derived groundwater storage anomalies grace provides total terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa therefore to derive the gwsa the soil moisture and surface water data anomalies have to be determined the anomalies are determined using the mean for the period between january 2004 and december 2009 cooley and landerer 2019 the anomalies are calculated by subtracting the mean from all monthly observations of the respective data cooley and landerer 2019 eventually the gwsa is determined by removing the sma and swa from the grace derived twsa using eq 2 and based on the datasets summarised in table 3 2 gwsa twsa sma swa 3 6 trend analysis the nonparametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 has been widely used in the field of water resources and climatic studies for trend detection patle et al 2015 pathak and dodamani 2019 ndlovu and demlie 2020 the mann kendall trend test was used to identify trends of the twsa sma and gwsa data in the study area at a 95 confidence level the purpose of the mann kendall test is to determine whether an upward or downward trend is present in a time series in the mann kendall test the null hypothesis ho is tested against the alternative hypothesis h1 where ho indicates that there is no trend and h1 indicates the presence of a trend the mann kendall statistic s is defined using eq 3 as mann 1945 kendall 1975 3 s n 1 i 1 n j i 1 sgn x j x i where n is the length of the sample xi is a time series ranked from i 1 2 n 1 and xj is ranked from j i 1 2 n sgn is the signum function defined in eq 4 4 sgn x j x i 1 if sgn x j x i 0 0 if sgn x j x i 0 1 if sgn x j x i 0 a positive s value indicates an increasing trend and a negative s value indicates a decreasing trend the mean of s is 0 and the variance of s can be acquired using eq 5 5 var s n n 1 2 n 5 σ t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where ti is the number of ties present with i as extent the standardized statistic z indicates whether a variable has an increasing decreasing or no trend and defined using eq 6 6 z s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 where z 0 indicates an increasing trend and z 0 indicates a decreasing trend the sen s slope estimator test is a simple non parametric procedure used to determine the true slope and magnitude of time series data sen 1968 this method is very robust against outliers and applied in this study the sen s slope estimator q is defined using eq 7 7 q x j x k j k for i 1 2 n where xj and xk are data values at times j and k j k respectively a positive q value indicates an increasing trend and a negative q value indicates a decreasing trend in addition trend images were extracted by fitting a time series at each grid point using a linear trend ahmed et al 2014 3 7 validation of grace derived groundwater storage anomalies models used to understand processes in hydrological and other environmental sciences must be evaluated to assess their performance model performance is evaluated by comparing the calculated data to the corresponding measured data and it is suggested that several statistical error criteria be used ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 in this study the grace gwsa data is compared against the in situ gwsa data using standard regression and error indices standard regression statistics coefficient of determination and pearson s correlation coefficient determine the strength of the linear relationship between modelled and measured data and error indices mean absolute error and root mean square error quantify the deviation of the modelled data from the measured data legates and mccabe 1999 the coefficient of determination r2 also known as the goodness of fit is a statistical measure in a regression model and determines the proportion of variance the values of r2 greater than 0 7 are regarded as good statistics 2021 pearson s correlation coefficient r values range from 1 to 1 the r values between 0 50 and 1 are said to be within acceptable range with higher values of the range preferable statistics 2021 although there is no absolute threshold mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse close to zero are regarded as excellent ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the r2 r mae and rmse was used to evaluate the validation of the grace derived gwsa 4 results 4 1 surface water storage anomalies the surface water anomalies were derived for the period from 2002 to 2020 based on data analysed from the three lakes and nine reservoirs of the usutu mhlatuze wma fig 3 the swa for some of the surface water bodies remained relatively constant throughout the study period expect for lake sibayi bivane dam heyshope dam geodertrouw dam morgenstond dam pongolapoort dam and klipfontein dam where a decrease in storage occurred between 2014 and 2020 the geodertrouw dam experienced the greatest reduction in storage from the mean swa 0 0089 m followed by lake sibayi swa 0 0057 m pongolapoort dam swa 0 0032 m klipfontein dam swa 0 003 m morgenstond dam swa 0 0014 m heyshope dam swa 0 0006 m and bivane dam swa 0 00055 m which occurred between 2016 and 2020 4 2 precipitation data between 2002 and 2020 precipitation data obtained from the makatini research centre for the period between 2002 and 2020 is presented in fig 5 the mann kendall trend test for precipitation in the usutu mhlatuze wma indicated an increasing trend for the period between 2002 and 2014 with a sen s slope of 6 74 while between 2014 and 2020 precipitation showed a decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 13 5 the mann kendall trend test for precipitation for the entire study period i e between 2002 and 2020 indicates an overall decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 10 table 4 provides a summary of the statistical analysis results of the mann kendall trend test and sens s slope for precipitation 4 3 terrestrial water storage anomalies derived from grace and its trend the results of the twsa trend map and time series data for the usutu mhlatuze wma derived from the grace satellite data for the period between april 2002 and february 2020 is presented in figs 4a and 5a respectively the twsa for the primary and secondary aquifers were similar through the study period it is observed that twsa decreased over time for both aquifers the highest and lowest twsa values were 0 098 m and 0 12 m recorded in 2013 and 2019 respectively the mann kendall trend test of the twsa in the usutu mhlatuze wma indicated an increasing trend for the period between 2002 and 2016 with a sen s slope of 0 047 while between 2016 and 2020 the twsa showed a decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 0 187 the mann kendall trend test of the twsa for the entire study period i e between 2002 and 2020 indicates an overall decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 0 001 the standard deviated was 5 8 and was used to determine the upper and lower error band fig 5a table 4 provides a summary of the statistical analysis results of the mann kendall trend test and sens s slope for the twsa 4 4 soil moisture anomalies sma derived from gldas the sma were derived from gldas data for the period between 2002 and 2020 the sma trend map and time series data for the sma is depicted in figs 4b and 5b respectively spatially the secondary aquifer had higher sma than the primary aquifer throughout the study period from 2002 2014 the mann kendall trend test indicated that there was an increasing trend with a sen s slope of 0 001 for this period the highest sma was 0 0084 m and the lowest was 0 008 m from 2014 2020 lower sma values were observed the mann kendall trend test for this latest period indicated a decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 0 001 the maximum and minimum sma values of 0 0048 m and 0 0094 m respectively were noted in 2014 and 2019 the overall sma trend for the entire study period between 2002 and 2020 is decreasing with a sen s slope of 0 001 the standard deviated was 0 43 and was used to determine the upper and lower error band fig 5b table 4 provides a summary of the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope for sma 4 5 grace derived groundwater storage anomalies and its validation the trend map of the grace derived gwsa is depicted in fig 4c the overall trend indicated that gwsa decreased over time for the primary and secondary aquifers the monthly grace derived groundwater storage anomalies for the primary and secondary aquifers were compared against monthly in situ observed groundwater storage anomalies fig 5c and d the period between 2010 and 2016 was used for the validation exercise as it contained a relatively continuous measured groundwater level data the r2 r mae and rmse are used to evaluate the validation the grace derived gwsa data and the measured gwsa data follow a very similar trend with r2 and r for the primary and secondary aquifers fall within acceptable ranges table 5 the r2 values between the grace derived and measured gwsa for the primary and secondary aquifers are 0 79 and 0 74 respectively the r values between grace derived and measured groundwater storage anomalies for the primary and secondary aquifers are 0 89 and 0 86 respectively the mae and the rmse values for the primary aquifer are 0 041 m and 0 035 m respectively while for the secondary aquifer are 0 025 m and 0 046 m respectively the calculated mae and rmse values for both aquifers are within acceptable limits the standard deviation for the in situ gwsa was determined to be 2 29 and 0 92 for the primary and secondary aquifer respectively and was used to determine the upper and lower error band fig 5c and d the standard deviation for the grace derived gwsa was determined to be 4 8 and 4 1 for the primary and secondary aquifer respectively and was used to determine the upper and lower error band fig 5c and d the statistical validation error criteria values of the grace derived gwsa are presented in table 5 4 6 results of long term grace derived groundwater storage change for the study area and its trends the grace based gwsa information derived for the primary and secondary aquifers of the study area for the period between 2002 and 2020 is presented in fig 6 the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope was used to identify trends and its magnitude in the grace derived gwsa the mann kendall trend test indicated an increasing trend in gwsa from 2002 to early 2014 for both aquifers during this period the sen s slope for the primary and secondary aquifers were 0 018 and 0 046 respectively both aquifers recorded the highest gwsa in march 2014 following this period a drastic decrease in gwsa is experienced for both aquifers up until 2020 where the sen s slope for the primary and secondary aquifers were 0 424 and 0 349 respectively the greatest decrease in gwsa occurred in november 2019 where the primary and secondary aquifers decreased by about 0 15 m and 0 13 m respectively table 6 provides a summary of the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope for the gwsa in the study area the mann kendall trend test revealed an overall decrease in the gwsa for the entire study period with sen s slope of 0 04 and 0 024 for the primary and secondary aquifers respectively during this period the primary and secondary aquifers experienced a groundwater storage loss of 925 106 m3 and 3614 106 m3 respectively 5 discussion the grace twsa gldas soil moisture anomaly and in situ observed surface water anomaly data were used to produce grace derived gwsa for the primary and secondary aquifers for the usutu mhlatuze wma the mann kendall trend test analyses for the twsa and sma indicated increasing trends between 2002 and 2014 with sen s slope of 0 47 and 0 001 respectively from 2014 2020 the twsa and sma showed decreasing trend with a sen s slope of 0 187 and 0 001 respectively during this latest period seven of the twelve surface water reservoirs lakes and dams in the study area experienced storage reduction 5 1 validation of the grace derived groundwater storage anomaly the grace derived gwsa for the period from 2010 to 2016 is validated against in situ measured gwsa for the same period the validation error criteria values for both the primary and secondary aquifers are within acceptable ranges and compared favourably to values reported in literature including rahaman et al 2019 who suggested that r2 values between 0 55 and 0 75 indicate good correlations between grace derived and measured gwsa furthermore moiwo et al 2009 liesch and ohmer 2016 and rahaman et al 2019 reported r2 values ranging from 0 55 to 0 75 for studies in northern china jordan and the california river basin respectively the r2 values of 0 79 and 0 74 achieved in the present study for the primary and secondary aquifers respectively are well above the range reported in literature the pearson s correlation coefficient of grace derived gwsa against measured gwsa reported in many studies across the world strassberg et al 2007 nanteza et al 2016 tangdamrongsub et al 2018 huang et al 2019 neves et al 2020 range from 0 41 to 0 91 the correlation of grace derived gwsa against measured gwsa returned a correlation coefficient of 0 89 and 0 86 for the primary and secondary aquifer respectively which are better than reported elsewhere in the world implying that the grace derived gwsa for the study area is deemed suitably validated similarly the rmse for the primary aquifer 0 035 m and secondary aquifer 0 046 m compare favourably to the rmse values of 0 044 m and 0 042 m reported in nanteza et al 2016 and huang et al 2019 respectively thus the validation results of this study indicate good comparison between the in situ measured gwsa and grace derived gwsa for both the primary and secondary aquifers consequently the grace derived gwsa can be used to understand groundwater storage changes over the study area comparison of the r2 correlation coefficients mae and rmse values for the primary and secondary aquifers indicate that groundwater storage changes in the primary aquifer was relatively better estimated by the grace satellite derived information it is important to note that according to ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 statistical results such as the validation error criteria can be influenced by outliers magnitude and number of data points the discrepancies between grace derived gwsa and observed gwsa reported in this study may be attributed to the uncertainties associated in the determination of both anomalies these anomalies are related to the determination of grace derived twsa gldas derived sma in situ swa and the observed gwsa all grace and grace fo data have errors and uncertainties inherited from the satellite level measurements and processing in particular the grace derived twsa estimates are prone to signal degradation due to measurement errors and noise landerer and swenson 2012 reported that higher measurement errors occurred near the equator and decreased towards the poles in addition the monthly grids have higher errors when the orbit is near exact repeat including the months between july to december 2004 and january and february 2015 furthermore during the latter part of the grace data record several months contain accelerometer measurements from only a single satellite which necessitated a special accelerometer transplant solution but resulted in the degradation of data quality with higher noise for the period between november 2016 to june 2017 cooley and landerer 2019 gldas land surface models lsm have been successfully applied in a number of studies scanlon et al 2012 chen and yuan 2020 hu et al 2021 however uncertainty in the model structure input parameters and forcing data may influence the soil moisture estimates bi et al 2016 lsm use one dimensional water balance formulation to describe soil moisture and evapotranspiration processes in the vertical direction ignoring horizontal processes which are controlled by geomorphology topography and lateral subsurface flow estimates bi et al 2016 in addition the accuracy of the input parameters such as soil properties vegetation types and elevation have a major influence on soil moisture estimates soil properties data directly influences soil moisture estimates gldas uses soil properties data derived from the food and agriculture organization fao where some studies have highlighted uncertainties in the soil properties data in fao may influence the accuracy of gldas soil moisture estimates bi et al 2016 the accuracy of surface water level data is attributed to several factors such as poor calibration of instruments instrument malfunction errors in data storage and inaccurate data patching in addition the accuracy can be affected by severe storm events wind and barometric changes ridolfi and manciola 2018 the uncertainties in the observed gwsa are mainly attributed to the number of groundwater level monitoring boreholes and their spatial distribution and the uncertainties associated with the specific yield information used thus using an increased number of monitoring boreholes that are distributed evenly across the wma and associated improved specific yield values may improve the validation results furthermore the spatial scale of the grace pixels is a major issue where many researchers for example huang et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 indicated that linking the grace estimates to point scale in situ ground observations or to areas smaller than the grace footprint are challenging in addition the discrepancies regarding in situ gwsa may originate from the uncertainty related to the specific yield values used the storativity and or the specific yield data obtained for the primary and secondary aquifers in the wma are limited and are variable the mean specific yield value was 0 04 with a standard deviation of 0 015 for the primary aquifers the secondary aquifer had a mean specific yield value of 0 015 with a standard deviation of 0 0037 the estimation of specific yield is dependent on several factors such as spatial variability depth to water table or delayed drainage dietrich et al 2018 greater accuracy of the specific yield values can be attained through detailed in situ measurements which may improve the comparison between the in situ gwsa and grace derived gwsa 5 2 groundwater storage changes and its drivers in the usuthu mhlatuze wma the grace derived gwsa for the primary and secondary aquifers show an increasing trend for the period from 2002 to early 2014 the primary aquifer storage increased by 0 054 m from the mean and the secondary aquifer storage increased by 0 069 m from the mean a significant decrease in the grace derived gwsa was observed from 2014 to 2020 in which the primary and secondary aquifer storages declined by 0 19 m and 0 17 m from the mean respectively during the entire study period the primary and secondary aquifers experienced a net groundwater storage loss of 9 25 108 m3 and 3 61 109 m3 respectively these groundwater storage depletions identified from the grace data analysis brings about serious water resources and environmental concern especially in the primary aquifer region where several key lakes and wetlands are located many studies conducted in the region indicated that the lakes and the groundwater are closely related due to the nature of the geological formations forming the local aquifers and the flat nature of the terrain meyer et al 2001 kelbe and germishuyse 2010 smithers et al 2017 dws 2020 this is particularly evident in the lake sibayi system where lake levels dropped from approximately 20 m amsl in 2000 to below 14 m amsl in 2020 dws 2020 furthermore recent studies on the maputaland coastal plain of the study area smithers et al 2017 ndlovu and demlie 2018 everson et al 2019 ramjeawon et al 2020 have highlighted that a change in land use groundwater pumping and climate change are attributed to be driving the decline in groundwater storage and consequent reduction in the levels of groundwater dependent lakes and the extent of wetlands thus changes in land use surface water and groundwater pumping increased evaporation and evapotranspiration and rainfall reduction appears to derive the groundwater storage loss highlighted in this study 5 3 impact of land use change on groundwater storage depletion in the usutu mhlatuze wma different land use practices influence groundwater recharge and storage in different ways gwp 2014 in the usutu mhlatuze wma commercial forestry in the coastal plain has been reported to have influenced groundwater resources negatively smithers et al 2017 ndlovu and demlie 2018 everson et al 2019 since groundwater resources in many catchments including in the study area are interconnected with surface water systems changes that occur on the groundwater due to anthropogenic stresses will directly affect the amount of water that would flow to surface waters such as rivers lakes and wetlands lerner and harris 2009 mishra et al 2014 everson et al 2019 investigated the water use of commercial plantations and agroforestry systems in the north eastern region of the study area and reported that eucalyptus trees use more water in a day compared to the indigenous vegetation modelling results from the study indicated that the removal of forest plantations from the vasi area located within the present study area will result in a 2 m increase in the groundwater table additionally smithers et al 2017 indicated that 35 of the total decrease in the level of lake sibayi was a result of forest plantations impacting groundwater storage surrounding the lake furthermore land use and cover change analyses conducted by ramjeawon et al 2020 in the study area reported that between 2001 and 2019 commercial plantations increased at a rate of over 1000 ha yr the present study shows that the grace derived gwsa of the primary aquifer declined by 0 11 during the same period thus an increase in commercial plantations particularly those located in the primary aquifer region is a major concern in the usutu mhlatuze wma similarly between 2001 and 2019 wetlands and surface water bodies along the coastal plain of the study area decreased at rates of approximately 750 ha yr and 150 ha yr respectively ramjeawon et al 2020 since the surface and groundwater system of the primary aquifer region are interconnected any stress on the groundwater systems will impact on surface water bodies and wetlands ramjeawon et al 2020 thus the grace derived groundwater storage depletion reported in this paper is consistent with previous studies and appears to be driven to a considerable extent by land use changes 5 4 impact of climate on groundwater storage change in the usutu mhlatuze wma groundwater is known to fluctuate in response to seasonal and interannual variations in precipitation abdullah and garba 2015 similar trends are observed in this study where the grace derived gws were higher at the end of the rainy summer seasons and lower at the end of the dry winter seasons at a longer temporal scale below average rainfall has been experienced in the study area since 2001 blamey et al 2018 ndlovu and demlie 2020 the mann kendall trend test for precipitation in the usutu mhlatuze wma indicated an increasing trend for the period between 2002 and 2014 with a sen s slope of 6 74 this trend is consistent with grace derived gwsa where the mann kendall trend test indicated an increase during this period and an increase in sen s slope of 0 018 and 0 046 for the primary and secondary aquifers respectively during 2014 and 2020 the mann kendall trend test indicated a decreasing trend for precipitation and grace gwsa the sen s slope during this period was 13 5 0 424 and 0 349 for precipitation and gwsa for the primary and secondary aquifer respectively for the entire study period between 2002 and 2020 the mann kendall trend test indicated a decreasing trend for precipitation and grace gwsa the sen s slope during this period was 10 0 04 and 0 024 for precipitation and gwsa for the primary and secondary aquifer respectively ndlovu and demlie 2018 highlighted the correlation between rainfall and groundwater recharge in the usutu mhlatuze wma and indicated that a decline in rainfall brought about a decline in groundwater levels similarly the significant decrease in the grace derived gws observed between 2014 and 2020 is associated with the impact of the most intense droughts experienced in the southern african region including the usutu mhlatuze wma blamey et al 2018 ndlovu and demlie 2020 the dry conditions in the region which is associated with el nino peaked in 2014 2015 with rainfall records for the interior and eastern part of south africa experiencing its lowest totals since 1950 blamey et al 2018 this period of reduced rainfall might have contributed to the highest grace derived gws reduction similarly recent studies have indicated that the total number of rainy days per annum between 1968 and 2004 has decreased in northern kwazulu natal while the number of consecutive dry days have increased ndlovu and demlie 2020 consequently affecting the amount of recharge reaching the aquifers therefore climate change related rainfall reduction which translates into a reduction in groundwater recharge may be partly responsible for the grace derived groundwater storage depletion in the primary and secondary aquifers of the wma investigated 6 conclusions the lack of representative aquifer storage parameter values such as storativity and specific yield lack of sufficient groundwater monitoring wells and inconsistent and erratic groundwater observation data in the usutu mhlatuze wma prompted the application of the grace satellite product to determine gwsa over a large region and provided the opportunity to understand groundwater storage changes and its drivers the grace satellite data for the usutu mhlatuze wma was successfully processed and analysed to determine the gwsa by removing the sma and swa from the twsa the grace derived gwsa was validated using limited in situ groundwater level data measured from piezometers located in the primary and secondary aquifers the comparison of grace derived gwsa with in situ measured gwsa as part of the validation process was evaluated against various statistical error criteria and the results are satisfactory the long term grace derived gwsa for the period from 2002 to 2020 indicated that the primary and secondary aquifers have been experiencing significant groundwater storage depletions and confirmed previous reports that groundwater storage in the usutu mhlatuze wma has been decreasing the overall grace based net groundwater storage losses for the period between 2002 and 2020 in the primary and secondary aquifers of the wma are 9 25 108 m3 and 3 61 109 m3 respectively this groundwater storage loss is attributed to the combined effects of land use change groundwater abstraction and decrease in precipitation related to regional climatic changes the study further demonstrated that the grace satellite data has the potential to determine groundwater storage changes at the basin scale in areas where groundwater monitoring networks are limited which in turn will assist policy makers and water resources managers in land use planning resource monitoring and licensing authors

7914,study region chao phraya river basin cprb the predominant basin located in thailand study focus this study aims to ascertain the difference between spatial bias heterogeneity of streamflow in large river basins such as cprb for a robust analysis the upstream major dams and the outlet of the basin were examined with two step bias correction and compared with a more practical bias correction only at the outlet of the basin the former clarified that due to the large effect of downstream bias the upstream bias effect was considered negligible thus the two approaches resulted in similar future projections in the cprb through this comparison streamflow bias in the past and future climate experiments was corrected considering its spatial characteristics for robust assessments of quantitative impacts of climate change new hydrological insights for the region a 4 k warmer climate will increase the frequency of the 2011 flood in cprb and enhance 100 year flood peak discharge by 1 1 1 6 times than the past climate 1961 2010 the future flood in the basin which starts predominantly in september in the present climate is likely to begin in september and august equally with a prolonged duration of floods around 10 50 days the study region is likely expected to experience elevated flood volume earlier flood occurrence and longer flood duration which indicates that forthcoming floods will be more rigorous graphical abstract ga1 keywords d4pdf bias correction 1k frm climate change floods chao phraya river basin 1 introduction the chao phraya river basin cprb is the principal river basin occupying 30 of thailand s geographical extent and inhabiting 40 of the country s total population it has been endowing livelihood employment opportunities and developing country s agronomics contributing to 66 of gross domestic product abhishek et al 2021 gunawardana et al 2021 this basin has been under continuous ramifications of floods droughts land subsidence urbanization increase in population etc especially affecting the lower delta region hogendoorn et al 2018 loc et al 2020 park et al 2021 over 3000 dams have been built in the cprb since 1950 to store monsoon rains and increase agricultural potential during the dry season bhumibol and sirikit dams are the two substantially large dams controlling 22 of the runoff from the total basin territory bond et al 2018 various episodic hydro meteorological events have hit the cprb in the past couple of decades such as floods in 2006 2011 and 2021 droughts in 2015 2016 and 2019 2020 affecting millions of people and causing a large economic damage loc et al 2020 abhishek et al 2021 as a result for cprb sustainability knowing the influence of climate change and its effect on future extreme events is a prerequisite innumerous studies have been carried out on climate change impact assessments on river discharge and water availability li et al 2016 hughes and farinosi 2020 budhathoki et al 2021 casale et al 2021 jahandideh tehrani et al 2021 environmental ecological and socio economic sectors such as agriculture industry hydropower and biodiversity protection rely on the ability to estimate water availability under varying climatic circumstances and hydrological changes both in the near and far future li et al 2016 didovets et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wannasin et al 2021 according to regional impact assessments in thailand the country will experience a change in high intensity rainfall falling between 5 in the dry season to raising to 36 5 in the wet season annually champathong et al 2013 chaowiwat et al 2019 studies with several general circulation models gcm show that average annual discharge as well as maximum annual flows will surge up between 6 8 and 38 4 with rising rainfall in the cprb towards to end of the 21st century kure and tebakari 2012 hunukumbura and tachikawa 2012 ligaray et al 2015 despite reduced uncertainty in climate change projections at the global scale owing to compiled evidence ar6 catchment scale future change projections are still varied which is possibly due to high uncertainty associated with the large impact of internal climate variability on extreme precipitation that cannot be captured with limited ensembles peel et al 2015 therefore previous works on climate change impact assessments on floods in thailand are limited to overall tendencies such as mean or variance and hard to give a robust estimate of frequency changes in extreme with a limited sample size such as the 2011 flood event to overcome this issue huge ensembles covering the internal climate variability as much as possible are required for the impact assessments of extreme floods the database for 4 policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf has therefore been developed mizuta et al 2017 with tens 50 100 of ensembles for 60 year simulation in the non global warming past 1951 2010 and future climates for 1 5 k 2 k and 4 k degree increase in global mean temperature the d4pdf has been employed in a variety of climate change impact studies looking into river discharge floods tropical cyclones storm surges etc lavender et al 2018 mori et al 2019 tanaka et al 2020 ninomiya et al 2021 therefore d4pdf has the potential of detecting future changes in extreme flood characteristics the d4pdf however still contains the model bias even after achieving such huge ensemble simulations tanaka et al 2019 watanabe et al 2020 and hence a prominent approach for addressing biases in gcm outputs is the quantile quantile mapping qqm bias correction technique is used for enhancing the accuracy of climate forecasts and hydrological simulations piani et al 2010 tong et al 2018 in this method the gcm data of a grid cell is adjusted using the qqm which links observation climate data from the same or surrounding grid cells and has been found to be very efficient at eliminating biases from climate model outputs while keeping shifts in climate frequency and variance ines and hansen 2006 elshamy et al 2009 many streamflow impact assessments lag the correlation structure in their bias that needs to be considered maraun 2016 this issue would be critical in the cprb where approximately 80 of precipitation is consumed by evapotranspiration i e runoff is considered a residual in terms of the water cycle wichakul et al 2014 zhao et al 2022 therefore as an alternative bias correction to gcm runoff data has been lately called to attention to reduce the uncertainty and results show improved river discharge calculations ibarra et al 2021 in particular in thailand or the indochina peninsula duong et al 2013 ram indra et al 2020a however it is still challenging due to the necessity of preparing reference runoff data that requires precise land surface simulations a more direct approach streamflow bias correction is considered in a few studies farmer et al 2018 possibly due to the combination of small observation simulation sample size runoff bias heterogeneity and human intervention such as dam control and or irrigation due to the long record of streamflow observations and large ensemble climate simulations such as d4pdf the sample size issue can be addressed nevertheless the later factors need regional scale analysis of bias structure in the selected river basin after the spatial bias structure is clarified with rigorous discussions streamflow bias correction could be adopted as a strategy although such a basin specific approach is hard to apply uniformly to the entire globe is crucial to compile regional studies for a comprehensive understanding as a whole this study aims to discuss robust streamflow bias correction in the cprb considering spatial contrast in bias between upstream and downstream and to present impact assessments on floods using d4pdf there is a unique topography of the cprb where the inflows to the bhumibol and sirikit dams represent upstream mountainous catchments hence we explore the upstream gcm bias and the corrected inflows at the two major dams following to middle stream bias which is corrected at nakhon sawan a major stream gauge in the downstream area additionally we compare the two step bias correction with the bias correction of simulated discharge only at nakhon sawan single step bias correction based on the general efficacy of the two step bias correction and its performance in the cprb the bias corrected d4pdf is applied in the basin to analyze its future floods in a 4 k warming condition therefore this study explores a unique method of spatial bias correction of simulated discharge using large climate ensembles for probabilistic future floods projection in the basin to avoid drastic damage like in the 2011 thailand flood additionally an insightful aspect on changes in reoccurrences commencing month and time span of future floods due to the effects of climate change is elaborated in this study this quantitative impact assessment based on huge ensemble climate simulations with robust bias correction can be advantageous for future flood risk assessment damage estimations and policymaking in the cprb 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the cprb 99 000 e 101 300 e 13 150 n 17 000 n is considered to be the largest river basin situated in thailand which spans about a length of 1352 km and a drainage area of 170 000 km2 from the shan plateau in the northwest part of thailand reaching to the south to the gulf of thailand the ping 36 018 km2 wang 11 708 km2 nan 34 557 km2 and yom 24 720 km2 are the four major tributaries in the basin fig 1 shows that from the northern mountain territories the ping and wang tributaries amalgamate with the nan and yom tributaries at nakhon sawan province which is the middle part of cprb and forms the chao phraya river the river then runs down and passes through ayutthaya and bangkok capital provinces before releasing to the gulf of thailand the climate in the basin is hot and humid affected by an asian tropical monsoon in the north and mild throughout the year in the south which is faced with the marine climate the basin comprises two seasons january to april is considered to be the dry season whereas may to december is considered to be the wet season the monthly average temperature in the basin is 22 28 c with slight changes average rainfall of 1220 mm in the northern mountains 1360 mm in the central and 1875 2000 mm in the southern area occurs in the basin out of which 85 of the rainfall and increasing the river discharge happens during the monsoon season may to december the water quantity in cprb changes promptly with seasons with approximately ten times the difference between wet and dry seasons the basin experiences peak discharge during september and october people in thailand typically reside in the floodplains since the area is suitable for farming and agriculture the central provinces receive a huge quantity of water practically every year due to their steep terrain and extensive forests 60 of area in the upper cprb causing floods in low lying regions along the yom and nan rivers in 2011 a great catastrophic flood hit thailand with the people residing in the low lying areas of the chao phraya river was vastly affected around 2 million people were affected with a fatality of 400 people tentatively 1400 mm of rainfall occurred alone in the wet season of 2011 resulting from flood hit five typhoons and depressions that hit the northern part of the cprb over 3000 dams have been built in the cprb since 1950 to store monsoon rains and increase agricultural potential during the dry season the bhumibol and sirikit dams are the two huge dams in ping river and nan river respectively whose purpose is hydropower generation irrigation flood control and salinity intrusion management during the mid of april 2011 45 of bhumibol and 51 of sirikit dam were filled which increased to 95 on both dam reservoirs by 05 october and 14 september 2011 komori et al 2012 mateo et al 2014 loc et al 2020 park et al 2021 in october 2011 nakhon sawan received a peak discharge of 4686 m3 s approximately usd 46 5 billion of economic damage and loss ravaged thailand during the 2011 flooding sayama et al 2015 2 2 data 2 2 1 observed data the observed inflow at the bhumibol and sirikit dams is provided by the electricity generating

search diasjp net en dataset d4pdf rcm 3d plev in order to project the future climates at various global warming levels by running numerous climate simulations using a high resolution global atmospheric model agcm 3 2 at a 60 km resolution and then dynamically downscaling with a regional atmospheric model at a 20 km resolution around japan mizuta et al 2017 hence the global climate experiment was used in this for both experiments four climate scenarios the non global warming the past 2 degree 4 degree warmer climates were employed in this study the boundary conditions were based on mizuta et al 2017 where the past climate simulation was driven by the observed sea surface temperatures sst and sea ice for 60 years from 1951 2010 with 100 variations of small perturbation comparable to observation errors yielding 6000 year data in total hereinafter past climate experiment the future climate simulation was driven by six representatives of the projected sst patterns see table 2 from cmip5 mizuta et al 2017 with the same perturbation setting and performed for 60 years yielding 5400 year data mizuta et al 2017 ishii and mori 2020 these sst models have been used in several studies around the globe for climate change projections for various applications chen et al 2022 study the future variation of extreme precipitation from southern china to north east asia using the d4pdf data yang et al 2018 assess the past and future storm surges in the korean peninsula similarly using d4pdf data the future flood risks on significant river basins of japan along with its economic damage were analyzed tanaka et al 2020 2021 apart from wide global implementation these six sst models have been used in the nearby region the mekong river basin which is a transboundary basin in east and southeast asia for the assessment of uncertainty in water resources and projection of flood inundation try et al 2020 meema et al 2021 based on these this study uses the most widely used the combination of the past climate experiment and the 4 degree rise scenario in global mean temperature hereinafter the 4 degree rise experiment mizuta et al 2017 mori et al 2019 to explore the impact of the most severe temperature increase on flooding in the cprb 2 3 overall methodology the overall methodology opted in the study is shown in fig 2 this study simulates streamflow through river routing simulations from runoff outputs of d4pdf the details are described below the most controversial point of this approach is neglecting spatial bias structure in climatic variables as well as runoff hence this study proposes to incorporate bias correction for upstream dam inflows at bb and sk before the direct correction at the downstream station hereinafter two step correction tsc as shown in the red colored dotted box as a far more straightforward alternative we also test the blue colored dotted box which shows the bias correction at c2 without bias correction at two upstream dams of the basin hereinafter single step correction ssc indeed ssc is a commonly used bias correction method by quantile mapping we then compare the results of the two approaches and examine how enough effective ssc is compared to tsc as a more complicated method we opt for this validation because cprb contains contrasting basin climates between upstream and midstream areas bias corrected streamflow data at c2 was then analyzed to evaluate the impact of climate change on flood peak volume its duration and the starting season the details of the methodological steps are shown in the following sections 2 3 1 river flow routing model 1 k frm a distributed river flow routing model with a spatial resolution of 10 km was used in this study https hywr kuciv kyoto u ac jp products 1k dhm 1k dhm html to convert the runoff generated by a land surface model sibuc embedded in the gcm into a river discharge this kinematic wave model is used where all the rectangular units channel the water downstream based on flow direction the continuity equation for each rectangular unit is shown in eq 1 1 q t a x q l x t where t time x distance from the rectangular unit s top m a cross sectional area m2 q discharge m3 s q l x t the lateral inflow per unit length of channel unit given as d4pdf runoff generated by mri agcm 3 2 m3 s mri agcm 3 2 outputs 3 hour averaged surface and baseflow runoff both of which were added as q l x t in the continuity equation eq 1 the one dimensional momentum manning s equation was used to route the water which regulates the open channel flow characteristics 2 q α a m 3 α i 0 n 1 b m 1 where i 0 slope n manning s roughness coefficient m is the river cross sectional parameter 5 3 the model parameters of the flow model b which is the width of flow is determined by b as c here s is the catchment area at the calculated points and a 1 06 and c 0 69 are constant parameters the value of n is determined to be 0 03 m 1 3 s for the channel when the catchment area at the calculated point is larger than 250 km2 and 11 0 m 1 3 s for the slope when the catchment area is smaller than 500 km2 tachikawa et al 2011 duong et al 2013 the topological dataset is hydrological data and maps based on 30 second digital elevation and flow direction data shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds lehner 2005 upscaled at 10 km spatial resolution for the flow routing model 1 k frm duong et al 2013 the downstream area of the yom river see fig 2 is frequently flooded in the middle stream area which was expressed by applying the following linear reservoir model to downstream cells 4 ds dt i q 5 s kq where s is the flooded storage i is the upstream inflow discharges to a target cell q is the river discharge considering the delay due to inundation around the cell k is the model parameters indicating the delay of flood peaks between inflow i and river discharge q duong et al 2013 used 1 k frm to compare the changes in flow for the past and future climate under changing climate for the indochina peninsula in order to well represent the spatially distributed topography of the chao phraya river basin this flow routing model was successfully used by wichakul et al 2013 and hunukumbura and tachikawa 2012 2 3 2 dam operation the monthly operations of the bhumibol 1 3 billion m3 and sirikit 0 9 billion m3 dams were modeled to store water during the wet season and release it during the dry season based on wichakul et al 2013 which estimated normal downstream water resources demands as 200 m3 s for the bhumibol dam and 250 m3 s for the sirikit dam further during the wet season the amount of water discharged was governed by a minimum maximum reservoir storage capacity and spillway capacity when reservoir storage was less than maximum both dams released roughly 15 and 30 of the natural inflow to sustain downstream flow due to the limited storage capacity of the dam they must entirely release the water when a dam s storage capacity approaches its limit 6000 m3 s and 3200 m3 s for the bhumibol and sirikit dams respectively 2 3 3 bias correction numerous studies have used qqm for gcm bias correction for a variety of climatic variables mishra and herath 2011 2015 bennett et al 2014 these studies targeted a single model ensemble and corrected its bias from observation data with comparable record lengths such procedures become complicated when multiple ensembles are available like d4pdf used due to far larger sample size than observation data there are several possible ways of bias correction particularly for the selection of model quantiles to compare with observation ones each ensemble aggregation of all members a median member as a baseline and an arbitrary ensemble as a baseline chen et al 2019 investigated the difference in performance among them and verified that the median ensemble based correction showed robust performance a similar approach was applied by tanaka et al 2020 that estimated the median of d4pdf ensembles at each percentile as a baseline to compare with observation ones hence in this analysis the same method was employed the median of 100 ensembles is calculated in order to identify the bias correction factors the qqm procedures are formulated as follows 6 r i f obs 1 f x raw i x raw i x raw i where r i is the bias correction factor for i th order statistics of the target variable i 1 2 60 x raw i is the median of a target streamflow variable among 100 ensembles f x raw i x is its empirical cumulative probability f obs 1 p is the inverse function of the empirical cumulative probability p of the observation data for the target variable unambiguously the bias correction factors are determined such that among 100 ensembles of 60 year data the cumulative probability of their median match that of observation as for the target variable as described in the results and discussions the target variables are wet may to december and dry january to april season total inflows and the flood volume total volume over 2000 m3 s at c2 all of which are annual data then the raw simulation daily discharge at the day d in the i th rank year for the target variable q raw i t is corrected to q bc i d by 7 q bc i d r i q raw i d 3 results and discussions 3 1 past climate simulation the raw d4pdf runoff data for 100 ensembles were first used in the river flow routing simulation with 1 k frm the simulated 100 ensemble dam inflows to bb and sk were sorted and for each dam their median was calculated at each percentile as a baseline to calculate the bias ratio by eq 6 fig 3 a and b show the cumulative probability plot of d4pdf dam inflows before after bias correction the raw d4pdf data gray are underestimated in comparison to the observed data black for both dams after the bias correction the median of corrected data blue should match the observation and as the result each corrected ensemble spreads around the observation plot the corrected daily inflow data was again input to 1 k frm to simulate downstream river discharge with dam operations and middle stream inundation as described above the cumulative plot at c2 is shown in fig 3 c as per rid the downstream part of the cprb has a discharge capacity of 2000 m3 s over which flooding occurs thereby the bias correction at the c2 station is done for the total amount of discharge over 2000 m3 s hereinafter flood volume after streamflow simulations with bias corrected dam inflows it is found that in contrast to the dam inflows downstream river discharge overestimated the observed data which implies that middle stream runoff was overestimated as demonstrated here the final output of river discharge is often affected by spatial heterogeneity of runoff or its original climate bias even resulting in the opposite direction therefore we suspected that the presence of bias correction at upstream dams ssc or tsc will affect the future projections of downstream streamflow therefore this study further investigated its impact as a case study in the cprb the magnitude of bias in wet season streamflow volume for the inflows at the upstream dams and middle stream river discharge at c2 was compared in fig 4 it shows that bias in the bhumibol dam is higher than in the sirikit dam we can also observe that the bias in the wet season volume at c2 is much larger than the bias in bhumibol and sirikit dams as well as their total indicating that the upstream bias correction at the dams does not contribute significantly to the future projection of downstream discharge in this particular river basin this is verified by applying both ssc and tsc to future projections below 3 2 future impact assessment 3 2 1 bhumibol and sirikit dam inflows fig 5 shows the same plot as fig 3 the bhumibol and sirikit dam inflows adding the bias corrected future projections for the six sst ensembles red in wet season volume the dry season volume analysis was also done in the study to compare the bias of dam operation the future discharge volume is going to be magnified in both dams during the wet season period the intensification of the future volume is higher in the bhumibol dam than in the sirikit dam there is a slight increase or almost similar future trend in sirikit dam whereas for the bhumibol dam the future volume is going to enlarge the mean increase ratio for 100 year volume for the six sst ensembles is likely going to be between 1 3 and 1 5 times the past climate for the bhumibol dam whereas 1 2 1 4 times the past climate for the sirikit dam fig 5 it shows that for both bhumibol and sirikit dams the future volume red is higher than the past blue in both the cases the cumulative probability higher than 0 9 for all sst ensembles shows greater volume than in the past this indicates that future dam operation rules such as rule curves need updates to avoid an adverse effect on downstream flooding 3 2 2 c2 station fig 6 shows the future changes in flood volume at c2 with a ssc and b tsc respectively in both cases all sst ensembles show a clear increasing trend red as for the bias correction approach both ssc and tsc showed a similar trend the mean increase ratio for 100 year volume for the six sst ensembles is likely going to be between 1 1 1 5 times times the past climate by ssc and 1 1 1 6 times the past climate by tsc the downstream of the c2 station is dominated by many industrial and agricultural areas this increase in future flood volume might alter downstream activities drastically due to the large c2 bias in the future climate similar to the past climate the upstream dam bias correction was insignificant in this particular case study however in general the tsc is more prominent and robust as it tries to reduce the bias correction uncertainty with multi step corrections therefore we opt for the tsc bias correction for further analysis of flood characteristics in the study the bias correction of discharge is one of the main considerations of this study studies show that the land surface model generates runoff data which incorporates the direct effect of land cover in gcm simulation techniques as a result the bias correction of runoff and river discharge in gcms may adapt to different types of land cover settings which is to a greater degree effective than the bias correction of precipitation mizushima et al 2019 ram indra et al 2020a 2020b the bias correction of the discharge method with an adequate statistical performance taking into account non stationary conditions is an effectual method for the estimation of future discharge manee et al 2016 3 3 future flood characteristics 3 3 1 return period the annual maximum peak discharge and flood volume at each return period at c2 are shown in fig 7 the maximum discharge is going to be higher than in the past climate experiment more severe floods are likely to occur more frequently i e less return period the figure shows that approximately 70 year return period event was corresponding to the 2011 thailand flood discharge whereas tentatively 120 year return period total volume was corresponding to the 2011 thailand flood we can also observe that the peak discharge may be slightly increased whereas for the same or less return period the volume of the flood is going to be huge it also shows that a reduced return period of similar or higher discharge and volume than the 2011 thailand flood in all the sst members is expected in the future in the cprb the 100 year return period flood is likely to be more 1 1 1 6 times in the future as shown in table 3 this implies frequency of the floods is also likely to increase and a future higher volume of floods will result in severe economic damage than in the past similar studies in the basin show that the increase in future discharge is expected to be between 28 and 40 tebakari et al 2012 ponpang nga and techamahasaranont 2016 in overall agreement with this study showing 10 60 increase in addition the mean monthly discharge in the basin is likely to increase in all the months and the flood risk in the future projection periods increases according to a flood frequency analysis utilizing the annual maximum daily flow record according to wichakul et al 2015 in the cprb kotsuki et al 2014 also suggested that at the c2 station there will be an increased annual runoff due to the increase in precipitation 3 3 2 shift in flood onset the change of flood is also assessed in terms of a shift in flood over 2000 m3 s onset in fig 8 indicating that typical i e the most frequent starting month will be expanded from predominantly september in the past climate blue to both august and september equally and even june and july at certain frequencies among the six sst ensembles mi shows relatively a similar pattern to the past climate corresponding to the closer future change ratio of peak discharge in fig 7 a table 3 shows that there is an increase in discharge for the 6 sst ensemble with respect to the return period in the cprb this implies that the projected shift in flood occurrence month in fig 8 is caused by the overall increase in annual maximum discharge this undeniably shows that longer and early occurrence of floods is likely to happen in all sst members previously there were rare occurrences of floods during june and july whereas in the future frequent flood events are likely to turn up during these months too similar results can be observed where the occurrence of floods in the future is starting from the month of june in the basin kitpaisalsakul et al 2016 therefore planning for adaptation for different crops cultivation especially rice which is a major source of income for people residing in chao phraya would be an urgent need 3 3 3 duration of flood as the result flood duration defined as the total number of days when daily discharge is over 2000 m3 s at c2 is likely to be longer in the 4 degree rise climate red compared to past climate blue as shown in fig 9 on average the flood used to occur approximately 70 days annually during the past which will shoot up between 80 120 days annually in the future based on sst members this means in the future the flood duration is going to be extended by 10 50 days on average higher flood volume early occurrence of flood and prolonged duration of flood show the future is going to be more intensive and persistent during the 2011 thailand flood the floods lasted from 3 weeks to 3 months depending on the various provinces which affected a large population giving a threat to the capital city jular 2011 frequent floods and prolonged duration will affect the economic social and environmental aspects of the basin and influence a large population depending on the cprb for their sustainability abhishek et al 2021 therefore understanding the past flood characteristics to be prepared for future flood damage is essential komori et al 2012 4 conclusions the cprb in thailand is strategically located in the heart of southeast asia s mainland making it one of the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to increased floods despite the obvious necessity for revealing its impact a single solid answer to this question is hard to obtain due to the large catchment area in a contrasting climate and geography with human interventions such as streamflow control this gives challenges to climate simulations bias correction and hydrological modeling climate simulation challenges have been addressed recently with large ensemble experiments such as the d4pdf however the bias correction of such large ensembles for multiple climate variables or unobservable runoff is a far more challenging task on these backgrounds in this study we explored the applicability of streamflow bias correction considering its spatial bias heterogeneity for the d4pdf datasets and assessed the impacts on future floods due to a 4 degree rise in global mean temperature corresponding to the end of the 21st century in the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario to achieve this large ensemble runoff data from d4pdf was translated into streamflow using the 1 km flow routing model 1 k frm customized in the cprb with the dam operation module for the two major upstream dams the bhumibol and sirikit dams as well as a simple representation of middle stream overflow using a validated linear reservoir model the bias of the obtained dam inflows was identified and corrected using the qqm method and then the bias corrected dam inflows were used in 1 k frm again to obtain the discharge at c2 with upstream bias eliminated and middle stream bias remained these results were compared with the observed river discharge at c2 and corrected this tsc approach is considered to realize robust bias removal even if the bias is in the opposite direction between upstream and middle stream catchments as demonstrated in this study due to the large biases present in the middle stream catchment revealed as bias at c2 in the tsc approach the upstream bias correction is nominal which implies similitude results between the multi step bias correction and a simpler bias correction at c2 in the case of d4pdf which was also verified by comparing the future projections with both bias corrections however this might not be the case in other large basins and it might be interesting to see the effect which helps to reduce the uncertainty that lies in the model results show that the future flood volume with respect to both the spatial bias correction techniques are expected to increase with respect to the past furthermore the impact assessment in the future floods shows that in the future the floods are going to be more prominent and their profound effect will be much higher than the 2011 flood in thailand in both ssc and tsc bias correction techniques elevated flood volume earlier flood occurrence and longer flood duration indicate that forthcoming floods will be more rigorous the increase in 100 year floods by 1 1 1 6 times with a larger duration exceeded by 10 50 days with respect to the past climate is observed in this study there is an urgent need for climate change adaptation to avoid future ravishing economic social and environmental destructions like or higher than the 2011 thailand flood consequently hydrological extremes such as floods are caused by several factors in addition to climate change such as local vulnerability and or spatial heterogeneity of people and property which is not considered in this study consequently flood volume change cannot perfectly explain resulting inundation and economic damage in particular literature still lacks knowledge about such social factors being a barrier to quantitative flood risk assessment in southeast asian countries leitold et al 2021 compared to europe or the united states where flood damage estimation procedures are manualized which will be investigated further for future research credit authorship contribution statement aakanchya budhathoki conceptualization methodology modeling experiments analysis visualization writing original

7914,study region chao phraya river basin cprb the predominant basin located in thailand study focus this study aims to ascertain the difference between spatial bias heterogeneity of streamflow in large river basins such as cprb for a robust analysis the upstream major dams and the outlet of the basin were examined with two step bias correction and compared with a more practical bias correction only at the outlet of the basin the former clarified that due to the large effect of downstream bias the upstream bias effect was considered negligible thus the two approaches resulted in similar future projections in the cprb through this comparison streamflow bias in the past and future climate experiments was corrected considering its spatial characteristics for robust assessments of quantitative impacts of climate change new hydrological insights for the region a 4 k warmer climate will increase the frequency of the 2011 flood in cprb and enhance 100 year flood peak discharge by 1 1 1 6 times than the past climate 1961 2010 the future flood in the basin which starts predominantly in september in the present climate is likely to begin in september and august equally with a prolonged duration of floods around 10 50 days the study region is likely expected to experience elevated flood volume earlier flood occurrence and longer flood duration which indicates that forthcoming floods will be more rigorous graphical abstract ga1 keywords d4pdf bias correction 1k frm climate change floods chao phraya river basin 1 introduction the chao phraya river basin cprb is the principal river basin occupying 30 of thailand s geographical extent and inhabiting 40 of the country s total population it has been endowing livelihood employment opportunities and developing country s agronomics contributing to 66 of gross domestic product abhishek et al 2021 gunawardana et al 2021 this basin has been under continuous ramifications of floods droughts land subsidence urbanization increase in population etc especially affecting the lower delta region hogendoorn et al 2018 loc et al 2020 park et al 2021 over 3000 dams have been built in the cprb since 1950 to store monsoon rains and increase agricultural potential during the dry season bhumibol and sirikit dams are the two substantially large dams controlling 22 of the runoff from the total basin territory bond et al 2018 various episodic hydro meteorological events have hit the cprb in the past couple of decades such as floods in 2006 2011 and 2021 droughts in 2015 2016 and 2019 2020 affecting millions of people and causing a large economic damage loc et al 2020 abhishek et al 2021 as a result for cprb sustainability knowing the influence of climate change and its effect on future extreme events is a prerequisite innumerous studies have been carried out on climate change impact assessments on river discharge and water availability li et al 2016 hughes and farinosi 2020 budhathoki et al 2021 casale et al 2021 jahandideh tehrani et al 2021 environmental ecological and socio economic sectors such as agriculture industry hydropower and biodiversity protection rely on the ability to estimate water availability under varying climatic circumstances and hydrological changes both in the near and far future li et al 2016 didovets et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wannasin et al 2021 according to regional impact assessments in thailand the country will experience a change in high intensity rainfall falling between 5 in the dry season to raising to 36 5 in the wet season annually champathong et al 2013 chaowiwat et al 2019 studies with several general circulation models gcm show that average annual discharge as well as maximum annual flows will surge up between 6 8 and 38 4 with rising rainfall in the cprb towards to end of the 21st century kure and tebakari 2012 hunukumbura and tachikawa 2012 ligaray et al 2015 despite reduced uncertainty in climate change projections at the global scale owing to compiled evidence ar6 catchment scale future change projections are still varied which is possibly due to high uncertainty associated with the large impact of internal climate variability on extreme precipitation that cannot be captured with limited ensembles peel et al 2015 therefore previous works on climate change impact assessments on floods in thailand are limited to overall tendencies such as mean or variance and hard to give a robust estimate of frequency changes in extreme with a limited sample size such as the 2011 flood event to overcome this issue huge ensembles covering the internal climate variability as much as possible are required for the impact assessments of extreme floods the database for 4 policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf has therefore been developed mizuta et al 2017 with tens 50 100 of ensembles for 60 year simulation in the non global warming past 1951 2010 and future climates for 1 5 k 2 k and 4 k degree increase in global mean temperature the d4pdf has been employed in a variety of climate change impact studies looking into river discharge floods tropical cyclones storm surges etc lavender et al 2018 mori et al 2019 tanaka et al 2020 ninomiya et al 2021 therefore d4pdf has the potential of detecting future changes in extreme flood characteristics the d4pdf however still contains the model bias even after achieving such huge ensemble simulations tanaka et al 2019 watanabe et al 2020 and hence a prominent approach for addressing biases in gcm outputs is the quantile quantile mapping qqm bias correction technique is used for enhancing the accuracy of climate forecasts and hydrological simulations piani et al 2010 tong et al 2018 in this method the gcm data of a grid cell is adjusted using the qqm which links observation climate data from the same or surrounding grid cells and has been found to be very efficient at eliminating biases from climate model outputs while keeping shifts in climate frequency and variance ines and hansen 2006 elshamy et al 2009 many streamflow impact assessments lag the correlation structure in their bias that needs to be considered maraun 2016 this issue would be critical in the cprb where approximately 80 of precipitation is consumed by evapotranspiration i e runoff is considered a residual in terms of the water cycle wichakul et al 2014 zhao et al 2022 therefore as an alternative bias correction to gcm runoff data has been lately called to attention to reduce the uncertainty and results show improved river discharge calculations ibarra et al 2021 in particular in thailand or the indochina peninsula duong et al 2013 ram indra et al 2020a however it is still challenging due to the necessity of preparing reference runoff data that requires precise land surface simulations a more direct approach streamflow bias correction is considered in a few studies farmer et al 2018 possibly due to the combination of small observation simulation sample size runoff bias heterogeneity and human intervention such as dam control and or irrigation due to the long record of streamflow observations and large ensemble climate simulations such as d4pdf the sample size issue can be addressed nevertheless the later factors need regional scale analysis of bias structure in the selected river basin after the spatial bias structure is clarified with rigorous discussions streamflow bias correction could be adopted as a strategy although such a basin specific approach is hard to apply uniformly to the entire globe is crucial to compile regional studies for a comprehensive understanding as a whole this study aims to discuss robust streamflow bias correction in the cprb considering spatial contrast in bias between upstream and downstream and to present impact assessments on floods using d4pdf there is a unique topography of the cprb where the inflows to the bhumibol and sirikit dams represent upstream mountainous catchments hence we explore the upstream gcm bias and the corrected inflows at the two major dams following to middle stream bias which is corrected at nakhon sawan a major stream gauge in the downstream area additionally we compare the two step bias correction with the bias correction of simulated discharge only at nakhon sawan single step bias correction based on the general efficacy of the two step bias correction and its performance in the cprb the bias corrected d4pdf is applied in the basin to analyze its future floods in a 4 k warming condition therefore this study explores a unique method of spatial bias correction of simulated discharge using large climate ensembles for probabilistic future floods projection in the basin to avoid drastic damage like in the 2011 thailand flood additionally an insightful aspect on changes in reoccurrences commencing month and time span of future floods due to the effects of climate change is elaborated in this study this quantitative impact assessment based on huge ensemble climate simulations with robust bias correction can be advantageous for future flood risk assessment damage estimations and policymaking in the cprb 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the cprb 99 000 e 101 300 e 13 150 n 17 000 n is considered to be the largest river basin situated in thailand which spans about a length of 1352 km and a drainage area of 170 000 km2 from the shan plateau in the northwest part of thailand reaching to the south to the gulf of thailand the ping 36 018 km2 wang 11 708 km2 nan 34 557 km2 and yom 24 720 km2 are the four major tributaries in the basin fig 1 shows that from the northern mountain territories the ping and wang tributaries amalgamate with the nan and yom tributaries at nakhon sawan province which is the middle part of cprb and forms the chao phraya river the river then runs down and passes through ayutthaya and bangkok capital provinces before releasing to the gulf of thailand the climate in the basin is hot and humid affected by an asian tropical monsoon in the north and mild throughout the year in the south which is faced with the marine climate the basin comprises two seasons january to april is considered to be the dry season whereas may to december is considered to be the wet season the monthly average temperature in the basin is 22 28 c with slight changes average rainfall of 1220 mm in the northern mountains 1360 mm in the central and 1875 2000 mm in the southern area occurs in the basin out of which 85 of the rainfall and increasing the river discharge happens during the monsoon season may to december the water quantity in cprb changes promptly with seasons with approximately ten times the difference between wet and dry seasons the basin experiences peak discharge during september and october people in thailand typically reside in the floodplains since the area is suitable for farming and agriculture the central provinces receive a huge quantity of water practically every year due to their steep terrain and extensive forests 60 of area in the upper cprb causing floods in low lying regions along the yom and nan rivers in 2011 a great catastrophic flood hit thailand with the people residing in the low lying areas of the chao phraya river was vastly affected around 2 million people were affected with a fatality of 400 people tentatively 1400 mm of rainfall occurred alone in the wet season of 2011 resulting from flood hit five typhoons and depressions that hit the northern part of the cprb over 3000 dams have been built in the cprb since 1950 to store monsoon rains and increase agricultural potential during the dry season the bhumibol and sirikit dams are the two huge dams in ping river and nan river respectively whose purpose is hydropower generation irrigation flood control and salinity intrusion management during the mid of april 2011 45 of bhumibol and 51 of sirikit dam were filled which increased to 95 on both dam reservoirs by 05 october and 14 september 2011 komori et al 2012 mateo et al 2014 loc et al 2020 park et al 2021 in october 2011 nakhon sawan received a peak discharge of 4686 m3 s approximately usd 46 5 billion of economic damage and loss ravaged thailand during the 2011 flooding sayama et al 2015 2 2 data 2 2 1 observed data the observed inflow at the bhumibol and sirikit dams is provided by the electricity generating authority of thailand egat the one at the c2 station nakhon sawan was collected from the royal irrigation department rid table 1 shows the details of the data collected and its sources for the cprb study 2 2 2 d4pdf data the d4pdf is created by the joint project of the meteorological research institute of japan meteorological agency atmosphere and ocean research institute of the university of tokyo disaster prevention research institute of kyoto university national institute of environmental study japan agency for marine earth science and technology jamstec and university of tsukuba http search diasjp net en dataset d4pdf rcm 3d plev in order to project the future climates at various global warming levels by running numerous climate simulations using a high resolution global atmospheric model agcm 3 2 at a 60 km resolution and then dynamically downscaling with a regional atmospheric model at a 20 km resolution around japan mizuta et al 2017 hence the global climate experiment was used in this for both experiments four climate scenarios the non global warming the past 2 degree 4 degree warmer climates were employed in this study the boundary conditions were based on mizuta et al 2017 where the past climate simulation was driven by the observed sea surface temperatures sst and sea ice for 60 years from 1951 2010 with 100 variations of small perturbation comparable to observation errors yielding 6000 year data in total hereinafter past climate experiment the future climate simulation was driven by six representatives of the projected sst patterns see table 2 from cmip5 mizuta et al 2017 with the same perturbation setting and performed for 60 years yielding 5400 year data mizuta et al 2017 ishii and mori 2020 these sst models have been used in several studies around the globe for climate change projections for various applications chen et al 2022 study the future variation of extreme precipitation from southern china to north east asia using the d4pdf data yang et al 2018 assess the past and future storm surges in the korean peninsula similarly using d4pdf data the future flood risks on significant river basins of japan along with its economic damage were analyzed tanaka et al 2020 2021 apart from wide global implementation these six sst models have been used in the nearby region the mekong river basin which is a transboundary basin in east and southeast asia for the assessment of uncertainty in water resources and projection of flood inundation try et al 2020 meema et al 2021 based on these this study uses the most widely used the combination of the past climate experiment and the 4 degree rise scenario in global mean temperature hereinafter the 4 degree rise experiment mizuta et al 2017 mori et al 2019 to explore the impact of the most severe temperature increase on flooding in the cprb 2 3 overall methodology the overall methodology opted in the study is shown in fig 2 this study simulates streamflow through river routing simulations from runoff outputs of d4pdf the details are described below the most controversial point of this approach is neglecting spatial bias structure in climatic variables as well as runoff hence this study proposes to incorporate bias correction for upstream dam inflows at bb and sk before the direct correction at the downstream station hereinafter two step correction tsc as shown in the red colored dotted box as a far more straightforward alternative we also test the blue colored dotted box which shows the bias correction at c2 without bias correction at two upstream dams of the basin hereinafter single step correction ssc indeed ssc is a commonly used bias correction method by quantile mapping we then compare the results of the two approaches and examine how enough effective ssc is compared to tsc as a more complicated method we opt for this validation because cprb contains contrasting basin climates between upstream and midstream areas bias corrected streamflow data at c2 was then analyzed to evaluate the impact of climate change on flood peak volume its duration and the starting season the details of the methodological steps are shown in the following sections 2 3 1 river flow routing model 1 k frm a distributed river flow routing model with a spatial resolution of 10 km was used in this study https hywr kuciv kyoto u ac jp products 1k dhm 1k dhm html to convert the runoff generated by a land surface model sibuc embedded in the gcm into a river discharge this kinematic wave model is used where all the rectangular units channel the water downstream based on flow direction the continuity equation for each rectangular unit is shown in eq 1 1 q t a x q l x t where t time x distance from the rectangular unit s top m a cross sectional area m2 q discharge m3 s q l x t the lateral inflow per unit length of channel unit given as d4pdf runoff generated by mri agcm 3 2 m3 s mri agcm 3 2 outputs 3 hour averaged surface and baseflow runoff both of which were added as q l x t in the continuity equation eq 1 the one dimensional momentum manning s equation was used to route the water which regulates the open channel flow characteristics 2 q α a m 3 α i 0 n 1 b m 1 where i 0 slope n manning s roughness coefficient m is the river cross sectional parameter 5 3 the model parameters of the flow model b which is the width of flow is determined by b as c here s is the catchment area at the calculated points and a 1 06 and c 0 69 are constant parameters the value of n is determined to be 0 03 m 1 3 s for the channel when the catchment area at the calculated point is larger than 250 km2 and 11 0 m 1 3 s for the slope when the catchment area is smaller than 500 km2 tachikawa et al 2011 duong et al 2013 the topological dataset is hydrological data and maps based on 30 second digital elevation and flow direction data shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds lehner 2005 upscaled at 10 km spatial resolution for the flow routing model 1 k frm duong et al 2013 the downstream area of the yom river see fig 2 is frequently flooded in the middle stream area which was expressed by applying the following linear reservoir model to downstream cells 4 ds dt i q 5 s kq where s is the flooded storage i is the upstream inflow discharges to a target cell q is the river discharge considering the delay due to inundation around the cell k is the model parameters indicating the delay of flood peaks between inflow i and river discharge q duong et al 2013 used 1 k frm to compare the changes in flow for the past and future climate under changing climate for the indochina peninsula in order to well represent the spatially distributed topography of the chao phraya river basin this flow routing model was successfully used by wichakul et al 2013 and hunukumbura and tachikawa 2012 2 3 2 dam operation the monthly operations of the bhumibol 1 3 billion m3 and sirikit 0 9 billion m3 dams were modeled to store water during the wet season and release it during the dry season based on wichakul et al 2013 which estimated normal downstream water resources demands as 200 m3 s for the bhumibol dam and 250 m3 s for the sirikit dam further during the wet season the amount of water discharged was governed by a minimum maximum reservoir storage capacity and spillway capacity when reservoir storage was less than maximum both dams released roughly 15 and 30 of the natural inflow to sustain downstream flow due to the limited storage capacity of the dam they must entirely release the water when a dam s storage capacity approaches its limit 6000 m3 s and 3200 m3 s for the bhumibol and sirikit dams respectively 2 3 3 bias correction numerous studies have used qqm for gcm bias correction for a variety of climatic variables mishra and herath 2011 2015 bennett et al 2014 these studies targeted a single model ensemble and corrected its bias from observation data with comparable record lengths such procedures become complicated when multiple ensembles are available like d4pdf used due to far larger sample size than observation data there are several possible ways of bias correction particularly for the selection of model quantiles to compare with observation ones each ensemble aggregation of all members a median member as a baseline and an arbitrary ensemble as a baseline chen et al 2019 investigated the difference in performance among them and verified that the median ensemble based correction showed robust performance a similar approach was applied by tanaka et al 2020 that estimated the median of d4pdf ensembles at each percentile as a baseline to compare with observation ones hence in this analysis the same method was employed the median of 100 ensembles is calculated in order to identify the bias correction factors the qqm procedures are formulated as follows 6 r i f obs 1 f x raw i x raw i x raw i where r i is the bias correction factor for i th order statistics of the target variable i 1 2 60 x raw i is the median of a target streamflow variable among 100 ensembles f x raw i x is its empirical cumulative probability f obs 1 p is the inverse function of the empirical cumulative probability p of the observation data for the target variable unambiguously the bias correction factors are determined such that among 100 ensembles of 60 year data the cumulative probability of their median match that of observation as for the target variable as described in the results and discussions the target variables are wet may to december and dry january to april season total inflows and the flood volume total volume over 2000 m3 s at c2 all of which are annual data then the raw simulation daily discharge at the day d in the i th rank year for the target variable q raw i t is corrected to q bc i d by 7 q bc i d r i q raw i d 3 results and discussions 3 1 past climate simulation the raw d4pdf runoff data for 100 ensembles were first used in the river flow routing simulation with 1 k frm the simulated 100 ensemble dam inflows to bb and sk were sorted and for each dam their median was calculated at each percentile as a baseline to calculate the bias ratio by eq 6 fig 3 a and b show the cumulative probability plot of d4pdf dam inflows before after bias correction the raw d4pdf data gray are underestimated in comparison to the observed data black for both dams after the bias correction the median of corrected data blue should match the observation and as the result each corrected ensemble spreads around the observation plot the corrected daily inflow data was again input to 1 k frm to simulate downstream river discharge with dam operations and middle stream inundation as described above the cumulative plot at c2 is shown in fig 3 c as per rid the downstream part of the cprb has a discharge capacity of 2000 m3 s over which flooding occurs thereby the bias correction at the c2 station is done for the total amount of discharge over 2000 m3 s hereinafter flood volume after streamflow simulations with bias corrected dam inflows it is found that in contrast to the dam inflows downstream river discharge overestimated the observed data which implies that middle stream runoff was overestimated as demonstrated here the final output of river discharge is often affected by spatial heterogeneity of runoff or its original climate bias even resulting in the opposite direction therefore we suspected that the presence of bias correction at upstream dams ssc or tsc will affect the future projections of downstream streamflow therefore this study further investigated its impact as a case study in the cprb the magnitude of bias in wet season streamflow volume for the inflows at the upstream dams and middle stream river discharge at c2 was compared in fig 4 it shows that bias in the bhumibol dam is higher than in the sirikit dam we can also observe that the bias in the wet season volume at c2 is much larger than the bias in bhumibol and sirikit dams as well as their total indicating that the upstream bias correction at the dams does not contribute significantly to the future projection of downstream discharge in this particular river basin this is verified by applying both ssc and tsc to future projections below 3 2 future impact assessment 3 2 1 bhumibol and sirikit dam inflows fig 5 shows the same plot as fig 3 the bhumibol and sirikit dam inflows adding the bias corrected future projections for the six sst ensembles red in wet season volume the dry season volume analysis was also done in the study to compare the bias of dam operation the future discharge volume is going to be magnified in both dams during the wet season period the intensification of the future volume is higher in the bhumibol dam than in the sirikit dam there is a slight increase or almost similar future trend in sirikit dam whereas for the bhumibol dam the future volume is going to enlarge the mean increase ratio for 100 year volume for the six sst ensembles is likely going to be between 1 3 and 1 5 times the past climate for the bhumibol dam whereas 1 2 1 4 times the past climate for the sirikit dam fig 5 it shows that for both bhumibol and sirikit dams the future volume red is higher than the past blue in both the cases the cumulative probability higher than 0 9 for all sst ensembles shows greater volume than in the past this indicates that future dam operation rules such as rule curves need updates to avoid an adverse effect on downstream flooding 3 2 2 c2 station fig 6 shows the future changes in flood volume at c2 with a ssc and b tsc respectively in both cases all sst ensembles show a clear increasing trend red as for the bias correction approach both ssc and tsc showed a similar trend the mean increase ratio for 100 year volume for the six sst ensembles is likely going to be between 1 1 1 5 times times the past climate by ssc and 1 1 1 6 times the past climate by tsc the downstream of the c2 station is dominated by many industrial and agricultural areas this increase in future flood volume might alter downstream activities drastically due to the large c2 bias in the future climate similar to the past climate the upstream dam bias correction was insignificant in this particular case study however in general the tsc is more prominent and robust as it tries to reduce the bias correction uncertainty with multi step corrections therefore we opt for the tsc bias correction for further analysis of flood characteristics in the study the bias correction of discharge is one of the main considerations of this study studies show that the land surface model generates runoff data which incorporates the direct effect of land cover in gcm simulation techniques as a result the bias correction of runoff and river discharge in gcms may adapt to different types of land cover settings which is to a greater degree effective than the bias correction of precipitation mizushima et al 2019 ram indra et al 2020a 2020b the bias correction of the discharge method with an adequate statistical performance taking into account non stationary conditions is an effectual method for the estimation of future discharge manee et al 2016 3 3 future flood characteristics 3 3 1 return period the annual maximum peak discharge and flood volume at each return period at c2 are shown in fig 7 the maximum discharge is going to be higher than in the past climate experiment more severe floods are likely to occur more frequently i e less return period the figure shows that approximately 70 year return period event was corresponding to the 2011 thailand flood discharge whereas tentatively 120 year return period total volume was corresponding to the 2011 thailand flood we can also observe that the peak discharge may be slightly increased whereas for the same or less return period the volume of the flood is going to be huge it also shows that a reduced return period of similar or higher discharge and volume than the 2011 thailand flood in all the sst members is expected in the future in the cprb the 100 year return period flood is likely to be more 1 1 1 6 times in the future as shown in table 3 this implies frequency of the floods is also likely to increase and a future higher volume of floods will result in severe economic damage than in the past similar studies in the basin show that the increase in future discharge is expected to be between 28 and 40 tebakari et al 2012 ponpang nga and techamahasaranont 2016 in overall agreement with this study showing 10 60 increase in addition the mean monthly discharge in the basin is likely to increase in all the months and the flood risk in the future projection periods increases according to a flood frequency analysis utilizing the annual maximum daily flow record according to wichakul et al 2015 in the cprb kotsuki et al 2014 also suggested that at the c2 station there will be an increased annual runoff due to the increase in precipitation 3 3 2 shift in flood onset the change of flood is also assessed in terms of a shift in flood over 2000 m3 s onset in fig 8 indicating that typical i e the most frequent starting month will be expanded from predominantly september in the past climate blue to both august and september equally and even june and july at certain frequencies among the six sst ensembles mi shows relatively a similar pattern to the past climate corresponding to the closer future change ratio of peak discharge in fig 7 a table 3 shows that there is an increase in discharge for the 6 sst ensemble with respect to the return period in the cprb this implies that the projected shift in flood occurrence month in fig 8 is caused by the overall increase in annual maximum discharge this undeniably shows that longer and early occurrence of floods is likely to happen in all sst members previously there were rare occurrences of floods during june and july whereas in the future frequent flood events are likely to turn up during these months too similar results can be observed where the occurrence of floods in the future is starting from the month of june in the basin kitpaisalsakul et al 2016 therefore planning for adaptation for different crops cultivation especially rice which is a major source of income for people residing in chao phraya would be an urgent need 3 3 3 duration of flood as the result flood duration defined as the total number of days when daily discharge is over 2000 m3 s at c2 is likely to be longer in the 4 degree rise climate red compared to past climate blue as shown in fig 9 on average the flood used to occur approximately 70 days annually during the past which will shoot up between 80 120 days annually in the future based on sst members this means in the future the flood duration is going to be extended by 10 50 days on average higher flood volume early occurrence of flood and prolonged duration of flood show the future is going to be more intensive and persistent during the 2011 thailand flood the floods lasted from 3 weeks to 3 months depending on the various provinces which affected a large population giving a threat to the capital city jular 2011 frequent floods and prolonged duration will affect the economic social and environmental aspects of the basin and influence a large population depending on the cprb for their sustainability abhishek et al 2021 therefore understanding the past flood characteristics to be prepared for future flood damage is essential komori et al 2012 4 conclusions the cprb in thailand is strategically located in the heart of southeast asia s mainland making it one of the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to increased floods despite the obvious necessity for revealing its impact a single solid answer to this question is hard to obtain due to the large catchment area in a contrasting climate and geography with human interventions such as streamflow control this gives challenges to climate simulations bias correction and hydrological modeling climate simulation challenges have been addressed recently with large ensemble experiments such as the d4pdf however the bias correction of such large ensembles for multiple climate variables or unobservable runoff is a far more challenging task on these backgrounds in this study we explored the applicability of streamflow bias correction considering its spatial bias heterogeneity for the d4pdf datasets and assessed the impacts on future floods due to a 4 degree rise in global mean temperature corresponding to the end of the 21st century in the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario to achieve this large ensemble runoff data from d4pdf was translated into streamflow using the 1 km flow routing model 1 k frm customized in the cprb with the dam operation module for the two major upstream dams the bhumibol and sirikit dams as well as a simple representation of middle stream overflow using a validated linear reservoir model the bias of the obtained dam inflows was identified and corrected using the qqm method and then the bias corrected dam inflows were used in 1 k frm again to obtain the discharge at c2 with upstream bias eliminated and middle stream bias remained these results were compared with the observed river discharge at c2 and corrected this tsc approach is considered to realize robust bias removal even if the bias is in the opposite direction between upstream and middle stream catchments as demonstrated in this study due to the large biases present in the middle stream catchment revealed as bias at c2 in the tsc approach the upstream bias correction is nominal which implies similitude results between the multi step bias correction and a simpler bias correction at c2 in the case of d4pdf which was also verified by comparing the future projections with both bias corrections however this might not be the case in other large basins and it might be interesting to see the effect which helps to reduce the uncertainty that lies in the model results show that the future flood volume with respect to both the spatial bias correction techniques are expected to increase with respect to the past furthermore the impact assessment in the future floods shows that in the future the floods are going to be more prominent and their profound effect will be much higher than the 2011 flood in thailand in both ssc and tsc bias correction techniques elevated flood volume earlier flood occurrence and longer flood duration indicate that forthcoming floods will be more rigorous the increase in 100 year floods by 1 1 1 6 times with a larger duration exceeded by 10 50 days with respect to the past climate is observed in this study there is an urgent need for climate change adaptation to avoid future ravishing economic social and environmental destructions like or higher than the 2011 thailand flood consequently hydrological extremes such as floods are caused by several factors in addition to climate change such as local vulnerability and or spatial heterogeneity of people and property which is not considered in this study consequently flood volume change cannot perfectly explain resulting inundation and economic damage in particular literature still lacks knowledge about such social factors being a barrier to quantitative flood risk assessment in southeast asian countries leitold et al 2021 compared to europe or the united states where flood damage estimation procedures are manualized which will be investigated further for future research credit authorship contribution statement aakanchya budhathoki conceptualization methodology modeling experiments analysis visualization writing original
