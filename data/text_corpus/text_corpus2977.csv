14885,urban rainfall events can lead to the runoff of pollutants including industrial pesticide and pharmaceutical chemicals transporting micropollutants mps into water systems can harm both human health and aquatic species therefore it is necessary to investigate the dynamics of mps during rainfall events however few studies have examined mps during rainfall events due to the high analytical expenses and extensive spatiotemporal variability few studies have investigated the occurrence patterns of mps and factors that influence their transport such as rainfall duration antecedent dry periods and variations in streamflow moreover while there have been many analyses of nutrients suspended solids and heavy metals during the first flush effect ffe studies on the transport of mps during ffe are insufficient this study aimed to identify the dynamics of mps and ffe in an urban catchment using high resolution monitoring and machine learning methods hierarchical clustering analysis and partial least squares regression plsr were implemented to estimate the similarity between each mp and identify the factors influencing their transport during rainfall events eleven dominant mps comprised 75 of the total mp concentration and had a 100 detection frequency during rainfall events pesticides and pharmaceutical mps showed a higher ffe than industrial mps moreover the initial 30 of the runoff volume contained 78 0 of pesticide and 50 1 of pharmaceutical substances for events w1 july 5 to july 6 2021 and w6 august 31 to september 1 2021 respectively the plsr model suggested that stormflow m3 s and the duration of antecedent dry hours h significantly influenced mp dynamics yielding the variable importance on projection scores greater than 1 0 hence our findings indicate that mps in urban waters should be managed by considering ffe graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutant high resolution mass spectrometry first flush effects hierarchical clustering analysis partial least squares regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction continuous urbanization and industrialization have led to an increase in stormwater runoff which has resulted in the discharge of heavy metals nutrients and organic chemicals barbosa et al 2012 kayhanian et al 2012 micropollutants mps including pharmaceutical industrial and pesticides are commonly found in these streams luo et al 2014 these pollutants are toxic to aquatic organisms and have been linked to the deaths of adult coho salmon du et al 2017 fairbairn et al 2018 peter et al 2018 furthermore the rapid growth of new industries and the use of advanced pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps releasing contaminants of emerging concern cec such as poly and per fluorinated alkyl substances pfass and organophosphate flame retardants opfrs into urban watersheds choi et al 2021b deere et al 2021 exposure to these contaminants can affect the endocrine systems of organisms leading to adverse health effects ebele et al 2017 studies have classified pfass as possibly carcinogenic to humans choi et al 2021a iarc 2020 and opfrs have been shown to be neurotoxic and carcinogenic to laboratory animals lee et al 2016 takahashi et al 2012 given the potential hazards of mps to human health and ecological systems it is crucial to understand their sources and transport mechanisms to mitigate the risks they pose to receiving water in an urban catchment stormwater runoff is a source of chemical discharge into stream water brezonik and stadelmann 2002 early runoff volumes receive disproportionally high pollutant loads and have much higher concentrations compared with subsequent runoff volumes this phenomenon is called the first flush effect deletic 1998 investigating ffe is necessary to identify the site specific characteristics of rainfall and runoff as the mp types may vary depending on the spatial distribution of climate land use and soil content chaudhary et al 2022 the mass first flush ratio mffn represents the amount of cumulative pollutant discharge in the early n of runoff volume jeung et al 2019 lee et al 2004 numerous studies have investigated stormwater runoff of pollutants such as algae metals nitrates phosphorus and suspended solids lee et al 2004 mccarthy et al 2012 mcdonald et al 2022 yang and toor 2017 zgheib et al 2012 however knowledge of the ffe and its influence on mps is limited there was a study that investigated ffe on mps in korea but it was focused on a coastal area rather than an urban stream baek et al 2022 therefore it is required to identify the ffe on mps and the variables influencing mp dynamics in an urban area for the further analysis of important variables related to mps machine learning approaches were adopted in this study several studies have demonstrated that machine learning is a powerful tool for managing large volumes of data jordan and mitchell 2015 szegedy et al 2015 this method can capture principal features using continuous and categorical data sets ongsulee 2017 it is a technique that is currently being developed for studies involving artificial intelligence without the need for explicit programming ngiam and khor 2019 among these methods hierarchical clustering analysis hca is appropriate for extracting interaction features in large datasets murtagh and contreras 2012 while partial least squares regression plsr can identify dependencies and the significance of variables boithias et al 2021 the appearance of mps in the same cluster indicate that they have similar sources use classes fate and transport properties according to previous studies carpenter et al 2018 wang et al 2020 boyacioglu and boyacioglu 2007 applied plsr to investigate similarities in water quality data across various monitoring stations dahlén et al 2000 analyzed water quality parameters including nitrate in groundwater using plsr this study examined the presence of mps in urban stormwater intensive monitoring was conducted in gumi an industrialized city with one of the major industrial complexes in south korea for water samples during wet and dry periods multi component chemical analysis was performed for 326 mps using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms the target substances were selected based on their frequent occurrence in surface waters in korea and included pharmaceutical industrial and pesticide compounds park et al 2018 the present study used hca to estimate the similarity between mps and plsr to identify the environmental variables that affect changes in mps the study aims to 1 analyze the occurrence of mps depending on stream flow regimes 2 quantify the ffe of mps during stormwater runoff events and 3 identify similar mps during rainfall and the factors influencing their variation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area mps were investigated at the sampling site 36 05 21 7 n 128 22 14 9 e which is located in gumi city in the upper part of the nakdong river watershed in korea fig 1 the average precipitation during summer july august and early autumn september was 221 86 mm and the total precipitation volume in 2021 was 1 098 mm meteorological data were sourced from the korean meteorological administration kma gwang pyeong stream our study area serves as a drinking water source for millions of people despite facing significant pollution from numerous manufacturers and large population seo et al 2021 the study area spreads over 20 25 km2 with 48 of the impervious surface covered by residential 18 industrial areas 30 and 52 pervious area including arable land 10 forest and grassland 42 the largest industrial complex in inland area of korea the gumi national industrial complex 1 occupies 10 4 km2 of land having more than 72 000 employees and comprising 718 companies gumi si 2021 most companies are related to textiles and electronics electronics related companies produce semiconductors using industrial chemicals such as pfass in addition a large amount of pharmaceutical pollutants e g metformin and acetaminophen have been reported in this area choi et al 2021b thus chemical exposure has become a concern due to unpredictable discharge through surface runoff diffusion and anthropogenic sources kim et al 2014 müller et al 2020 yong et al 2021 2 2 hydrological monitoring 2 2 1 flow rate measurement the flow rate was estimated using the rating curve approach rantz 1982 which involves calculating the flow rate from direct measurements of hydraulic properties fig 2 a 1 the rating equation is determined based on the water depth which represents the index of the change in streamflow bjerklie et al 2003 conventionally the flow rate q is calculated as follows 1 q w d v a v where w is the stream width m d is the water depth m v is the water velocity m s and a is the streamline cross sectional area m2 in our study the rainfall depth for each event varied from 1 to 70 mm which could cause significant fluctuation in surface runoff woolhiser and goodrich 1988 therefore we developed two types of exponential equations to cover the range of observed water depths the derived rating equations are presented below 2 q h 0 5141 e 2 3072 d d 0 321 m 3 q l 0 00003 e 32 656 d d 0 321 m where qh and ql are the flow rates the water depth was automatically recorded using vented pressure instruments ott orpheus mini ott hydromet at time intervals of 1 and 10 min during the wet and dry seasons respectively for measuring water velocity a microwave water surface current meter mu 2720 mutronics was used during the wet season whereas an automatic impeller flowmeter model 001 valeport was applied during the dry season 2 2 2 baseflow separation baseflow separation has been applied to identify the contributions of hydrological components e g baseflow and stormflow to pollutant emission arnold et al 1995 fig 2 a 1 baseflow comprises streamflow contributed by groundwater and interflow whereas stormflow receives direct flow from the land surface li et al 2018 shuster et al 2008 singh et al 2019 in addition the chemical fate and transport differ between the baseflow and stormflow due to the different flow pathways zhu et al 2019 stormflow can promote pollutant wash off and transport on the surface while baseflow can affect the pollutants movement in the soil and their transport from a point source egodawatta et al 2007 xin et al 2017 for example biagi et al 2022 found that baseflow influences the total yields of phosphate and nitrate while soper et al 2021 reported that a high proportion of the chloride load is delivered through baseflow showing a much higher concentration in baseflow than in runoff flow in this study we adopted the lyne and hollick method based on a digital filter method for the baseflow separation arnold and allen 1999 lyne and hollick 1979 this method has been verified for separating the baseflow and stormflow tularam and ilahee 2008 the following equations were used for the baseflow separation 4 f k β f k 1 1 β 2 y k y k 1 i f f k 0 5 b k y k f k where fk and bk are stormflow and baseflow at the k th time step respectively β is the filter parameter and yk is the sum of the baseflow and stormflow at the k th time step this study assigned 0 925 for β according to previous studies nathan and mcmahon 1990 xie et al 2020 2 3 mps monitoring 2 3 1 mps quantification water quality monitoring was conducted to analyze mps during seven wet events and three dry events from july 5 2021 to september 7 2021 table 1 and fig 2 a 2 water samples were collected using an automated peristaltic sampler as950 hach lange gmbh colorado usa the sample suction inlet was placed 30 cm below the water surface and to prevent cross contamination sampling bottles and lines were pre washed with field samples at the sampling site each sample was collected at the planned time and stored in 1 l high density polyethylene pe bottles only pe bottles were utilized by the autosampler that we equipped to collect water samples nevertheless the sample loss was insignificant as noted by quality assurance and control qa qc for the pretreatment of mps text s2 the composite sampling time interval was adjusted according to weather conditions e g 15 min during rainfall and 1 h for pre or post rainfall analytical replication was applied to evaluate analytical precision but field replicates could not be obtained using this method the collected samples were transferred to a laboratory within 1 day at 4 c in an icebox sample extract pretreatment was performed within 24 h of arrival at the laboratory using the solid phase extraction spe method described in table s3 a multilayer cartridge was applied for spe using oasis hlb 200 mg oasis waters usa isolute env 150 mg international sorbent technology uk strata xcw and strata xaw each 100 mg phenomenex uk this method can capture as many chemicals as possible from a water sample excluding the environmental matrix huntscha et al 2008 the samples 900 ml were pretreated according to the method described by park and jeon 2021 first samples were filtered with a glass fiber filter gf f grade advantec japan and the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 5 using 0 5 m citrate buffer huntscha et al 2008 subsequently 100 µl of the isotope labelled internal standard istd mixture 1 mg l was added each with a mass of 100 ng to each sample using a glass syringe the istd information can be found in the supplementary materials table s2 the samples were loaded into a self packed multilayer cartridge fixed on top of the vacuum manifold after cartridge preconditioning with 5 ml of meoh and 10 ml of deionized water the cartridges were gently dried with n2 gas to minimize chemical reactions during drying the elution sequence was performed using two extraction solutions 6 ml of an alkaline solution etoac etoh 50 50 with 0 5 ammonia and 3 ml of an acidic solution etoac meoh 50 50 with 1 7 formic acid the collected aliquots were concentrated at approximately 0 1 ml in a nitrogen concentrator at 35 c concentrated aliquots were reconstituted with a meoh di water mixture 1 9 v v to a final volume of 1 ml filtered through a 0 2 µm pore size cellulose acetate filter and stored at 4 c until lc hrms analysis blank samples were prepared using ultrapure water and the same analytical method was applied to examine any contamination from the sampling and pretreatment processes the pooled replicate samples n 2 were used for lc hrms analysis due to the absence of field replicate samples concentrations were quantified by averaging the values of the pooled replicates for each mp this study adopted q exactive orbitrap mass spectrometry for hrms analysis using the internal standard method fig 2 b 1 an explanation of the hrms analysis can be found in the supplementary material text s1 2 3 2 evaluation of first flush effect ffe the ffe refers to the phenomenon in which a high fraction of the pollutant load is washed off during the initial part of the stormwater runoff resulting in the transport of accumulated pollutant discharges from the surface to the watershed chaudhary et al 2022 saget et al 1996 in particular for urban and industrial areas ffe analysis is necessary to understand build up and wash off processes of the pollutants perera et al 2019 this study evaluated the ffe of mps detected in more than 75 of samples the normalized cumulative pollutant mass l and the normalized cumulative runoff volume at each time t v were used to estimate the ffe christian et al 2020 fig 2 b 2 normalized cumulative pollutant mass and runoff volume were calculated using the following equations 6 l 0 t c t q t d t m 7 v 0 t q t d t v where c t is the mp concentration q t is the runoff volume at time t and m and v are the total chemical mass and total runoff volume respectively mffn is the ratio used to quantify the ffe which represents the percentage of pollutant loads versus stormwater runoff as a function of storm duration lee et al 2004 this mass ratio is not only useful for estimating the magnitude of the first flush ff but also for supporting a precise definition of the phenomena zeng et al 2019 mffn was calculated as follows 8 m f f n l v where n indicates the percentage of the runoff volume ranging from 0 to 100 for example an mff30 of 2 5 indicates that the first 30 of the discharging volume transported 75 of the pollutant load previous studies have determined that 10 20 and 30 are suitable as the index n to characterize ffe kim et al 2005 kong et al 2021 hence we adopted mff10 mff20 and mff30 as indices to quantify the ffe in addition to ff this study defined the pre storm and post ff periods the pre storm period was defined as the dry period from the beginning of sampling to the rainfall while the post ff period was determined from the time showing the percentage of accumulated discharge flow of more than 30 2 4 relationships between mps 2 4 1 hierarchical clustering analysis hca the hca was adopted to better understand the relationships between each mp in urban stormwater fig 2 c 1 this study included the mps detected in more than 75 of samples for clustering hca is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can display high dimensional data in a low dimensional space which is typically two dimensional murtagh and contreras 2012 it has been widely used to analyze patterns of spatial variations and cluster water quality parameters warsito et al 2021 in a same cluster the parameters had similar properties regarding their sources use classes and fate and transport carpenter et al 2018 wang et al 2020 ikem and adisa 2011 applied ward s and single linkage methods to investigate the similarity between sampling points and revealed different pollution levels for each point this study adopted wards method as this method has been described to be the best among hca methods e g single linkage complete linkage average centroid and ward s method hands and everitt 1987 saraçli et al 2013 langfelder et al 2008 provided a detailed explanation of hca the squared euclidean distance d 2 between mp a and b was calculated using the standardized values as follows kamble and vijay 2011 9 d 2 i 1 n a i b i 2 where ai andbi are the normalized concentrations of mp type a and b respectively and n indicates the total number of samples hca was performed using the statistics and machine learning toolbox in matlab matlab 2020 each mp concentration was normalized based on the min max normalization method to compare the occurrence tendencies of mps tables s1 11 this normalization criterion can prevent misinterpretation caused by data discrepancies e g outliers non detected values and values below the limit of quantification loq were assumed to be zero for min max normalization 2 5 identification of influential variables for mps 2 5 1 partial linear square regression plsr model this study applied the plsr to investigate the influences of environmental factors on mps fig 2 c 2 this is a robust multivariate regression method that combines the advantages of principal component analysis and multiple linear regression salkind 2006 a few linear combinations can be identified using the original x values that represent most of the intrinsic information of the y values shi et al 2013 the plsr projects the data in the direction of maximum covariance by reducing the dimensionality of the data matrix khatri et al 2021 the correlations between the x and y values can be inferred from the weights and regression coefficients of the main explanatory components which is an intriguing feature of plsr yan et al 2013 thus this model is appropriate for identifying the most influential variables affecting the target dependent variable khatri et al 2021 details of the plsr are available in abdi 2010 the plsr model was implemented using the statistics and machine learning toolbox in matlab matlab 2020 seven hydrometeorological variables were inputs for the plsr algorithm the selected hydrometeorological variables were antecedent dry hours adh precipitation p stormflow sf baseflow bf total flow tf water temperature wt and wind speed wd table s16 seven wet events w1 w7 were considered to investigate the impact of these variables on mp occurrence these variables can change over time thus varying the water quality parameters sequentially berne et al 2004 specifically adh was defined as hours with antecedent rainfall less than 1 5 and 10 mm representing adh1 adh5 and adh10 respectively previous studies have determined antecedent dry periods based on different rainfall thresholds 2 5 6 and 10 mm borris et al 2014 li et al 2007 these multiple definitions are required because light precipitation 10 mm has an insufficient wash off effect on surface contaminants borris et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological monitoring meteorological information for wet w1 w7 and dry d1 d3 events is shown in table 1 schmidli and frei 2005 defined a dry event as a sampling period when rainfall is less than 1 mm therefore event d3 was categorized as a dry event owing to its low rainfall depth 0 5 mm among the wet events rainfall depths during w1 w2 and w6 were 66 8 mm 47 5 mm and 37 1 mm respectively indicating that there was heavy rainfall during three events as they had a rainfall intensity higher than 3 33 mm h i e the threshold value of heavy rainfall used by the kma kim et al 2019 the antecedent dry periods varied according to each event and the thresholds of the dry levels event w2 occurred only 10 h after rainfall over 1 0 mm h with an estimated adh1 of 10 otherwise the adh1 values of events w1 and w6 were 40 h and 54 h respectively these discrepancies can result in different patterns of mp occurrence because the pollutant accumulation and discharge can be determined by the durations of antecedent dry periods and rainfall characteristics egodawatta et al 2007 gbeddy et al 2018 the low to moderate rainfall events were w3 5 and w7 with rainfall depths ranging from 1 4 to 9 5 mm specifically event w7 presented the longest antecedent dry period of 120 h i e 6 d the remaining events occurred within a day of rainfall exceeding 1 0 mm h although the rainfall depth in w7 was much lower than that during heavy rainfall events the sufficient dry condition can provide the abundant contaminants accumulated on the urban surface overall the event lasting for the shortest duration was w3 30 min whereas that for the longest duration was w1 15 h in the dry events the maximum rainfall depth was 0 5 mm when the sampling was conducted the mean and standard deviation values of flow rate were low 0 2 m3 s and 0 02 m3 s respectively fig s2 in addition the proportion of baseflow to streamflow was 94 5 on average indicating that most of the streamflow was contributed by baseflow during the dry season the remaining 5 5 might be discharged from lateral flow leakage of water pipelines and direct anthropogenic inputs hamel et al 2013 for the storm events the flow rate varied from 0 1 to 76 45 m3 s with a standard deviation of 5 89 m3 s during events w1 w2 and w6 the surface runoff increased with rainfall fig 3 accounting for 27 0 84 6 and 48 1 of the peak flow rate respectively this indicates that the stormflow contribution to the peak flow was noticeable the stormflow also comprised over 40 of the peak flow rate during events w4 w5 and w7 event w3 showed similar patterns in streamflow during the dry seasons fig 3 this indicates that the volume duration and intensity of rainfall can influence runoff patterns mitchell et al 2001 demonstrated that a short rainfall duration can have a weak effect on streamflow the baseflow showed a tendency to increase with the rainfall volume this can be attributed to an increase in interflow during and after rainfall due to the subsequent enhanced infiltration bannwarth et al 2015 yoo et al 2022 recharge from precipitation can also increase baseflow singh 1968 in addition this site has experienced a backflow problem from the main channel of the nakdong river kang et al 2020 these factors may result in the diversity and complexity of baseflow responses making it difficult to generalize baseflow in urban areas hamel et al 2013 meyer 2005 further studies are required because this study was limited to validating baseflow and interpreting the exact mechanism of baseflow increase during rainfall 3 2 mp monitoring 3 2 1 mps in the urban watershed using quantitative target screening 253 of the 326 target compounds were detected at least once at a concentration above the loq fig s3 based on the qa qc of target screening each calibration curve yielded an r2 value above 0 99 this indicated that the quantitative analysis was successful with good linearity the limit of detection ranged from 0 5 to 5 0 ng l 1 and the loq was lower than 20 0 ng l 1 for the majority of compounds except seven targets table s4 more detailed information on qa qc is included in the supplementary materials text s2 the detected mps during events d1 3 and w1 7 were summarized in table s5 s15 as a result of qualitative compound observations 81 pharmaceuticals and 12 of their transformation products tps 36 8 87 pesticides and 29 of their tps 45 8 and 44 industrial substances 17 4 were detected at least once during sampling campaigns fig s4 in contrast the concentrations of pharmaceuticals e g metformin 34 9 and industrial chemicals accounted for 87 9 of total mean concentrations fig s4 a high proportion of pharmaceuticals has been observed in urban sites governed by human residential and industrial activities kiefer et al 2021 in addition pharmaceutical mps have been considered as human residential markers in urban watersheds because the type of pharmaceutical is dependent on population density and lifestyles in urban areas duan et al 2022 the emission of industrial and pharmaceutical substances implies an unexpected outfall of sewage waters into the stream although the sewage wastewater treatment plant stp wwtp is not located near the sampling site sidhu et al 2013 among target mps 85 compounds was observed with a detection frequency df greater than 75 including pharmaceuticals and their tps 30 industrial chemicals 29 and pesticides and their tps 26 these mps were regarded as persistent pollutants in this study although using solely df has limitations in reflecting the ecotoxicity in urban water reh et al 2013 among the persistent pollutants 11 mps were selected to be the most persistent and contributive pollutants owing to their consistent occurrence df 100 and high proportion 75 in the total mean concentration in this study we defined these mps as dominant mps each and all the 11 mps comprised more than 1 and 75 of the total mean concentration respectively which represents the sum of mean concentrations for each mp mp i concentration number of samples i type of detected mps the dominant mps included metformin met tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tbep 2 benzothiazolesulfonic acid bth benzotriazole btr 2 6 dimethylbenzenesulfonic acid dmbs trimethyl phosphate tmp caffeine cfn hexa methoxymethyl melamine hmmm acetaminophen act 9h hexadecafluorononanoic acid 9h pfna 4 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole mbtr met one of the most popular antidiabetics showed the highest mean concentration mean 13 9 μg l 0 69 59 7 μg l previous studies have frequently observed met with an increasing number of diabetic populations choi et al 2021b park and jeon 2021 met is regarded as a cec owing to its high polarity logp 2 6 and low removal efficiency in wastewater treatment systems golovko et al 2021 tbep showed a high mean concentration mean 4 7 μg l 0 37 25 3 μg l following met tbep can be emitted from industrial complexes specifically from electronic products and residential areas fries and püttmann 2003 masoner et al 2019 regnery and püttmann 2010 it is necessary to monitor this compound because it can cause cancer affect hormones hao et al 2018 raise potential aquatic environment risks park and jeon 2021 and threaten tap water safety li et al 2014 bth mean 2 9 μg l 0 2 21 1 μg l and btr mean 1 5 μg l 0 27 5 2 μg l having potential usage in corrosion inhibitors and ultraviolet stabilizers were detected in every water sample liao et al 2018 moreover bth has been noted to be an oxidative tp of polyether polymer stabilizers making them a potential source of bth fuchte et al 2022 hmmm mean 0 79 μg l 0 002 5 3 μg l and tmp which could have originated from tire related materials were also detected xing et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge no prior observations of hmmm have been reported in korea recent studies have shown that hmmm poses a toxicity risk to aquatic species e g coho salmon possessing the coho mortality signature of a cyclic amine group peter et al 2018 furthermore concerns have been raised regarding its bioaccumulation and potential long term adverse effects tamis et al 2021 act 740 580 ng l is another surrogate mark of human activity in surface water pugajeva et al 2021 act and azithromycin 110 190 ng l have been prescribed for treating coronavirus disease faida losa 2020 hsieh et al 2021 watanabe et al 2021 the lower concentration of azithromycin can be explained by the faster excretion rate of act celle jeanton et al 2014 compared to that of azithromycin bu et al 2020 recent studies have evaluated the role of pharmaceuticals as markers of antibiotic pollution azaroff et al 2020 rodriguez mozaz et al 2020 among the measured unsaturated perfluoro alkyl substances 9h pfna showed the highest concentration and was also detected as a major contaminant in a us street sweep study ahmadireskety et al 2021 since the aquatic environmental risk of these dominant mps has been proven it was valid to evaluate their discharge dynamics the subsequent sections will focus on these dominant species 3 2 2 mp loads based on the stormflow and base flow we quantified the mp loads based on stormflow and baseflows fig s5 the mp loads substantially increased during storm events with a median value of 65 kg d which was much higher than that noted for dry events median 5 2 kg d during the ff period surface runoff e g direct runoff and wash off contributed more to the total mp loads than baseflow e g lateral inflow interflow and groundwater this can be attributed to surface runoff which accounts for 27 to 84 of peak flow for example during event w1 mps load changes were drastic with three stormwater periods pre storm 130 28 g d ff period 7 700 3 400 g d and post ff 5 300 5 300 g d the maximum discharge of pharmaceutical mps maximum 4 100 g d 3 500 1 500 g d for the ff period was obtained at the beginning of the ff period july 5 2021 21 45 tbep an industrial chemical exhibited relatively large amounts of mps 2 300 2 700 g d across all three storm periods as shown in the concentration pattern fig s4 although the peak discharges were delayed for industrial mps both pharmaceutical and industrial mps occurred during the ff period july 5 2021 23 30 owing to this time delay it is not always possible to match discharge of mps with a hydrograph johannessen and parnis 2021 this discrepancy in peak time can be interpreted as mps being discharged from different sources the rising concentration and frequent occurrence df 100 of pharmaceuticals e g met indicated that point sources e g stp wwtp may not be the only source of these mps instead other unknown origins might exist e g pipeline outfall bradley et al 2016 hmmm as the tire derived mp in an urban area johannessen and parnis 2021 peter et al 2020 was discharged as a load of 35 4 of total discharged mps during the ff period 48 20 g d this study measured three folds higher mass discharge for hmmm than the previous report peter et al 2020 owing to the direct road runoff of tire relevant matter into the sampling point to classify the transport mechanisms the mass discharge patterns from the stormflow were compared among three periods pre storm ff and post ff described in section 2 3 2 the average surface runoff loads for the detected mps ranged from 14 15 pre storm to 3 800 1 300 g d ff period 1 2 and 80 9 of the total detected mps were discharged from stormflow during the pre storm and ff periods respectively an increase in mp discharge by surface runoff was observed at every storm event fig s5 among storm events the highest fraction of surface runoff 285 23 kg d 59 3 of total discharged mps was observed for event w2 which was probably caused by the highest rainfall intensity table 1 the proportion of surface runoff was lowest at event w6 7 5 0 5 kg d 11 7 of total discharged mps however met accounted for approximately half of the mass discharge during the event w6 49 2 of the total runoff and 48 7 of surface runoff the different rainfall characteristics e g rainfall intensity duration and depth can lead to discrepancies in stormwater runoff li et al 2015 3 2 3 ff analysis for mps mffn n 10 20 and 30 was calculated to estimate the mass transport by stormwater during the ff period jeung et al 2019 kang et al 2006 the quantification results of mffn and the ff curve are presented in table 2 fig 4 6 and fig s6 7 mffn values of the detected mps were significantly different one way anova p 0 05 for each wet sampling event table 2 average mff30 values with stormflow ranged from 1 24 to 1 83 indicating that 37 2 to 54 9 of total mps were discharged during ff through surface runoff in contrast mff30 by total flow ranged from 1 82 to 2 35 suggesting a simultaneous chemical input not only by surface runoff but also by lateral flow rao et al 2022 among the storm events events w1 mff30 1 38 0 42 and w6 mff30 1 83 0 66 exhibited a stronger ffe than other storm events mff30 of event w7 1 24 0 32 table 2 a higher mffn value indicates stronger ffe occurrence hongbing et al 2009 in event w1 the mff30 of industrial chemicals was calculated as 1 59 indicating 47 7 of total mps to be emitted in 30 of the total volume the mff30 values of pharmaceutical and pesticide compounds were 1 67 and 1 16 respectively the reason for the low mff30 of pesticides is the longer retention time through the permeable layers lefrancq et al 2017 in event w6 the ffe pattern of each chemical usage group i e pharmaceutical industrial and pesticide differed significantly from that of event w1 fig 4 b and 5 b the pharmaceutical mff30 2 08 and pesticide mff30 2 86 groups showed a line above the 1 1 line of the ff curve at w6 specifically fungicides showed higher mff30 values such as orysastrobin 3 26 tricyclazole 1 89 carbendazim 1 37 and tebuconazole 1 38 than those of the other pesticides urban pesticide runoff has been observed batikian et al 2019 but pesticide runoff is highly related to the time of pesticide spraying lefrancq et al 2017 at event w7 weak ffe was observed except in the pesticide group fig s8 b discrepancies across storm events can be caused by spatial and temporal parameters such as land use composition watershed area rainfall intensity rainfall duration and antecedent dry periods fairbairn et al 2018 gupta and saul 1996 li et al 2015 müller et al 2021 peter et al 2020 according to gupta and saul 1996 variations in peak concentrations in a watershed depend on stormwater characteristics zuraini and alias 2020 found that high rainfall intensity results in the wash off of larger amounts of contaminants while taebi and droste 2004 reported that rainfall duration influences ffe results in addition to stormwater relevant parameters e g water discharge volume the chemical composition and dynamics depend on the source and watershed characteristics peter et al 2020 müller et al 2021 conducted time resolved sampling during storm events and found that the wwtp influenced mp occurrence and concentration by locating the sampling sites upstream and downstream of the wwtp for example btr showed a steeper increase in mass fluxes downstream which could be due to the overflow contributed by the combination of sewer system and wastewater müller et al 2021 moreover a prior investigation revealed that site type had a greater effect on pharmaceutical and commercial cecs than event type fairbairn et al 2018 therefore further analysis on various sites is necessary to verify chemical and physical characteristics depending on spatial distribution in future studies we will investigate the influence of hydrological variables on mp types and transport at each site nevertheless some pharmaceuticals showed ffe reproducibility between each storm event such as azithromycin mff30 1 54 2 11 and valsartan mff30 1 46 1 85 which were observed in the ffes of most storm events ffe observations of valsartan and azithromycin have been reported in urban waters in sweden moschet et al 2015 and the usa mohapatra et al 2016 3 2 4 characterization of mps in urban stream water in this study we used hca to identify similarities in mps based on their concentration profiles the number of mps detected varied from 179 to 196 during storm events the hca results for the mps are presented in fig 4 5 and fig s9 13 the groups relevant to ff were clustered for three storm events w1 w6 and w7 during the monitoring of storm events most mps in these events exhibited the ffe with higher concentrations observed in the early part of the storm than in the latter part sansalone and cristina 2004 in event w1 mps clustered into ff and peak flow periods fig 4 most mps in event w1 were classified as cluster w1 a containing 42 substances that showed a rapid increase in concentration during the ff duration this cluster comprised 23 pharmaceuticals 1 tp 7 pesticides and 10 industrial chemicals including met tbep bth dmbs cfn and hmmm the concentration of met pre storm 1 4 μg l post storm 9 1 μg l and tbep pre storm 1 2 μg l post storm 5 9 μg l which were 6 5 and 4 9 times higher than those in the pre storm period respectively other mps in cluster w1 a showed higher concentrations in post storm periods median 1 7 times higher bth and tbep showed similar trends because of their frequent usage in industrial formulations gorga et al 2015 this similarity can be relevant to their usage in the industries tbep as flame retardants regnery and püttmann 2010 and industrial chemicals fries and püttmann 2003 masoner et al 2019 and bth as an oxidative transformation product fuchte et al 2022 these compounds have been considered for their potential hazards causing endocrine disruption and bio amplification owing to their high toxicity neale et al 2020a previšić et al 2021 to evaluate the ffe of the chemicals grouped by hca the ff curves for w1 a were presented in fig 4 ffe was observed in all samples except for one chemical i e isophorone cluster w1 a was a chemical group that showed the maximum concentration during ff therefore a slight increase in mp load was observed owing to the decrease in concentration after ff the agreement between the clustering and ffe results indicates that hca is suitable for identifying the mps contributed by ffe cluster w1 b did not exhibit an ffe showing an incremental trend in mp concentration after ff eighteen compounds were classified in this cluster comprising 14 pesticides 3 industrial chemicals and 1 pharmaceutical in this cluster most substances were related to agricultural activities which could be interpreted as the influence of precipitation on farmland and the long retention times of agricultural compounds chen et al 2019 all chemicals grouped under cluster w1 b showed values lower than the 1 1 line in the ff curves indicating that the σmp load increases according to the discharge flow for event w6 most of the substances were included in clusters w6 a and w6 b which are related to the ff phenomena fig 5 this cluster consisted of 60 compounds including six major contaminants met btr cfn hmmm 9h pfna and mbtr in terms of usage class composition this cluster had a higher fraction of pharmaceuticals and their tps comprising from highest to lowest proportions 24 pharmaceuticals and 3 tps 45 0 followed by 18 industrial chemicals 30 0 and 11 pesticides and 4 tps 25 0 only 18 compounds cluster w6 a showed the maximum concentration during ff and 42 compounds cluster w6 b showed the maximum concentration before rain until ff according to the concept of ff curves it appears that wash off would contribute to cluster w6 b at event w6 btr and mbtr showed different profiles compared to event w1 which can be explained by the variable sources of these chemicals parajulee et al 2017a and the hydrodynamics of each event cluster w6 c presented high concentrations after ff and included 11 pesticides 3 pesticide tps 6 pharmaceuticals 1 pharmaceutical tp and 6 industrial substances through w1 and w6 the pesticides e g tebuconazole and carbendazim consistently showed a patterns of increasing concentration per unit volume discharged during event w7 cluster w7 a contained 31 compounds fig s8 in dry events e g events d1 d2 and d3 no hca cluster showed consistent mp profiles fig s9 suggesting that the hydrometeorological variables can affect the appearance of pollutants ellis 2006 3 3 relationship between environmental variables and mps the present study adopted plsr model to identify the factors influencing the dominant mps variable importance on projection vip scores were estimated for each predictor presented in table s16 among them sf10 sf60 adh1 adh5 and adh10 had mean vip scores greater than 1 0 fig 7 a this indicates that the detected mps with high concentrations were significantly correlated with the hydrological features of the stormflow and antecedent dry period numerous studies have investigated the effects of rainfall and surface runoff on increases in chemical concentrations in particular adh has been determined as an influencing factor because dry conditions cause the accumulation of chemical substances on urban surfaces which could potentially be flushed into aquatic systems hewitt and rashed 1992 parajulee et al 2017b moreover launay et al 2016 and burant et al 2018 have demonstrated that stormwater and surface runoff can induce pollutants loads including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons opfrs and ppcps these trace organic contaminants had significantly high concentrations during urban rainfall burant et al 2018 in contrast the occurrence of hmmm and tmp was affected by water temperature with vip scores greater than 1 0 for hmmm and tmp fig 7 e f this suggests that the water temperature is an influential factor in the occurrence of these mps previous studies have also described the influence of temperature on mp concentrations bacaloni et al 2008 ebrahimzadeh et al 2021 fries and püttmann 2003 however the plsr model cannot eludidate the physicochemical mechanisms between these variables and mps thus it is necessary to apply a process based model e g storm water management model swmm to identify the exact mechanism our plsr model used the coefficient of determination r2 as an indicator of model reliability the model yielded r2 values of 0 8 for btr 0 6 for mbtr and 0 5 for bth table s17 previous studies have suggested using this coefficient as a standard metric to evaluate regression analysis chicco et al 2021 also described good results for statistical analysis with an r2 greater than 0 4 although the model presented a low prediction with an r2 value of less than 0 6 the regression model can explain the factors influencing the prediction sandoval et al 2013 based on these reliable results we investigated the driving factors of the btr mbtr and bth among the predictors sf adh and bf were the factors that contributed the most to the btr and mbtr fig 7 b c beckers et al 2018 revealed that btr and mbtr are frequently detected in the surface water of urban areas otherwise bth was influenced less by adh and more by sf than their effect to btr and mbtr fig 7 d this can be derived from the variation in concentrations discharged from the effluents that can increase during antecedent dry periods or decrease with increasing rainfall manka et al 2016 neale et al 2020b 4 conclusion in this study we explored changes in the concentration and occurrence of micropollutants mps in an urban catchment area intensive stormwater monitoring was conducted and 253 target compounds were detected through high resolution mass spectrometry hierarchical clustering analysis hca was used to estimate the similarity between mps and partial least squares regression plsr was used to identify the factors influencing mp concentration the main findings of this study are as follows 1 among the observed target compounds 85 mps were persistently detected in more than 75 of samples and the most dominant mps were metformin tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate 2 benzothiazolesulfonic acid benzotriazole 2 6 dimethylbenzenesulfonic acid trimethyl phosphate caffeine hexa methoxymethyl melamine acetaminophen 9h hexadecafluorononanoic acid and 9h hexadecafluorononanoic acid these 11 mps were detected in every sample and comprised 75 of the total mp concentration 2 pharmaceutical and pesticide compounds showed a high first flush effect ffe with the mass first flush mff ratio above 1 5 indicating that these mps were discharged from surface runoff and urban pipelines during rainfall the industrial compounds presented moderate ffe by stormwater owing to the absence of direct effluents from the sewage and waste water treatment plants 3 the plsr results indicated that antecedent dry hours adh and stormflow sf were the main contributors to the presence of mps and changes in concentration this might be interpreted from the effects of adh and sf on pollutants adh induced the accumulation of mps on the surface and sf promoted the wash off of mps via stormwater this study demonstrated the applicability of high resolution monitoring and machine learning for identifying the factors influencing mp variability in response to hydrological changes these findings could be informative for designing stormwater management plans and preventing mp hazards on aquatic environments however the following limitations need to be addressed to understand the transport of mps during urban storm events 1 generalizing the hydrological changes and mp occurrence depending on the spatial characteristics of stormwater and 2 identifying the exact physicochemical mechanism between the hydrological variables and mps hence future research will require data acquisition from various sites and the use of process based models e g swmm to investigate the influence of land use patterns and hydrologic variables on mps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14885,urban rainfall events can lead to the runoff of pollutants including industrial pesticide and pharmaceutical chemicals transporting micropollutants mps into water systems can harm both human health and aquatic species therefore it is necessary to investigate the dynamics of mps during rainfall events however few studies have examined mps during rainfall events due to the high analytical expenses and extensive spatiotemporal variability few studies have investigated the occurrence patterns of mps and factors that influence their transport such as rainfall duration antecedent dry periods and variations in streamflow moreover while there have been many analyses of nutrients suspended solids and heavy metals during the first flush effect ffe studies on the transport of mps during ffe are insufficient this study aimed to identify the dynamics of mps and ffe in an urban catchment using high resolution monitoring and machine learning methods hierarchical clustering analysis and partial least squares regression plsr were implemented to estimate the similarity between each mp and identify the factors influencing their transport during rainfall events eleven dominant mps comprised 75 of the total mp concentration and had a 100 detection frequency during rainfall events pesticides and pharmaceutical mps showed a higher ffe than industrial mps moreover the initial 30 of the runoff volume contained 78 0 of pesticide and 50 1 of pharmaceutical substances for events w1 july 5 to july 6 2021 and w6 august 31 to september 1 2021 respectively the plsr model suggested that stormflow m3 s and the duration of antecedent dry hours h significantly influenced mp dynamics yielding the variable importance on projection scores greater than 1 0 hence our findings indicate that mps in urban waters should be managed by considering ffe graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutant high resolution mass spectrometry first flush effects hierarchical clustering analysis partial least squares regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction continuous urbanization and industrialization have led to an increase in stormwater runoff which has resulted in the discharge of heavy metals nutrients and organic chemicals barbosa et al 2012 kayhanian et al 2012 micropollutants mps including pharmaceutical industrial and pesticides are commonly found in these streams luo et al 2014 these pollutants are toxic to aquatic organisms and have been linked to the deaths of adult coho salmon du et al 2017 fairbairn et al 2018 peter et al 2018 furthermore the rapid growth of new industries and the use of advanced pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps releasing contaminants of emerging concern cec such as poly and per fluorinated alkyl substances pfass and organophosphate flame retardants opfrs into urban watersheds choi et al 2021b deere et al 2021 exposure to these contaminants can affect the endocrine systems of organisms leading to adverse health effects ebele et al 2017 studies have classified pfass as possibly carcinogenic to humans choi et al 2021a iarc 2020 and opfrs have been shown to be neurotoxic and carcinogenic to laboratory animals lee et al 2016 takahashi et al 2012 given the potential hazards of mps to human health and ecological systems it is crucial to understand their sources and transport mechanisms to mitigate the risks they pose to receiving water in an urban catchment stormwater runoff is a source of chemical discharge into stream water brezonik and stadelmann 2002 early runoff volumes receive disproportionally high pollutant loads and have much higher concentrations compared with subsequent runoff volumes this phenomenon is called the first flush effect deletic 1998 investigating ffe is necessary to identify the site specific characteristics of rainfall and runoff as the mp types may vary depending on the spatial distribution of climate land use and soil content chaudhary et al 2022 the mass first flush ratio mffn represents the amount of cumulative pollutant discharge in the early n of runoff volume jeung et al 2019 lee et al 2004 numerous studies have investigated stormwater runoff of pollutants such as algae metals nitrates phosphorus and suspended solids lee et al 2004 mccarthy et al 2012 mcdonald et al 2022 yang and toor 2017 zgheib et al 2012 however knowledge of the ffe and its influence on mps is limited there was a study that investigated ffe on mps in korea but it was focused on a coastal area rather than an urban stream baek et al 2022 therefore it is required to identify the ffe on mps and the variables influencing mp dynamics in an urban area for the further analysis of important variables related to mps machine learning approaches were adopted in this study several studies have demonstrated that machine learning is a powerful tool for managing large volumes of data jordan and mitchell 2015 szegedy et al 2015 this method can capture principal features using continuous and categorical data sets ongsulee 2017 it is a technique that is currently being developed for studies involving artificial intelligence without the need for explicit programming ngiam and khor 2019 among these methods hierarchical clustering analysis hca is appropriate for extracting interaction features in large datasets murtagh and contreras 2012 while partial least squares regression plsr can identify dependencies and the significance of variables boithias et al 2021 the appearance of mps in the same cluster indicate that they have similar sources use classes fate and transport properties according to previous studies carpenter et al 2018 wang et al 2020 boyacioglu and boyacioglu 2007 applied plsr to investigate similarities in water quality data across various monitoring stations dahlén et al 2000 analyzed water quality parameters including nitrate in groundwater using plsr this study examined the presence of mps in urban stormwater intensive monitoring was conducted in gumi an industrialized city with one of the major industrial complexes in south korea for water samples during wet and dry periods multi component chemical analysis was performed for 326 mps using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms the target substances were selected based on their frequent occurrence in surface waters in korea and included pharmaceutical industrial and pesticide compounds park et al 2018 the present study used hca to estimate the similarity between mps and plsr to identify the environmental variables that affect changes in mps the study aims to 1 analyze the occurrence of mps depending on stream flow regimes 2 quantify the ffe of mps during stormwater runoff events and 3 identify similar mps during rainfall and the factors influencing their variation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area mps were investigated at the sampling site 36 05 21 7 n 128 22 14 9 e which is located in gumi city in the upper part of the nakdong river watershed in korea fig 1 the average precipitation during summer july august and early autumn september was 221 86 mm and the total precipitation volume in 2021 was 1 098 mm meteorological data were sourced from the korean meteorological administration kma gwang pyeong stream our study area serves as a drinking water source for millions of people despite facing significant pollution from numerous manufacturers and large population seo et al 2021 the study area spreads over 20 25 km2 with 48 of the impervious surface covered by residential 18 industrial areas 30 and 52 pervious area including arable land 10 forest and grassland 42 the largest industrial complex in inland area of korea the gumi national industrial complex 1 occupies 10 4 km2 of land having more than 72 000 employees and comprising 718 companies gumi si 2021 most companies are related to textiles and electronics electronics related companies produce semiconductors using industrial chemicals such as pfass in addition a large amount of pharmaceutical pollutants e g metformin and acetaminophen have been reported in this area choi et al 2021b thus chemical exposure has become a concern due to unpredictable discharge through surface runoff diffusion and anthropogenic sources kim et al 2014 müller et al 2020 yong et al 2021 2 2 hydrological monitoring 2 2 1 flow rate measurement the flow rate was estimated using the rating curve approach rantz 1982 which involves calculating the flow rate from direct measurements of hydraulic properties fig 2 a 1 the rating equation is determined based on the water depth which represents the index of the change in streamflow bjerklie et al 2003 conventionally the flow rate q is calculated as follows 1 q w d v a v where w is the stream width m d is the water depth m v is the water velocity m s and a is the streamline cross sectional area m2 in our study the rainfall depth for each event varied from 1 to 70 mm which could cause significant fluctuation in surface runoff woolhiser and goodrich 1988 therefore we developed two types of exponential equations to cover the range of observed water depths the derived rating equations are presented below 2 q h 0 5141 e 2 3072 d d 0 321 m 3 q l 0 00003 e 32 656 d d 0 321 m where qh and ql are the flow rates the water depth was automatically recorded using vented pressure instruments ott orpheus mini ott hydromet at time intervals of 1 and 10 min during the wet and dry seasons respectively for measuring water velocity a microwave water surface current meter mu 2720 mutronics was used during the wet season whereas an automatic impeller flowmeter model 001 valeport was applied during the dry season 2 2 2 baseflow separation baseflow separation has been applied to identify the contributions of hydrological components e g baseflow and stormflow to pollutant emission arnold et al 1995 fig 2 a 1 baseflow comprises streamflow contributed by groundwater and interflow whereas stormflow receives direct flow from the land surface li et al 2018 shuster et al 2008 singh et al 2019 in addition the chemical fate and transport differ between the baseflow and stormflow due to the different flow pathways zhu et al 2019 stormflow can promote pollutant wash off and transport on the surface while baseflow can affect the pollutants movement in the soil and their transport from a point source egodawatta et al 2007 xin et al 2017 for example biagi et al 2022 found that baseflow influences the total yields of phosphate and nitrate while soper et al 2021 reported that a high proportion of the chloride load is delivered through baseflow showing a much higher concentration in baseflow than in runoff flow in this study we adopted the lyne and hollick method based on a digital filter method for the baseflow separation arnold and allen 1999 lyne and hollick 1979 this method has been verified for separating the baseflow and stormflow tularam and ilahee 2008 the following equations were used for the baseflow separation 4 f k β f k 1 1 β 2 y k y k 1 i f f k 0 5 b k y k f k where fk and bk are stormflow and baseflow at the k th time step respectively β is the filter parameter and yk is the sum of the baseflow and stormflow at the k th time step this study assigned 0 925 for β according to previous studies nathan and mcmahon 1990 xie et al 2020 2 3 mps monitoring 2 3 1 mps quantification water quality monitoring was conducted to analyze mps during seven wet events and three dry events from july 5 2021 to september 7 2021 table 1 and fig 2 a 2 water samples were collected using an automated peristaltic sampler as950 hach lange gmbh colorado usa the sample suction inlet was placed 30 cm below the water surface and to prevent cross contamination sampling bottles and lines were pre washed with field samples at the sampling site each sample was collected at the planned time and stored in 1 l high density polyethylene pe bottles only pe bottles were utilized by the autosampler that we equipped to collect water samples nevertheless the sample loss was insignificant as noted by quality assurance and control qa qc for the pretreatment of mps text s2 the composite sampling time interval was adjusted according to weather conditions e g 15 min during rainfall and 1 h for pre or post rainfall analytical replication was applied to evaluate analytical precision but field replicates could not be obtained using this method the collected samples were transferred to a laboratory within 1 day at 4 c in an icebox sample extract pretreatment was performed within 24 h of arrival at the laboratory using the solid phase extraction spe method described in table s3 a multilayer cartridge was applied for spe using oasis hlb 200 mg oasis waters usa isolute env 150 mg international sorbent technology uk strata xcw and strata xaw each 100 mg phenomenex uk this method can capture as many chemicals as possible from a water sample excluding the environmental matrix huntscha et al 2008 the samples 900 ml were pretreated according to the method described by park and jeon 2021 first samples were filtered with a glass fiber filter gf f grade advantec japan and the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 5 using 0 5 m citrate buffer huntscha et al 2008 subsequently 100 µl of the isotope labelled internal standard istd mixture 1 mg l was added each with a mass of 100 ng to each sample using a glass syringe the istd information can be found in the supplementary materials table s2 the samples were loaded into a self packed multilayer cartridge fixed on top of the vacuum manifold after cartridge preconditioning with 5 ml of meoh and 10 ml of deionized water the cartridges were gently dried with n2 gas to minimize chemical reactions during drying the elution sequence was performed using two extraction solutions 6 ml of an alkaline solution etoac etoh 50 50 with 0 5 ammonia and 3 ml of an acidic solution etoac meoh 50 50 with 1 7 formic acid the collected aliquots were concentrated at approximately 0 1 ml in a nitrogen concentrator at 35 c concentrated aliquots were reconstituted with a meoh di water mixture 1 9 v v to a final volume of 1 ml filtered through a 0 2 µm pore size cellulose acetate filter and stored at 4 c until lc hrms analysis blank samples were prepared using ultrapure water and the same analytical method was applied to examine any contamination from the sampling and pretreatment processes the pooled replicate samples n 2 were used for lc hrms analysis due to the absence of field replicate samples concentrations were quantified by averaging the values of the pooled replicates for each mp this study adopted q exactive orbitrap mass spectrometry for hrms analysis using the internal standard method fig 2 b 1 an explanation of the hrms analysis can be found in the supplementary material text s1 2 3 2 evaluation of first flush effect ffe the ffe refers to the phenomenon in which a high fraction of the pollutant load is washed off during the initial part of the stormwater runoff resulting in the transport of accumulated pollutant discharges from the surface to the watershed chaudhary et al 2022 saget et al 1996 in particular for urban and industrial areas ffe analysis is necessary to understand build up and wash off processes of the pollutants perera et al 2019 this study evaluated the ffe of mps detected in more than 75 of samples the normalized cumulative pollutant mass l and the normalized cumulative runoff volume at each time t v were used to estimate the ffe christian et al 2020 fig 2 b 2 normalized cumulative pollutant mass and runoff volume were calculated using the following equations 6 l 0 t c t q t d t m 7 v 0 t q t d t v where c t is the mp concentration q t is the runoff volume at time t and m and v are the total chemical mass and total runoff volume respectively mffn is the ratio used to quantify the ffe which represents the percentage of pollutant loads versus stormwater runoff as a function of storm duration lee et al 2004 this mass ratio is not only useful for estimating the magnitude of the first flush ff but also for supporting a precise definition of the phenomena zeng et al 2019 mffn was calculated as follows 8 m f f n l v where n indicates the percentage of the runoff volume ranging from 0 to 100 for example an mff30 of 2 5 indicates that the first 30 of the discharging volume transported 75 of the pollutant load previous studies have determined that 10 20 and 30 are suitable as the index n to characterize ffe kim et al 2005 kong et al 2021 hence we adopted mff10 mff20 and mff30 as indices to quantify the ffe in addition to ff this study defined the pre storm and post ff periods the pre storm period was defined as the dry period from the beginning of sampling to the rainfall while the post ff period was determined from the time showing the percentage of accumulated discharge flow of more than 30 2 4 relationships between mps 2 4 1 hierarchical clustering analysis hca the hca was adopted to better understand the relationships between each mp in urban stormwater fig 2 c 1 this study included the mps detected in more than 75 of samples for clustering hca is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can display high dimensional data in a low dimensional space which is typically two dimensional murtagh and contreras 2012 it has been widely used to analyze patterns of spatial variations and cluster water quality parameters warsito et al 2021 in a same cluster the parameters had similar properties regarding their sources use classes and fate and transport carpenter et al 2018 wang et al 2020 ikem and adisa 2011 applied ward s and single linkage methods to investigate the similarity between sampling points and revealed different pollution levels for each point this study adopted wards method as this method has been described to be the best among hca methods e g single linkage complete linkage average centroid and ward s method hands and everitt 1987 saraçli et al 2013 langfelder et al 2008 provided a detailed explanation of hca the squared euclidean distance d 2 between mp a and b was calculated using the standardized values as follows kamble and vijay 2011 9 d 2 i 1 n a i b i 2 where ai andbi are the normalized concentrations of mp type a and b respectively and n indicates the total number of samples hca was performed using the statistics and machine learning toolbox in matlab matlab 2020 each mp concentration was normalized based on the min max normalization method to compare the occurrence tendencies of mps tables s1 11 this normalization criterion can prevent misinterpretation caused by data discrepancies e g outliers non detected values and values below the limit of quantification loq were assumed to be zero for min max normalization 2 5 identification of influential variables for mps 2 5 1 partial linear square regression plsr model this study applied the plsr to investigate the influences of environmental factors on mps fig 2 c 2 this is a robust multivariate regression method that combines the advantages of principal component analysis and multiple linear regression salkind 2006 a few linear combinations can be identified using the original x values that represent most of the intrinsic information of the y values shi et al 2013 the plsr projects the data in the direction of maximum covariance by reducing the dimensionality of the data matrix khatri et al 2021 the correlations between the x and y values can be inferred from the weights and regression coefficients of the main explanatory components which is an intriguing feature of plsr yan et al 2013 thus this model is appropriate for identifying the most influential variables affecting the target dependent variable khatri et al 2021 details of the plsr are available in abdi 2010 the plsr model was implemented using the statistics and machine learning toolbox in matlab matlab 2020 seven hydrometeorological variables were inputs for the plsr algorithm the selected hydrometeorological variables were antecedent dry hours adh precipitation p stormflow sf baseflow bf total flow tf water temperature wt and wind speed wd table s16 seven wet events w1 w7 were considered to investigate the impact of these variables on mp occurrence these variables can change over time thus varying the water quality parameters sequentially berne et al 2004 specifically adh was defined as hours with antecedent rainfall less than 1 5 and 10 mm representing adh1 adh5 and adh10 respectively previous studies have determined antecedent dry periods based on different rainfall thresholds 2 5 6 and 10 mm borris et al 2014 li et al 2007 these multiple definitions are required because light precipitation 10 mm has an insufficient wash off effect on surface contaminants borris et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological monitoring meteorological information for wet w1 w7 and dry d1 d3 events is shown in table 1 schmidli and frei 2005 defined a dry event as a sampling period when rainfall is less than 1 mm therefore event d3 was categorized as a dry event owing to its low rainfall depth 0 5 mm among the wet events rainfall depths during w1 w2 and w6 were 66 8 mm 47 5 mm and 37 1 mm respectively indicating that there was heavy rainfall during three events as they had a rainfall intensity higher than 3 33 mm h i e the threshold value of heavy rainfall used by the kma kim et al 2019 the antecedent dry periods varied according to each event and the thresholds of the dry levels event w2 occurred only 10 h after rainfall over 1 0 mm h with an estimated adh1 of 10 otherwise the adh1 values of events w1 and w6 were 40 h and 54 h respectively these discrepancies can result in different patterns of mp occurrence because the pollutant accumulation and discharge can be determined by the durations of antecedent dry periods and rainfall characteristics egodawatta et al 2007 gbeddy et al 2018 the low to moderate rainfall events were w3 5 and w7 with rainfall depths ranging from 1 4 to 9 5 mm specifically event w7 presented the longest antecedent dry period of 120 h i e 6 d the remaining events occurred within a day of rainfall exceeding 1 0 mm h although the rainfall depth in w7 was much lower than that during heavy rainfall events the sufficient dry condition can provide the abundant contaminants accumulated on the urban surface overall the event lasting for the shortest duration was w3 30 min whereas that for the longest duration was w1 15 h in the dry events the maximum rainfall depth was 0 5 mm when the sampling was conducted the mean and standard deviation values of flow rate were low 0 2 m3 s and 0 02 m3 s respectively fig s2 in addition the proportion of baseflow to streamflow was 94 5 on average indicating that most of the streamflow was contributed by baseflow during the dry season the remaining 5 5 might be discharged from lateral flow leakage of water pipelines and direct anthropogenic inputs hamel et al 2013 for the storm events the flow rate varied from 0 1 to 76 45 m3 s with a standard deviation of 5 89 m3 s during events w1 w2 and w6 the surface runoff increased with rainfall fig 3 accounting for 27 0 84 6 and 48 1 of the peak flow rate respectively this indicates that the stormflow contribution to the peak flow was noticeable the stormflow also comprised over 40 of the peak flow rate during events w4 w5 and w7 event w3 showed similar patterns in streamflow during the dry seasons fig 3 this indicates that the volume duration and intensity of rainfall can influence runoff patterns mitchell et al 2001 demonstrated that a short rainfall duration can have a weak effect on streamflow the baseflow showed a tendency to increase with the rainfall volume this can be attributed to an increase in interflow during and after rainfall due to the subsequent enhanced infiltration bannwarth et al 2015 yoo et al 2022 recharge from precipitation can also increase baseflow singh 1968 in addition this site has experienced a backflow problem from the main channel of the nakdong river kang et al 2020 these factors may result in the diversity and complexity of baseflow responses making it difficult to generalize baseflow in urban areas hamel et al 2013 meyer 2005 further studies are required because this study was limited to validating baseflow and interpreting the exact mechanism of baseflow increase during rainfall 3 2 mp monitoring 3 2 1 mps in the urban watershed using quantitative target screening 253 of the 326 target compounds were detected at least once at a concentration above the loq fig s3 based on the qa qc of target screening each calibration curve yielded an r2 value above 0 99 this indicated that the quantitative analysis was successful with good linearity the limit of detection ranged from 0 5 to 5 0 ng l 1 and the loq was lower than 20 0 ng l 1 for the majority of compounds except seven targets table s4 more detailed information on qa qc is included in the supplementary materials text s2 the detected mps during events d1 3 and w1 7 were summarized in table s5 s15 as a result of qualitative compound observations 81 pharmaceuticals and 12 of their transformation products tps 36 8 87 pesticides and 29 of their tps 45 8 and 44 industrial substances 17 4 were detected at least once during sampling campaigns fig s4 in contrast the concentrations of pharmaceuticals e g metformin 34 9 and industrial chemicals accounted for 87 9 of total mean concentrations fig s4 a high proportion of pharmaceuticals has been observed in urban sites governed by human residential and industrial activities kiefer et al 2021 in addition pharmaceutical mps have been considered as human residential markers in urban watersheds because the type of pharmaceutical is dependent on population density and lifestyles in urban areas duan et al 2022 the emission of industrial and pharmaceutical substances implies an unexpected outfall of sewage waters into the stream although the sewage wastewater treatment plant stp wwtp is not located near the sampling site sidhu et al 2013 among target mps 85 compounds was observed with a detection frequency df greater than 75 including pharmaceuticals and their tps 30 industrial chemicals 29 and pesticides and their tps 26 these mps were regarded as persistent pollutants in this study although using solely df has limitations in reflecting the ecotoxicity in urban water reh et al 2013 among the persistent pollutants 11 mps were selected to be the most persistent and contributive pollutants owing to their consistent occurrence df 100 and high proportion 75 in the total mean concentration in this study we defined these mps as dominant mps each and all the 11 mps comprised more than 1 and 75 of the total mean concentration respectively which represents the sum of mean concentrations for each mp mp i concentration number of samples i type of detected mps the dominant mps included metformin met tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tbep 2 benzothiazolesulfonic acid bth benzotriazole btr 2 6

korea recent studies have shown that hmmm poses a toxicity risk to aquatic species e g coho salmon possessing the coho mortality signature of a cyclic amine group peter et al 2018 furthermore concerns have been raised regarding its bioaccumulation and potential long term adverse effects tamis et al 2021 act 740 580 ng l is another surrogate mark of human activity in surface water pugajeva et al 2021 act and azithromycin 110 190 ng l have been prescribed for treating coronavirus disease faida losa 2020 hsieh et al 2021 watanabe et al 2021 the lower concentration of azithromycin can be explained by the faster excretion rate of act celle jeanton et al 2014 compared to that of azithromycin bu et al 2020 recent studies have evaluated the role of pharmaceuticals as markers of antibiotic pollution azaroff et al 2020 rodriguez mozaz et al 2020 among the measured unsaturated perfluoro alkyl substances 9h pfna showed the highest concentration and was also detected as a major contaminant in a us street sweep study ahmadireskety et al 2021 since the aquatic environmental risk of these dominant mps has been proven it was valid to evaluate their discharge dynamics the subsequent sections will focus on these dominant species 3 2 2 mp loads based on the stormflow and base flow we quantified the mp loads based on stormflow and baseflows fig s5 the mp loads substantially increased during storm events with a median value of 65 kg d which was much higher than that noted for dry events median 5 2 kg d during the ff period surface runoff e g direct runoff and wash off contributed more to the total mp loads than baseflow e g lateral inflow interflow and groundwater this can be attributed to surface runoff which accounts for 27 to 84 of peak flow for example during event w1 mps load changes were drastic with three stormwater periods pre storm 130 28 g d ff period 7 700 3 400 g d and post ff 5 300 5 300 g d the maximum discharge of pharmaceutical mps maximum 4 100 g d 3 500 1 500 g d for the ff period was obtained at the beginning of the ff period july 5 2021 21 45 tbep an industrial chemical exhibited relatively large amounts of mps 2 300 2 700 g d across all three storm periods as shown in the concentration pattern fig s4 although the peak discharges were delayed for industrial mps both pharmaceutical and industrial mps occurred during the ff period july 5 2021 23 30 owing to this time delay it is not always possible to match discharge of mps with a hydrograph johannessen and parnis 2021 this discrepancy in peak time can be interpreted as mps being discharged from different sources the rising concentration and frequent occurrence df 100 of pharmaceuticals e g met indicated that point sources e g stp wwtp may not be the only source of these mps instead other unknown origins might exist e g pipeline outfall bradley et al 2016 hmmm as the tire derived mp in an urban area johannessen and parnis 2021 peter et al 2020 was discharged as a load of 35 4 of total discharged mps during the ff period 48 20 g d this study measured three folds higher mass discharge for hmmm than the previous report peter et al 2020 owing to the direct road runoff of tire relevant matter into the sampling point to classify the transport mechanisms the mass discharge patterns from the stormflow were compared among three periods pre storm ff and post ff described in section 2 3 2 the average surface runoff loads for the detected mps ranged from 14 15 pre storm to 3 800 1 300 g d ff period 1 2 and 80 9 of the total detected mps were discharged from stormflow during the pre storm and ff periods respectively an increase in mp discharge by surface runoff was observed at every storm event fig s5 among storm events the highest fraction of surface runoff 285 23 kg d 59 3 of total discharged mps was observed for event w2 which was probably caused by the highest rainfall intensity table 1 the proportion of surface runoff was lowest at event w6 7 5 0 5 kg d 11 7 of total discharged mps however met accounted for approximately half of the mass discharge during the event w6 49 2 of the total runoff and 48 7 of surface runoff the different rainfall characteristics e g rainfall intensity duration and depth can lead to discrepancies in stormwater runoff li et al 2015 3 2 3 ff analysis for mps mffn n 10 20 and 30 was calculated to estimate the mass transport by stormwater during the ff period jeung et al 2019 kang et al 2006 the quantification results of mffn and the ff curve are presented in table 2 fig 4 6 and fig s6 7 mffn values of the detected mps were significantly different one way anova p 0 05 for each wet sampling event table 2 average mff30 values with stormflow ranged from 1 24 to 1 83 indicating that 37 2 to 54 9 of total mps were discharged during ff through surface runoff in contrast mff30 by total flow ranged from 1 82 to 2 35 suggesting a simultaneous chemical input not only by surface runoff but also by lateral flow rao et al 2022 among the storm events events w1 mff30 1 38 0 42 and w6 mff30 1 83 0 66 exhibited a stronger ffe than other storm events mff30 of event w7 1 24 0 32 table 2 a higher mffn value indicates stronger ffe occurrence hongbing et al 2009 in event w1 the mff30 of industrial chemicals was calculated as 1 59 indicating 47 7 of total mps to be emitted in 30 of the total volume the mff30 values of pharmaceutical and pesticide compounds were 1 67 and 1 16 respectively the reason for the low mff30 of pesticides is the longer retention time through the permeable layers lefrancq et al 2017 in event w6 the ffe pattern of each chemical usage group i e pharmaceutical industrial and pesticide differed significantly from that of event w1 fig 4 b and 5 b the pharmaceutical mff30 2 08 and pesticide mff30 2 86 groups showed a line above the 1 1 line of the ff curve at w6 specifically fungicides showed higher mff30 values such as orysastrobin 3 26 tricyclazole 1 89 carbendazim 1 37 and tebuconazole 1 38 than those of the other pesticides urban pesticide runoff has been observed batikian et al 2019 but pesticide runoff is highly related to the time of pesticide spraying lefrancq et al 2017 at event w7 weak ffe was observed except in the pesticide group fig s8 b discrepancies across storm events can be caused by spatial and temporal parameters such as land use composition watershed area rainfall intensity rainfall duration and antecedent dry periods fairbairn et al 2018 gupta and saul 1996 li et al 2015 müller et al 2021 peter et al 2020 according to gupta and saul 1996 variations in peak concentrations in a watershed depend on stormwater characteristics zuraini and alias 2020 found that high rainfall intensity results in the wash off of larger amounts of contaminants while taebi and droste 2004 reported that rainfall duration influences ffe results in addition to stormwater relevant parameters e g water discharge volume the chemical composition and dynamics depend on the source and watershed characteristics peter et al 2020 müller et al 2021 conducted time resolved sampling during storm events and found that the wwtp influenced mp occurrence and concentration by locating the sampling sites upstream and downstream of the wwtp for example btr showed a steeper increase in mass fluxes downstream which could be due to the overflow contributed by the combination of sewer system and wastewater müller et al 2021 moreover a prior investigation revealed that site type had a greater effect on pharmaceutical and commercial cecs than event type fairbairn et al 2018 therefore further analysis on various sites is necessary to verify chemical and physical characteristics depending on spatial distribution in future studies we will investigate the influence of hydrological variables on mp types and transport at each site nevertheless some pharmaceuticals showed ffe reproducibility between each storm event such as azithromycin mff30 1 54 2 11 and valsartan mff30 1 46 1 85 which were observed in the ffes of most storm events ffe observations of valsartan and azithromycin have been reported in urban waters in sweden moschet et al 2015 and the usa mohapatra et al 2016 3 2 4 characterization of mps in urban stream water in this study we used hca to identify similarities in mps based on their concentration profiles the number of mps detected varied from 179 to 196 during storm events the hca results for the mps are presented in fig 4 5 and fig s9 13 the groups relevant to ff were clustered for three storm events w1 w6 and w7 during the monitoring of storm events most mps in these events exhibited the ffe with higher concentrations observed in the early part of the storm than in the latter part sansalone and cristina 2004 in event w1 mps clustered into ff and peak flow periods fig 4 most mps in event w1 were classified as cluster w1 a containing 42 substances that showed a rapid increase in concentration during the ff duration this cluster comprised 23 pharmaceuticals 1 tp 7 pesticides and 10 industrial chemicals including met tbep bth dmbs cfn and hmmm the concentration of met pre storm 1 4 μg l post storm 9 1 μg l and tbep pre storm 1 2 μg l post storm 5 9 μg l which were 6 5 and 4 9 times higher than those in the pre storm period respectively other mps in cluster w1 a showed higher concentrations in post storm periods median 1 7 times higher bth and tbep showed similar trends because of their frequent usage in industrial formulations gorga et al 2015 this similarity can be relevant to their usage in the industries tbep as flame retardants regnery and püttmann 2010 and industrial chemicals fries and püttmann 2003 masoner et al 2019 and bth as an oxidative transformation product fuchte et al 2022 these compounds have been considered for their potential hazards causing endocrine disruption and bio amplification owing to their high toxicity neale et al 2020a previšić et al 2021 to evaluate the ffe of the chemicals grouped by hca the ff curves for w1 a were presented in fig 4 ffe was observed in all samples except for one chemical i e isophorone cluster w1 a was a chemical group that showed the maximum concentration during ff therefore a slight increase in mp load was observed owing to the decrease in concentration after ff the agreement between the clustering and ffe results indicates that hca is suitable for identifying the mps contributed by ffe cluster w1 b did not exhibit an ffe showing an incremental trend in mp concentration after ff eighteen compounds were classified in this cluster comprising 14 pesticides 3 industrial chemicals and 1 pharmaceutical in this cluster most substances were related to agricultural activities which could be interpreted as the influence of precipitation on farmland and the long retention times of agricultural compounds chen et al 2019 all chemicals grouped under cluster w1 b showed values lower than the 1 1 line in the ff curves indicating that the σmp load increases according to the discharge flow for event w6 most of the substances were included in clusters w6 a and w6 b which are related to the ff phenomena fig 5 this cluster consisted of 60 compounds including six major contaminants met btr cfn hmmm 9h pfna and mbtr in terms of usage class composition this cluster had a higher fraction of pharmaceuticals and their tps comprising from highest to lowest proportions 24 pharmaceuticals and 3 tps 45 0 followed by 18 industrial chemicals 30 0 and 11 pesticides and 4 tps 25 0 only 18 compounds cluster w6 a showed the maximum concentration during ff and 42 compounds cluster w6 b showed the maximum concentration before rain until ff according to the concept of ff curves it appears that wash off would contribute to cluster w6 b at event w6 btr and mbtr showed different profiles compared to event w1 which can be explained by the variable sources of these chemicals parajulee et al 2017a and the hydrodynamics of each event cluster w6 c presented high concentrations after ff and included 11 pesticides 3 pesticide tps 6 pharmaceuticals 1 pharmaceutical tp and 6 industrial substances through w1 and w6 the pesticides e g tebuconazole and carbendazim consistently showed a patterns of increasing concentration per unit volume discharged during event w7 cluster w7 a contained 31 compounds fig s8 in dry events e g events d1 d2 and d3 no hca cluster showed consistent mp profiles fig s9 suggesting that the hydrometeorological variables can affect the appearance of pollutants ellis 2006 3 3 relationship between environmental variables and mps the present study adopted plsr model to identify the factors influencing the dominant mps variable importance on projection vip scores were estimated for each predictor presented in table s16 among them sf10 sf60 adh1 adh5 and adh10 had mean vip scores greater than 1 0 fig 7 a this indicates that the detected mps with high concentrations were significantly correlated with the hydrological features of the stormflow and antecedent dry period numerous studies have investigated the effects of rainfall and surface runoff on increases in chemical concentrations in particular adh has been determined as an influencing factor because dry conditions cause the accumulation of chemical substances on urban surfaces which could potentially be flushed into aquatic systems hewitt and rashed 1992 parajulee et al 2017b moreover launay et al 2016 and burant et al 2018 have demonstrated that stormwater and surface runoff can induce pollutants loads including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons opfrs and ppcps these trace organic contaminants had significantly high concentrations during urban rainfall burant et al 2018 in contrast the occurrence of hmmm and tmp was affected by water temperature with vip scores greater than 1 0 for hmmm and tmp fig 7 e f this suggests that the water temperature is an influential factor in the occurrence of these mps previous studies have also described the influence of temperature on mp concentrations bacaloni et al 2008 ebrahimzadeh et al 2021 fries and püttmann 2003 however the plsr model cannot eludidate the physicochemical mechanisms between these variables and mps thus it is necessary to apply a process based model e g storm water management model swmm to identify the exact mechanism our plsr model used the coefficient of determination r2 as an indicator of model reliability the model yielded r2 values of 0 8 for btr 0 6 for mbtr and 0 5 for bth table s17 previous studies have suggested using this coefficient as a standard metric to evaluate regression analysis chicco et al 2021 also described good results for statistical analysis with an r2 greater than 0 4 although the model presented a low prediction with an r2 value of less than 0 6 the regression model can explain the factors influencing the prediction sandoval et al 2013 based on these reliable results we investigated the driving factors of the btr mbtr and bth among the predictors sf adh and bf were the factors that contributed the most to the btr and mbtr fig 7 b c beckers et al 2018 revealed that btr and mbtr are frequently detected in the surface water of urban areas otherwise bth was influenced less by adh and more by sf than their effect to btr and mbtr fig 7 d this can be derived from the variation in concentrations discharged from the effluents that can increase during antecedent dry periods or decrease with increasing rainfall manka et al 2016 neale et al 2020b 4 conclusion in this study we explored changes in the concentration and occurrence of micropollutants mps in an urban catchment area intensive stormwater monitoring was conducted and 253 target compounds were detected through high resolution mass spectrometry hierarchical clustering analysis hca was used to estimate the similarity between mps and partial least squares regression plsr was used to identify the factors influencing mp concentration the main findings of this study are as follows 1 among the observed target compounds 85 mps were persistently detected in more than 75 of samples and the most dominant mps were metformin tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate 2 benzothiazolesulfonic acid benzotriazole 2 6 dimethylbenzenesulfonic acid trimethyl phosphate caffeine hexa methoxymethyl melamine acetaminophen 9h hexadecafluorononanoic acid and 9h hexadecafluorononanoic acid these 11 mps were detected in every sample and comprised 75 of the total mp concentration 2 pharmaceutical and pesticide compounds showed a high first flush effect ffe with the mass first flush mff ratio above 1 5 indicating that these mps were discharged from surface runoff and urban pipelines during rainfall the industrial compounds presented moderate ffe by stormwater owing to the absence of direct effluents from the sewage and waste water treatment plants 3 the plsr results indicated that antecedent dry hours adh and stormflow sf were the main contributors to the presence of mps and changes in concentration this might be interpreted from the effects of adh and sf on pollutants adh induced the accumulation of mps on the surface and sf promoted the wash off of mps via stormwater this study demonstrated the applicability of high resolution monitoring and machine learning for identifying the factors influencing mp variability in response to hydrological changes these findings could be informative for designing stormwater management plans and preventing mp hazards on aquatic environments however the following limitations need to be addressed to understand the transport of mps during urban storm events 1 generalizing the hydrological changes and mp occurrence depending on the spatial characteristics of stormwater and 2 identifying the exact physicochemical mechanism between the hydrological variables and mps hence future research will require data acquisition from various sites and the use of process based models e g swmm to investigate the influence of land use patterns and hydrologic variables on mps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14886,depending on the ambient ph ionizable substances are present in varying proportions in their neutral or charged form the extent to which these two chemical species contribute to the ph dependant toxicity of ionizable chemicals and whether intracellular ion trapping has a decisive influence in this context is controversially discussed against this background we determined the acute toxicity of 24 ionizable substances at up to 4 different ph values on the embryonic development of the zebrafish danio rerio and supplemented this dataset with additional data from the literature the lc50 for some substances diclofenac propranolol fluoxetine differed by a factor of even 103 between ph5 and ph9 to simulate the toxicity of 12 acids and 12 bases six models to calculate a ph dependant logd value as a proxy for the uptake of potentially toxic molecules were created based on different premises for the trans membrane passage and toxic action of neutral and ionic species and their abilities to explain the real lc50 data set were assessed using this approach we were able to show that both neutral and charged species are almost certainly taken up into cells according to their logd based distribution and that both species exert toxicity since two of the models that assume all intracellular molecules to be neutral overestimated the real toxicity it must be concluded that the toxic effect of a single charged intracellularly present molecule is on the average lower than that of a single neutral molecule furthermore it was possible to attribute differences in toxicity at different ph values for these 24 ionizable substances to the respective deltas in logd at these ph levels with high accuracy enabling particularly a full logd based model on the basis of logpow as a membrane passage descriptor to be used for predicting potential toxicities in worst case scenarios from existing experimental studies as stipulated in the process of registration of chemicals and the definition of environmental quality standards eqs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords danio rerio ecotoxicity eqs fet oecd 236 pharmaceuticals data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it has long been known that the quantitative uptake of organic chemicals into cells and associated with this their potential to be toxic depends on the lipophilicity of these substances according to their octanol water coefficient pow or lipid water coefficient plipw pow and plipw or their logarithms describe the relationship between lipophilicity and hydrophilicity of a given substance high logp values characterise lipophilic chemicals low hydrophilic ones for substances with variable lipophilicity such as ionisable chemicals however this relationship is much more complicated and thus requires a more differentiated view an ionizable substance can be present in several species neutral or ionic by association or dissociation and each of these species can be assigned its own logp value the partitioning of these species however is ph dependant to account for different partition patterns of neutral and ionic species the actual lipophilicity of an ionizable compound under given ph conditions is denoted by the combined partition coefficient logd in this context the lipophilicity of the neutral species is given as logdneutral that of the ionic species as logdionic both often forming a plateau across a range of ph levels in general the distribution coefficient logd can be determined on the basis of the distribution of the chemical between octanol and water logdow or between liposomes and water logdlipw in this work we comparatively consider these different concepts due to their sheer number franco et al 2010 ionisable compounds are of great importance in the environment depending on environmentally relevant ph fluctuations in the medium these substances switch their speciation and lipophilicity amongst different states of charge which changes their ability to be taken up by cells and to exert toxic effects in them rendal et al 2011a 2012 neuwoehner and escher 2011 baumer et al 2017 bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b to mathematically handle the relationship between ph conditions bioaccumulation of ionisable substances via bioconcentration factor bcf determinations and the resulting toxicity mostly ec50 values various approaches were chosen each of which referred to selected properties of the chemicals under consideration and when comparing the toxicity exerted by them on different organisms the different fat and protein contents of these thus different models exist today that are well capable to explain the uptake and biological effect for selected trophic level specific endpoints rendal et al 2011a 2012 neuwoehner and escher 2011 baumer et al 2017 bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b goss et al 2018 whose suitability and limitations however have been critically reviewed rendal et al 2011b escher et al 2020 for a reliable modelling of ph dependant toxicity in this context it is crucial to know the proportion of charged and uncharged chemical species outside and inside the cells of an exposed organism the quantity of charged and uncharged species that passively diffuse through the outer cell membrane into the cell interior or are actively taken up by transporters and whether the intracellularly exerted toxicity is exclusively caused by one single chemical species possibly the uncharged species that binds to intracellular membrane structures or by both species according to a given toxic potential to reduce the complexity of the relationships here we focus on monoprotic ionisable chemicals for which no active transmembrane transport is known and for which uptake can therefore be assumed exclusively via passive diffusion applying a single test system only the fish embryo test fet using developing zebrafish danio rerio in its embryonic stages nevertheless our approach followed the basic mechanistic relationships outlined above and schematically visualised in fig 1 considering the modulating effect of different substance properties acids vs bases and external ph conditions fig 2 we aim at 1 understanding which uptake and effect pathways are used by the different chemical species and which ones are ultimately relevant for the resulting toxicity of a chemical at prevailing ph values furthermore we aim at 2 establishing a model for the reliable prediction of ph dependant basal toxicity that can be generalised across many substance classes for this we have set up six mechanistic models each of which is taking different possible processes and interactions into account figs 1 and 2 and tested their reliability and predictive power using an extensive data set of 24 ionisable chemicals based on our own experiments and published data bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b schweizer et al 2022 we hypothesise that the model that specifies the logd value for a given substance such that this value correlates most strongly with experimentally collected embryotoxicity data captures those parameters and processes that are mechanistically responsible for the observed differences in ph related toxicity therefore we formulated three sets of models each set comprising two similar models which differed only in the selection of the descriptor for trans membrane passage of chemical species to simulate a most realistic putatively effective logd curve that should approximate the quantitative course of the uptake of potentially toxic molecules in which based on theories formulated in the past different parameters were included each model set consisted of two models using identical mathematics but either were based on pow or on plipw the reason for this was that on one hand pow is generally used as a proxy to estimate the bioaccumulation of organic chemicals in whole animals whereas plipw is considered to directly describe the association of organic chemicals with biomembranes avdeef et al 1998 escher et al 2000 a the first set of models considered all the processes outlined in figs 1 and 2 processes 1 2 3 4 and 5 in fig 1 and assumed that both the uncharged and the charged species of a given chemical are passively membrane permeable although the uncharged form permeates membranes unequally better for the ph dependant ratios and lipophilicities we assumed a logd based distribution of both species this model set also implied an automatic adjustment of a logd dependant equilibrium within the cell according to the intracellular ph and furthermore assumed that both the uncharged and the charged species contribute to toxicity we here call these models full extra and intracellularly logd dependant partitioning based herafter briefly logd based i e for both pow and plipw in effect the two models in this set both consist of a linear part where both the neutral and the ionic species contribute to logd as well as two plateaus each dominated by one of the two species the neutral plateau represents the highest logd values due to about 100 of the neutral more lipophilic species being present while the lower ionic plateau is located at the ph range at which 99 ionic species are present b in contrast the second set of models just considered the uptake of the neutral species present under the given ph conditions ignored a possible intracellular formation of charged molecules and implied that all molecules taken up by the cell exert the same level of toxicity thus only processes 1 and 2 listed in fig 1 were considered for these models this set of models was based on the assumption that only the neutral form of an ionisable chemical will enter the organic phase ecetoc 2013 and thus can passively diffuse through membranes intracellular ion trapping was neglected and so there was no intracellular conversion to any ionic species taken into consideration and basic toxicity was supposed to be exerted by the entire intracellular fraction of the chemical neutral only models hence there is no ionic plateau formed and consequently the log d calculated on the basis of this approach gradually decreases over the entire ph range c the third model set also considered an exclusive uptake of neutral species into the cell process 1 in fig 1 however it also took into account that due to the difference of the intracellular cytoplasmic ph value from that of the external medium a re distribution of uncharged and charged species takes place ion trap process 5 in fig 1 and thus the toxic effect of the entirety of the intracellular fraction of the chemical process 2 in fig 1 is modulated by this ion trapping in this model no toxicity is attributed to the charged species and any toxic effect is assumed to be exerted exclusively by the intracellular concentration of the neutral species of the chemicals thus implying that the ion trapping process contributes to the detoxification of a distinct portion of the intracellular fraction this model set will be referred to as ion trap detox in the following all in all we thus calculated six models table 1 three sets with two models each based on pow and plipw and assessed their suitability or more precisely the suitability of the logd values calculated by each of these models for each chemical at a given ph to explain the toxicities lc50 data found experimentally in the danio rerio embryotoxicity test at different ph values for 24 ionisable substances we further assumed that those of the theoretically conceivable processes for the uptake and toxic action of chemicals in cells that had been used in the construction of the best fit models also reflected the real processes responsible for toxicity however the central intention of our study was not only to elucidate quantitative aspects of the uptake and toxic effects of the differently charged species of chemicals but in particular to develop a practicable tool for the reliable prediction of ph dependant relative differences in embryotoxicity of those substances whose effects have been solely determined at a single ph value e g those for which initial registration has been applied for within the framework of chemical authorisation such a model that corrects the empirical effect value in a given study to worst case ph conditions should have great potential to be implemented in the official registration and risk assessment of ionisable chemicals 2 material and methods 2 1 substance properties and buffer systems twenty seven ionizable substances listed in table 2 have been subject to zebrafish embryo toxicity testing fet at up to 4 different ph levels according to oecd guideline 236 oecd 2013 amongst them two compounds the nonsteroidal selective oestrogen receptor modulator enclomiphene and the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid could not be integrated into the modelling because toxicity data could be reliably generated for a single ph only and or could only be unreliably generated by extrapolation furthermore in the case of citric acid the chemical was actively taken up by membrane bound transporters and therefore could not be incorporated into models exclusively based on passive diffusion as uptake pathway the water solubility of ionisable substances is usually given for a neutral ph table 2 hence these values may be underestimating the solubility for those ph levels at which the chemical is present largely in its ionised hydrophilic form therefore for a number of substances high concentrations could be dissolved and tested without solvent at ph levels that entail predominantly the ionic species of these chemicals only in some cases it was necessary to involve a solvent table 2 finally a total of 24 ionisable chemicals 12 acids and 12 bases were included in the modelling the identities and all relevant physicochemical properties of the included substances as well as information on the source of the data and the chemicals the tested ph levels the concentration range and the occasionally used solvents are given in table 2 data for four additional substances i e cetirizine dimethindene doxylamine genistein have been taken from bittner et al 2019a 2019b while data for additional ph values were available for five substances tested by the authors i e diclofenac ketotifen metoprolol naproxen propranolol from bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b all other data originated from own experiments using the methodology described below to keep the test systems at constant phs four different buffer systems were used a potassium hydrogen phthalate buffer ph 5 according to clark and lubs 1916 a phosphate buffer based on sodium phosphate monobasic and sodium phosphate dibasic ph 6 as well as a tris buffer ph 8 pufferan 99 9 p a cas 77 86 1 roth carl roth gmbh co kg karlsruhe germany and a glycine buffer ph 9 according to sørensen 1912 the buffer solutions were prepared with reconstituted water which consisted of 25 ml of 0 23 g l kcl 2 59 g l nahco3 4 93 g l mgs4o 7 h2o and 11 76 g l cacl2 2 h2o each and 900 ml double distilled water hcl and naoh were applied to adjust the test media to the exact ph value prior to the test 2 2 test design and concentrations in order to determine the concentration of a test substance being lethal to 50 of the test organisms lc50 at highest possible accuracy three test runs were conducted for each substance and ph combination with differing test concentrations for concentrations see table 2 the spacing of test concentrations for the first run run 1 was generally set wider to cover mortalities of danio rerio embryos between 0 and 100 after 96 h post fertilisation hpf test concentrations were determined on the basis of literature reported acute lethal concentrations for adult fish i e oecd 203 or based on qsar predictions ecosar u s epa 1994 in a second run run 2 the concentration range was adjusted to ideally induce mortalities between 20 and 80 after 96 hpf a third run run 3 offered the possibility to cover the concentration range around 50 mortality more precisely in runs 1 and 2 usually four concentrations per substance and ph were tested compared to five concentrations in the third run provided that the controls did not differ significantly from each other data points obtained from all experimental runs were merged into a single dose response relationship and used collectively for statistical analyses 2 3 maintenance of zebrafish two equally sensitive strains of zebrafish danio rerio established at the animal physiological ecology laboratory of tübingen university were equally used for egg production the abtl strain obtained from the institute of neurobiology tübingen university and the westaquarium strain that originated from heidelberg university but had been bred at the animal physiological ecology laboratory for many years the two strains were kept in separate 90 200 l tanks filled with a 1 1 mixture of filtered tap water ae 2 l water filter coming with an abl 0240 29 activated carbon filter 0 3 μm reiser seligenstadt germany and purified water at a constant temperature of 27 1 c to ensure optimal water quality the physicochemical water parameters were kept in the following ranges ph 7 4 0 2 conductivity 260 350 µs cm oxygen saturation 100 5 total hardness 8 12 dh 142 4 213 6 mg l caco3 nitrate 1 5 mg l

cycle and fed three times daily with dry flake food tetramin tetra gmbh melle germany and at least twice weekly with a mixture of mosquito larvae and glass worms poseidon aquakultur freeze ruppichteroth germany for protein supplement 2 4 fish embryo test fet to trigger egg production in otherwise unequipped fish tanks plexiglas breeding boxes 20 20 6 cm were introduced the evening before the test start the breeding boxes were covered with a metal mesh to avoid predation on the eggs and artificial sea grass was added on top as optical spawning stimulus since zebrafish spawn at sunrise eggs could be collected the following morning 1 1 5 h after the onset of light the eggs were rinsed with lukewarm tap water and transferred into glass container filled with artificial water the fertilisation rate 80 according to oecd 236 was checked under a stereo microscope stemi 2000 c zeiss oberkochen germany the embryo test with d rerio was carried out in glass petri dishes to avoid a reduction of bioavailability of the test material by adsorption all petri dishes were filled with the test solution containing the chemical at least 24 h prior to the test and emptied and refilled directly before test start to assure saturation of the glass walls subsequently the eggs were transferred into pre exposure petri dishes 70 mm in diameter filled with test solution of the respective substance concentrations and incubated at 26 1 c in a heating cabinet for two hours after incubation well developed eggs at the same developmental stage 128 256 cell stage according to kimmel et al 1995 were picked and transferred into the test petri dishes 30 mm in diameter for both the first and second run four concentrations per ph were tested using four petri dishes with four embryos per treatment each to avoid pseudo replication near the expected lc50 the third run consisted of five concentrations per ph and included ten petri dishes with one embryo each despite different procedures in run1 2 and run 3 this experimental design particularly allowed the determination of lc50 values by means of nonlinear regression analysis with high precision for each ph level a buffer control was run at the respective ph the embryos were then incubated at 26 1 c in a heating cabinet for 96 hpf with an artificial day night cycle of 12 12 h embryos were checked every 12 24 h for mortality and dead individuals and empty eggshells were removed to avoid oxygen deprivation due to bacterial degradation processes the ph was measured during the test in at least one petri dish per concentration daily exemplarily to assure ph stability since ph 5 and ph 9 are marking the periphery of the zebrafish s tolerance range mcclure et al 2006 spence et al 2006 lawrence 2007 horng et al 2009 control mortalities occasionally exceeded 10 after 96 h all experiments were terminated and the embryos euthanised with ms222 tricaine methane sulphonate pharmaq ltd fordingbridge uk 2 5 chemical analysis to verify the nominal concentrations that determined the lc50 for all chemicals at the different ph values we carried out further exposures under the same conditions as in the toxicity tests described above but exclusively with concentrations in close proximity to the lc50s determined by regressions see above which enabled us to take sufficiently large volumes of exposure medium for chemical analysis at the beginning and end of the exposure period of 96 h in each case all chemicals analytical standards internal standards etc were purchased in the highest available purity and are listed in detail in the supplementary information s1 reference standard solutions were used to determine the concentration range that provides a linear signal response for each analyte preliminary dilution tests were performed with samples of the exposure media to ensure that the concentration of the diluted sample was included in the linear dynamic range of the instrument the exposure media samples were filtered through 0 2 μm rc syringe filters and diluted based on the preliminary test results afterwards equal amounts of methanol and the diluted samples were transferred into glass vials to reach a final constitution of 1 1 v v methanol h2o finally the samples were spiked with stable isotope labelled internal standards is in different concentration for each analyte and stored at 80 c until the lchrms analysis the sample preparation procedure is described in the supplementary information s2 analysis of the exposure media samples was carried out using a uhplc qtof ms system equipped with a uhplc apparatus dionex ultimate 3000 rslc thermo fisher scientific dreieich germany and coupled to the qtof ms mass analyser maxis impact bruker daltonics bremen germany the lchrms analyses were conducted in reversed phase liquid chromatography rplc in both positive and negative ionization modes chromatographic separation was performed using an acclaim rslc c18 column 2 1 100 mm 2 2 μm from thermo fischer scientific dreieich germany detailed information about instrumental analysis is provided in the supplementary information s3 a target screening workflow presented in detail in the supplementary information s4 was used to identify the different analytes reference standard solutions were analysed utilizing lc esi qtofms processing of the raw data was implemented with the software tools data analysis 5 3 and tasq client 2 1 bruker daltonics bremen germany an in house database containing analytical information for all the analytes was compiled and used to screen the samples s4 the detection of the substances was based on specific screening parameters mass accuracy 5 mda retention time shift 0 2 min isotopic fitting 200 msigma only for confirmation of positive findings whereas the presence of characteristic qualifier ions was considered mandatory for their successful identification quantification was performed using standard addition calibration curves the is were used in the quantification process to achieve reliable and accurate quantitative results for that reason relative areas have been used the area of each substance has been divided by the area of the respective is s4 the concentration of each analyte in the samples was determined by using these calibration curves 2 6 determination of lethal concentrations using 96 hpf cumulative mortality data based on binomial distributions non linear regressions were run with the drc package in the open source software r ritz et al 2016 to fit dose response curves for up to four individual models three parametric log logistic log normal and weibull 1 to derive individual lc50s lethal concentration at which 50 of the embryos die together with the upper and lower boundaries of the 95th confidence intervals the parametric models were performed with an upper boundary condition at 1 for some substances that could not be tested beyond their water solubility or with a very wide effect gradient we added grid points at substantially higher concentrations where a full effect was expected as an additional boundary condition to stabilise the models control data of the three test runs were pooled for each ph to derive the final lc50 value the results of the best models were selected based on their aic values and in case of equally good models where the delta of the aic values was smaller or equal to five burnham and anderson 2004 the mean of the model ensemble was used see schweizer et al 2022 additional concentration response data were taken from bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b digitized and treated in the same way to derive comparable lc50 values that were concurrently used for modelling 2 7 modelling of ph dependant differences in order to examine which physicochemical processes during membrane passage and within the cell might determine the observed ph related differences in toxicity three types of models were generated and tested for their suitability to best represent the experimentally collected toxicity data for these three model types two models were generated each one on the basis of log pow n octanol water partitioning and the other on the basis of log plipw i e the partitioning coefficient between artificial liposomes zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine which are considered mimicking biological membranes escher and schwarzenbach 1996 avdeef et al 1998 and water the distribution ratios of the neutral species of ionisable compounds are very similar in the octanol and the liposome water system but the charged species partition was found to be significantly higher in the anisotropic lipid bilayer than into the bulk phase octanol escher and schwarzenbach 1996 it was therefore assumed that eventually the distribution ratio of klipw is a more suitable descriptor for the uptake of ionizable compounds into biological membranes than the corresponding kow escher and schwarzenbach 1996 vaes et al 1998 bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b escher et al 2020 in the following both descriptors are compared for their explanatory value to predict the ph dependant toxicity in the fet for the following three different model types in the following equations logd is meant to be the putatively effective partition coefficient that corresponds to at least the exerted baseline toxicity and the subscript x in the descriptors of lipophilicity dx or px always stands for either subscript ow octanol water or subscript lipw liposomes water logd based models 1 log d x log 10 f neut ral 10 logpx neut ral f ionic 10 logpx ionic for the neutral fraction applies 2 f n e u t

stands for the fraction of either the neutral or ionic species considering the difference between chemical species partitioning between the exterior and the interior of cells assuming a ph of 7 3 for the internal cytoplasm of fish embryos thereby logd potentially considers both the neutral and the ionic form of the substance concurrently and therefore represents a kind of mixture exposure to both chemical species however once chemical species enter the fish embryo cells the chemicals are subjected to the internal ph of the cytoplasm set to 7 3 according to madshus 1988 who gives a regular ph 7 0 7 4 for this parameter depending on the external ph absolute concentrations of internal fractions vary while the relative internal equilibrium stays the same the reason is that part of the neutral species that entered the embryo will be intracellularly ionized or vice versa depending on the character of the compound acid or base and whether the mean logd of the substance in the cytoplasm is lower or higher than that in the extracellular medium since the ion trap detox models assume that the ionised species does not develop any toxicity the result would generally be a lower toxic effect than suggested from the logd in the external medium δlogd as proxy for ph dependant differences in order to estimate the potential difference in the resulting effect value lc50 of two fet tests at two given ph levels ph i and ph ii the novel term δlogd was introduced which could be considered as factorial difference of the logd values that have been generated through algorithmisation for these two ph levels 8 δ log d log d ph i log d ph ii the parameter δlogd strongly depends on the two ph levels of the exposure media of two tests with an identical substance to be compared and describes the potential difference of the test substance to be taken up by the fish embryo and hence to cause toxicity 2 8 statistics the quality of the models to correspond with the mortality data was assessed by root mean square error rmse calculation for the 14 chemicals that were tested at least at 4 ph levels i e including literature data significance of mean rmses was checked by welch s anova followed by benjamini hochberg correction for multiple comparisons initial p 0 05 to assess the relationship between log d and toxicity at different phs i e ph i and ph ii the δ log lc50 values at 96 hpf were calculated according to eq 9 for all possible binary combinations of ph for each of the given substances and correlated with the respective δ log d 9 δ log l c 50 log l c 50 ph i log l c 50 ph ii a linear regression was run with the combined data set of all substances using r software version 4 2 1 r core team 2021 3 results 3 1 chemical analysis the chemical analyses of the compounds were performed as indicated for fets separately conducted at the respective lc50s across all chemicals chemical analytics revealed in the majority of cases 93 out of 121 a recovery i e nominal vs measured concentration rate of 30 or higher and in about half of the cases a rate of 50 or higher table 3 across most of the chemicals the measured concentration of the water samples from the start 0 h and the end 96 h of the exposure experiments were at the same range if the standard deviation was taken into consideration for this reason all modelling was based on the nominal effect concentrations for each chemical 3 2 embryotoxicity in the fet based on the three stage toxicity test design carried out for each substance at different ph values at least 13 test concentrations could be considered in robust concentration response relationships and hence lc50 values for 20 substances could be determined with high accuracy fig 3 exemplarily displays the observed mortalities for the weak acid diclofenac and the weak base metoprolol for four ph conditions from 5 to 9 in accordance with the expectations all acids including diclofenac exerted its embryotoxicity at gradually lower concentrations when ph gradually decreases on the contrary bases such as metoprolol exhibited lower lc50 values with increasing ph the concentration response curves for all substances are displayed in the supplementary information s5 thereby the compounds exhibiting the largest differences between lc50s at the two most distant phs were diclofenac factor 1715 propranolol factor 1574 and fluoxetine factor 1046 within the environmentally relevant ph range between ph6 and ph8 the lc50 values for these three substances varied by the factors 61 4 propranolol 29 4 diclofenac and 26 9 fluoxetine on the contrary we observed very little differences factors 3 for compounds like dcp or triclosan which were tested at or close to their neutral plateaus as well as for cetirizine tested at its ionic plateau table 4 and fig s2 additional lc50 values at other ph conditions for 5 test chemicals i e diclofenac naproxen ketotifen metoprolol propranolol and for four additional substances i e cetirizine dimethindene doxylamine genistein were determined using data published by bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b however data for three tested substances could not be used for modelling because the data were too uncertain as the lc50 would have to be generated by extrapolation or just for a single ph only due to low solubility i e enclomiphene imidacloprid moreover the natural compound citric acid is known to be actively taken up via membrane bound transporters it was tested for toxicity at three different ph values but showed little ph dependant difference in toxicity due to the active uptake pathway data not shown as compared to the rather large differences expected according to log d the latter observation only served to show that the approach used in our study cannot be transferred to substances actively regulated by cells thus data for 24 ionisable substances i e 12 acids and 12 bases were finally included in the modelling approaches 3 3 modelling the ph dependence of embryotoxicity exerted by the 24 substances could be reproduced in very different quality by the six different models some models which took into account different aspects of the possible uptake pathways and theoretically possible toxic effects of charged and uncharged chemical species reproduced the observed differences of these ph dependencies very well others however only insufficiently although the potential for reliable modelling of real data was indeed substance specific and thus some models were suitable for selected chemicals only and less suitable for others it became clear that three models performed best and mirrored the effect data equally well as they did not differ significantly welch s anova with benjamini hochberg correction the mean root mean square errors rmse sd calculated for the respective best fit models for those 14 substances with at least 4 tested ph values for compounds with less data i e ph levels the rmses are hardly meaningful were almost identical 0 15 0 06 for the logd based pow model and 0 14 0 05 for both neutral only pow or plipw models the other three models reflected the real effect lc50 data significantly less accurately than each of the former ones and their rmses were in ascending order 0 30 0 22 for the logd based plipw model 0 36 0 20 for the ion trap detox pow model and 0 41 0 23 for the ion trap detox plipw model these latter three models did not show any significant differences amongst one another welch s anova with benjamini hochberg correction exemplarily the potential of the models to reflect the distribution of the real data measured in the experiments is visualised for two compounds i e diclofenac and metoprolol in fig 4 the best fit of all models for all 24 substances is displayed in the supplementary information s6 statistical testing of differences amongst the models is displayed in the supplementary information s7 for the three models found to be reliable in the rmse analysis there was also a very strong to excellent correlation symbolized by high concordance correlation coefficients ccc and high coefficients of determination r2 of the differences in the effective logd values calculated for binary combinations of ph values referred to as δlogd with the differences in mortality at the same ph values referred to as δlc50 this main finding of the study can be visualised when the lc50 measurements are logarithmised and plotted versus the modelled effective distribution coefficient in the external medium fig 5 it can be clearly seen that for the log d based model on the basis of pow the now linearised dependence of log lc50 and effective log d runs almost identical to the bisector through the 1 1 origin in a nice uniformity for all substances investigated in fact all other models lag behind it regarding the uniformity of the predictions for the various substances weak acids and bases alike as well as with regard to the deviations from the bisector i e the slope using this correlation it is thus possible with the help of the δlogd pow based model to infer very reliably from a known lc50 for an ionisable chemical at a given ph to the lc50 of the same chemical at a different ph e g within the framework of worst case scenarios with limitations this is also possible using one of the two neutral only models but with less accuracy as these models overestimate observed toxicity changes with ph shifts of one unit by a factor of about 1 4 the three remaining models however drastically underestimate real toxicity changes with ph shifts i e flatter slopes and thus failed to prove any ability to infer from the toxicity exerted by a chemical at a given ph to the toxic effect at another ph 4 discussion following our findings and against the background of the available literature on the topic which was critically reviewed in two excellent reviews rendal et al 2011b escher et al 2020 our study opens up new insights into the mode of action of the neutral and charged species of ionisable organic chemicals and provides a novel methodology for simulating worst case scenario toxicity mechanistically the difference between the three sets of our models was that they took into account different aspects of the uptake and toxicity of chemicals full extra and intracellularly logd dependant partitioning based i e shortly logd based uptake of charged ionic and uncharged neutral species into the cell intracellular equilibrium between uncharged and charged species which both may exert toxicity neutral only uptake of only uncharged species into the cell equal toxicity of all uptaken molecules ion trap detox uptake of only uncharged species into the cell and toxicity exerted by only those uptaken molecules that remain neutral in the cell according to the recommendation of escher et al 2020 we focused on the generation of high quality data at constant phs which we achieved by using buffered test media as a simultaneous determination of lc50 and bcf is rarely attainable escher et al 2020 it was also not possible for us to calculate internal lc50 ilc50 values for the test substances of the present study and thus to verify the suitability of a quantitative ion trapping model with absolute values as proposed by escher and hermens 2004 for acids and by neuwoehner and escher 2011 for bases in the study reported here however this task is addressed in current work by our team 4 1 observed ph dependant differences in acute toxicity as known for decades the prevalent ph of the test medium impacts the toxicity of ionisable chemicals stehly and hayton 1990 valenti et al 2009 this has been shown for test organisms across a variety of taxa such as bacteria algae daphnids and fish nakamura et al 2008 neuwoehner and escher 2011 li et al 2018 as compared to non ionizable neutral organic chemicals whose absolute baseline toxicity can be well predicted by the log pow of the compound ionisable substances reach their maximum toxic potential only if tested at a ph level at which the substances are exclusively uncharged while they are significantly less toxic at those ph ranges that induce the ionised forms examples from our study for natural environmental phs to result in mostly neutral species are triclosan or the chlorophenols whereas e g cetirizine is present only in the ionised form under normal environmental conditions the observed differences in ph dependant toxicity could be very large and may cover three orders of magnitude as shown for diclofenac fluoxetine metoprolol and propranolol this finding therefore should also have fundamental consequences for the regulation of chemical risks as will be explained at the end of this chapter 4 2 contribution of neutral and charged species to toxicity early studies have shown that the toxicity of an ionizable substance increases with increasing fraction of the neutral species of this substance e g rendal et al 2011b this finding has led to the suggestion that the neutral species per se exerts higher toxicity in the cells of an organism however it has to be questioned whether the increased harmful effect in this case is caused by a more severe intracellular action of an uncharged molecule vs a charged one or rather by the differently efficient uptake of the two species per time unit into the cell furthermore an exclusive focus just on the ratio of fractions i e the relative proportion of neutral and ionic species in the assessment of toxicity is certainly not sufficient since according to our results the respective aggregated lipophilicities symbolised by logd are of decisive importance especially as the absolute differences in the lipophilicity of the neutral and ionic species are substance specific the comparison of the approaches to calculate δ logd based on different models provides insight into the mechanisms by which the toxicity of ionizable substances is exerted the logd calculated in each case can be seen here as a proxy for the uptake of potentially toxic molecules and thus its delta as a prediction of the toxicity change to be expected according to the respective models in fig 5 these predictions have been plotted versus the real toxicity changes based on our assumption that the model whose effective logd values correlate most strongly with experimental data on embryotoxicity takes into account those parameters and processes that are mechanistically responsible for the observed toxicity the following conclusions emerge from our results when comparing effective logd and lc50 and the correlation between δlogd and δloglc50 the logd based model on the basis of pow which considers both uptake and toxicity of both the ionized and neutral species predicts the real experimentally quantified toxicity in the comparison of δlogd vs δloglc50 almost perfectly with a slope of 1 019 and an r2 of 0 892 due to a just negligible deviation from a 1 1 relationship of δlogd and δloglc50 it also had the by far highest ccc of all models i e 0 942 since this model has proven to be also suitable for mapping the lethal effects with regard to rmse it must be concluded that both the neutral and the charged species of an ionisable chemical are taken up intracellularly and that both species also contribute to the toxicity at least for the tested ionisable organic substances with a molecular mass of 180 to 406 da the assumption that the ion trapping process leads to a complete ˈdetoxificationˈ of uptaken molecules by converting toxic neutral molecules into the non toxic charged species failed to explain the real toxicity in both ion trap detox models these two models drastically underestimate the real toxicity which must be regarded an indirect proof of the ionic species to contribute to the toxicity exerted by ionisable substances this conclusion is particularly confirmed by the example of cetirizine which exerted similar toxic effects at all three tested phs all of which are in the ionic plateau of the log d curve this should not have been the case if either only the neutral species which essentially is not present at those phs was taken up nor if the ionic species does not contribute to toxicity then no toxic effect would have been observed both neutral only models which assume that only the neutral species enters the cell and exerts the toxicity attributed to neutral molecules in an unchanged manner slightly overestimate the real toxicity with slopes of the regression curves of 1 407 and 1 461 respectively thus it should be assumed that the toxic effect of an ionisable chemical is not exclusively but largely due to the uptake and intracellular action of the neutral species as it is undisputed that an equilibrium between neutral and ionised species must also prevail intracellularly and that ionised molecules also develop toxicity see conclusion above it must also be concluded that the toxicity resulting from the ionised species is somewhat lower than would be expected from the same number of neutral molecules otherwise the neutral only models would not have overestimated toxicity if the ratio of the slopes of the regression curves to each other is used as a rough estimate of the degree of toxicity reduction the model derived δloglc50 predicted by a neutral only calculated δlogd overestimated the real δloglc50 by a factor of about 1 4 this estimate however only refers to the totality of the chemicals and phs considered here and may of course differ for each individual compound and tested ph the respective models based on plipw underestimate the real toxicity for logd based and ion trap detox modelling to a greater extent than those based on pow for the neutral only series however they are almost identical the reason for this is that the ionic species was completely excluded in neutral only modelling and that the interaction particularly of charged molecules with biomembranes makes the fundamental difference between pow and plipw as plipw has been considered more suitable for estimating the distribution of substances between cell membranes and aqueous components such as the outer medium avdeef et al 1998 escher et al 2000 our results suggest that solely chemical distribution patterns cannot be used to infer the resulting toxic effects of a given substance without considering the possibilities for transmembrane uptake of its different species in contrast to previous findings which showed only limited partitioning of ionic species into storage lipids but strong association with the phospholipids of biological membranes escher and sigg 2004 and the conclusion that octanol is not suitable as a surrogate for biomembranes for ionisable chemicals escher et al 2020 our results show that toxicity can be modelled much more reliably on the basis of pow than for plipw the reason for this is probably to be found in the fact that although plipw maps the real conditions of the entire biomembrane including the polar parts of the phospholipids better than pow the charged species of chemicals plausibly interact preferentially with these polar groups on the outward facing parts of the membrane mccarty and mackay 1993 bittermann et al 2014 thus the mere interaction of the charged species with the membrane plipw does not seem to reflect their potential to diffuse through the lipid portion of the bilayer but suggests based on the sheer membrane binding a higher proportion of ions taken up than being actually the case for the solubility of charged organics in only the lipid middle part of the membrane and thus to pass this part by diffusion however the pow seems to be far more suitable which also is plausible as octanol represents a surrogate for long chain fatty acids indeed for ph levels at which the charged species predominates the logdlipw is sometimes considerably larger than the logdow whereas for ph levels resulting in predominantly neutral molecules logdlipw and logdow tend to equalise the chemical properties of biomembranes and the charged species should be regarded also responsible for the estimation of the toxicity exerted by organic ions and for the assumption that the toxicity caused by the charged species is exerted via binding to water soluble components in the cytoplasm e g proteins henneberger et al 2016a 2016b the fact that an effect of charged species on membranes is limited according to this interpretation can very well be mechanistically explained by the fact that these species may interact with the surfaces of organelle membranes but as already mentioned in the discussion on the cellular uptake above in contrast to the neutral species intercalates only poorly into the lipid part of the bilayer an effect that is considered to trigger narcosis baseline toxicity mccarty and mackay 1993 our concept of the mechanism of uptake and toxicity of the uncharged and charged species is visualised in fig 6 taking into account the different uptake quantities and the assumption that neutral and charged species differ in their intracellular targets and thus show independent action the prerequisites for a concentration addition mixture toxicity modelling approach to simulate effects of ionizable substances which assumes the same mode of action e g altenburger et al 2000 of both species must be critically questioned the disadvantages of this approach in terms of the lack of mechanistic knowledge and the need for a wide range of the ionic species fraction which often cannot be achieved in the ranges of experimentally accessible ph values have already been recognised by baumer et al 2017 and escher et al 2020 however as a short cut concentration addition modelling might result in predictions similar to those of independent action modelling which might be experimentally tackled in future studies 4 3 implementation in the regulation of chemicals our findings may well contribute to improved prospective risk assessment in the process of registration and authorisation of ionisable chemicals as well as in retrospective risk assessment within environmental monitoring like the european water framework directive wfd using environmental quality standards eqs the european food safety authority efsa highlights the importance of the ph in toxicity testing in their aquatic guidance document efsa 2013 consideration should be given to appropriate phs to be used in the test as solubility may be lower but toxicity may be higher in the unionised form than in the ionised form therefore testing of bioconcentration and toxicity of ionisable substances should preferably be conducted at a ph consistent with the more toxic form of the substance whilst remaining within the range required to maintain the health of the control organisms a stable ph is important to ensure that the balance between dissociated and non dissociated forms of the substance is maintained similarly it is noteworthy that this is actually also required by the oecd gd 23 on difficult substances which states that the definitive test should be conducted at a ph consistent with the most toxic form usually the non dissociated form of the test chemical whilst remaining within the range required to maintain the health of the control organisms this may require testing at the ph extremes of the allowable range for test organisms oecd 2019 in our study we were able to show that the toxicity of an ionisable chemical to d rerio embryos in the acute fish embryo toxicity test according to oecd test guideline 236 can differ between environmentally relevant ph values by several orders of magnitude other authors noted similar findings bittner et al 2019a 2019b to account for such high variation in toxicity it is critical to consider the presumably most bioaccumulative fraction of a given test chemical in the respective toxicity test guideline the regulatory consequences of all the considerations above are twofold firstly for existing studies and hence endpoints investigated at a ph different from such a realistic worst case ph the ecotoxicological value should be mathematically corrected to account for worst case conditions as demanded by the oecd gd 23 in order to guarantee the same protection level as for neutral chemicals secondly any new study planned or submitted to authorities should consider the realistic worst case ph condition for the test system used beforehand this hence would require a change in the current testing practice i e it has to be ensured that test laboratories are able to test the respective species for the required worst case ph since this often depends on the water quality natural ph of the local drinking or spring water at the test laboratory the free choice of test laboratories must be limited in this regard as it is for example not possible to adjust the ph for thousands of litres of medium in case of a fish acute toxicity test we propose that the basis for the mathematical correction should be the delta between the logd value based on kow eq 1 at the given ph of the test under consideration and the logd value at the realistic worst case ph of the respective test guideline both calculated as shown in eqs 10 13 as described above the difference in the ratio of uncharged to charged species at the ph used in the toxicity study ph studied and at the ph of the worst case scenario ph worst case is simply calculated as the delta between the logd values at the two phs 10 δ log d worst case studied log d ph worst case log d ph studied with ph worst case corresponding to the environmentally realistic worst case ph i e the one with the highest fraction of the neutral species that the test organism can tolerate and ph studied corresponding to the ph at which the toxicity test has actually been conducted the mathematical correction factor cf for toxicity estimated for the worst case scenario then can be calculated as 11 cf 1 0 δ log d worst case studied because there is strong evidence for a 1 1 correlation between δlog d and the delta of experimental toxicity for numerous ionisable chemicals present study schweizer et al 2022 the correction factor as described above eq 11 should be applied to each empirical ecotoxicological endpoint according to the actual test ph in order to derive realistic worst case effect data ec50 or noec for the ionisable compound under assessment on the basis of the relationships between logd and acute toxicity explored in the present study it is hence easily possible to directly determine the lethal concentration lc50 of an ionisable chemical at a particular ph with a high degree of accuracy even if only an lc50 value for a different ph is available e g when a dossier is submitted to a regulatory authority in order to determine the realistic worst case toxicity 12 log l c 50 predicted ph log l c 50 given ph log d ow given ph log d ow predicted ph or in delogarithmized notation 13 l c 50 predicted ph l c 50 given ph 1 0 logdow given ph logdow predicted ph this is particularly relevant if the toxicity is to be determined for a worst case scenario covered by oecd guidelines as an example this procedure is explained below for the selected chemicals diclofenac as a weak acid and metoprolol as a weak base if the lc50 of 19 7 mg l at ph8 determined for diclofenac in the present study is used as a basis for determining the lc50 at an environmentally relevant and realistic worst case ph6 this results in a predicted lc50 of 0 61 mg l this value shows a remarkably high agreement with the experimentally determined lc50 of 0 67 mg l for ph6 although it was extrapolated over about 1 5 orders of magnitude the same is true for the base metoprolol based on the rounded lc50 of 3118 mg l experimentally determined for ph6 the lc50 for an environmentally relevant and realistic worst case according to oecd guidelines at ph8 is calculated to be 90 0 mg l which quite accurately reflects the value experimentally determined for this ph i e 61 4 mg l in this way the toxicities for other ph values can also be determined mathematically for both chemicals over three orders of magnitude and their comparison with experimentally determined data shows remarkably high correlation values and slopes of the regression lines of almost 1 0 fig 7 subsequently such realistic worst case corrected toxicity values should then be used to derive the regulatory threshold or eqs in fact such a correction has recently been applied to a dossier for the derivation of an eqs datasheet jrc 2022 in accordance with the recommendation of this paper an extensive dataset exists for the non steroidal anti inflammatory pharmaceutical ibuprofen comprising data from various aquatic ecotoxicity studies which have been performed at various phs without endpoint correction this inconsistency would have resulted in a species sensitivity distribution ssd with higher uncertainty but our method made it possible to create a ph corrected ssd for the worst case scenarios with higher confidence in the end a deterministic approach was endorsed based on the noec of 55 μg l for danio rerio tested at ph 7 7 5 corrected to a worst case noec of 6 88 µg l for ph 6 5 applying a safety factor of 50 the scientific committee on health environmental and emerging risks scheer of the eu has set the eqs for ibuprofen on the basis of the ph corrected noec to 0 14 µg l on december 5 2022 scheer 2022 as a perspective the concept of mathematically correcting endpoints may also be applied to other properties of ionisable compounds such as e g the capability for bioaccumulation commonly measured as bcf however in such case the relationship between δlog d and the delta of the respective chemical property must first be established and may deviate from the 1 1 relationship observed here 5 conclusion this comprehensive study on the modes of action and effects of ionisable chemicals on zebrafish embryos allows three main conclusions 1 toxicity modelling for ionizable substances with a molecular weight of a few 100 da which are not actively taken up intracellularly via cellular transport must consider the toxicity of the charged species which on the average is lower than that of the uncharged species 2 the partition coefficient plipw may be more suitable than pow at mapping the association of a chemical compound with biomembranes but in our study pow has been shown to be more appropriate when the transmembrane uptake of a chemical and its intracellular action are in the focus of modelling 3 the δlogd generated by a full extra and intracellularly logd dependant partitioning based here shortly called logd based model using pow as a descriptor for the trans membrane diffusion capability of organic chemicals has outstanding potential for implementation in the registration and authorization of chemicals due to its exceptionally high precision to predict toxicities at ph levels under worst case scenarios it was already applied for the first time by the eu in december 2022 in deriving the draft eqs value for ibuprofen taking into account a worst case scenario for surface waters modelled in this way it would be desirable if this approach was used also for future eqs derivations for ionizable chemicals and in the process of registration and authorization of such

14886,depending on the ambient ph ionizable substances are present in varying proportions in their neutral or charged form the extent to which these two chemical species contribute to the ph dependant toxicity of ionizable chemicals and whether intracellular ion trapping has a decisive influence in this context is controversially discussed against this background we determined the acute toxicity of 24 ionizable substances at up to 4 different ph values on the embryonic development of the zebrafish danio rerio and supplemented this dataset with additional data from the literature the lc50 for some substances diclofenac propranolol fluoxetine differed by a factor of even 103 between ph5 and ph9 to simulate the toxicity of 12 acids and 12 bases six models to calculate a ph dependant logd value as a proxy for the uptake of potentially toxic molecules were created based on different premises for the trans membrane passage and toxic action of neutral and ionic species and their abilities to explain the real lc50 data set were assessed using this approach we were able to show that both neutral and charged species are almost certainly taken up into cells according to their logd based distribution and that both species exert toxicity since two of the models that assume all intracellular molecules to be neutral overestimated the real toxicity it must be concluded that the toxic effect of a single charged intracellularly present molecule is on the average lower than that of a single neutral molecule furthermore it was possible to attribute differences in toxicity at different ph values for these 24 ionizable substances to the respective deltas in logd at these ph levels with high accuracy enabling particularly a full logd based model on the basis of logpow as a membrane passage descriptor to be used for predicting potential toxicities in worst case scenarios from existing experimental studies as stipulated in the process of registration of chemicals and the definition of environmental quality standards eqs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords danio rerio ecotoxicity eqs fet oecd 236 pharmaceuticals data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it has long been known that the quantitative uptake of organic chemicals into cells and associated with this their potential to be toxic depends on the lipophilicity of these substances according to their octanol water coefficient pow or lipid water coefficient plipw pow and plipw or their logarithms describe the relationship between lipophilicity and hydrophilicity of a given substance high logp values characterise lipophilic chemicals low hydrophilic ones for substances with variable lipophilicity such as ionisable chemicals however this relationship is much more complicated and thus requires a more differentiated view an ionizable substance can be present in several species neutral or ionic by association or dissociation and each of these species can be assigned its own logp value the partitioning of these species however is ph dependant to account for different partition patterns of neutral and ionic species the actual lipophilicity of an ionizable compound under given ph conditions is denoted by the combined partition coefficient logd in this context the lipophilicity of the neutral species is given as logdneutral that of the ionic species as logdionic both often forming a plateau across a range of ph levels in general the distribution coefficient logd can be determined on the basis of the distribution of the chemical between octanol and water logdow or between liposomes and water logdlipw in this work we comparatively consider these different concepts due to their sheer number franco et al 2010 ionisable compounds are of great importance in the environment depending on environmentally relevant ph fluctuations in the medium these substances switch their speciation and lipophilicity amongst different states of charge which changes their ability to be taken up by cells and to exert toxic effects in them rendal et al 2011a 2012 neuwoehner and escher 2011 baumer et al 2017 bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b to mathematically handle the relationship between ph conditions bioaccumulation of ionisable substances via bioconcentration factor bcf determinations and the resulting toxicity mostly ec50 values various approaches were chosen each of which referred to selected properties of the chemicals under consideration and when comparing the toxicity exerted by them on different organisms the different fat and protein contents of these thus different models exist today that are well capable to explain the uptake and biological effect for selected trophic level specific endpoints rendal et al 2011a 2012 neuwoehner and escher 2011 baumer et al 2017 bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b goss et al 2018 whose suitability and limitations however have been critically reviewed rendal et al 2011b escher et al 2020 for a reliable modelling of ph dependant toxicity in this context it is crucial to know the proportion of charged and uncharged chemical species outside and inside the cells of an exposed organism the quantity of charged and uncharged species that passively diffuse through the outer cell membrane into the cell interior or are actively taken up by transporters and whether the intracellularly exerted toxicity is exclusively caused by one single chemical species possibly the uncharged species that binds to intracellular membrane structures or by both species according to a given toxic potential to reduce the complexity of the relationships here we focus on monoprotic ionisable chemicals for which no active transmembrane transport is known and for which uptake can therefore be assumed exclusively via passive diffusion applying a single test system only the fish embryo test fet using developing zebrafish danio rerio in its embryonic stages nevertheless our approach followed the basic mechanistic relationships outlined above and schematically visualised in fig 1 considering the modulating effect of different substance properties acids vs bases and external ph conditions fig 2 we aim at 1 understanding which uptake and effect pathways are used by the different chemical species and which ones are ultimately relevant for the resulting toxicity of a chemical at prevailing ph values furthermore we aim at 2 establishing a model for the reliable prediction of ph dependant basal toxicity that can be generalised across many substance classes for this we have set up six mechanistic models each of which is taking different possible processes and interactions into account figs 1 and 2 and tested their reliability and predictive power using an extensive data set of 24 ionisable chemicals based on our own experiments and published data bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b schweizer et al 2022 we hypothesise that the model that specifies the logd value for a given substance such that this value correlates most strongly with experimentally collected embryotoxicity data captures those parameters and processes that are mechanistically responsible for the observed differences in ph related toxicity therefore we formulated three sets of models each set comprising two similar models which differed only in the selection of the descriptor for trans membrane passage of chemical species to simulate a most realistic putatively effective logd curve that should approximate the quantitative course of the uptake of potentially toxic molecules in which based on theories formulated in the past different parameters were included each model set consisted of two models using identical mathematics but either were based on pow or on plipw the reason for this was that on one hand pow is generally used as a proxy to estimate the bioaccumulation of organic chemicals in whole animals whereas plipw is considered to directly describe the association of organic chemicals with biomembranes avdeef et al 1998 escher et al 2000 a the first set of models considered all the processes outlined in figs 1 and 2 processes 1 2 3 4 and 5 in fig 1 and assumed that both the uncharged and the charged species of a given chemical are passively membrane permeable although the uncharged form permeates membranes unequally better for the ph dependant ratios and lipophilicities we assumed a logd based distribution of both species this model set also implied an automatic adjustment of a logd dependant equilibrium within the cell according to the intracellular ph and furthermore assumed that both the uncharged and the charged species contribute to toxicity we here call these models full extra and intracellularly logd dependant partitioning based herafter briefly logd based i e for both pow and plipw in effect the two models in this set both consist of a linear part where both the neutral and the ionic species contribute to logd as well as two plateaus each dominated by one of the two species the neutral plateau represents the highest logd values due to about 100 of the neutral more lipophilic species being present while the lower ionic plateau is located at the ph range at which 99 ionic species are present b in contrast the second set of models just considered the uptake of the neutral species present under the given ph conditions ignored a possible intracellular formation of charged molecules and implied that all molecules taken up by the cell exert the same level of toxicity thus only processes 1 and 2 listed in fig 1 were considered for these models this set of models was based on the assumption that only the neutral form of an ionisable chemical will enter the organic phase ecetoc 2013 and thus can passively diffuse through membranes intracellular ion trapping was neglected and so there was no intracellular conversion to any ionic species taken into consideration and basic toxicity was supposed to be exerted by the entire intracellular fraction of the chemical neutral only models hence there is no ionic plateau formed and consequently the log d calculated on the basis of this approach gradually decreases over the entire ph range c the third model set also considered an exclusive uptake of neutral species into the cell process 1 in fig 1 however it also took into account that due to the difference of the intracellular cytoplasmic ph value from that of the external medium a re distribution of uncharged and charged species takes place ion trap process 5 in fig 1 and thus the toxic effect of the entirety of the intracellular fraction of the chemical process 2 in fig 1 is modulated by this ion trapping in this model no toxicity is attributed to the charged species and any toxic effect is assumed to be exerted exclusively by the intracellular concentration of the neutral species of the chemicals thus implying that the ion trapping process contributes to the detoxification of a distinct portion of the intracellular fraction this model set will be referred to as ion trap detox in the following all in all we thus calculated six models table 1 three sets with two models each based on pow and plipw and assessed their suitability or more precisely the suitability of the logd values calculated by each of these models for each chemical at a given ph to explain the toxicities lc50 data found experimentally in the danio rerio embryotoxicity test at different ph values for 24 ionisable substances we further assumed that those of the theoretically conceivable processes for the uptake and toxic action of chemicals in cells that had been used in the construction of the best fit models also reflected the real processes responsible for toxicity however the central intention of our study was not only to elucidate quantitative aspects of the uptake and toxic effects of the differently charged species of chemicals but in particular to develop a practicable tool for the reliable prediction of ph dependant relative differences in embryotoxicity of those substances whose effects have been solely determined at a single ph value e g those for which initial registration has been applied for within the framework of chemical authorisation such a model that corrects the empirical effect value in a given study to worst case ph conditions should have great potential to be implemented in the official registration and risk assessment of ionisable chemicals 2 material and methods 2 1 substance properties and buffer systems twenty seven ionizable substances listed in table 2 have been subject to zebrafish embryo toxicity testing fet at up to 4 different ph levels according to oecd guideline 236 oecd 2013 amongst them two compounds the nonsteroidal selective oestrogen receptor modulator enclomiphene and the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid could not be integrated into the modelling because toxicity data could be reliably generated for a single ph only and or could only be unreliably generated by extrapolation furthermore in the case of citric acid the chemical was actively taken up by membrane bound transporters and therefore could not be incorporated into models exclusively based on passive diffusion as uptake pathway the water solubility of ionisable substances is usually given for a neutral ph table 2 hence these values may be underestimating the solubility for those ph levels at which the chemical is present largely in its ionised hydrophilic form therefore for a number of substances high concentrations could be dissolved and tested without solvent at ph levels that entail predominantly the ionic species of these chemicals only in some cases it was necessary to involve a solvent table 2 finally a total of 24 ionisable chemicals 12 acids and 12 bases were included in the modelling the identities and all relevant physicochemical properties of the included substances as well as information on the source of the data and the chemicals the tested ph levels the concentration range and the occasionally used solvents are given in table 2 data for four additional substances i e cetirizine dimethindene doxylamine genistein have been taken from bittner et al 2019a 2019b while data for additional ph values were available for five substances tested by the authors i e diclofenac ketotifen metoprolol naproxen propranolol from bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b all other data originated from own experiments using the methodology described below to keep the test systems at constant phs four different buffer systems were used a potassium hydrogen phthalate buffer ph 5 according to clark and lubs 1916 a phosphate buffer based on sodium phosphate monobasic and sodium phosphate dibasic ph 6 as well as a tris buffer ph 8 pufferan 99 9 p a cas 77 86 1 roth carl roth gmbh co kg karlsruhe germany and a glycine buffer ph 9 according to sørensen 1912 the buffer solutions were prepared with reconstituted water which consisted of 25 ml of 0 23 g l kcl 2 59 g l nahco3 4 93 g l mgs4o 7 h2o and 11 76 g l cacl2 2 h2o each and 900 ml double distilled water hcl and naoh were applied to adjust the test media to the exact ph value prior to the test 2 2 test design and concentrations in order to determine the concentration of a test substance being lethal to 50 of the test organisms lc50 at highest possible accuracy three test runs were conducted for each substance and ph combination with differing test concentrations for concentrations see table 2 the spacing of test concentrations for the first run run 1 was generally set wider to cover mortalities of danio rerio embryos between 0 and 100 after 96 h post fertilisation hpf test concentrations were determined on the basis of literature reported acute lethal concentrations for adult fish i e oecd 203 or based on qsar predictions ecosar u s epa 1994 in a second run run 2 the concentration range was adjusted to ideally induce mortalities between 20 and 80 after 96 hpf a third run run 3 offered the possibility to cover the concentration range around 50 mortality more precisely in runs 1 and 2 usually four concentrations per substance and ph were tested compared to five concentrations in the third run provided that the controls did not differ significantly from each other data points obtained from all experimental runs were merged into a single dose response relationship and used collectively for statistical analyses 2 3 maintenance of zebrafish two equally sensitive strains of zebrafish danio rerio established at the animal physiological ecology laboratory of tübingen university were equally used for egg production the abtl strain obtained from the institute of neurobiology tübingen university and the westaquarium strain that originated from heidelberg university but had been bred at the animal physiological ecology laboratory for many years the two strains were kept in separate 90 200 l tanks filled with a 1 1 mixture of filtered tap water ae 2 l water filter coming with an abl 0240 29 activated carbon filter 0 3 μm reiser seligenstadt germany and purified water at a constant temperature of 27 1 c to ensure optimal water quality the physicochemical water parameters were kept in the following ranges ph 7 4 0 2 conductivity 260 350 µs cm oxygen saturation 100 5 total hardness 8 12 dh 142 4 213 6 mg l caco3 nitrate 1 5 mg l nitrite 0 025 1 mg l and the water was changed every two weeks by removing and refilling at least 30 50 of the total water volume of the tanks zebrafish were kept at an artificial 12 12 day night cycle and fed three times daily with dry flake food tetramin tetra gmbh melle germany and at least twice weekly with a mixture of mosquito larvae and glass worms poseidon aquakultur freeze ruppichteroth germany for protein supplement 2 4 fish embryo test fet to trigger egg production in otherwise unequipped fish tanks plexiglas breeding boxes 20 20 6 cm were introduced the evening before the test start the breeding boxes were covered with a metal mesh to avoid predation on the eggs and artificial sea grass was added on top as optical spawning stimulus since zebrafish spawn at sunrise eggs could be collected the following morning 1 1 5 h after the onset of light the eggs were rinsed with lukewarm tap water and transferred into glass container filled with artificial water the fertilisation rate 80 according to oecd 236 was checked under a stereo microscope stemi 2000 c zeiss oberkochen germany the embryo test with d rerio was carried out in glass petri dishes to avoid a reduction of bioavailability of the test material by adsorption all petri dishes were filled with the test solution containing the chemical at least 24 h prior to the test and emptied and refilled directly before test start to assure saturation of the glass walls subsequently the eggs were transferred into pre exposure petri dishes 70 mm in diameter filled with test solution of the respective substance concentrations and incubated at 26 1 c in a heating cabinet for two hours after incubation well developed eggs at the same developmental stage 128 256 cell stage according to kimmel et al 1995 were picked and transferred into the test petri dishes 30 mm in diameter for both the first and second run four concentrations per ph were tested using four petri dishes with four embryos per treatment each to avoid pseudo replication near the expected lc50 the third run consisted of five concentrations per ph and included ten petri dishes with one embryo each despite different procedures in run1 2 and run 3 this experimental design particularly allowed the determination of lc50 values by means of nonlinear regression analysis with high precision for each ph level a buffer control was run at the respective ph the embryos were then incubated at 26 1 c in a heating cabinet for 96 hpf with an artificial day night cycle of 12 12 h embryos were checked every 12 24 h for mortality and dead individuals and empty eggshells were removed to avoid oxygen deprivation due to bacterial degradation processes the ph was measured during the test in at least one petri dish per concentration daily exemplarily to assure ph stability since ph 5 and ph 9 are marking the periphery of the zebrafish s tolerance range mcclure et al 2006 spence et al 2006 lawrence 2007 horng et al 2009 control mortalities occasionally exceeded 10 after 96 h all experiments were terminated and the embryos euthanised with ms222 tricaine methane sulphonate pharmaq ltd fordingbridge uk 2 5 chemical analysis to verify the nominal concentrations that determined the lc50 for all chemicals at the different ph values we carried out further exposures under the same conditions as in the toxicity tests described above but exclusively with concentrations in close proximity to the lc50s determined by regressions see above which enabled us to take sufficiently large volumes of exposure medium for chemical analysis at the beginning and end of the exposure period of 96 h in each case all chemicals analytical standards internal standards etc were purchased in the highest available purity and are listed in detail in the supplementary information s1 reference standard solutions were used to determine the concentration range that provides a linear signal response for each analyte preliminary dilution tests were performed with samples of the exposure media to ensure that the concentration of the diluted sample was included in the linear dynamic range of the instrument the exposure media samples were filtered through 0 2 μm rc syringe filters and diluted based on the preliminary test results afterwards equal amounts of methanol and the diluted samples were transferred into glass vials to reach a final constitution of 1 1 v v methanol h2o finally the samples were spiked with stable isotope labelled internal standards is in different concentration for each analyte and stored at 80 c until the lchrms analysis the sample preparation procedure is described in the supplementary information s2 analysis of the exposure media samples was carried out using a uhplc qtof ms system equipped with a uhplc apparatus dionex ultimate 3000 rslc thermo fisher scientific dreieich germany and coupled to the qtof ms mass analyser maxis impact bruker daltonics bremen germany the lchrms analyses were conducted in reversed phase liquid chromatography rplc in both positive and negative ionization modes chromatographic separation was performed using an acclaim rslc c18 column 2 1 100 mm 2 2 μm from thermo fischer scientific dreieich germany detailed information about instrumental analysis is provided in the supplementary information s3 a target screening workflow presented in detail in the supplementary information s4 was used to identify the different analytes reference standard solutions were analysed utilizing lc esi qtofms processing of the raw data was implemented with the software tools data analysis 5 3 and tasq client 2 1 bruker daltonics bremen germany an in house database containing analytical information for all the analytes was compiled and used to screen the samples s4 the detection of the substances was based on specific screening parameters mass accuracy 5 mda retention time shift 0 2 min isotopic fitting 200 msigma only for confirmation of positive findings whereas the presence of characteristic qualifier ions was considered mandatory for their successful identification quantification was performed using standard addition calibration curves the is were used in the quantification process to achieve reliable and accurate quantitative results for that reason relative areas have been used the area of each substance has been divided by the area of the respective is s4 the concentration of each analyte in the samples was determined by using these calibration curves 2 6 determination of lethal concentrations using 96 hpf cumulative mortality data based on binomial distributions non linear regressions were run with the drc package in the open source software r ritz et al 2016 to fit dose response curves for up to four individual models three parametric log logistic log normal and weibull 1 to derive individual lc50s lethal concentration at which 50 of the embryos die together with the upper and lower boundaries of the 95th confidence intervals the parametric models were performed with an upper boundary condition at 1 for some substances that could not be tested beyond their water solubility or with a very wide effect gradient we added grid points at substantially higher concentrations where a full effect was expected as an additional boundary condition to stabilise the models control data of the three test runs were pooled for each ph to derive the final lc50 value the results of the best models were selected based on their aic values and in case of equally good models where the delta of the aic values was smaller or equal to five burnham and anderson 2004 the mean of the model ensemble was used see schweizer et al 2022 additional concentration response data were taken from bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b digitized and treated in the same way to derive comparable lc50 values that were concurrently used for modelling 2 7 modelling of ph dependant differences in order to examine which physicochemical processes during membrane passage and within the cell might determine the observed ph related differences in toxicity three types of models were generated and tested for their suitability to best represent the experimentally collected toxicity data for these three model types two models were generated each one on the basis of log pow n octanol water partitioning and the other on the basis of log plipw i e the partitioning coefficient between artificial liposomes zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine which are considered mimicking biological membranes escher and schwarzenbach 1996 avdeef et al 1998 and water the distribution ratios of the neutral species of ionisable compounds are very similar in the octanol and the liposome water system but the charged species partition was found to be significantly higher in the anisotropic lipid bilayer than into the bulk phase octanol escher and schwarzenbach 1996 it was therefore assumed that eventually the distribution ratio of klipw is a more suitable descriptor for the uptake of ionizable compounds into biological membranes than the corresponding kow escher and schwarzenbach 1996 vaes et al 1998 bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b escher et al 2020 in the following both descriptors are compared for their explanatory value to predict the ph dependant toxicity in the fet for the following three different model types in the following equations logd is meant to be the putatively effective partition coefficient that corresponds to at least the exerted baseline toxicity and the subscript x in the descriptors of lipophilicity dx or px always stands for either subscript ow octanol water or subscript lipw liposomes water logd based models 1 log d x log 10 f neut ral 10 logpx neut ral f ionic 10 logpx ionic for the neutral fraction applies 2 f n e u t

stands for the fraction of either the neutral or ionic species considering the difference between chemical species partitioning between the exterior and the interior of cells assuming a ph of 7 3 for the internal cytoplasm of fish embryos thereby logd potentially considers both the neutral and the ionic form of the substance concurrently and therefore represents a kind of mixture exposure to both chemical species however once chemical species enter the fish embryo cells the chemicals are subjected to the internal ph of the cytoplasm set to 7 3 according to madshus 1988 who gives a regular ph 7 0 7 4 for this parameter depending on the external ph absolute concentrations of internal fractions vary while the relative internal equilibrium stays the same the reason is that part of the neutral species that entered the embryo will be intracellularly ionized or vice versa depending on the character of the compound acid or base and whether the mean logd of the substance in the cytoplasm is lower or higher than that in the extracellular medium since the ion trap detox models assume that the ionised species does not develop any toxicity the result would generally be a lower toxic effect than suggested from the logd in the external medium δlogd as proxy for ph dependant differences in order to estimate the potential difference in the resulting effect value lc50 of two fet tests at two given ph levels ph i and ph ii the novel term δlogd was introduced which could be considered as factorial difference of the logd values that have been generated through algorithmisation for these two ph levels 8 δ log d log d ph i log d ph ii the parameter δlogd strongly depends on the two ph levels of the exposure media of two tests with an identical substance to be compared and describes the potential difference of the test substance to be taken up by the fish embryo and hence to cause toxicity 2 8 statistics the quality of the models to correspond with the mortality data was assessed by root mean square error rmse calculation for the 14 chemicals that were tested at least at 4 ph levels i e including literature data significance of mean rmses was checked by welch s anova followed by benjamini hochberg correction for multiple comparisons initial p 0 05 to assess the relationship between log d and toxicity at different phs i e ph i and ph ii the δ log lc50 values at 96 hpf were calculated according to eq 9 for all possible binary combinations of ph for each of the given substances and correlated with the respective δ log d 9 δ log l c 50 log l c 50 ph i log l c 50 ph ii a linear regression was run with the combined data set of all substances using r software version 4 2 1 r core team 2021 3 results 3 1 chemical analysis the chemical analyses of the compounds were performed as indicated for fets separately conducted at the respective lc50s across all chemicals chemical analytics revealed in the majority of cases 93 out of 121 a recovery i e nominal vs measured concentration rate of 30 or higher and in about half of the cases a rate of 50 or higher table 3 across most of the chemicals the measured concentration of the water samples from the start 0 h and the end 96 h of the exposure experiments were at the same range if the standard deviation was taken into consideration for this reason all modelling was based on the nominal effect concentrations for each chemical 3 2 embryotoxicity in the fet based on the three stage toxicity test design carried out for each substance at different ph values at least 13 test concentrations could be considered in robust concentration response relationships and hence lc50 values for 20 substances could be determined with high accuracy fig 3 exemplarily displays the observed mortalities for the weak acid diclofenac and the weak base metoprolol for four ph conditions from 5 to 9 in accordance with the expectations all acids including diclofenac exerted its embryotoxicity at gradually lower concentrations when ph gradually decreases on the contrary bases such as metoprolol exhibited lower lc50 values with increasing ph the concentration response curves for all substances are displayed in the supplementary information s5 thereby the compounds exhibiting the largest differences between lc50s at the two most distant phs were diclofenac factor 1715 propranolol factor 1574 and fluoxetine factor 1046 within the environmentally relevant ph range between ph6 and ph8 the lc50 values for these three substances varied by the factors 61 4 propranolol 29 4 diclofenac and 26 9 fluoxetine on the contrary we observed very little differences factors 3 for compounds like dcp or triclosan which were tested at or close to their neutral plateaus as well as for cetirizine tested at its ionic plateau table 4 and fig s2 additional lc50 values at other ph conditions for 5 test chemicals i e diclofenac naproxen ketotifen metoprolol propranolol and for four additional substances i e cetirizine dimethindene doxylamine genistein were determined using data published by bittner et al 2018 2019a 2019b however data for three tested substances could not be used for modelling because the data were too uncertain as the lc50 would have to be generated by extrapolation or just for a single ph only due to low solubility i e enclomiphene imidacloprid moreover the natural compound citric acid is known to be actively taken up via membrane bound transporters it was tested for toxicity at three different ph values but showed little ph dependant difference in toxicity due to the active uptake pathway data not shown as compared to the rather large differences expected according to log d the latter observation only served to show that the approach used in our study cannot be transferred to substances actively regulated by cells thus data for 24 ionisable substances i e 12 acids and 12 bases were finally included in the modelling approaches 3 3 modelling the ph dependence of embryotoxicity exerted by the 24 substances could be reproduced in very different quality by the six different models some models which took into account different aspects of the possible uptake pathways and theoretically possible toxic effects of charged and uncharged chemical species reproduced the observed differences of these ph dependencies very well others however only insufficiently although the potential for reliable modelling of real data was indeed substance specific and thus some models were suitable for selected chemicals only and less suitable for others it became clear that three models performed best and mirrored the effect data equally well as they did not differ significantly welch s anova with benjamini hochberg correction the mean root mean square errors rmse sd calculated for the respective best fit models for those 14 substances with at least 4 tested ph values for compounds with less data i e ph levels the rmses are hardly meaningful were almost identical 0 15 0 06 for the logd based pow model and 0 14 0 05 for both neutral only pow or plipw models the other three models reflected the real effect lc50 data significantly less accurately than each of the former ones and their rmses were in ascending order 0 30 0 22 for the logd based plipw model 0 36 0 20 for the ion trap detox pow model and 0 41 0 23 for the ion trap detox plipw model these latter three models did not show any significant differences amongst one another welch s anova with benjamini hochberg correction exemplarily the potential of the models to reflect the distribution of the real data measured in the experiments is visualised for two compounds i e diclofenac and metoprolol in fig 4 the best fit of all models for all 24 substances is displayed in the supplementary information s6 statistical testing of differences amongst the models is displayed in the supplementary information s7 for the three models found to be reliable in the rmse analysis there was also a very strong to excellent correlation symbolized by high concordance correlation coefficients ccc and high coefficients of determination r2 of the differences in the effective logd values calculated for binary combinations of ph values referred to as δlogd with the differences in mortality at the same ph values referred to as δlc50 this main finding of the study can be visualised when the lc50 measurements are logarithmised and plotted versus the modelled effective distribution coefficient in the external medium fig 5 it can be clearly seen that for the log d based model on the basis of pow the now linearised dependence of log lc50 and effective log d runs almost identical to the bisector through the 1 1 origin in a nice uniformity for all substances investigated in fact all other models lag behind it regarding the uniformity of the predictions for the various substances weak acids and bases alike as well as with regard to the deviations from the bisector i e the slope using this correlation it is thus possible with the help of the δlogd pow based model to infer very reliably from a known lc50 for an ionisable chemical at a given ph to the lc50 of the same chemical at a different ph e g within the framework of worst case scenarios with limitations this is also possible using one of the two neutral only models but with less accuracy as these models overestimate observed toxicity changes with ph shifts of one unit by a factor of about 1 4 the three remaining models however drastically underestimate real toxicity changes with ph shifts i e flatter slopes and thus failed to prove any ability to infer from the toxicity exerted by a chemical at a given ph to the toxic effect at another ph 4 discussion following our findings and against the background of the available literature on the topic which was critically reviewed in two excellent reviews rendal et al 2011b escher et al 2020 our study opens up new insights into the mode of action of the neutral and charged species of ionisable organic chemicals and provides a novel methodology for simulating worst case scenario toxicity mechanistically the difference between the three sets of our models was that they took into account different aspects of the uptake and toxicity of chemicals full extra and intracellularly logd dependant partitioning based i e shortly logd based uptake of charged ionic and uncharged neutral species into the cell intracellular equilibrium between uncharged and charged species which both may exert toxicity neutral only uptake of only uncharged species into the cell equal toxicity of all uptaken molecules ion trap detox uptake of only uncharged species into the cell and toxicity exerted by only those uptaken molecules that remain neutral in the cell according to the recommendation of escher et al 2020 we focused on the generation of high quality data at constant phs which we achieved by using buffered test media as a simultaneous determination of lc50 and bcf is rarely attainable escher et al 2020 it was also not possible for us to calculate internal lc50 ilc50 values for the test substances of the present study and thus to verify the suitability of a quantitative ion trapping model with absolute values as proposed by escher and hermens 2004 for acids and by neuwoehner and escher 2011 for bases in the study reported here however this task is addressed in current work by our team 4 1 observed ph dependant differences in acute toxicity as known for decades the prevalent ph of the test medium impacts the toxicity of ionisable chemicals stehly and hayton 1990 valenti et al 2009 this has been shown for test organisms across a variety of taxa such as bacteria algae daphnids and fish nakamura et al 2008 neuwoehner and escher 2011 li et al 2018 as compared to non ionizable neutral organic chemicals whose absolute baseline toxicity can be well predicted by the log pow of the compound ionisable substances reach their maximum toxic potential only if tested at a ph level at which the substances are exclusively uncharged while they are significantly less toxic at those ph ranges that induce the ionised forms examples from our study for natural environmental phs to result in mostly neutral species are triclosan or the chlorophenols whereas e g cetirizine is present only in the ionised form under normal environmental conditions the observed differences in ph dependant toxicity could be very large and may cover three orders of magnitude as shown for diclofenac fluoxetine metoprolol and propranolol this finding therefore should also have fundamental consequences for the regulation of chemical risks as will be explained at the end of this chapter 4 2 contribution of neutral and charged species to toxicity early studies have shown that the toxicity of an ionizable substance increases with increasing fraction of the neutral species of this substance e g rendal et al 2011b this finding has led to the suggestion that the neutral species per se exerts higher toxicity in the cells of an organism however it has to be questioned whether the increased harmful effect in this case is caused by a more severe intracellular action of an uncharged molecule vs a charged one or rather by the differently efficient uptake of the two species per time unit into the cell furthermore an exclusive focus just on the ratio of fractions i e the relative proportion of neutral and ionic species in the assessment of toxicity is certainly not sufficient since according to our results the respective aggregated lipophilicities symbolised by logd are of decisive importance especially as the absolute differences in the lipophilicity of the neutral and ionic species are substance specific the comparison of the approaches to calculate δ logd based on different models provides insight into the mechanisms by which the toxicity of ionizable substances is exerted the logd calculated in each case can be seen here as a proxy for the uptake of potentially toxic molecules and thus its delta as a prediction of the toxicity change to be expected according to the respective models in fig 5 these predictions have been plotted versus the real toxicity changes based on our assumption that the model whose effective logd values correlate most strongly with experimental data on embryotoxicity takes into account those parameters and processes that are mechanistically responsible for the observed toxicity the following conclusions emerge from our results when comparing effective logd and lc50 and the correlation between δlogd and δloglc50 the logd based model on the basis of pow which considers both uptake and toxicity of both the ionized and neutral species predicts the real experimentally quantified toxicity in the comparison of δlogd vs δloglc50 almost perfectly with a slope of 1 019 and an r2 of 0 892 due to a just negligible deviation from a 1 1 relationship of δlogd and δloglc50 it also had the by far highest ccc of all models i e 0 942 since this model has proven to be also suitable for mapping the lethal effects with regard to rmse it must be concluded that both the neutral and the charged species of an ionisable chemical are taken up intracellularly and that both species also contribute to the toxicity at least for the tested ionisable organic substances with a molecular mass of 180 to 406 da the assumption that the ion trapping process leads to a complete ˈdetoxificationˈ of uptaken molecules by converting toxic neutral molecules into the non toxic charged species failed to explain the real toxicity in both ion trap detox models these two models drastically underestimate the real toxicity which must be regarded an indirect proof of the ionic species to contribute to the toxicity exerted by ionisable substances this conclusion is particularly confirmed by the example of cetirizine which exerted similar toxic effects at all three tested phs all of which are in the ionic plateau of the log d curve this should not have been the case if either only the neutral species which essentially is not present at those phs was taken up nor if the ionic species does not contribute to toxicity then no toxic effect would have been observed both neutral only models which assume that only the neutral species enters the cell and exerts the toxicity attributed to neutral molecules in an unchanged manner slightly overestimate the real toxicity with slopes of the regression curves of 1 407 and 1 461 respectively thus it should be assumed that the toxic effect of an ionisable chemical is not exclusively but largely due to the uptake and intracellular action of the neutral species as it is undisputed that an equilibrium between neutral and ionised species must also prevail intracellularly and that ionised molecules also develop toxicity see conclusion above it must also be concluded that the toxicity resulting from the ionised species is somewhat lower than would be expected from the same number of neutral molecules otherwise the neutral only models would not have overestimated toxicity if the ratio of the slopes of the regression curves to each other is used as a rough estimate of the degree of toxicity reduction the model derived δloglc50 predicted by a neutral only calculated δlogd overestimated the real δloglc50 by a factor of about 1 4 this estimate however only refers to the totality of the chemicals and phs considered here and may of course differ for each individual compound and tested ph the respective models based on plipw underestimate the real toxicity for logd based and ion trap detox modelling to a greater extent than those based on pow for the neutral only series however they are almost identical the reason for this is that the ionic species was completely excluded in neutral only modelling and that the interaction particularly of charged molecules with biomembranes makes the fundamental difference between pow and plipw as plipw has been considered more suitable for estimating the distribution of substances between cell membranes and aqueous components such as the outer medium avdeef et al 1998 escher et al 2000 our results suggest that solely chemical distribution patterns cannot be used to infer the resulting toxic effects of a given substance without considering the possibilities for transmembrane uptake of its different species in contrast to previous findings which showed only limited partitioning of ionic species into storage lipids but strong association with the phospholipids of biological membranes escher and sigg 2004 and the conclusion that octanol is not suitable as a surrogate for biomembranes for ionisable chemicals escher et al 2020 our results show that toxicity can be modelled much more reliably on the basis of pow than for plipw the reason for this is probably to be found in the fact that although plipw maps the real conditions of the entire biomembrane including the polar parts of the phospholipids better than pow the charged species of chemicals plausibly interact preferentially with these polar groups on the outward facing parts of the membrane mccarty and mackay 1993 bittermann et al 2014 thus the mere interaction of the charged species with the membrane plipw does not seem to reflect their potential to diffuse through the lipid portion of the bilayer but suggests based on the sheer membrane binding a higher proportion of ions taken up than being actually the case for the solubility of charged organics in only the lipid middle part of the membrane and thus to pass this part by diffusion however the pow seems to be far more suitable which also is plausible as octanol represents a surrogate for long chain fatty acids indeed for ph levels at which the charged species predominates the logdlipw is sometimes considerably larger than the logdow whereas for ph levels resulting in predominantly neutral molecules logdlipw and logdow tend to equalise the chemical properties of biomembranes and the charged species should be regarded also responsible for the estimation of the toxicity exerted by organic ions and for the assumption that the toxicity caused by the charged species is exerted via binding to water soluble components in the cytoplasm e g proteins henneberger et al 2016a 2016b the fact that an effect of charged species on membranes is limited according to this interpretation can very well be mechanistically explained by the fact that these species may interact with the surfaces of organelle membranes but as already mentioned in the discussion on the cellular uptake above in contrast to the neutral species intercalates only poorly into the lipid part of the bilayer an effect that is considered to trigger narcosis baseline toxicity mccarty and mackay 1993 our concept of the mechanism of uptake and toxicity of the uncharged and charged species is visualised in fig 6 taking into account the different uptake quantities and the assumption that neutral and charged species differ in their intracellular targets and thus show independent action the prerequisites for a concentration addition mixture toxicity modelling approach to simulate effects of ionizable substances which assumes the same mode of action e g altenburger et al 2000 of both species must be critically questioned the disadvantages of this approach in terms of the lack of mechanistic knowledge and the need for a wide range of the ionic species fraction which often cannot be achieved in the ranges of experimentally accessible ph values have already been recognised by baumer et al 2017 and escher et al 2020 however as a short cut concentration addition modelling might result in predictions similar to those of independent action modelling which might be experimentally tackled in future studies 4 3 implementation in the regulation of chemicals our findings may well contribute to improved prospective risk assessment in the process of registration and authorisation of ionisable chemicals as well as in retrospective risk assessment within environmental monitoring like the european water framework directive wfd using environmental quality standards eqs the european food safety authority efsa highlights the importance of the ph in toxicity testing in their aquatic guidance document efsa 2013 consideration should be given to appropriate phs to be used in the test as solubility may be lower but toxicity may be higher in the unionised form than in the ionised form therefore testing of bioconcentration and toxicity of ionisable substances should preferably be conducted at a ph consistent with the more toxic form of the substance whilst remaining within the range required to maintain the health of the control organisms a stable ph is important to ensure that the balance between dissociated and non dissociated forms of the substance is maintained similarly it is noteworthy that this is actually also required by the oecd gd 23 on difficult substances which states that the definitive test should be conducted at a ph consistent with the most toxic form usually the non dissociated form of the test chemical whilst remaining within the range required to maintain the health of the control organisms this may require testing at the ph extremes of the allowable range for test organisms oecd 2019 in our study we were able to show that the toxicity of an ionisable chemical to d rerio embryos in the acute fish embryo toxicity test according to oecd test guideline 236 can differ between environmentally relevant ph values by several orders of magnitude other authors noted similar findings bittner et al 2019a 2019b to account for such high variation in toxicity it is critical to consider the presumably most bioaccumulative fraction of a given test chemical in the respective toxicity test guideline the regulatory consequences of all the considerations above are twofold firstly for existing studies and hence endpoints investigated at a ph different from such a realistic worst case ph the ecotoxicological value should be mathematically corrected to account for worst case conditions as demanded by the oecd gd 23 in order to guarantee the same protection level as for neutral chemicals secondly any new study planned or submitted to authorities should consider the realistic worst case ph condition for the test system used beforehand this hence would require a change in the current testing practice i e it has to be ensured that test laboratories are able to test the respective species for the required worst case ph since this often depends on the water quality natural ph of the local drinking or spring water at the test laboratory the free choice of test laboratories must be limited in this regard as it is for example not possible to adjust the ph for thousands of litres of medium in case of a fish acute toxicity test we propose that the basis for the mathematical correction should be the delta between the logd value based on kow eq 1 at the given ph of the test under consideration and the logd value at the realistic worst case ph of the respective test guideline both calculated as shown in eqs 10 13 as described above the difference in the ratio of uncharged to charged species at the ph used in the toxicity study ph studied and at the ph of the worst case scenario ph worst case is simply calculated as the delta between the logd values at the two phs 10 δ log d worst case studied log d ph worst case log d ph studied with ph worst case corresponding to the environmentally realistic worst case ph i e the one with the highest fraction of the neutral species that the test organism can tolerate and ph studied corresponding to the ph at which the toxicity test has actually been conducted the mathematical correction factor cf for toxicity estimated for the worst case scenario then can be calculated as 11 cf 1 0 δ log d worst case studied because there is strong evidence for a 1 1 correlation between δlog d and the delta of experimental toxicity for numerous ionisable chemicals present study schweizer et al 2022 the correction factor as described above eq 11 should be applied to each empirical ecotoxicological endpoint according to the actual test ph in order to derive realistic worst case effect data ec50 or noec for the ionisable compound under assessment on the basis of the relationships between logd and acute toxicity explored in the present study it is hence easily possible to directly determine the lethal concentration lc50 of an ionisable chemical at a particular ph with a high degree of accuracy even if only an lc50 value for a different ph is available e g when a dossier is submitted to a regulatory authority in order to determine the realistic worst case toxicity 12 log l c 50 predicted ph log l c 50 given ph log d ow given ph log d ow predicted ph or in delogarithmized notation 13 l c 50 predicted ph l c 50 given ph 1 0 logdow given ph logdow predicted ph this is particularly relevant if the toxicity is to be determined for a worst case scenario covered by oecd guidelines as an example this procedure is explained below for the selected chemicals diclofenac as a weak acid and metoprolol as a weak base if the lc50 of 19 7 mg l at ph8 determined for diclofenac in the present study is used as a basis for determining the lc50 at an environmentally relevant and realistic worst case ph6 this results in a predicted lc50 of 0 61 mg l this value shows a remarkably high agreement with the experimentally determined lc50 of 0 67 mg l for ph6 although it was extrapolated over about 1 5 orders of magnitude the same is true for the base metoprolol based on the rounded lc50 of 3118 mg l experimentally determined for ph6 the lc50 for an environmentally relevant and realistic worst case according to oecd guidelines at ph8 is calculated to be 90 0 mg l which quite accurately reflects the value experimentally determined for this ph i e 61 4 mg l in this way the toxicities for other ph values can also be determined mathematically for both chemicals over three orders of magnitude and their comparison with experimentally determined data shows remarkably high correlation values and slopes of the regression lines of almost 1 0 fig 7 subsequently such realistic worst case corrected toxicity values should then be used to derive the regulatory threshold or eqs in fact such a correction has recently been applied to a dossier for the derivation of an eqs datasheet jrc 2022 in accordance with the recommendation of this paper an extensive dataset exists for the non steroidal anti inflammatory pharmaceutical ibuprofen comprising data from various aquatic ecotoxicity studies which have been performed at various phs without endpoint correction this inconsistency would have resulted in a species sensitivity distribution ssd with higher uncertainty but our method made it possible to create a ph corrected ssd for the worst case scenarios with higher confidence in the end a deterministic approach was endorsed based on the noec of 55 μg l for danio rerio tested at ph 7 7 5 corrected to a worst case noec of 6 88 µg l for ph 6 5 applying a safety factor of 50 the scientific committee on health environmental and emerging risks scheer of the eu has set the eqs for ibuprofen on the basis of the ph corrected noec to 0 14 µg l on december 5 2022 scheer 2022 as a perspective the concept of mathematically correcting endpoints may also be applied to other properties of ionisable compounds such as e g the capability for bioaccumulation commonly measured as bcf however in such case the relationship between δlog d and the delta of the respective chemical property must first be established and may deviate from the 1 1 relationship observed here 5 conclusion this comprehensive study on the modes of action and effects of ionisable chemicals on zebrafish embryos allows three main conclusions 1 toxicity modelling for ionizable substances with a molecular weight of a few 100 da which are not actively taken up intracellularly via cellular transport must consider the toxicity of the charged species which on the average is lower than that of the uncharged species 2 the partition coefficient plipw may be more suitable than pow at mapping the association of a chemical compound with biomembranes but in our study pow has been shown to be more appropriate when the transmembrane uptake of a chemical and its intracellular action are in the focus of modelling 3 the δlogd generated by a full extra and intracellularly logd dependant partitioning based here shortly called logd based model using pow as a descriptor for the trans membrane diffusion capability of organic chemicals has outstanding potential for implementation in the registration and authorization of chemicals due to its exceptionally high precision to predict toxicities at ph levels under worst case scenarios it was already applied for the first time by the eu in december 2022 in deriving the draft eqs value for ibuprofen taking into account a worst case scenario for surface waters modelled in this way it would be desirable if this approach was used also for future eqs derivations for ionizable chemicals and in the process of registration and authorization of such

14887,persistent and mobile pm substances among the organic micropollutants have gained increasing interest since their inherent properties enable them to enrich in water cycles this study set out to investigate the potential of adsorption onto activated carbon as a drinking water treatment option for 19 pm candidates in batch experiments in a drinking water matrix using a microporous and a mesoporous activated carbon overall adsorption of pm candidates proved to be very variable and the extent of removal could not be directly related to molecular properties at an activated carbon dose of 10 mg l and 48 h contact time five out of 19 substances were readily removed 80 among them n 3 dimethylamino propyl methacrylamide which was investigated for the first time for five other substances no or negligible removal 20 was observed including 2 methyl 2 propene 1 sulfonic acid and 4 hydroxy 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine for the former current state of the art adsorption processes may pose a sufficient barrier additionally substance specific surrogate correlations between removals and uva254 abatements were established to provide a cheap and fast estimate for pm candidate elimination adsorption onto activated carbon could contribute significantly to pm substance elimination as part of multi barrier approaches but assessments for individual substances still require clarification as demonstrated for the investigated pm candidates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords powdered activated carbon emerging contaminants organic micropollutants omp trace organic compounds torcs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction organic micropollutants omp and their behaviors in the aquatic environment and in water treatment have been a topic in research for decades and in recent years persistent and mobile pm substances among omp have attracted increasing interest hale et al 2020a reemtsma et al 2016 as pm substances are poorly biodegraded photodegraded and removed by sorption processes they are prone to penetrate through natural and technical barriers loos et al 2013 scheurer et al 2017 pm substances belong to various substance classes and application fields such as pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals herbicides and pesticides as well as their transformation products and therefore originate from multiple emission sources like households agriculture urban stormwater runoff and industry reemtsma et al 2016 ineffective barriers and climatic changes are anticipated to favor pm substance enrichment in water cycles and thus the contamination of drinking water sources in fact numerous potential pm substances have been detected in the aquatic environment loos et al 2010 neuwald et al 2021 nödler et al 2016 schulze et al 2019 zahn et al 2019 and even in drinking water scheurer et al 2017 zahn et al 2016 to identify persistence for regulatory purposes the use of the degradation half life time in the environment as defined in the annex xiii of reach and applied in the pbt vpvb assessment was proposed arp and hale 2019 in the same context the ph dependent octanol water partition coefficient log d was suggested as a mobility indicator with substances having a log d 4 at a ph range of 4 9 considered mobile arp and hale 2019 however there is an ongoing discussion about how to quantify the mobility of a substance in the scientific community a commonly recognized quantitative definition or quantification method for a compound s mobility in the aquatic environment remains challenging hale et al 2020b kalberlah et al 2014 sigmund et al 2022 the detection of mobile substances has long been limited by the capabilities of traditional chromatographic techniques such as gas chromatography and reversed phase liquid chromatography rplc as analytics advanced the spectrum of substances detected by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry extended to polar and very polar substances reemtsma et al 2016 however the analyses of very polar compounds continues to be a challenge and thus far no analytical method appears to cover all mobile substances but different chromatography approaches mixed mode liquid chromatography supercritical fluid chromatography hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography gas chromatography rplc rather seem to complement each other neuwald et al 2021 zahn et al 2020 the lack of appropriate analytical methods in the past the vast number of newly detected compounds potential pm substances and the time and cost intensive field and laboratory studies required lead to the present knowledge gap on pm substances little is known about their toxic effects on the environment and human health their fate in the aquatic environment and the efficiency of technical treatment options consequently the precautionary principle should be applied to protect human health and the environment although minimizing emissions should be a priority knowledge about remediation options is needed to counteract current and future contamination adsorption onto activated carbon is an established water treatment technique eliminating a broad range of omp jekel et al 2015 kennedy et al 2015 ternes et al 2002 and therefore may be a suitable treatment option for pm substances although adsorption onto activated carbon is known for improved removals of hydrophobic omp ridder et al 2010 previous studies demonstrated removal of polar substances piai et al 2019 sperlich et al 2017 the removal potential of activated carbon depends on adsorbent characteristics the water matrix as well as adsorbate characteristics since adsorption is a surface related process the surface area pore size distribution and surface characteristics of the adsorbent play an important role in the selection of an appropriate activated carbon due to size exclusion and kinetic limitations aschermann et al 2018 dittmann et al 2022 piai et al 2019 previous studies linked adsorption behavior to electric charge molecular weight hydrophobicity polarizability aromaticity and the presence of h bond donor acceptor groups mailler et al 2015 ridder et al 2010 assessing the relationship between adsorbate characteristics and removal behavior may be useful to identify critical substances that may pass through the adsorption step of waterworks to obtain insight into the viability of adsorption onto activated carbon as a treatment option for pm substances 19 potential pm substances hereinafter referred to as pm candidates were tested for their adsorption potential in batch experiments in equilibrium with one mesoporous and one microporous commercially available activated carbon the selection of pm candidates was based on a monitoring in european water samples published by schulze et al 2019 where some pm candidates have been identified for the first time in surface waters or even drinking water three of the pm candidates 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulfonate aamps adamantan 1 amine ata and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid tfmsa were among the 10 most frequently detected novel or scarcely investigated substances identified during a suspect screening by neuwald et al 2021 in samples of two river systems the pm candidates chosen for this study were all characterized by a high polarity median log d 1 4 at ph 7 5 a low molecular weight median 186 g mol and were mostly charged ionic or ionizable organic molecules at the relevant ph systematic persistence data for the investigated substances are lacking however based on their occurrence in water cycles low or negligible biodegradability under environmental conditions was assumed to put the adsorptive removal of the target substances into perspective and directly compare adsorption capacities well known omp were tested as references based on their removals at economical carbon dosages the pm candidates were classified according to their adsorption tendency as uv254 absorbance measurement was proven to be a useful tool for omp removal control altmann et al 2014 anumol et al 2015 uva254 abatement was compared with the removals of the pm candidates 2 materials and methods 2 1 investigated substances in total 25 substances were investigated in this study with abbreviations and relevant characteristics shown in table 1 nine substances were considered well known omp since their adsorption behavior has been studied widely zietzschmann et al 2014 altmann et al 2014 ruhl et al 2015 the well known substances acesulfame ace benzotriazole bta and primidone pri were included in the pm candidate set due to their high mobility and potential persistence under environmental conditions for the compounds log d polarizability maximum projection area and maximum projection diameter predicted values by chemicalize developed by chemaxon were used carbamazepine cbz 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole mbt metoprolol mtp formylaminoantipyrine faa sulfamethoxazole smx and gabapentin gab were analyzed with a separate rplc method thus their retention times are not directly comparable and therefore not included in table 1 and considered for correlations 2 2 activated carbons one microporous activated carbon hydraffin cc and one mesoporous activated carbon epibon a both donau carbon germany based on coconut husk and lignite respectively were used for the batch experiments characteristics of the original granular activated carbons according to aschermann et al 2018 2019 and dittmann et al 2022 are listed in table 2 to obtain uniform adsorbents for evaluations in batch test freihardt et al 2017 both granular activated carbons were pulverized cryomill retsch used without cooling 30 s 30 hz prior to the experiments 2 3 batch experiments three batch experiments with pulverized activated carbon were conducted in 50 ml berlin tap water spiked with omp an overview of the experiments is given in table 3 ion concentrations of the drinking water matrix are provided in table si1 a first screening with two activated carbons aimed to assess the effect of the differing characteristics of the selected activated carbons on well known omp experiment 1 and pm candidate experiment 2 adsorption behavior secondly a comparison between the adsorptive removals of well known omp and selected pm candidates in equilibrium was conducted additional batch experiments data not shown in the same drinking water matrix revealed that 48 h contact time are sufficient to achieve adsorption equilibrium for the following batch experiment 3 the favoured activated carbon was selected additional pm candidates diatrizoic acid dza oxipurinol oxp valsartan acid vsa were included and the resolution of the applied activated carbon doses was increased two mixed stock solutions one for pm candidates and one for well known omp both in ultrapure water and one single solute stock solution containing oxp in ultrapure water and methanol with concentrations of 10 mg l of each analyte were used for spiking the initial target concentrations of 1 and 10 µg l respectively dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in experiment 3 were elevated compared to experiments 1 and 2 due to the methanol in the oxp stock solution in previous studies methanol was found to have no impact on the adsorption of omp onto activated carbon kilduff et al 1998 mailler et al 2016 and its impact on adsorption is therefore not further addressed in this study two activated carbon stock suspensions of 2 and 10 g l respectively were used to apply the aimed activated carbon dose in the corresponding batches a reference batch without activated carbon was prepared in parallel all experiments were carried out at room temperature approx 22 c after 48 h contact time on a horizontal shaker ca 120 rpm mixing frequency the activated carbon was separated by membrane filtration regenerated cellulose 0 45 µm nominal pore diameter to obtain ph values for equilibrium conditions ph measurements were conducted after the experiments 2 4 analytics 2 4 1 doc and uva254 analyses doc was analyzed via catalytic combustion on a variotoc cube elementar analysensysteme germany the uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 was measured by a dual beam spectral photometer lambda 12 uv vis perkin elmer germany using 10 mm quartz cuvettes hellma germany 2 4 2 well known omp analyses the well known omp were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms thereby the analytes were chromatographically separated by a reversed phase xselect hss t3 xp column 2 1 50 mm column waters usa subsequent compound detection was carried out by a triple quadrupole with electro spray ionization tsq vantage thermo fisher usa for each analyte two mass fragments were selected according to the daios database wasserchemische gesellschaft germany the fragments with the largest peak areas and deuterated internal standards were used for quantification further details are described by zietzschmann et al 2019 values below the limit of quantification loq of 0 1 µg l were set to the loq value the removal by activated carbon was calculated in comparison to the reference negative removals were set to 0 2 4 3 pm candidate analyses 2 4 3 1 sample enrichment all samples were enriched by azeotropic evaporation based on a slightly modified method of schulze et al 2020 as described in neuwald et al 2021 in short 4 ml of sample was mixed with 21 ml acetonitrile and evaporated at 40 c under a gentle stream of nitrogen before reconstitution in 200 µl acetonitrile water 90 10 to achieve a concentration factor of 20 the extract was centrifugated and the supernatant chemically analyzed 2 4 3 2 instrumental analysis for instrumental analysis by supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry sfc hrms an acquity upc2 system together with a synapt gs2 quadrupole time of flight high resolution mass spectrometer both waters milford usa were applied chromatographic separation was performed on an acquity upc2 beh column 100 3 mm 1 7 µm waters the gradient and eluent composition were taken from literature neuwald et al 2021 and are given together with further details regarding sfc hrms in the si chapter 1 2 instrumental analyses by sfc hrms 2 4 3 3 calculation of removals and evaluation of matrix effects during instrumental analysis removals of the pm candidates were calculated using peak area ratios of target analytes before and after adsorption onto activated carbon due to a linear relation between analyte concentrations and peak areas that was confirmed by an external calibration curve prepared in ultra pure solvent however the magnitude of signal suppression or enhancement matrix effects of the target analytes during instrumental analysis by sfc hrms is potentially influenced by nonconstant concentrations of sample constituents matrix before and after sample treatment with activated carbon to exclude the influence of matrix effects on peak area ratios before and after sample treatment matrix effects of all analytes were determined as described in the si chapter 1 3 matrix effects matrix effects that lead to suppression or enhancement of the chromatographic signals of ace ata dmbsa dchss mpsa hhtmp sac and tfmsa during chemical analysis by sfc ms were recently reported for a method using a similar mobile phase the same stationary phase and a positive ionization mode as applied in this study schulze et al 2020 therefore matrix effects that influence the instrumental analyses of pm candidates were determined to assure that apparent removals during sample treatment with activated carbon are not exclusively resulting from signal suppression even if pronounced matrix effects between 76 3 for aamps and 80 3 for ptss were found si figure si1 only minor changes 10 after sample treatment with activated carbon si figure si2 were observed with increasing amount of applied activated carbon matrix effects increased in average about 6 1 10 mg l activated carbon 7 8 50 mg l activated carbon and 9 3 100 mg l activated carbon and thus only had a minor impact on measured removals 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing adsorptive removals of well known omp and pm candidates in a first screening with two activated carbons testing a wide range of activated carbon doses 5 500 mg l for the removal of well known omp experiment 1 as well as selected pm candidates experiment 2 the former were removed as expected fig 1 a cbz bta mbt and mtp known as well adsorbing omp were completely removed by both activated carbons applying a typical activated carbon dose of 10 mg l or higher while a dose of 50 mg l activated carbon was necessary to reach 100 removal of faa smx and pri both ace and gab were poorly removed by both activated carbons exhibiting 35 elimination at a dose of 10 mg l overall increasing the activated carbon dose always resulted in improved removal of well known omp in contrast the removal of pm candidates appears to be more diverse tending towards either none or high adsorptive removal fig 1b three of the target substances namely diotog mapma and betmac indicate high affinities towards activated carbon with removals 89 already at the lowest dose 5 mg l in contrast hhtmp tfmsa and mpsa show none or negligible removal 11 even for high activated carbon doses up to 100 mg l increasing the activated carbon dose to 500 mg l only results in a significant removal improvement for mpsa to up to 78 while hhtmp and tfmsa removals remain below 30 table si4 the strongly varying elimination potential of activated carbon for the pm candidates is emphasized in fig 2 where the removals of four pm candidates tfmsa ata mel betmac with a high occurrence in european water samples reported by schulze et al 2019 are shown in relation to the smx removal smx was suggested as an indicator substance for moderate adsorption onto activated carbon jekel et al 2015 and is frequently subject to monitoring and research benotti et al 2009 peng et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 overall well known omp were eliminated on average by 80 while pm candidates were removed considerably less by 63 on average both at an activated carbon dose of 10 mg l 3 2 removals of well known omp and pm candidates by hydraffin cc and epibon a in fig 1 a and b the performance of the microporous hydraffin cc and the mesoporous epibon a for the removal of omp and pm candidates experiment 1 and 2 see table 3 was compared thereby an improved removal by at least 20 for one or more activated carbon doses was set as a benchmark for preferential adsorption as visualized by the dashed lines the difference of at least 20 considers both the experimental and analytical error si chapter 1 4 comparing the adsorptive removals a total of 16 substances hhtmp tfmsa mpsa gab ace ata mel pri smx dchss dmbsa sac betmac mapma mbt diotog showed a very similar affinity towards both activated carbon products accounting for more than 70 of all investigated substances only for four well known omp a distinctive tendency towards the microporous hydraffin cc was identified faa bta cbz mtp this trend was visible only for the lowest activated carbon dose 5 mg l where competition with background organic matter is highest in the present study multi solute adsorption experiments were carried out in the presence of a real drinking water matrix where adsorbates compete for available adsorption sites in competitive adsorption in drinking water and wastewater treatment background organic matter is deemed the major competitor for omp wang et al 2021 zietzschmann 2021 the adsorption competition by background organic matter is considered relatively strong due to large difference in concentration levels worch 2021 here the pm candidates are present in concentration levels of low µg l whereas background organic matter prevails in the lower mg l range of approx 4300 µg l carbon corresponding to ca 8600 µg l background organic matter assuming 50 carbon content of the diverse molecules of background organic matter consequently e g in experiment 2 the total sum of pm candidates ca 13 µg l was more than 650 fold lower than the background organic matter concentration aamps removal of 22 by hydraffin cc at an activated carbon dose of 10 mg l was assumed to be an outlier based on the comparison with removals by epibon a and experiment 3 fig 3 only one compound ptss adsorbed preferentially to epibon a one of the omps preferentially adsorbed by the microporous hydraffin cc is bta the one with the lowest molecular mass 119 g mol fig 1 also ruhl et al 2014 observed the best performance for bta removal to be of a coconut based activated carbon product as hydraffin cc among eight different powdered activated carbons the pore structure of an activated carbon influences the accessibility of its internal surface area in theory small compounds are anticipated to reach further into the porous structure and consequently adsorb better onto microporous activated carbons compared to high molecular weight substances which may be hindered by size exclusion jekel et al 2015 mestre et al 2014 previous analysis of hydraffin cc revealed a high share of the total surface area located in the micropores with 95 compared to 64 of a macroporous activated carbon aschermann et al 2018 however larger molecules such as faa cbz mtp and aamps 207 267 g mol also adsorb well to hydraffin cc the higher bet surface of hydraffin cc table 2 likely contributes to the improved adsorption properties of hydraffin cc compared to epibon a apart from the evident beneficial physical properties of hydraffin cc for the tested omp the adsorbents chemical properties contribute to the removal performance of individual organic compounds nielsen et al 2014 piai et al 2019 accordingly the higher carbon content lower ash content and higher share of micropores of hydraffin cc compared to epibon a table 2 has a positive effect on the adsorption capacity due to the increased number of available adsorption sites as already indicated by the specific surface area furthermore at experimental ph see table 3 the activated carbons differ in their net surface charge due to their respective phpzc see table 2 enabling electrostatic attraction or repulsion of charged compounds however despite the positive net charge of hydraffin cc improved removal was mainly achieved for neutral compounds bta cbz faa rather than for anionic compounds more specific bonding between a compound and the adsorbent may occur on functional groups particularly surface oxygen groups are known to play a key role for the affinity of omp towards activated carbon dittmann et al 2022 a relative high oxygen content and therefore degree of functionalization is present in hydraffin cc compared to epibon a especially at ph 8 2 8 3 the pronounced amount of carboxylic acid groups provides moieties with negative charge in hydraffin cc in contrast to its positive net surface charge this may refer to a significant carbonate content interfering with the phpzc however coconut husk based activated carbons as hydraffin cc contain increased amounts of phenol groups dittmann et al 2022 that are known to chemically react with amide moieties of target compounds nielsen et al 2014 hence the amide structure of aamps faa and cbz is likely to cause enhanced adsorption by hydraffin cc as affirmed by the obtained adsorption results 3 3 categorization of pm candidates building on the previous results hydraffin cc was tested for a wider range of activated carbon dosages adding also more omps to the test set experiment 3 table 3 the results are in line with the previous experiments albeit slightly lower removals 14 lower median removal see figure si4 were achieved due to the higher initial pm substance concentration table 3 based on experiment 3 all investigated pm candidates were categorized according to their removals at a common activated carbon dose of 10 mg l to assess the suitability of an adsorption step as a viable treatment option fig 3 as observed in the screening experiment 2 fig 1b the pm candidates exhibited a broad range of adsorbabilities onto activated carbon in equilibrium at a practice oriented activated carbon dose of 10 mg l nine substances adsorbed poorly 20 60 vsa ptss ata ace or very poorly 20 dza aamps hhtmp mpsa tfmsa fig 3 the lowest removals were achieved for the sulfonic acids tfmsa and mpsa followed by hhtmp all relatively small 150 201 g mol and very mobile log d 1 2 charged aliphatic compounds these three substances do not achieve more than 50 removal even at an extensive dosage of activated carbon of 100 mg l therefore tfmsa mpsa and hhtmp are likely to break through advanced drinking water treatment by activated carbon when present in the respective raw water the short chain perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid tfmsa was detected for the first time in european surface water groundwater and bank filtrate by schulze et al 2019 at estimated concentrations of up to 1 µg l following sampling campaigns including a variety of water samples such as surface and groundwater underlined these findings reporting tfmsa in 94 of all samples with a median concentration of 30 ng l in sweden björnsdotter et al 2019 and concentrations 1 µg l in a wastewater influenced german surface water alb river scheurer et al 2022 the recent detection of tfmsa in the arctic suggests that tfmsa is already ubiquitous in the aquatic environment björnsdotter et al 2021 out of the 19 tested pm candidates five dchss betmac sac dmbsa and mel were moderately 60 80 and five substances diotog bta oxp mapma pri were readily removed achieving 80 removals at an activated carbon dose of 10 mg l except for tfmsa mpsa and hhtmp a strong impact of the activated carbon dose on the adsorptive removals was observed consequently further seven substances dchss betmac sac dmbsa mel vsa and ptss see fig 3 reach good removals 80 applying slightly higher activated carbon doses of 15 to 20 mg l overall knowledge on pm substance removal by adsorption onto activated carbon is still limited to our knowledge this study is the first to address the adsorption potential of mapma dchss mpsa and hhtmp while mpsa and hhtmp are hardly controllable by activated carbon adsorption mapma and to some extent dchss both industrial chemicals registered under reach and used in adhesives and sealants amongst other consumer uses indicate promising adsorption potentials furthermore this study provides data regarding removability of aamps ata betmac diotog dmbsa and ptss which are scarcely investigated particularly in real water matrices interestingly the removal of ata and betmac in the present study exceeded recently reported eliminations in ultrapure water by scheurer et al 2022 by approx 10 and 30 applying the same activated carbon dosage 10 mg l and contact time 48 h in contrast aamps and ptss showed enhanced removal by more than 50 in that study which is in line with expectations due to the absence of competing background organic matter this study confirms that adsorption steps may be suitable options for the elimination of specific pm substances and should be considered when discussing appropriate treatment measures especially since adsorption is already an established process with wide knowledge regarding operation and optimization typically well adsorbable compounds are the target for an adsorption step thereby 80 removal of a specific compound or higher is a common elimination goal in advanced water treatment this study shows that this can well be reached for some of the pm candidates removal of pm compounds by adsorption onto activated carbon can be further improved by increasing the activated carbon dose in case of a powdered activated carbon application or renewing granular activated carbon in a fixed bed filter at lower throughputs this may be necessary when regulatory concentration limits for specific compounds come into place and alternative treatment options are either lacking or even more cost and or resource intensive this is particularly relevant for substances that show potential toxicity e g for tfmsa which was recently found to alter the liver lipid metabolism and gut microbiota of mice when exposed to low tfmsa concentrations zhou et al 2020 and was classified a potentially toxic substance based on qsar cramer class assessment by arp and hale 2019 however further research is needed to investigate the role of kinetics and competing background organic matter since they may hinder an economic application of activated carbon for insufficiently retained pm candidates with poor to moderate adsorbability ozonation as a pretreatment may enhance their removals zietzschmann et al 2015 described improved retention of omp that do not react or hardly react with ozone or oh radicals by a subsequent adsorption step due to the alteration of the background organic matter the oxidation of organic matrix constituents results in an increased mobility and thereby lower competition against target compounds for very poorly adsorbable pm candidates though alternative treatments are needed for charged pm candidates ion exchange resins may be a feasible removal option promising results by ion exchange were reported for short chain pfas smaili and ng 2023 including the sulfonic acid perfluorobutanesulfonate dixit et al 2020 which therefore may be an effective removal option for tfmsa or other small sulfonic acids like mpsa also nanofiltration and reverse osmosis effectively retain most omp though have the disadvantage of high energy needs and the disposal of concentrates the retention of small and neutral substances has so far been a challenge even for membrane processes albergamo et al 2019 3 4 uva254 abatement as surrogate for pm candidate removals in previous studies uva254 abatement was reported to correlate with omp eliminations by activated carbon and was therefore proposed as a surrogate anumol et al 2015 zietzschmann et al 2014 thereby uva254 measurements before and after a treatment step serve as a prediction tool for omp removal this is of particular importance for very polar compounds since their determination remains challenging in analytics reemtsma et al 2016 in this study surrogate correlations fig 4 were established for the investigated pm candidates 80 removal was reached at 20 30 and 60 uva254 abatement for the well moderately and poorly adsorbable compounds fig 4 respectively thus uva254 provides a cheap and fast estimate for the removals of the target compounds this proves the broad applicability of the surrogate and justifies the use also for new omp 3 5 correlation between removal by adsorption onto activated carbon and physico chemical properties to date no reliable prediction of removal efficiencies of individual omp in specific water matrices is possible due to the complex processes that determine the interactions of adsorbent adsorbate and water matrix kah et al 2017 ridder et al 2010 scheurer et al 2022 wang et al 2021 a long term research goal remains the identification of key characteristics of organic compounds that determine their affinities towards activated carbon previous studies relating adsorption performance and log d in matrices without background organic matter obtained different results while ridder et al 2010 demonstrated a clear trend between the increase in affinity of omp for activated carbon and the increase in log d no correlation was found in other studies alves et al 2018 piai et al 2019 scheurer et al 2022 accordingly the removals of all tested pm candidates results from experiment 3 table 3 applying a low a medium and a high activated carbon dose 1 10 and 50 mg l were compared with the predicted polarity indicator log d geometrical properties projection area and projection diameter the molecular mass and electric properties polarizability which have been related to adsorbability in the past piai et al 2019 ridder et al 2010 additionally chromatographic information retention time in rplc was selected to investigate a potential relation to adsorbability as shown in figures si5 a f no distinctive correlation with adsorptive removal was found for any of the parameters chosen for the correlation analysis in this study 0 01 r² 0 28 an overview of all determination coefficients r² received is given in table si6 this finding is supported by previous research connecting the relation between adsorption rates and log d with the nature of the test substances hydrophilicity a low molecular weight and or ionic or ionizable organic compounds like all the pm candidates investigated in this study translate into to less dominant hydrophobic partitioning and consequently poor correlations chen et al 2007 ridder et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2005 zwiener 2007 however these findings may be somewhat limited by the uncertainty of predicted log d data since the experiments were carried out in real drinking water matrices the different activated carbon dosages generate differing competition conditions with background organic matter with increasing activated carbon dosages the adsorption competition decreases it is noteworthy that even though general correlation is lacking the log d correlation appears to be more relevant using low activated carbon dose hence under most competing conditions however when general competition declines other characteristics such as the geometrical properties the interaction with a chromatographic column rplc or the polarizability become more important since the r² increases with the applied activated carbon dose in conclusion neither of the selected compound characteristics is suitable to solely describe the removability of the selected pm candidates by activated carbon adsorption hence other substance characteristics as well as interactions with background organic matter significantly affect their adsorbability further studies focusing on multi parameter approaches and or a larger set of pm substances are recommended to gain more insight into the relation between compound characteristics and adsorptive removals 4 conclusions the adsorption of 19 pm candidates onto activated carbon was investigated in batch experiments applying one microporous and one mesoporous activated carbon in a drinking water matrix tfmsa hhtmp and mpsa were not or very poorly removed independently of the applied activated carbon type and activated carbon dose here the viability of other treatment options should be assessed diotog bta oxp pri and mapma were readily removed which was indicated for mapma the first time for these compounds activated carbon adsorption may be a suitable treatment option even at the high level of competing background organic matter in berlin tap water the highly diverse elimination potentials emphasize the need for not only multi barrier approaches and case specific treatment solutions but also the improvement of drinking water resource protection uva254 is a suitable and easy to measure surrogate for the substance specific adsorptive pm candidate removal which proves its wide applicability and justifies its use also for newly detected omp available substance characteristics namely log d projection area and diameter molecular weight polarizability or retention time in rplc did not show useful relations to adsorptive removals adsorption onto activated carbon should be taken into account as an effective barrier for numerous pm substances even though high mobility implies poor removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14887,persistent and mobile pm substances among the organic micropollutants have gained increasing interest since their inherent properties enable them to enrich in water cycles this study set out to investigate the potential of adsorption onto activated carbon as a drinking water treatment option for 19 pm candidates in batch experiments in a drinking water matrix using a microporous and a mesoporous activated carbon overall adsorption of pm candidates proved to be very variable and the extent of removal could not be directly related to molecular properties at an activated carbon dose of 10 mg l and 48 h contact time five out of 19 substances were readily removed 80 among them n 3 dimethylamino propyl methacrylamide which was investigated for the first time for five other substances no or negligible removal 20 was observed including 2 methyl 2 propene 1 sulfonic acid and 4 hydroxy 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine for the former current state of the art adsorption processes may pose a sufficient barrier additionally substance specific surrogate correlations between removals and uva254 abatements were established to provide a cheap and fast estimate for pm candidate elimination adsorption onto activated carbon could contribute significantly to pm substance elimination as part of multi barrier approaches but assessments for individual substances still require clarification as demonstrated for the investigated pm candidates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords powdered activated carbon emerging contaminants organic micropollutants omp trace organic compounds torcs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction organic micropollutants omp and their behaviors in the aquatic environment and in water treatment have been a topic in research for decades and in recent years persistent and mobile pm substances among omp have attracted increasing interest hale et al 2020a reemtsma et al 2016 as pm substances are poorly biodegraded photodegraded and removed by sorption processes they are prone to penetrate through natural and technical barriers loos et al 2013 scheurer et al 2017 pm substances belong to various substance classes and application fields such as pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals herbicides and pesticides as well as their transformation products and therefore originate from multiple emission sources like households agriculture urban stormwater runoff and industry reemtsma et al 2016 ineffective barriers and climatic changes are anticipated to favor pm substance enrichment in water cycles and thus the contamination of drinking water sources in fact numerous potential pm substances have been detected in the aquatic environment loos et al 2010 neuwald et al 2021 nödler et al 2016 schulze et al 2019 zahn et al 2019 and even in drinking water scheurer et al 2017 zahn et al 2016 to identify persistence for regulatory purposes the use of the degradation half life time in the environment as defined in the annex xiii of reach and applied in the pbt vpvb assessment was proposed arp and hale 2019 in the same context the ph dependent octanol water partition coefficient log d was suggested as a mobility indicator with substances having a log d 4 at a ph range of 4 9 considered mobile arp and hale 2019 however there is an ongoing discussion about how to quantify the mobility of a substance in the scientific community a commonly recognized quantitative definition or quantification method for a compound s mobility in the aquatic environment remains challenging hale et al 2020b kalberlah et al 2014 sigmund et al 2022 the detection of mobile substances has long been limited by the capabilities of traditional chromatographic techniques such as gas chromatography and reversed phase liquid chromatography rplc as analytics advanced the spectrum of substances detected by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry extended to polar and very polar substances reemtsma et al 2016 however the analyses of very polar compounds continues to be a challenge and thus far no analytical method appears to cover all mobile substances but different chromatography approaches mixed mode liquid chromatography supercritical fluid chromatography hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography gas chromatography rplc rather seem to complement each other neuwald et al 2021 zahn et al 2020 the lack of appropriate analytical methods in the past the vast number of newly detected compounds potential pm substances and the time and cost intensive field and laboratory studies required lead to the present knowledge gap on pm substances little is known about their toxic effects on the environment and human health their fate in the aquatic environment and the efficiency of technical treatment options consequently the precautionary principle should be applied to protect human health and the environment although minimizing emissions should be a priority knowledge about remediation options is needed to counteract current and future contamination adsorption onto activated carbon is an established water treatment technique eliminating a broad range of omp jekel et al 2015 kennedy et al 2015 ternes et al 2002 and therefore may be a suitable treatment option for pm substances although adsorption onto activated carbon is known for improved removals of hydrophobic omp ridder et al 2010 previous studies demonstrated removal of polar substances piai et al 2019 sperlich et al 2017 the removal potential of activated carbon depends on adsorbent characteristics the water matrix as well as adsorbate characteristics since adsorption is a surface related process the surface area pore size distribution and surface characteristics of the adsorbent play an important role in the selection of an appropriate activated carbon due to size exclusion and kinetic limitations aschermann et al 2018 dittmann et al 2022 piai et al 2019 previous studies linked adsorption behavior to electric charge molecular weight hydrophobicity polarizability aromaticity and the presence of h bond donor acceptor groups mailler et al 2015 ridder et al 2010 assessing the relationship between adsorbate characteristics and removal behavior may be useful to identify critical substances that may pass through the adsorption step of waterworks to obtain insight into the viability of adsorption onto activated carbon as a treatment option for pm substances 19 potential pm substances hereinafter referred to as pm candidates were tested for their adsorption potential in batch experiments in equilibrium with one mesoporous and one microporous commercially available activated carbon the selection of pm candidates was based on a monitoring in european water samples published by schulze et al 2019 where some pm candidates have been identified for the first time in surface waters or even drinking water three of the pm candidates 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulfonate aamps adamantan 1 amine ata and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid tfmsa were among the 10 most frequently detected novel or scarcely investigated substances identified during a suspect screening by neuwald et al 2021 in samples of two river systems the pm candidates chosen for this study were all characterized by a high polarity median log d 1 4 at ph 7 5 a low molecular weight median 186 g mol and were mostly charged ionic or ionizable organic molecules at the relevant ph systematic persistence data for the investigated substances are lacking however based on their occurrence in water cycles low or negligible biodegradability under environmental conditions was assumed to put the adsorptive removal of the target substances into perspective and directly compare adsorption capacities well known omp were tested as references based on their removals at economical carbon dosages the pm candidates were classified according to their adsorption tendency as uv254 absorbance measurement was proven to be a useful tool for omp removal control altmann et al 2014 anumol et al 2015 uva254 abatement was compared with the removals of the pm candidates 2 materials and methods 2 1 investigated substances in total 25 substances were investigated in this study with abbreviations and relevant characteristics shown in table 1 nine substances were considered well known omp since their adsorption behavior has been studied widely zietzschmann et al 2014 altmann et al 2014 ruhl et al 2015 the well known substances acesulfame ace benzotriazole bta and primidone pri were included in the pm candidate set due to their high mobility and potential persistence under environmental conditions for the compounds log d polarizability maximum projection area and maximum projection diameter predicted values by chemicalize developed by chemaxon were used carbamazepine cbz 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole mbt metoprolol mtp formylaminoantipyrine faa sulfamethoxazole smx and gabapentin gab were analyzed with a separate rplc method thus their retention times are not directly comparable and therefore not included in table 1 and considered for correlations 2 2 activated carbons one microporous activated carbon hydraffin cc and one mesoporous activated carbon epibon a both donau carbon germany based on coconut husk and lignite respectively were used for the batch experiments characteristics of the original granular activated carbons according to aschermann et al 2018 2019 and dittmann et al 2022 are listed in table

experiments 2 3 batch experiments three batch experiments with pulverized activated carbon were conducted in 50 ml berlin tap water spiked with omp an overview of the experiments is given in table 3 ion concentrations of the drinking water matrix are provided in table si1 a first screening with two activated carbons aimed to assess the effect of the differing characteristics of the selected activated carbons on well known omp experiment 1 and pm candidate experiment 2 adsorption behavior secondly a comparison between the adsorptive removals of well known omp and selected pm candidates in equilibrium was conducted additional batch experiments data not shown in the same drinking water matrix revealed that 48 h contact time are sufficient to achieve adsorption equilibrium for the following batch experiment 3 the favoured activated carbon was selected additional pm candidates diatrizoic acid dza oxipurinol oxp valsartan acid vsa were included and the resolution of the applied activated carbon doses was increased two mixed stock solutions one for pm candidates and one for well known omp both in ultrapure water and one single solute stock solution containing oxp in ultrapure water and methanol with concentrations of 10 mg l of each analyte were used for spiking the initial target concentrations of 1 and 10 µg l respectively dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in experiment 3 were elevated compared to experiments 1 and 2 due to the methanol in the oxp stock solution in previous studies methanol was found to have no impact on the adsorption of omp onto activated carbon kilduff et al 1998 mailler et al 2016 and its impact on adsorption is therefore not further addressed in this study two activated carbon stock suspensions of 2 and 10 g l respectively were used to apply the aimed activated carbon dose in the corresponding batches a reference batch without activated carbon was prepared in parallel all experiments were carried out at room temperature approx 22 c after 48 h contact time on a horizontal shaker ca 120 rpm mixing frequency the activated carbon was separated by membrane filtration regenerated cellulose 0 45 µm nominal pore diameter to obtain ph values for equilibrium conditions ph measurements were conducted after the experiments 2 4 analytics 2 4 1 doc and uva254 analyses doc was analyzed via catalytic combustion on a variotoc cube elementar analysensysteme germany the uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 was measured by a dual beam spectral photometer lambda 12 uv vis perkin elmer germany using 10 mm quartz cuvettes hellma germany 2 4 2 well known omp analyses the well known omp were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms thereby the analytes were chromatographically separated by a reversed phase xselect hss t3 xp column 2 1 50 mm column waters usa subsequent compound detection was carried out by a triple quadrupole with electro spray ionization tsq vantage thermo fisher usa for each analyte two mass fragments were selected according to the daios database wasserchemische gesellschaft germany the fragments with the largest peak areas and deuterated internal standards were used for quantification further details are described by zietzschmann et al 2019 values below the limit of quantification loq of 0 1 µg l were set to the loq value the removal by activated carbon was calculated in comparison to the reference negative removals were set to 0 2 4 3 pm candidate analyses 2 4 3 1 sample enrichment all samples were enriched by azeotropic evaporation based on a slightly modified method of schulze et al 2020 as described in neuwald et al 2021 in short 4 ml of sample was mixed with 21 ml acetonitrile and evaporated at 40 c under a gentle stream of nitrogen before reconstitution in 200 µl acetonitrile water 90 10 to achieve a concentration factor of 20 the extract was centrifugated and the supernatant chemically analyzed 2 4 3 2 instrumental analysis for instrumental analysis by supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry sfc hrms an acquity upc2 system together with a synapt gs2 quadrupole time of flight high resolution mass spectrometer both waters milford usa were applied chromatographic separation was performed on an acquity upc2 beh column 100 3 mm 1 7 µm waters the gradient and eluent composition were taken from literature neuwald et al 2021 and are given together with further details regarding sfc hrms in the si chapter 1 2 instrumental analyses by sfc hrms 2 4 3 3 calculation of removals and evaluation of matrix effects during instrumental analysis removals of the pm candidates were calculated using peak area ratios of target analytes before and after adsorption onto activated carbon due to a linear relation between analyte concentrations and peak areas that was confirmed by an external calibration curve prepared in ultra pure solvent however the magnitude of signal suppression or enhancement matrix effects of the target analytes during instrumental analysis by sfc hrms is potentially influenced by nonconstant concentrations of sample constituents matrix before and after sample treatment with activated carbon to exclude the influence of matrix effects on peak area ratios before and after sample treatment matrix effects of all analytes were determined as described in the si chapter 1 3 matrix effects matrix effects that lead to suppression or enhancement of the chromatographic signals of ace ata dmbsa dchss mpsa hhtmp sac and tfmsa during chemical analysis by sfc ms were recently reported for a method using a similar mobile phase the same stationary phase and a positive ionization mode as applied in this study schulze et al 2020 therefore matrix effects that influence the instrumental analyses of pm candidates were determined to assure that apparent removals during sample treatment with activated carbon are not exclusively resulting from signal suppression even if pronounced matrix effects between 76 3 for aamps and 80 3 for ptss were found si figure si1 only minor changes 10 after sample treatment with activated carbon si figure si2 were observed with increasing amount of applied activated carbon matrix effects increased in average about 6 1 10 mg l activated carbon 7 8 50 mg l activated carbon and 9 3 100 mg l activated carbon and thus only had a minor impact on measured removals 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing adsorptive removals of well known omp and pm candidates in a first screening with two activated carbons testing a wide range of activated carbon doses 5 500 mg l for the removal of well known omp experiment 1 as well as selected pm candidates experiment 2 the former were removed as expected fig 1 a cbz bta mbt and mtp known as well adsorbing omp were completely removed by both activated carbons applying a typical activated carbon dose of 10 mg l or higher while a dose of 50 mg l activated carbon was necessary to reach 100 removal of faa smx and pri both ace and gab were poorly removed by both activated carbons exhibiting 35 elimination at a dose of 10 mg l overall increasing the activated carbon dose always resulted in improved removal of well known omp in contrast the removal of pm candidates appears to be more diverse tending towards either none or high adsorptive removal fig 1b three of the target substances namely diotog mapma and betmac indicate high affinities towards activated carbon with removals 89 already at the lowest dose 5 mg l in contrast hhtmp tfmsa and mpsa show none or negligible removal 11 even for high activated carbon doses up to 100 mg l increasing the activated carbon dose to 500 mg l only results in a significant removal improvement for mpsa to up to 78 while hhtmp and tfmsa removals remain below 30 table si4 the strongly varying elimination potential of activated carbon for the pm candidates is emphasized in fig 2 where the removals of four pm candidates tfmsa ata mel betmac with a high occurrence in european water samples reported by schulze et al 2019 are shown in relation to the smx removal smx was suggested as an indicator substance for moderate adsorption onto activated carbon jekel et al 2015 and is frequently subject to monitoring and research benotti et al 2009 peng et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 overall well known omp were eliminated on average by 80 while pm candidates were removed considerably less by 63 on average both at an activated carbon dose of 10 mg l 3 2 removals of well known omp and pm candidates by hydraffin cc and epibon a in fig 1 a and b the performance of the microporous hydraffin cc and the mesoporous epibon a for the removal of omp and pm candidates experiment 1 and 2 see table 3 was compared thereby an improved removal by at least 20 for one or more activated carbon doses was set as a benchmark for preferential adsorption as visualized by the dashed lines the difference of at least 20 considers both the experimental and analytical error si chapter 1 4 comparing the adsorptive removals a total of 16 substances hhtmp tfmsa mpsa gab ace ata mel pri smx dchss dmbsa sac betmac mapma mbt diotog showed a very similar affinity towards both activated carbon products accounting for more than 70 of all investigated substances only for four well known omp a distinctive tendency towards the microporous hydraffin cc was identified faa bta cbz mtp this trend was visible only for the lowest activated carbon dose 5 mg l where competition with background organic matter is highest in the present study multi solute adsorption experiments were carried out in the presence of a real drinking water matrix where adsorbates compete for available adsorption sites in competitive adsorption in drinking water and wastewater treatment background organic matter is deemed the major competitor for omp wang et al 2021 zietzschmann 2021 the adsorption competition by background organic matter is considered relatively strong due to large difference in concentration levels worch 2021 here the pm candidates are present in concentration levels of low µg l whereas background organic matter prevails in the lower mg l range of approx 4300 µg l carbon corresponding to ca 8600 µg l background organic matter assuming 50 carbon content of the diverse molecules of background organic matter consequently e g in experiment 2 the total sum of pm candidates ca 13 µg l was more than 650 fold lower than the background organic matter concentration aamps removal of 22 by hydraffin cc at an activated carbon dose of 10 mg l was assumed to be an outlier based on the comparison with removals by epibon a and experiment 3 fig 3 only one compound ptss adsorbed preferentially to epibon a one of the omps preferentially adsorbed by the microporous hydraffin cc is bta the one with the lowest molecular mass 119 g mol fig 1 also ruhl et al 2014 observed the best performance for bta removal to be of a coconut based activated carbon product as hydraffin cc among eight different powdered activated carbons the pore structure of an activated carbon influences the accessibility of its internal surface area in theory small compounds are anticipated to reach further into the porous structure and consequently adsorb better onto microporous activated carbons compared to high molecular weight substances which may be hindered by size exclusion jekel et al 2015 mestre et al 2014 previous analysis of hydraffin cc revealed a high share of the total surface area located in the micropores with 95 compared to 64 of a macroporous activated carbon aschermann et al 2018 however larger molecules such as faa cbz mtp and aamps 207 267 g mol also adsorb well to hydraffin cc the higher bet surface of hydraffin cc table 2 likely contributes to the improved adsorption properties of hydraffin cc compared to epibon a apart from the evident beneficial physical properties of hydraffin cc for the tested omp the adsorbents chemical properties contribute to the removal performance of individual organic compounds nielsen et al 2014 piai et al 2019 accordingly the higher carbon content lower ash content and higher share of micropores of hydraffin cc compared to epibon a table 2 has a positive effect on the adsorption capacity due to the increased number of available adsorption sites as already indicated by the specific surface area furthermore at experimental ph see table 3 the activated carbons differ in their net surface charge due to their respective phpzc see table 2 enabling electrostatic attraction or repulsion of charged compounds however despite the positive net charge of hydraffin cc improved removal was mainly achieved for neutral compounds bta cbz faa rather than for anionic compounds more specific bonding between a compound and the adsorbent may occur on functional groups particularly surface oxygen groups are known to play a key role for the affinity of omp towards activated carbon dittmann et al 2022 a relative high oxygen content and therefore degree of functionalization is present in hydraffin cc compared to epibon a especially at ph 8 2 8 3 the pronounced amount of carboxylic acid groups provides moieties with negative charge in hydraffin cc in contrast to its positive net surface charge this may refer to a significant carbonate content interfering with the phpzc however coconut husk based activated carbons as hydraffin cc contain increased amounts of phenol groups dittmann et al 2022 that are known to chemically react with amide moieties of target compounds nielsen et al 2014 hence the amide structure of aamps faa and cbz is likely to cause enhanced adsorption by hydraffin cc as affirmed by the obtained adsorption results 3 3 categorization of pm candidates building on the previous results hydraffin cc was tested for a wider range of activated carbon dosages adding also more omps to the test set experiment 3 table 3 the results are in line with the previous experiments albeit slightly lower removals 14 lower median removal see figure si4 were achieved due to the higher initial pm substance concentration table 3 based on experiment 3 all investigated pm candidates were categorized according to their removals at a common activated carbon dose of 10 mg l to assess the suitability of an adsorption step as a viable treatment option fig 3 as observed in the screening experiment 2 fig 1b the pm candidates exhibited a broad range of adsorbabilities onto activated carbon in equilibrium at a practice oriented activated carbon dose of 10 mg l nine substances adsorbed poorly 20 60 vsa ptss ata ace or very poorly 20 dza aamps hhtmp mpsa tfmsa fig 3 the lowest removals were achieved for the sulfonic acids tfmsa and mpsa followed by hhtmp all relatively small 150 201 g mol and very mobile log d 1 2 charged aliphatic compounds these three substances do not achieve more than 50 removal even at an extensive dosage of activated carbon of 100 mg l therefore tfmsa mpsa and hhtmp are likely to break through advanced drinking water treatment by activated carbon when present in the respective raw water the short chain perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid tfmsa was detected for the first time in european surface water groundwater and bank filtrate by schulze et al 2019 at estimated concentrations of up to 1 µg l following sampling campaigns including a variety of water samples such as surface and groundwater underlined these findings reporting tfmsa in 94 of all samples with a median concentration of 30 ng l in sweden björnsdotter et al 2019 and concentrations 1 µg l in a wastewater influenced german surface water alb river scheurer et al 2022 the recent detection of tfmsa in the arctic suggests that tfmsa is already ubiquitous in the aquatic environment björnsdotter et al 2021 out of the 19 tested pm candidates five dchss betmac sac dmbsa and mel were moderately 60 80 and five substances diotog bta oxp mapma pri were readily removed achieving 80 removals at an activated carbon dose of 10 mg l except for tfmsa mpsa and hhtmp a strong impact of the activated carbon dose on the adsorptive removals was observed consequently further seven substances dchss betmac sac dmbsa mel vsa and ptss see fig 3 reach good removals 80 applying slightly higher activated carbon doses of 15 to 20 mg l overall knowledge on pm substance removal by adsorption onto activated carbon is still limited to our knowledge this study is the first to address the adsorption potential of mapma dchss mpsa and hhtmp while mpsa and hhtmp are hardly controllable by activated carbon adsorption mapma and to some extent dchss both industrial chemicals registered under reach and used in adhesives and sealants amongst other consumer uses indicate promising adsorption potentials furthermore this study provides data regarding removability of aamps ata betmac diotog dmbsa and ptss which are scarcely investigated particularly in real water matrices interestingly the removal of ata and betmac in the present study exceeded recently reported eliminations in ultrapure water by scheurer et al 2022 by approx 10 and 30 applying the same activated carbon dosage 10 mg l and contact time 48 h in contrast aamps and ptss showed enhanced removal by more than 50 in that study which is in line with expectations due to the absence of competing background organic matter this study confirms that adsorption steps may be suitable options for the elimination of specific pm substances and should be considered when discussing appropriate treatment measures especially since adsorption is already an established process with wide knowledge regarding operation and optimization typically well adsorbable compounds are the target for an adsorption step thereby 80 removal of a specific compound or higher is a common elimination goal in advanced water treatment this study shows that this can well be reached for some of the pm candidates removal of pm compounds by adsorption onto activated carbon can be further improved by increasing the activated carbon dose in case of a powdered activated carbon application or renewing granular activated carbon in a fixed bed filter at lower throughputs this may be necessary when regulatory concentration limits for specific compounds come into place and alternative treatment options are either lacking or even more cost and or resource intensive this is particularly relevant for substances that show potential toxicity e g for tfmsa which was recently found to alter the liver lipid metabolism and gut microbiota of mice when exposed to low tfmsa concentrations zhou et al 2020 and was classified a potentially toxic substance based on qsar cramer class assessment by arp and hale 2019 however further research is needed to investigate the role of kinetics and competing background organic matter since they may hinder an economic application of activated carbon for insufficiently retained pm candidates with poor to moderate adsorbability ozonation as a pretreatment may enhance their removals zietzschmann et al 2015 described improved retention of omp that do not react or hardly react with ozone or oh radicals by a subsequent adsorption step due to the alteration of the background organic matter the oxidation of organic matrix constituents results in an increased mobility and thereby lower competition against target compounds for very poorly adsorbable pm candidates though alternative treatments are needed for charged pm candidates ion exchange resins may be a feasible removal option promising results by ion exchange were reported for short chain pfas smaili and ng 2023 including the sulfonic acid perfluorobutanesulfonate dixit et al 2020 which therefore may be an effective removal option for tfmsa or other small sulfonic acids like mpsa also nanofiltration and reverse osmosis effectively retain most omp though have the disadvantage of high energy needs and the disposal of concentrates the retention of small and neutral substances has so far been a challenge even for membrane processes albergamo et al 2019 3 4 uva254 abatement as surrogate for pm candidate removals in previous studies uva254 abatement was reported to correlate with omp eliminations by activated carbon and was therefore proposed as a surrogate anumol et al 2015 zietzschmann et al 2014 thereby uva254 measurements before and after a treatment step serve as a prediction tool for omp removal this is of particular importance for very polar compounds since their determination remains challenging in analytics reemtsma et al 2016 in this study surrogate correlations fig 4 were established for the investigated pm candidates 80 removal was reached at 20 30 and 60 uva254 abatement for the well moderately and poorly adsorbable compounds fig 4 respectively thus uva254 provides a cheap and fast estimate for the removals of the target compounds this proves the broad applicability of the surrogate and justifies the use also for new omp 3 5 correlation between removal by adsorption onto activated carbon and physico chemical properties to date no reliable prediction of removal efficiencies of individual omp in specific water matrices is possible due to the complex processes that determine the interactions of adsorbent adsorbate and water matrix kah et al 2017 ridder et al 2010 scheurer et al 2022 wang et al 2021 a long term research goal remains the identification of key characteristics of organic compounds that determine their affinities towards activated carbon previous studies relating adsorption performance and log d in matrices without background organic matter obtained different results while ridder et al 2010 demonstrated a clear trend between the increase in affinity of omp for activated carbon and the increase in log d no correlation was found in other studies alves et al 2018 piai et al 2019 scheurer et al 2022 accordingly the removals of all tested pm candidates results from experiment 3 table 3 applying a low a medium and a high activated carbon dose 1 10 and 50 mg l were compared with the predicted polarity indicator log d geometrical properties projection area and projection diameter the molecular mass and electric properties polarizability which have been related to adsorbability in the past piai et al 2019 ridder et al 2010 additionally chromatographic information retention time in rplc was selected to investigate a potential relation to adsorbability as shown in figures si5 a f no distinctive correlation with adsorptive removal was found for any of the parameters chosen for the correlation analysis in this study 0 01 r² 0 28 an overview of all determination coefficients r² received is given in table si6 this finding is supported by previous research connecting the relation between adsorption rates and log d with the nature of the test substances hydrophilicity a low molecular weight and or ionic or ionizable organic compounds like all the pm candidates investigated in this study translate into to less dominant hydrophobic partitioning and consequently poor correlations chen et al 2007 ridder et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2005 zwiener 2007 however these findings may be somewhat limited by the uncertainty of predicted log d data since the experiments were carried out in real drinking water matrices the different activated carbon dosages generate differing competition conditions with background organic matter with increasing activated carbon dosages the adsorption competition decreases it is noteworthy that even though general correlation is lacking the log d correlation appears to be more relevant using low activated carbon dose hence under most competing conditions however when general competition declines other characteristics such as the geometrical properties the interaction with a chromatographic column rplc or the polarizability become more important since the r² increases with the applied activated carbon dose in conclusion neither of the selected compound characteristics is suitable to solely describe the removability of the selected pm candidates by activated carbon adsorption hence other substance characteristics as well as interactions with background organic matter significantly affect their adsorbability further studies focusing on multi parameter approaches and or a larger set of pm substances are recommended to gain more insight into the relation between compound characteristics and adsorptive removals 4 conclusions the adsorption of 19 pm candidates onto activated carbon was investigated in batch experiments applying one microporous and one mesoporous activated carbon in a drinking water matrix tfmsa hhtmp and mpsa were not or very poorly removed independently of the applied activated carbon type and activated carbon dose here the viability of other treatment options should be assessed diotog bta oxp pri and mapma were readily removed which was indicated for mapma the first time for these compounds activated carbon adsorption may be a suitable treatment option even at the high level of competing background organic matter in berlin tap water the highly diverse elimination potentials emphasize the need for not only multi barrier approaches and case specific treatment solutions but also the improvement of drinking water resource protection uva254 is a suitable and easy to measure surrogate for the substance specific adsorptive pm candidate removal which proves its wide applicability and justifies its use also for newly detected omp available substance characteristics namely log d projection area and diameter molecular weight polarizability or retention time in rplc did not show useful relations to adsorptive removals adsorption onto activated carbon should be taken into account as an effective barrier for numerous pm substances even though high mobility implies poor removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14888,nitrate contamination has been commonly detected in water environments and poses serious hazards to human health previously methane was proposed as a promising electron donor to remove nitrate from contaminated water compared with pure methane natural gas which not only contains methane but also other short chain gaseous alkanes scgas is less expensive and more widely available representing a more attractive electron source for removing oxidized contaminants however it remains unknown if these scgas can be utilized as electron donors for nitrate reduction here two lab scale membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs separately supplied with propane and butane were operated under oxygen limiting conditions to test its feasibility of microbial nitrate reduction long term performance suggested nitrate could be continuously removed at a rate of 40 50 mg n l d using propane butane as electron donors in the absence of propane butane nitrate removal rates significantly decreased both in the long term operation 2 10 and 4 9 mg n l d for propane and butane based mbfrs respectively and batch tests indicating nitrate bio reduction was driven by propane butane the consumption rates of nitrate and propane butane dramatically decreased under anaerobic conditions but recovered after resupplying limited oxygen suggesting oxygen was an essential triggering factor for propane butane based nitrate reduction high throughput sequencing targeting 16s rrna bmox and narg genes indicated mycobacterium rhodococcus thauera were the potential microorganisms oxidizing propane butane while various denitrifiers e g dechloromonas denitratisoma zoogloea acidovorax variovorax pseudogulbenkiania and rhodanobacter might perform nitrate reduction in the biofilms our findings provide evidence to link scga oxidation with nitrate reduction under oxygen limiting conditions and may ultimately facilitate the design of cost effective techniques for ex situ groundwater remediation using natural gas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate propane butane membrane biofilm reactor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate no3 contamination has been widely detected in surface water zhang et al 2014 and groundwater wick et al 2012 due to the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers and improper use of animal manures in agriculture power and schepers 1989 exposure to nitrate contaminated groundwater could potentially pose serious health threats to human beings such as methemoglobinemia gastric cancer and goitre majumdar and gupta 2000 wolfe and patz 2002 as such a maximum contaminant level of 10 mg l no3 n has been established by the us environmental protection agency us epa doudrick et al 2013 multiple techniques have been developed to remove nitrate from contaminated water including physical reverse osmosis or electrolysis physicochemical ion exchange and biological methods ao et al 2019 duan et al 2020 rezvani et al 2019 compared to physical or physicochemical strategies biological reduction of nitrate has received more attention in recent years as it is more sustainable and environmentally friendly rezvani et al 2019 methane ch4 which is an easily available carbon source and generates less residue electrons has been recently proposed as a promising electron donor for nitrate removal luo et al 2018 modin et al 2010 shi et al 2021 however pure or 95 ch4 used in these studies is relatively expensive 1 1 5 m3 global petrol prices 2020 for practical application in contaminated water remediation therefore requiring the utilization of an inexpensive source of methane such as biogas and natural gas 0 1 m3 markets insider 2022 in comparison to biogas which would acidify bioreactors by carbon dioxide co2 30 50 in biogas and thus deteriorate microbial activities ghafari et al 2009 liu et al 2019 natural gas generally contains very low co2 0 9 9 shimekit and mukhtar 2012 making it an ideal source of ch4 however in addition to ch4 as the primary component natural gas also contains considerable amount of non methane short chain gaseous alkanes scgas up to 20 such as ethane propane and butane tissot and welte 1984 although these gaseous alkanes are potent carbon and energy sources for microorganisms it remains unknown whether they can be utilized as electron donors to remove nitrate from contaminated water microbial oxidation of non methane scgas could occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions under aerobic conditions various microbes able to utilize propane and butane have been isolated from soil and oilfields including arthrobacter corynebacterium mycobacterium nocardia and rhodococc shennan 2006 similar with aerobic methane oxidation pathway aerobic degradation of propane and butane are also catalyzed by monooxygenases with reactive oxygen species from molecular oxygen incoporated into the terminal or sub terminal carbon atom in propane or butane yileding propanol or butanol musat 2015 shennan 2006 electrons generated from aerobic propane and butane oxidation processes are presumably available for reduing electron acceptors recently propane and butane were supplied as electron donors in membrane bioflim reactors mbfrs to drive selenate or perchlorate reduction under oxygen limiting conditions lai et al 2020 2021a 2021b trichloroethylene tce which is a suspected carcinogen and persistent in the environment could also be degreaded by several aerobic bacteria using monooxygenases such as propane grown r rhodochrous and mycobacterium vaccae job5 malachowsky et al 1994 wackett et al 1989 and butane grown pseudomonas butanovora hamamura et al 1997 under anaerobic conditions sulfate has been identified as the electron acceptor to be coupled to the oxidation of non methane scgas the pure culture strain bus5 a deltaproteobacterium was proved to anaerobically oxidize propane and butane to co2 with sulfate reduced to sulfide kniemeyer et al 2007 recently anaerobic enriched archaea candidatus syntrophoarchaeum and candidatus argoarchaeum was shown to activate butane and ethane via butyl coenzyme m and ethyl coenzyme m formation respectively and reducing equivalents are channelled to the partner sulfate reducing bacteria laso pérez et al 2016 chen et al 2019 given that nitrate is a thermodynamically more favourable electron acceptor than sulfate marietou et al 2009 nitrate reduction coupled to propane or butane oxidation would be energetically feasible recently a bacterial lineage within the class symbiobacteriia candidatus alkanivorans nitratireducens was proved to mediate nitrate dependent anaerobic propane oxidation wu et al 2022 compared to the limited nitrate reduction rate under anaerobic conditions 0 5 1 2 mg n l d wu et al 2022 biological nitrate reduction driven by propane or butane under oxygen limiting conditions would be more favorable to achieve a quick nitrate removal from contaminated water overall the objective of this study was to test the feasibility of microbial nitrate reduction using propane or butane as electron donors under oxygen limiting conditions in order to achieve this aim two independent mbfrs were set up in which hollow fibre membranes were employed to supply propane or butane and to provide surfaces for biofilm attachment nitrate was continuously fed into the reactors as the sole electron acceptor to evaluate the long term nitrate removal performance multiple batch tests were conducted to study the mechanisms of microbial nitrate reduction driven by propane or butane the key microbes involved in propane or butane oxidation and nitrate reduction were identified by high throughput sequencing for targeting both 16s rrna gene and functional genes bmox encoding alpha hydroxylase subunit of propane butane monooxygenase and narg encoding nitrate reductase it is expected that the findings will improve our understanding of propane or butane based nitrate reduction processes and may ultimately help us develop techniques to remove nitrate from contaminated water 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbfr setup and operation two mbfrs which have similar configurations with that used in our previous study lai et al 2020 were set up in this study fig s1 each mbfr was equipped with two glass tubes and two bundles of hollow fiber membranes which contained 84 fibers model mhf 200tl mitsubishi ltd japan the mbfr has a total volume of 200 ml and total membrane surface area of 123 cm2 pure propane or n butane hereafter butane gas 99 99 coregas australia was separately supplied to each mbfr with the gas pressure inside the hollow fibers controlled at 10 psi 165 kpa by gas pressure regulators coregas australia the bulk liquor in the mbfrs was mixed and recirculated at a flow rate of 78 ml min using a peristaltic pump masterflex usa in order to trigger propane and butane oxidation limited oxygen was delivered at 150 mg l d to the systems through an oxygen permeable tubing for the recirculation silicone tubing longerpump china the mbfrs were covered with aluminium foil to avoid alga growth and operated in a temperature controlled lab 22 2 c in order to achieve biofilm attachment on the membrane surfaces 20 ml of activated sludge from a full scale wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia was used as the inoculum for each mbfr and then the sludge was mixed with fresh medium containing 20 mg n l no3 via recirculation for 48 h the synthetic medium was prepared as follows unit g l if not specified cacl2 1 mg mgso4 7h2o 5 mg kah2po4 0 20 g and na2hpo4 0 16 g acidic trace elements 0 5 ml l and alkaline trace elements 0 2 ml l lai et al 2020 afterwards fresh medium with nitrate concentration of 10 and 20 mg n l correspond to the surface no3 loading rate of 0 53 and 1 05 g n m2 d was continuously fed into the mbfr at hrt of 6 5 h in stages 1 and 2 respectively in stage 3 influent nitrate concentration was maintained at 20 mg n l and hrt was increased to 10 h to improve nitrate removal efficiency in order to test if nitrate could be consumed without propane butane the gas supply of propane butane to each mbfr was intentionally stopped for 10 days after stage 3 and then recovered during the entire operational period liquid samples were collected from the reactor 2 3 times per week to monitor the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite 2 2 batch tests three batch tests each bath test was run in triplicate were conducted for each mbfr at the end of long term operation table s1 bath test a was carried out in situ mbfr to study the dynamic changes of propane butane and nitrate under oxygen limiting conditions the pumps feeding influent medium was stopped and the supply of propane butane to the hollow fibers was cut off fresh medium containing 20 mg n l no3 was sparged with propane butane for 30 min and then introduced into the mbfrs to eliminate any headspace liquid samples were collected every 1 2 h to monitor the dissolved propane butane and nitrate concentration fresh medium saturated with helium was injected into the mbfr after each sampling to compensate for liquid losses due to sampling

performed based on ncbi database 3 results 3 1 long term performance of nitrate reduction in propane butane based mbfrs initially in stage 1 synthetic influent containing 10 mg n l no3 was continuously fed into the two mbfrs supplied with propane butane nitrate was completely removed without nitrite accumulation at hrt of 6 5 h for both mbfrs giving rise to a nitrate removal rate of 37 mg n l d fig 1 a and b with nitrate concentration in influent increased to 20 mg n l in stage 2 nitrate removal efficiency decreased to 25 40 and 40 65 initially but finally recovered to 50 65 and 70 80 for propane and butane fed mbfrs respectively with hrt increased from 6 5 h to 10 h at stage 3 the propane and butane based mbfrs achieved a nitrate removal efficiency of 75 85 and 85 95 respectively and the effluent nitrate concentration was below 5 mg n l which could meet the groundwater standard 10 mg n l established by us epa doudrick et al 2013 however when propane butane gas supply was stopped for the reactors the nitrate removal rates significantly decreased from above 32 to 2 10 mg n l d for propane and above 38 to 4 9 mg n l d for butane correspondingly nitrate concentration increased to 13 19 and 13 15 mg n l in propane based and butane based mbfrs respectively once gases were re supplied to each mbfr nitrate removal efficiency was recovered to 75 80 3 2 dynamic changes of nitrate propane butane in batch tests in order to further understand the mechanisms of propane butane based microbial nitrate reduction processes multiple batch tests were conducted at the end of long term operation for each mbfr in batch test a nitrate was consistently decreased without nitrite accumulation for both mbfrs fig 2 a and b at similar reduction rates 1 23 0 10 and 1 18 0 15 mg n l h for propane and butane respectively simultaneously propane and butane were also decreased with time at consumption rates of 4 48 0 81 mg l h for propane and 5 73 0 75 mg l h for butane fig 2a and b the electrons generated by propane and butane oxidation was 2 4 fold and 3 1 fold of electrons required for nitrate and oxygen reduction respectively table s2 however nitrate reduction rates 0 39 0 06 mg n l h for propane and 0 42 0 03 mg n l h for butane in batch test b without the supply of propane butane were significantly lower than that in batch test a when propane butane was provided p 0 01 fig 2c and d fig s2 for batch test c the biofilms were incubated under anaerobic conditions in order to explore the role of oxygen in propane and butane based nitrate reduction it was found that the oxidation rates of propane and butane under anaerobic conditions were less than 0 1 mg l h significantly lower p 0 01 than that in batch test a when limited oxygen was supplied fig 2e and f fig s2 in addition nitrate reduction rates were also dramatically decreased to 0 07 0 01 mg n l h for propane and 0 05 0 00 mg n l h for butane p 0 01 fig 2e and f fig s2 however with oxygen gas injected into the serum bottles used in batch test c oxygen propane or butane 2 1 nitrate reduction rates were quickly recovered to 0 46 0 07 mg n l h for propane and 0 48 0 02 mg n l h for butane fig 2e and f concurrently propane and butane consumption rates were increased to 6 62 0 07 mg l h and 4 20 0 37 mg l h respectively 3 3 microbial community structure microbial communities of the inoculum and propane butane shaped biofilms were first investigated using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to track which microorganisms were enriched in the biofilms results fig 3 a and b showed that mycobacterium which is negligible in the inoculum with a relative abundance of 0 1 of total microorganims was obviously enriched in the propane butane shaped biofilms 3 0 6 1 for propane and 1 1 2 1 for butane genus affiliated to rhodococcus was undetectable in the inoculum but it became dominant in the butane fed biofilms 3 3 5 7 differently rhodococcus was not found in any biofilms fed by propane in addition the relative abundances of dechloromonas denitratisoma and zoogloea which all affiliated to the rhodocyclaceae family were increased from 0 5 1 9 and being undetected in the inoculum to 2 5 9 4 2 8 6 0 and 0 4 4 3 in the propane shaped biofilms and 6 5 17 6 2 4 9 0 and 0 8 7 2 in the butane fed biofilms respectively propane fed biofilms were also dominated by holophagaceae 7 1 10 1 and fimbriimonadaceae 1 4 11 4 while both reactors boosted the growth of anaerolineaceae 3 7 11 4 and flavobacterium 0 9 5 8 that were suggested to be able to utilize extracellular polysaccharides and proteins as carbon sources bernardet and bowman 2006 sun et al 2016 in order to further identify major functional microbes performing propane butane oxidation and nitrate reduction high throughput sequencing targeting bmox and narg genes was applied results suggested that the genus of mycobacterium dominated in the microbial groups containing bmox gene in both propane 22 4 54 8 and butane 2 6 15 7 shaped biofilms fig 4 a which is in accordance with the 16s rrna gene sequencing results that propane butane supply significantly promoted the growth of mycobacterium in addition another genus of thauera was also found to be predominant in the propane fed biofilms 13 3 58 2 and its relative abundance varied from 0 2 to 33 3 in the biofilms supplied with butane however thauera was very minor 0 1 in the biofilms according to 16s rrna gene sequencing acidovorax was the major genus in the narg gene containing community for both propane and butane fed biofilms 3 6 52 3 fig 4b followed by variovorax 0 7 12 5 and pseudogulbenkiania 0 5 8 0 rhodanobacter accounted for 3 0 6 3 in the microbial groups containing narg gene for the butane shaped biofilms but was undetected for propane the relative abundances of these four genera detected by narg gene sequencing were consistently low 0 1 for all biofilms based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing 4 discussion 4 1 potential mechanisms of microbial nitrate reduction coupled to propane butane oxidation although nitrate removal driven by aerobic or anaerobic methane oxidation has been intensively studied in previous work cai et al 2015 luo et al 2018 sun et al 2013 the feasibility of nitrate reduction using propane or butane as electron donors has not been investigated so far this study demonstrated that nitrate removal could be achieved in two independent mbfrs supplied with propane butane under oxygen limiting conditions considering these gaseous alkanes were the sole electron donors for each mbfr the continuous nitrate removal with the presence of propane butane and the dramatically decreased reduction rates without these alkanes collectively suggested that nitrate reduction was associated with propane butane oxidation in addition simultaneous propane butane and nitrate consumption were observed in batch test a while nitrate reduction rates were also significantly lower in the absence of propane butane batch test b than that with the presence of propane butane batch test a further confirming that nitrate bio reduction was driven by propane butane oxidation the observed nitrate reduction without propane butane was likely driven by organic components such as extracellular polymeric substances and polyhydroxyalkanoates generated in the biofilms which have been shown to support selenate perchlorate or vanadate reduction in ethane propane methane based mbfrs lai et al 2018 2020 2021a 2021b it should be noted that limited oxygen 150 mg l d was intentionally supplied to the reactors to boost the aerobic oxidation of propane butane indeed limited oxygen was found to play an important role in propane butane based nitrate reduction propane butane and nitrate consumption rates were obvious with oxygen provided in batch test a while their consumption rates were significantly decreased in batch test c when the biofilms were incubated under anaerobic conditions moreover after limited oxygen was re provided to the biofilm cultures the consumption rates of propane butane and nitrate were significantly increased further confirming that oxygen supply was essential for triggering propane butane based nitrate reduction it has been suggested that limited oxygen supply was necessary for ethane propane driven microbial selenate and perchlorate reduction lai et al 2020 2021a the perchlorate removal rate in a methane based mbfr was also increased from 4 mg cl l d under anoxic conditions to 16 mg cl l d when 10 mg l d of oxygen was externally supplied wu et al 2019 in addition the o2 ch4 ratio was suggested to have a significant impact on nitrate removal rates of the aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification processes in which 0 25 was identified as the optimal ratio for denitrification zhu et al 2017 nevertheless the role of oxygen in propane butane driven nitrate reduction requires systematical investigations in future studies which will also ultimately improve nitrate removal capacities for bioremediation in terms of microbial community analysis using 16s rrna gene and functional gene sequencing microbial nitrate reduction driven by propane butane appears to be completed via a partnership between two functional groups aerobic propane butane oxidation bacteria and nitrate reducers compared to microbial communities in the inoculum mycobacterium was significantly enriched in both mbfrs supplied with propane and butane moreover high throughput sequencing targeting the bmox gene also showed that microbial communities were dominated by mycobacterium for both biofilms indicating that mycobacterium played an important role in propane butane oxidation in the mbfrs in addition the butane fed biofilms were also dominated by rhodococcus although rhodococcus was not identified by bmox gene sequencing it should be noted that the primer sets used in this study might not be specific for amplifying butane oxidation genes in rhodococcus and thus we cannot exclude the possibility that rhodococcus also performed butane oxidation in the butane fed mbfr indeed many strains affiliated to the genera of mycobacterium and rhodococcus have been reported to be able to grow on propane and butane shennan 2006 for example mycobacterium strain nbb4 harbours complete gene clusters encoding multiple monooxygenases mo including propane mo and butane mo and was shown to grow on propane and butane coleman et al 2011 rhodococcus sp strain bcp1 could oxidize butane and generate 1 butanol as the terminal oxidation product cappelletti et al 2015 another potential propane butane oxidation genus thauera which has been reported to oxidize c3 c5 alkanes via the expression of soluble butane monooxygenase cooley et al 2009 was also detected in the biofilms by the bmox gene sequencing 0 2 58 2 although they were negligible 0 1 in the 16s rrna gene sequencing results regarding nitrate reduction diverse nitrate reducers were enriched in the propane butane fed biofilms including the genera of dechloromonas denitratisoma and zoogloea based on 16s rrna gene sequencing and acidovorax variovorax pseudogulbenkiania and rhodanobacter according to narg gene sequencing various strains affiliated to these genera have been well recognized as denitrifiers chen et al 2019 coates et al 2001 fahrbach et al 2006 huang et al 2015 im et al 2010 maintinguer et al 2013 prakash et al 2012 indicating they may have performed nitrate reduction in the biofilms using the electrons or intermediates generated from aerobic propane butane oxidation in order to provide insights into the mechanisms of microbial nitrate reduction driven by propane butane under oxygen limiting conditions long term operation batch tests together with 16s rrna and functional gene sequencing were combined in this study it is proposed that propane butane was aerobically oxidized by mycobacterium rhodococcus thauera in which unknown intermediates might be generated and simultaneously utilized to reduce nitrate by denitrifiers e g dechloromonas denitratisoma zoogloea acidovorax variovorax pseudogulbenkiania and rhodanobacter fig s3 potential intermediates such as acids and alcohols were monitored in this study but found to be negligible 0 5 mg l possibly because they were completely consumed by denitrifiers indeed acetate was not detected in a methane based mbfr while the external addition of acetate immediately boosts up perchlorate reduction rates suggesting it may be a key syntrophic linkage between aerobic methanotrophs and perchlorate reducers wang et al 2022 however it cannot be completely excluded that mycobacterium rhodococcus might independently carry out the propane butane driven nitrate reduction since a few strains of these bacteria were capable of performing denitrification chen et al 2012 sohaskey and modesti 2009 and mycobacterium was also detected in the biofilms by narg gene sequencing 0 1 2 1 further studies are required to reveal the detailed pathways by using isotope tracing and meta omics techniques 4 2 implications of this work this work was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of removing nitrate from contaminated water using propane and butane as electron donors and give insights into the mechanisms given natural gas is composed of methane ethane propane and butane further studies are required to investigate the feasibility of using mixtures of these gases for nitrate removal in mbfrs which will ultimately help the development of cost effective techniques for groundwater remediation using natural gas groundwater constitutes a primary drinking water source for 33 and 70 of the population in the us and china kenny et al 2009 qiu 2011 respectively while it suffers from serious contamination and nitrate is one of the dominant pollutants burow et al 2010 although a multitude of technologies have been developed for nitrate remediation such as catalytic reduction of nitrate reddy and lin 2000 and adding extra carbon sources ethanol or methanol to stimulate nitrate bio reduction gomez et al 2000 nitrate removal using natural gas based mbfrs has a few advantages firstly natural gas 0 019 0 100 per mol electrons is much cheaper than organic carbon sources such as ethanol 0 17 0 29 per mol electrons markets insider 2022 which suggests it is more economically attractive to utilize natural gas for bio reduction compared to ethanol secondly natural gas is less soluble than organic matters and thus will not remain in effluent avoiding post treatment therefore it might be feasible to use natural gas based mbfrs to treat nitrate contaminated groundwater in addition scgas and nitrate are found to co exist in shale gas extraction sites where leakage of shale gas causes scga emissions and hydraulic fracturing process leads to generation of high volumes of wastewater containing nitrate umukoro and ismail 2017 sun et al 2019 it is potentially feasible to utilize propane and butane produced in situ shale gas exploitation sites to treat nitrate contamination nevertheless compared to the reported nitrate removal rates driven by aerobic methane oxidation processes 24 260 mg n l d modin et al 2007 the rates achieved in this study 40 50 mg l d were relatively lower while it could be potentially further optimized via the optimization of oxygen supply oxygen was found to be an essential triggering factor for propane butane oxidation in this study since it is required to incorporate o atom into the c h bond of scgas to activate them however it should be noticed that given the high redox potential of oxygen it can also be a strong electron acceptor outcompeting nitrate for electrons indeed a proper oxygen supply 184 mg l d was suggested to enhance the selenate reduction rate in a methane based mbfr while an excessive oxygen supply 626 mg l d suppressed selenate reduction indicating oxygen plays a dual role in methane based selenate reduction wang et al 2021 therefore it requires further investigation how oxygen supply rate could be precisely controlled to maintain the balance between propane butane oxidation and nitrate reduction and eventually maximize nitrate removal rates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14888,nitrate contamination has been commonly detected in water environments and poses serious hazards to human health previously methane was proposed as a promising electron donor to remove nitrate from contaminated water compared with pure methane natural gas which not only contains methane but also other short chain gaseous alkanes scgas is less expensive and more widely available representing a more attractive electron source for removing oxidized contaminants however it remains unknown if these scgas can be utilized as electron donors for nitrate reduction here two lab scale membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs separately supplied with propane and butane were operated under oxygen limiting conditions to test its feasibility of microbial nitrate reduction long term performance suggested nitrate could be continuously removed at a rate of 40 50 mg n l d using propane butane as electron donors in the absence of propane butane nitrate removal rates significantly decreased both in the long term operation 2 10 and 4 9 mg n l d for propane and butane based mbfrs respectively and batch tests indicating nitrate bio reduction was driven by propane butane the consumption rates of nitrate and propane butane dramatically decreased under anaerobic conditions but recovered after resupplying limited oxygen suggesting oxygen was an essential triggering factor for propane butane based nitrate reduction high throughput sequencing targeting 16s rrna bmox and narg genes indicated mycobacterium rhodococcus thauera were the potential microorganisms oxidizing propane butane while various denitrifiers e g dechloromonas denitratisoma zoogloea acidovorax variovorax pseudogulbenkiania and rhodanobacter might perform nitrate reduction in the biofilms our findings provide evidence to link scga oxidation with nitrate reduction under oxygen limiting conditions and may ultimately facilitate the design of cost effective techniques for ex situ groundwater remediation using natural gas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate propane butane membrane biofilm reactor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate no3 contamination has been widely detected in surface water zhang et al 2014 and groundwater wick et al 2012 due to the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers and improper use of animal manures in agriculture power and schepers 1989 exposure to nitrate contaminated groundwater could potentially pose serious health threats to human beings such as methemoglobinemia gastric cancer and goitre majumdar and gupta 2000 wolfe and patz 2002 as such a maximum contaminant level of 10 mg l no3 n has been established by the us environmental protection agency us epa doudrick et al 2013 multiple techniques have been developed to remove nitrate from contaminated water including physical reverse osmosis or electrolysis physicochemical ion exchange and biological methods ao et al 2019 duan et al 2020 rezvani et al 2019 compared to physical or physicochemical strategies biological reduction of nitrate has received more attention in recent years as it is more sustainable and environmentally friendly rezvani et al 2019 methane ch4 which is an easily available carbon source and generates less residue electrons has been recently proposed as a promising electron donor for nitrate removal luo et al 2018 modin et al 2010 shi et al 2021 however pure or 95 ch4 used in these studies is relatively expensive 1 1 5 m3 global petrol prices 2020 for practical application in contaminated water remediation therefore requiring the utilization of an inexpensive source of methane such as biogas and natural gas 0 1 m3 markets insider 2022 in comparison to biogas which would acidify bioreactors by carbon dioxide co2 30 50 in biogas and thus deteriorate microbial activities ghafari et al 2009 liu et al 2019 natural gas generally contains very low co2 0 9 9 shimekit and mukhtar 2012 making it an ideal source of ch4 however in addition to ch4 as the primary component natural gas also contains considerable amount of non methane short chain gaseous alkanes scgas up to 20 such as ethane propane and butane tissot and welte 1984 although these gaseous alkanes are potent carbon and energy sources for microorganisms it remains unknown whether they can be utilized as electron donors to remove nitrate from contaminated water microbial oxidation of non methane scgas could occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions under aerobic conditions various microbes able to utilize propane and butane have been isolated from soil and oilfields including arthrobacter corynebacterium mycobacterium nocardia and rhodococc shennan 2006 similar with aerobic methane oxidation pathway aerobic degradation of propane and butane are also catalyzed by monooxygenases with reactive oxygen species from molecular oxygen incoporated into the terminal or sub terminal carbon atom in propane or butane yileding propanol or butanol musat 2015 shennan 2006 electrons generated from aerobic propane and butane oxidation processes are presumably available for reduing electron acceptors recently propane and butane were supplied as electron donors in membrane bioflim reactors mbfrs to drive selenate or perchlorate reduction under oxygen limiting conditions lai et al 2020 2021a 2021b trichloroethylene tce which is a suspected carcinogen and persistent in the environment could also be degreaded by several aerobic bacteria using monooxygenases such as propane grown r rhodochrous and mycobacterium vaccae job5 malachowsky et al 1994 wackett et al 1989 and butane grown pseudomonas butanovora hamamura et al 1997 under anaerobic conditions sulfate has been identified as the electron acceptor to be coupled to the oxidation of non methane scgas the pure culture strain bus5 a deltaproteobacterium was proved to anaerobically oxidize propane and butane to co2 with sulfate reduced to sulfide kniemeyer et al 2007 recently anaerobic enriched archaea candidatus syntrophoarchaeum and candidatus argoarchaeum was shown to activate butane and ethane via butyl coenzyme m and ethyl coenzyme m formation respectively and reducing equivalents are channelled to the partner sulfate reducing bacteria laso pérez et al 2016 chen et al 2019 given that nitrate is a thermodynamically more favourable electron acceptor than sulfate marietou et al 2009 nitrate reduction coupled to propane or butane oxidation would be energetically feasible recently a bacterial lineage within the class symbiobacteriia candidatus alkanivorans nitratireducens was proved to mediate nitrate dependent anaerobic propane oxidation wu et al 2022 compared to the limited nitrate reduction rate under anaerobic conditions 0 5 1 2 mg n l d wu et al 2022 biological nitrate reduction driven by propane or butane under oxygen limiting conditions would be more favorable to achieve a quick nitrate removal from contaminated water overall the objective of this study was to test the feasibility of microbial nitrate reduction using propane or butane as electron donors under oxygen limiting conditions in order to achieve this aim two independent mbfrs were set up in which hollow fibre membranes were employed to supply propane or butane and to provide surfaces for biofilm attachment nitrate was continuously fed into the reactors as the sole electron acceptor to evaluate the long term nitrate removal performance multiple batch tests were conducted to study the mechanisms of microbial nitrate reduction driven by propane or butane the key microbes involved in propane or butane oxidation and nitrate reduction were identified by high throughput sequencing for targeting both 16s rrna gene and functional genes bmox encoding alpha hydroxylase subunit of propane butane monooxygenase and narg encoding nitrate reductase it is expected that the findings will improve our understanding of propane or butane based nitrate reduction processes and may ultimately help us develop techniques to remove nitrate from contaminated water 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbfr setup and operation two mbfrs which have similar configurations with that used in our previous study lai et al 2020 were set up in this study fig s1 each mbfr was equipped with two glass tubes and two bundles of hollow fiber membranes which contained 84 fibers model mhf 200tl mitsubishi ltd japan the mbfr has a total volume of 200 ml and total membrane surface area of 123 cm2 pure propane or n butane hereafter butane gas 99 99 coregas

mixed and recirculated at a flow rate of 78 ml min using a peristaltic pump masterflex usa in order to trigger propane and butane oxidation limited oxygen was delivered at 150 mg l d to the systems through an oxygen permeable tubing for the recirculation silicone tubing longerpump china the mbfrs were covered with aluminium foil to avoid alga growth and operated in a temperature controlled lab 22 2 c in order to achieve biofilm attachment on the membrane surfaces 20 ml of activated sludge from a full scale wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia was used as the inoculum for each mbfr and then the sludge was mixed with fresh medium containing 20 mg n l no3 via recirculation for 48 h the synthetic medium was prepared as follows unit g l if not specified cacl2 1 mg mgso4 7h2o 5 mg

to the surface no3 loading rate of 0 53 and 1 05 g n m2 d was continuously fed into the mbfr at hrt of 6 5 h in stages 1 and 2 respectively in stage 3 influent nitrate concentration was maintained at 20 mg n l and hrt was increased to 10 h to improve nitrate removal efficiency in order to test if nitrate could be consumed without propane butane the gas supply of propane butane to each mbfr was intentionally stopped for 10 days after stage 3 and then recovered during the entire operational period liquid samples were collected from the reactor 2 3 times per week to monitor the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite 2 2 batch tests three batch tests each bath test was run in triplicate were conducted for each mbfr at the end of long term operation table s1 bath test a was carried out in situ mbfr to study the dynamic changes of propane butane and nitrate under oxygen limiting conditions the pumps feeding influent medium was stopped and the supply of propane butane to the hollow fibers was cut off fresh medium containing 20 mg n l no3 was sparged with propane butane for 30 min and then introduced into the mbfrs to eliminate any headspace liquid samples were collected every 1 2 h to monitor the dissolved propane butane and nitrate concentration fresh medium saturated with helium was injected into the mbfr after each sampling to compensate for liquid losses due to sampling and the dilution effect of the extra liquid brought to the reactor was considered during data analysis bath test b was conducted to evaluate the nitrate reduction rates in the absence of propane butane the mbfr was disconnected from the gas cylinder to stop propane butane supply and the residual gas in the gas tubes and hollow fibers was removed by flushing with n2 for 30 min oxygen supply

regularly taken to measure the concentrations of nitrate batch test c was carried out to study the pattern of propane butane oxidation and nitrate reduction under anaerobic conditions biofilms were scrapped off from the hollow fibers and mixed with fresh synthetic medium containing 40 mg n l no3 in serum bottles the serum bottles were sparged with n2 gas for 30 min and then sealed with rubber stoppers propane butane was injected into the headspace of serum bottles using gas tight syringes the serum bottles were wrapped with aluminium foil and incubated at 22 2 c headspace gas and liquid samples were taken regularly to determine propane butane and nitrate respectively in order to further confirm oxygen as a triggering factor for propane butane activation pure oxygen gas 99 99 coregas australia was injected into the headspace of serum bottles to make the ratios of oxygen propane and oxygen butane both as 2 1 at the end of batch test c the other experimental conditions were maintained the same as described above the statistical significances of different batch tests were determined by one way analysis of variance anova using graphpad prism differences with p 0 05 were

performed based on ncbi database 3 results 3 1 long term performance of nitrate reduction in propane butane based mbfrs initially in stage 1 synthetic influent containing 10 mg n l no3 was continuously fed into the two mbfrs supplied with propane butane nitrate was completely removed without nitrite accumulation at hrt of 6 5 h for both mbfrs giving rise to a nitrate removal rate of 37 mg n l d fig 1 a and b with nitrate concentration in influent increased to 20 mg n l in stage 2 nitrate removal efficiency decreased to 25 40 and 40 65 initially but finally recovered to 50 65 and 70 80 for propane and butane fed mbfrs respectively with hrt increased from 6 5 h to 10 h at stage 3 the propane and butane based mbfrs achieved a nitrate removal efficiency of 75 85 and 85 95 respectively and the effluent nitrate concentration was below 5 mg n l which could meet the groundwater standard 10 mg n l established by us epa doudrick et al 2013 however when propane butane gas supply was stopped for the reactors the nitrate removal rates significantly decreased from above 32 to 2 10 mg n l d for propane and above 38 to 4 9 mg n l d for butane correspondingly nitrate concentration increased to 13 19 and 13 15 mg n l in propane based and butane based mbfrs respectively once gases were re supplied to each mbfr nitrate removal efficiency was recovered to 75 80 3 2 dynamic changes of nitrate propane butane in batch tests in order to further understand the mechanisms of propane butane based microbial nitrate reduction processes multiple batch tests were conducted at the end of long term operation for each mbfr in batch test a nitrate was consistently decreased without nitrite accumulation for both mbfrs fig 2 a and b at similar reduction rates 1 23 0 10 and 1 18 0 15 mg n l h for propane and butane respectively simultaneously propane and butane were also decreased with time at consumption rates of 4 48 0 81 mg l h for propane and 5 73 0 75 mg l h for butane fig 2a and b the electrons generated by propane and butane oxidation was 2 4 fold and 3 1 fold of electrons required for nitrate and oxygen reduction respectively table s2 however nitrate reduction rates 0 39 0 06 mg n l h for propane and 0 42 0 03 mg n l h for butane in batch test b without the supply of propane butane were significantly lower than that in batch test a when propane butane was provided p 0 01 fig 2c and d fig s2 for batch test c the biofilms were incubated under anaerobic conditions in order to explore the role of oxygen in propane and butane based nitrate reduction it was found that the oxidation rates of propane and butane under anaerobic conditions were less than 0 1 mg l h significantly lower p 0 01 than that in batch test a when limited oxygen was supplied fig 2e and f fig s2 in addition nitrate reduction rates were also dramatically decreased to 0 07 0 01 mg n l h for propane and 0 05 0 00 mg n l h for butane p 0 01 fig 2e and f fig s2 however with oxygen gas injected into the serum bottles used in batch test c oxygen propane or butane 2 1 nitrate reduction rates were quickly recovered to 0 46 0 07 mg n l h for propane and 0 48 0 02 mg n l h for butane fig 2e and f concurrently propane and butane consumption rates were increased to 6 62 0 07 mg l h and 4 20 0 37 mg l h respectively 3 3 microbial community structure microbial communities of the inoculum and propane butane shaped biofilms were first investigated using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to track which microorganisms were enriched in the biofilms results fig 3 a and b showed that mycobacterium which is negligible in the inoculum with a relative abundance of 0 1 of total microorganims was obviously enriched in the propane butane shaped biofilms 3 0 6 1 for propane and 1 1 2 1 for butane genus affiliated to rhodococcus was undetectable in the inoculum but it became dominant in the butane fed biofilms 3 3 5 7 differently rhodococcus was not found in any biofilms fed by propane in addition the relative abundances of dechloromonas denitratisoma and zoogloea which all affiliated to the rhodocyclaceae family were increased from 0 5 1 9 and being undetected in the inoculum to 2 5 9 4 2 8 6 0 and 0 4 4 3 in the propane shaped biofilms and 6 5 17 6 2 4 9 0 and 0 8 7 2 in the butane fed biofilms respectively propane fed biofilms were also dominated by holophagaceae 7 1 10 1 and fimbriimonadaceae 1 4 11 4 while both reactors boosted the growth of anaerolineaceae 3 7 11 4 and flavobacterium 0 9 5 8 that were suggested to be able to utilize extracellular polysaccharides and proteins as carbon sources bernardet and bowman 2006 sun et al 2016 in order to further identify major functional microbes performing propane butane oxidation and nitrate reduction high throughput sequencing targeting bmox and narg genes was applied results suggested that the genus of mycobacterium dominated in the microbial groups containing bmox gene in both propane 22 4 54 8 and butane 2 6 15 7 shaped biofilms fig 4 a which is in accordance with the 16s rrna gene sequencing results that propane butane supply significantly promoted the growth of mycobacterium in addition another genus of thauera was also found to be predominant in the propane fed biofilms 13 3 58 2 and its relative abundance varied from 0 2 to 33 3 in the biofilms supplied with butane however thauera was very minor 0 1 in the biofilms according to 16s rrna gene sequencing acidovorax was the major genus in the narg gene containing community for both propane and butane fed biofilms 3 6 52 3 fig 4b followed by variovorax 0 7 12 5 and pseudogulbenkiania 0 5 8 0 rhodanobacter accounted for 3 0 6 3 in the microbial groups containing narg gene for the butane shaped biofilms but was undetected for propane the relative abundances of these four genera detected by narg gene sequencing were consistently low 0 1 for all biofilms based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing 4 discussion 4 1 potential mechanisms of microbial nitrate reduction coupled to propane butane oxidation although nitrate removal driven by aerobic or anaerobic methane oxidation has been intensively studied in previous work cai et al 2015 luo et al 2018 sun et al 2013 the feasibility of nitrate reduction using propane or butane as electron donors has not been investigated so far this study demonstrated that nitrate removal could be achieved in two independent mbfrs supplied with propane butane under oxygen limiting conditions considering these gaseous alkanes were the sole electron donors for each mbfr the continuous nitrate removal with the presence of propane butane and the dramatically decreased reduction rates without these alkanes collectively suggested that nitrate reduction was associated with propane butane oxidation in addition simultaneous propane butane and nitrate consumption were observed in batch test a while nitrate reduction rates were also significantly lower in the absence of propane butane batch test b than that with the presence of propane butane batch test a further confirming that nitrate bio reduction was driven by propane butane oxidation the observed nitrate reduction without propane butane was likely driven by organic components such as extracellular polymeric substances and polyhydroxyalkanoates generated in the biofilms which have been shown to support selenate perchlorate or vanadate reduction in ethane propane methane based mbfrs lai et al 2018 2020 2021a 2021b it should be noted that limited oxygen 150 mg l d was intentionally supplied to the reactors to boost the aerobic oxidation of propane butane indeed limited oxygen was found to play an important role in propane butane based nitrate reduction propane butane and nitrate consumption rates were obvious with oxygen provided in batch test a while their consumption rates were significantly decreased in batch test c when the biofilms were incubated under anaerobic conditions moreover after limited oxygen was re provided to the biofilm cultures the consumption rates of propane butane and nitrate were significantly increased further confirming that oxygen supply was essential for triggering propane butane based nitrate reduction it has been suggested that limited oxygen supply was necessary for ethane propane driven microbial selenate and perchlorate reduction lai et al 2020 2021a the perchlorate removal rate in a methane based mbfr was also increased from 4 mg cl l d under anoxic conditions to 16 mg cl l d when 10 mg l d of oxygen was externally supplied wu et al 2019 in addition the o2 ch4 ratio was suggested to have a significant impact on nitrate removal rates of the aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification processes in which 0 25 was identified as the optimal ratio for denitrification zhu et al 2017 nevertheless the role of oxygen in propane butane driven nitrate reduction requires systematical investigations in future studies which will also ultimately improve nitrate removal capacities for bioremediation in terms of microbial community analysis using 16s rrna gene and functional gene sequencing microbial nitrate reduction driven by propane butane appears to be completed via a partnership between two functional groups aerobic propane butane oxidation bacteria and nitrate reducers compared to microbial communities in the inoculum mycobacterium was significantly enriched in both mbfrs supplied with propane and butane moreover high throughput sequencing targeting the bmox gene also showed that microbial communities were dominated by mycobacterium for both biofilms indicating that mycobacterium played an important role in propane butane oxidation in the mbfrs in addition the butane fed biofilms were also dominated by rhodococcus although rhodococcus was not identified by bmox gene sequencing it should be noted that the primer sets used in this study might not be specific for amplifying butane oxidation genes in rhodococcus and thus we cannot exclude the possibility that rhodococcus also performed butane oxidation in the butane fed mbfr indeed many strains affiliated to the genera of mycobacterium and rhodococcus have been reported to be able to grow on propane and butane shennan 2006 for example mycobacterium strain nbb4 harbours complete gene clusters encoding multiple monooxygenases mo including propane mo and butane mo and was shown to grow on propane and butane coleman et al 2011 rhodococcus sp strain bcp1 could oxidize butane and generate 1 butanol as the terminal oxidation product cappelletti et al 2015 another potential propane butane oxidation genus thauera which has been reported to oxidize c3 c5 alkanes via the expression of soluble butane monooxygenase cooley et al 2009 was also detected in the biofilms by the bmox gene sequencing 0 2 58 2 although they were negligible 0 1 in the 16s rrna gene sequencing results regarding nitrate reduction diverse nitrate reducers were enriched in the propane butane fed biofilms including the genera of dechloromonas denitratisoma and zoogloea based on 16s rrna gene sequencing and acidovorax variovorax pseudogulbenkiania and rhodanobacter according to narg gene sequencing various strains affiliated to these genera have been well recognized as denitrifiers chen et al 2019 coates et al 2001 fahrbach et al 2006 huang et al 2015 im et al 2010 maintinguer et al 2013 prakash et al 2012 indicating they may have performed nitrate reduction in the biofilms using the electrons or intermediates generated from aerobic propane butane oxidation in order to provide insights into the mechanisms of microbial nitrate reduction driven by propane butane under oxygen limiting conditions long term operation batch tests together with 16s rrna and functional gene sequencing were combined in this study it is proposed that propane butane was aerobically oxidized by mycobacterium rhodococcus thauera in which unknown intermediates might be generated and simultaneously utilized to reduce nitrate by denitrifiers e g dechloromonas denitratisoma zoogloea acidovorax variovorax pseudogulbenkiania and rhodanobacter fig s3 potential intermediates such as acids and alcohols were monitored in this study but found to be negligible 0 5 mg l possibly because they were completely consumed by denitrifiers indeed acetate was not detected in a methane based mbfr while the external addition of acetate immediately boosts up perchlorate reduction rates suggesting it may be a key syntrophic linkage between aerobic methanotrophs and perchlorate reducers wang et al 2022 however it cannot be completely excluded that mycobacterium rhodococcus might independently carry out the propane butane driven nitrate reduction since a few strains of these bacteria were capable of performing denitrification chen et al 2012 sohaskey and modesti 2009 and mycobacterium was also detected in the biofilms by narg gene sequencing 0 1 2 1 further studies are required to reveal the detailed pathways by using isotope tracing and meta omics techniques 4 2 implications of this work this work was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of removing nitrate from contaminated water using propane and butane as electron donors and give insights into the mechanisms given natural gas is composed of methane ethane propane and butane further studies are required to investigate the feasibility of using mixtures of these gases for nitrate removal in mbfrs which will ultimately help the development of cost effective techniques for groundwater remediation using natural gas groundwater constitutes a primary drinking water source for 33 and 70 of the population in the us and china kenny et al 2009 qiu 2011 respectively while it suffers from serious contamination and nitrate is one of the dominant pollutants burow et al 2010 although a multitude of technologies have been developed for nitrate remediation such as catalytic reduction of nitrate reddy and lin 2000 and adding extra carbon sources ethanol or methanol to stimulate nitrate bio reduction gomez et al 2000 nitrate removal using natural gas based mbfrs has a few advantages firstly natural gas 0 019 0 100 per mol electrons is much cheaper than organic carbon sources such as ethanol 0 17 0 29 per mol electrons markets insider 2022 which suggests it is more economically attractive to utilize natural gas for bio reduction compared to ethanol secondly natural gas is less soluble than organic matters and thus will not remain in effluent avoiding post treatment therefore it might be feasible to use natural gas based mbfrs to treat nitrate contaminated groundwater in addition scgas and nitrate are found to co exist in shale gas extraction sites where leakage of shale gas causes scga emissions and hydraulic fracturing process leads to generation of high volumes of wastewater containing nitrate umukoro and ismail 2017 sun et al 2019 it is potentially feasible to utilize propane and butane produced in situ shale gas exploitation sites to treat nitrate contamination nevertheless compared to the reported nitrate removal rates driven by aerobic methane oxidation processes 24 260 mg n l d modin et al 2007 the rates achieved in this study 40 50 mg l d were relatively lower while it could be potentially further optimized via the optimization of oxygen supply oxygen was found to be an essential triggering factor for propane butane oxidation in this study since it is required to incorporate o atom into the c h bond of scgas to activate them however it should be noticed that given the high redox potential of oxygen it can also be a strong electron acceptor outcompeting nitrate for electrons indeed a proper oxygen supply 184 mg l d was suggested to enhance the selenate reduction rate in a methane based mbfr while an excessive oxygen supply 626 mg l d suppressed selenate reduction indicating oxygen plays a dual role in methane based selenate reduction wang et al 2021 therefore it requires further investigation how oxygen supply rate could be precisely controlled to maintain the balance between propane butane oxidation and nitrate reduction and eventually maximize nitrate removal rates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14889,identifying the distribution of multi trophic microbiota under the complicated hydrodynamic characteristics of channel confluences and evaluating the microbial contributions to biogeochemical processes are vital for river regulation and ecological function protection however relevant studies mainly focus on bacterial community distribution in confluence neglecting the essential role of multi trophic microbiota in the aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical processes to address this knowledge gap this study investigated the distribution of multi trophic microbiota and the underlying assembly process under the hydraulic characteristics in the confluence and described the direct and indirect effects of multi trophic microbiota on the nitrogen dynamics results revealed that in a river confluence eukaryotic communities were governed by deterministic processes 52 4 and bacterial communities were determined by stochastic processes 74 3 the response of higher trophic levels to environmental factors was intensively higher than that of lower trophic microbiota resulting in higher trophic microbiota were significantly different between regions with varied environmental conditions p 0 05 flow velocity was the driving force controlling the assembly and composition of multi trophic microbiota and interactions among multi trophic levels and further made a significant difference to nitrogen dynamics in regions with lower flow velocity interactions among multi trophic levels were more complex there were intense nitrate and nitrite reduction and anammox reactions via direct impacts of protozoan and metazoan and the top down control protozoan and metazoan prey on heterotrophic bacteria among multi trophic microbiota results and findings reveal the ecological effect on river nitrogen removal in a river confluence under complex hydraulic conditions and provide useful information for river management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords river confluence multi trophic nitrogen dynamics confluence characteristic microbial food web data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction confluence are typical structures of urban river systems and are essential for the connectivity of river systems sukhodolov et al 2017 the merging of the two channels will result in dramatic changes in flow dynamics and produce complex hydraulic characteristics yuan et al 2022 according to the characteristics of the bed morphology and flow patterns at confluences reported by previous researches channel confluences are usually divided into six different hydraulic regions including flow stagnation region fst flow deflection region fd flow separation region fse maximum velocity region mv gradual flow recovery region fr and shear layers region sl best et al 1987 each region has unique flow characteristics such as a near zero velocity magnitude at fst increased turbulence levels at sl and recirculating flow at fse hydrological variations are essential to the functions of the river affecting biogeochemical services such as primary production and nutrient cycling yang et al 2021a therefore revealing the biogeochemical processes under the complex hydraulic conditions of channel confluence is significant for protecting river ecosystem health microorganisms are vital components of the river ecosystem and play a crucial role in ecological function reed et al 2014 louca et al 2016 environmental factors including nutrients temperature and hydrodynamics affect the microbial composition and distribution yuan et al 2021 hydrodynamics is identified as the vital physical force changing river microbial communities battin et al 2016 which drives the changes in the microbial biofilm structure besemer et al 2012 the community assembly and community metabolism processes singer et al 2010 the diverse microbial composition endowed them with various ecological functions e g energy transference organic matter degradation and nutrient absorption stegen et al 2016 recent researches found that the composition and assembly of microorganisms in the channel confluence were significantly different from those in the straight river samson et al 2019 channel confluences influenced the microbial community phylogeny rajput et al 2022 and accelerated the migration of nutrients louca et al 2016 and pollutants li et al 2020c which further changed the function of river systems the results found in the previous studies have made microbial composition community assembly and functional potentials under complex hydraulic characteristics of river confluence a research hot spot however relevant studies mainly focus on the impact of hydrological changes on single trophic microbiota in channel confluence especially bacteria wang et al 2020 neglecting eukaryotic communities the vital components of microbial ecosystems kamp et al 2015 from the ecosystem perspective biological functions are not merely affected by single trophic level but are driven by multi trophic level species schmidt et al 2019 in river ecosystems microbial food webs are mainly formed by a combination of multi trophic microorganisms such as protozoan metazoan algae and bacteria and abiotic factors such as nutrient availability there were interactions among multi trophic microbiota which could result in cascading effects through top down predation and bottom up nutrient supply controls ozen et al 2018 multi trophic microbiota could occur at high densities in sediments and promoted material and energy fluxes via shifting the production of lower trophic levels to higher trophic levels ritz et al 2017 thus biological processes do not usually occur in isolation and are associated with other reactions at the same trophic levels or between the adjacent trophic levels e g reciprocity predation and parasitism altering ecosystem and biogeochemical processes rocha et al 2019 besides the composition of multi trophic microbiota and interactions among multi trophic microbiota could affect the nutrient cycles ardon et al 2021 which could either contribute to the nutrient utilization or accumulation yang et al 2021a therefore it is crucial to assess the impact of nutrient transport and transmission under the interactions among multi trophic microorganisms at the food web level in the urban channel in addition various researches have shown that flow patterns affected the composition of multi trophic species horppila et al 2019 the feeding efficiency and prey selection of predators harkonen et al 2014 and the cascading effects along the microbial food web palmer and ruhi 2019 the strength of top down and bottom up forces changed with flow rate gualtieri et al 2019 leading to hydrologic commonly decoupled predation and resource processes leonard et al 1998 making flow conditions vital in microbial food web dynamics recent laboratory research has demonstrated that the changes of flow velocity significantly affected the microbial composition of multi trophic levels and further affected nitrogen conversion through cascades yang et al 2022b however the composition and distribution of multi trophic microbiota in channel confluence and their response to complex flow conditions in the channel confluence still remain unclear urban channels are nitrogen sinks and hot spots of nitrogen pollution zhang et al 2015 nitrogen in high concentration could accelerate phytoplankton growth increasing oxygen consumption and disrupting aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2019 identifying the process of nitrogen transport and transformation in channel confluences is vital to alleviate nitrogen pollution nitrogen dynamics was deemed to be involved by microorganisms eukaryotes and bacteria are directly involved in the transport and transformation of nitrogen yang et al 2021 besides interactions among multi trophic microbiota also affected nitrogen dynamics via top down forces ozen et al 2018 tso and taghon 2006 channel confluence was identified as the hotspot for nitrogen removal of the river network due to complex hydraulic conditions channel confluence enriched the microbial communities that promote nitrogen removal li et al 2020a hui et al 2022 however relevant studies mainly focus on the impact of single trophic microbial groups on nitrogen dynamics under complex hydraulic conditions especially bacteria neglecting the potential role of multi trophic microbiota kamp et al 2015 wang et al 2020 therefore this study aims to elucidate the response of benthic multi trophic microbiota to complex flow conditions in urban channel confluence areas and the effects of multi trophic microbiota on nitrogen dynamics analysis was performed to 1 identify the composition and distribution of multi trophic microbiota at channel confluence 2 illuminate the interactions among multi trophic microbiota and identify the environmental factors that influenced multi trophic community assembly 3 explore the direct and indirect effects of multi trophic microbiota on nitrogen dynamics under complex hydraulic conditions to achieve the purpose above the composition pattern of the multi trophic microbiota was explored by statistical methods based on next generation 16s and 18s rrna genes co occurrence network analysis was conducted to illustrate the correlations among multi trophic microbiota the multi trophic community assembly was quantitated by the β nearest taxon index βnti based on the community assembly method provided by stegen stegen et al 2016 the path models were set up to visualize the potential role of multi trophic microbiota in nitrogen dynamics the results in this study can help to realize the influence of hydraulic conditions changes at urban channel confluence on the benthic ecosystem and support for urban channel regulation and ecological function protection 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sample collection thirty samples were

1 composition and distribution of multi trophic microbiota 27 019 bacterial otus including heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria and 3409 eukaryotic otus including various algae protozoans and metazoans were observed autotrophic bacteria were not individually discussed due to heterotrophic bacteria playing dominant roles in the benthic heterotrophic food web faupel et al 2012 and almost all reads of bacteria belonged to heterotrophs table s5 at the phylum level fig 2 the most abundant protozoans were ciliophora 36 5 followed by cercozoa 21 8 and tubulinea 10 6 for the metazoan community the abundant phylum was gastrotricha 33 3 followed by nematoda 19 5 and arthropoda 15 7 the algae community was dominated by bacillariophyta 75 1 streptophyta 15 and chlorophyta 8 9 proteobacteria 42 1 was the most abundant heterotrophic bacterial community followed by chloroflexi 17 5 and acidobacteria 10 8 the dominant community in protozoans such as ciliates and heterotrophic flagellates and metazoans such as arthropods nematodes and rotifers in channel confluence were proved to be the vital components of microbial food web weitere et al 2018 to analyze the influence of hydraulic characteristics on the microbial community pcoa was applied to identify the difference of multi trophic microbiota composition among different hydraulic regions however there was no distinct difference in multi trophic microbiota composition among different regions fig s1 the hydraulic regions were classified according to flow directions riverbed morphology and locations tang et al 2017 however the external factors that directly affected the microbiota such as nutrient concentrations can be similar among various hydraulic regions yuan et al 2022 song et al 2022 therefore to identify the difference of four chemical indices and flow velocity among different hydraulic regions dmrt was conducted table s3 according to the result of dmrt all sampling points were divided into two groups group 1 g1 includes the sampling points in fst fd fse and tu group 2 g2 was formed by the sampling points in mu mv sl and fr to confirm the difference in multi trophic microbiota composition between two groups pcoa analysis was applied fig 3 higher trophic levels protozoan metazoan and algae from these two groups separated well and lower trophic level heterotrophic bacterial showed no apparent difference between two groups anosim was subsequently carried out and further confirmed that protozoan r 0 307 p 0 001 metazoan r 0 589 p 0 001 and algae r 0 307 p 0 002 were significantly different between g1 and g2 however no significant difference in heterotrophic bacteria r 0 129 p 0 053 was found between the two groups furthermore highly differential multi trophic microbiota between the two groups were identified as shown in fig 4 protozoans including ciliophora apicomplexa evosea endomyxa and perkimsozoa and metazoans including nematoda rotifera and arthropoda were enriched in g1 ciliophora was a key species in the microbial food web and strongly associated with other species ciliophora such as ciliates worked as predators of diatoms in the microbial food web loder et al 2011 and indirectly competed with metazoans such as copepods and dinoflagellates aberle et al 2007 sherr and sherr 2007 nematoda and rotifera which fed on bacteria and protozoans were the most widely reported predators in most benthic systems yang et al 2020 besides all algae species found in the study area were enriched in g1 in aquatic systems changes in algae might increase the number and abundance of primary consumers increasing the number of predators and their interactions mor et al 2018 therefore above results showed that the composition and distribution of multi trophic levels including the main components of the microbial food web differed in two regions of the channel confluence which might lead to various interactions among multi trophic microbiota 3 2 interactions among multi trophic microbiota to reveal the interactions of multi trophic microbiota and illuminate potential ecologically significant between taxa a co occurrence network was applied layeghifard et al 2017 the co occurrence network of g1 comprised 125 nodes with 25 protozoan otus 30 metazoan otus 5 algae otus and 65 bacterial otus the co occurrence network of g2 comprised 111 nodes with 12 protozoan otus 20 metazoan otus 5 algae otus and 74 bacterial otus to determine the correlations among multi trophic microorganisms different colored dots were used to indicate protozoan metazoan algae and heterotrophic bacteria various colored links were used to indicate positive and negative relationships between species fig 5 positive correlations in a network would mean that communities have similar preferences are symbiosis or have mutualistic relationships among the taxa that cooperate within the same niche negative correlations may mean that competition or predation between the taxa steele et al 2011 the results showed that the g1 network had more negatively correlated edges 32 9 than the g2 network 14 4 indicating that more microorganisms shared the same ecological niche and performed similar ecological roles in g2 on the contrary microorganisms in g1 might have more significant predation and competition relationships however such competition or predation would occur between the same or different trophic levels thus to point out whether predation and competition occur within the same trophic levels or between different trophic levels edges with different colors were used to represent links between the same trophic level and between different trophic levels fig 5 results illustrated that predation and competition between different trophic levels existed in g1 and g2 these results were consistent with literature which proved that predator prey relationships are the most essential interactions between microorganisms bjorbaekmo et al 2020 in addition more correlations between different trophic levels were found in g1 34 3 than in g2 17 8 illustrating that many edges target from lower to higher trophic levels species vice versa based on these results there were more predation and competition correlations between different trophic levels in g1 that is more top down and bottom up controls of the microbial food web existed in g1 3 3 environmental factors affecting multi trophic microbiota the assembly of microbial communities was considered to be determined by deterministic and stochastic processes which crucially affect the microbial community composition and the interactions among multi trophic microbiota martiny et al 2011 bahram et al 2016 li et al 2020d to identify the assembly of multi trophic microbiota in channel confluence the βnti metric of bacterial and eukaryotic communities were calculated respectively the results showed that eukaryotic communities of urban channel confluence were governed by deterministic processes 52 4 including homogeneous selection 32 9 and variable selection 19 5 bacterial communities were governed by stochastic processes 74 3 including homogenizing dispersal 73 8 and ecological drift 0 5 environmental pressures consistent within each group would dominated the dispersal process which governed microbial community assembly dini andreote et al 2015 the significant difference in environmental various such as hydraulic conditions and concentration of chemical indicators including different forms of nitrogen between two groups made the variable selection process dominant and finally formed the different formation of multi trophic microbiota in channel confluence the proportion of deterministic processes increasing from low trophic levels to high trophic levels indicated the response of higher trophic levels to environmental factors was intensively higher than that of lower trophic microbiota in the channel confluence these results were consistent with the distribution patterns of multi trophic microbiota by pcoa fig 3 explaining that the environmental various between groups led to significant dissimilar in higher trophic microbiota to have deeper investigations in the potential role of the environmental factors including hydraulic characteristics and nutrition concentration in regulating the multi trophic microbiota community assembly in channel confluences the βnti metric was measured as shown in fig 6 flow velocity was significantly correlated with the βnti of bacterial and eukaryotic communities p 0 05 these results indicated assembly of the microbial community assembly shifted from matched with stochastic processes βnti 2 to matched with flow velocity βnti 2 that is driven by flow velocity tn nh4 no3 and no2 were significantly correlated with the βnti of bacterial and eukaryotic communities p 0 05 which probably due to multi trophic microbiota would directly or indirectly participate in material cycles kamp et al 2015 it has long been assumed that microorganisms mediate the nitrogen cycle in riverine ecosystems gao et al 2021 and the potential role of hydrological characteristics on nitrogen dynamics have been systematically reported zhang et al 2020b the significant role of flow velocity to microbial ecological processes was investigated in our study these results indicated that the multi trophic microbiota changed in response to hydrological conditions represented by flow dynamics and significantly affected nitrogen dynamics the different ecological processes determining the community assembly was essential for forming the mutualistic and antagonistic co occurrence patterns freilich et al 2018 results of microbial ecological processes and co occurrence network in this study showed that slower flow velocity in fse fd and fst promoted more interactions among multi trophic species in g1 these results were consistent with recent studies huber et al 2020 which confirmed that due to higher niche segregation under the higher environmental heterogeneity a large number of highly related taxa were found besides biotic interactions such as predation and competition affected nitrogen dynamics via cascading effects therefore this study suggested that the higher trophic microbiota shaped by deterministic processes i e flow velocity might affect the nitrogen transformation in urban channel confluence 3 4 the potential role of multi trophic microbiota in nitrogen dynamics nitrogen dynamics in sediment were proved to be affected by multi trophic microbiota along microbial food web nguyen et al 2020 to investigate the potential role of the multi trophic microbiota along microbial food web in nitrogen dynamics of urban channel confluence a path model was conducted to investigate the correlation between different multi trophic levels and their effects on nitrogen dynamics the interactions among multi trophic levels were considered in our model such as the protozoa prey on heterotrophic bacteria and algae metazoan prey on protozoa heterotrophic bacteria and algae yang et al 2021b the hydraulic condition could directly affect the microbial communities including heterotrophic bacteria protozoan metazoan and algae which belong to different trophic levels eukaryotes have been reported to involved in nitrogen transformation in direct such as assimilation and indirect such as predation and excretion processes yang et al 2021b protozoans with high excretion rates produced large quantities of nh4 and large quantities of nh4 were excreted by metazoans when nutrients were over their growth demands heterotrophic bacteria are the direct and critical driver of nitrogen transformations in river sediments bacteria were mainly involved in processes of anammox and denitrification li et al 2020b liang et al 2022 besides heterotrophic bacteria such as chloroflexi nitrospinae and nitrospirae consumed nh4 via phototrophic nitrite oxidation and complete ammonia oxidation and then came into no3 kuypers et al 2018 these correlations were all considered in the path model and exhibited a proper fit with χ2 df 1 036 the value in the range of 1 3 is acceptable and ifi 0 944 0 9 zhang et al 2020a as shown in fig 7 negative correlations were found between protozoan and heterotrophic bacteria r 0 26 protozoan and algae r 0 33 metazoan and heterotrophic bacteria r 0 48 metazoan and algae r 0 24 the results of path models suggested that the multi trophic microorganisms in channel confluence did not exist in isolation and illustrated that top down predation forces were the main forces in controlling the microbial food web domingues et al 2017 which proved that predator prey are the most essential interactions among microorganisms bjorbaekmo et al 2020 the model showed that flow velocity had positive correlations with protozoan r 0 30 algae r 0 33 and heterotrophic bacteria r 0 06 and had negative correlations with metazoan r 0 27 these results indicated that flow velocity benefited the protozoan and heterotrophic bacteria and inhibited the abundance of metazoan in channel confluence high flow velocity contributed to the increase in nutrient and suspended solids concentrations which could accelerate the growth and development of tiny microorganisms such as protozoan and heterotrophic bacteria yang et al 2022b besides it was interesting to find that flow velocity promoted the algae abundance in channel confluence this result can be attributed to the enrichment of bacillariophyta and chlorophyta in channel confluence fig 2 bacillariophyta and chlorophyta could not move on their own making them better adapt to turbulent conditions where high flow velocity accelerate availability of nutrients zhou et al 2016 yang et al 2022a besides most bacillariophyta genera were coupled with their silica shell and had relatively large sizes making bacillariophyta more adapted to high flow velocity tréguer et al 2017 all above results suggested that hydraulic conditions might control the composition of multi trophic microbiota as well as the interactions among trophic levels to alter the patterns of the microbial food web furthermore the direct and cascading effects through multi trophic levels on nitrogen conversion were observed in regions with lower flow velocity nitrate and nitrite reduction processes were promoted via direct effect by species of different trophic levels and indirect effect by predation among multi trophic levels the reduced flow velocity enriched metazoan which was directly conducive to reducing no2 to nh4 lower flow velocity decreased the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria and protozoan which directly promoted the anammox of no2 and no3 protozoans such as flagellates and algae such as diatoms and chlorophytes reduced no3 to no2 via nitrate reduction reactions comeau et al 2019 besides metazoans and protozoans indirectly promoted the production of no3 and no2 via top down control of heterotrophic bacteria by predation the aerobic nitrification communities adapted well to the low oxygen conditions and carry out the ammoxidation of no3 and no2 kuypers et al 2018 in addition eukaryotes including protozoan such as ciliates dinoflagellate metazoan such as foraminifers and algae such as diatoms were able to store no3 intracellularly and use it for dissimilatory no3 reduction and eukaryotes might rival prokaryotes in terms of dissimilatory no3 reduction kamp et al 2015 the predation of bacteria by higher trophic levels inhibited the absorption of no2 and no3 by bacteria in channel confluence thus the no2 and no3 reduction reactions by higher trophic levels might be the main process of nitrate removal all the above results suggested that in regions with lower velocity such as fse fst and fd there were intense no2 and no3 reduction and anammox reactions via direct impacts of multi trophic microbiota and the top down control predation among multi trophic microbiota 4 conclusion in summary this study found apparent predator prey relationships exhibiting in channel confluence the velocity at the confluence was the main driver shaping the composition and distribution of multi trophic microbiota the response of higher trophic levels to flow velocity was strongly higher than that of lower trophic levels resulting in significant differences in the composition of the higher trophic level microbiota between different river confluence regions flow velocity critically affected nitrogen dynamics in the microbial food web by regulating the composition of microbial food web in regions with lower flow velocity interactions among multi trophic levels were more complex intense nitrate and nitrite reduction and anammox reactions occurred in region with lower flow velocity via direct impacts of multi trophic microbiota and the top down control predation among multi trophic microbiota we suggested that complex flow conditions significantly impact higher trophic microbiota by controlling the bottom up forces in channel confluence and in turn affect the nitrogen cycle via top down forces consequently paying attention to high trophic microorganisms and identifying responses of microbial food webs to environmental factors in urban channel with complex flow conditions is a crucial measure of urban channel management this study comprehensively described the influence of hydraulic conditions changes at urban channel confluence on the benthic ecosystem and proposed the potential ecological risks offering a guidance for urban channel

14889,identifying the distribution of multi trophic microbiota under the complicated hydrodynamic characteristics of channel confluences and evaluating the microbial contributions to biogeochemical processes are vital for river regulation and ecological function protection however relevant studies mainly focus on bacterial community distribution in confluence neglecting the essential role of multi trophic microbiota in the aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical processes to address this knowledge gap this study investigated the distribution of multi trophic microbiota and the underlying assembly process under the hydraulic characteristics in the confluence and described the direct and indirect effects of multi trophic microbiota on the nitrogen dynamics results revealed that in a river confluence eukaryotic communities were governed by deterministic processes 52 4 and bacterial communities were determined by stochastic processes 74 3 the response of higher trophic levels to environmental factors was intensively higher than that of lower trophic microbiota resulting in higher trophic microbiota were significantly different between regions with varied environmental conditions p 0 05 flow velocity was the driving force controlling the assembly and composition of multi trophic microbiota and interactions among multi trophic levels and further made a significant difference to nitrogen dynamics in regions with lower flow velocity interactions among multi trophic levels were more complex there were intense nitrate and nitrite reduction and anammox reactions via direct impacts of protozoan and metazoan and the top down control protozoan and metazoan prey on heterotrophic bacteria among multi trophic microbiota results and findings reveal the ecological effect on river nitrogen removal in a river confluence under complex hydraulic conditions and provide useful information for river management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords river confluence multi trophic nitrogen dynamics confluence characteristic microbial food web data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction confluence are typical structures of urban river systems and are essential for the connectivity of river systems sukhodolov et al 2017 the merging of the two channels will result in dramatic changes in flow dynamics and produce complex hydraulic characteristics yuan et al 2022 according to the characteristics of the bed morphology and flow patterns at confluences reported by previous researches channel confluences are usually divided into six different hydraulic regions including flow stagnation region fst flow deflection region fd flow separation region fse maximum velocity region mv gradual flow recovery region fr and shear layers region sl best et al 1987 each region has unique flow characteristics such as a near zero velocity magnitude at fst increased turbulence levels at sl and recirculating flow at fse hydrological variations are essential to the functions of the river affecting biogeochemical services such as primary production and nutrient cycling yang et al 2021a therefore revealing the biogeochemical processes under the complex hydraulic conditions of channel confluence is significant for protecting river ecosystem health microorganisms are vital components of the river ecosystem and play a crucial role in ecological function reed et al 2014 louca et al 2016 environmental factors including nutrients temperature and hydrodynamics affect the microbial composition and distribution yuan et al 2021 hydrodynamics is identified as the vital physical force changing river microbial communities battin et al 2016 which drives the changes in the microbial biofilm structure besemer et al 2012 the community assembly and community metabolism processes singer et al 2010 the diverse microbial composition endowed them with various ecological functions e g energy transference organic matter degradation and nutrient absorption stegen et al 2016 recent researches found that the composition and assembly of microorganisms in the channel confluence were significantly different from those in the straight river samson et al 2019 channel confluences influenced the microbial community phylogeny rajput et al 2022 and accelerated the migration of nutrients louca et al 2016 and pollutants li et al 2020c which further changed the function of river systems the results found in the previous studies have made microbial composition community assembly and functional potentials under complex hydraulic characteristics of river confluence a research hot spot however relevant studies mainly focus on the impact of hydrological changes on single trophic microbiota in channel confluence especially bacteria wang et al 2020 neglecting eukaryotic communities the vital components of microbial ecosystems kamp et al 2015 from the ecosystem perspective biological functions are not merely affected by single trophic level but are driven by multi trophic level species schmidt et al 2019 in river ecosystems microbial food webs are mainly formed by a combination of multi trophic microorganisms such as protozoan metazoan algae and bacteria and abiotic factors such as nutrient availability there were interactions among multi trophic microbiota which could result in cascading effects through top down predation and bottom up nutrient supply controls ozen et al 2018 multi trophic microbiota could occur at high densities in sediments and promoted material and energy fluxes via shifting the production of lower trophic levels to higher trophic levels ritz et al 2017 thus biological processes do not usually occur in isolation and are associated with other reactions at the same trophic levels or between the adjacent trophic levels e g reciprocity predation and parasitism altering ecosystem and biogeochemical processes rocha et al 2019 besides the composition of multi trophic microbiota and interactions among multi trophic microbiota could affect the nutrient cycles ardon et al 2021 which could either contribute to the nutrient utilization or accumulation yang et al 2021a therefore it is crucial to assess the impact of nutrient transport and transmission under the interactions among multi trophic microorganisms at the food web level in the urban channel in addition various researches have shown that flow patterns affected the composition of multi trophic species horppila et al 2019 the feeding efficiency and prey selection of predators harkonen et al 2014 and the cascading effects along the microbial food web palmer and ruhi 2019 the strength of top down and bottom up forces changed with flow rate gualtieri et al 2019 leading to hydrologic commonly decoupled predation and resource processes leonard et al 1998 making flow conditions vital in microbial food web dynamics recent laboratory research has demonstrated that the changes of flow velocity significantly affected the microbial composition of multi trophic levels and further affected nitrogen conversion through cascades yang et al 2022b however the composition and distribution of multi trophic microbiota in channel confluence and their response to complex flow conditions in the channel confluence still remain unclear urban channels are nitrogen sinks and hot spots of nitrogen pollution zhang et al 2015 nitrogen in high concentration could accelerate phytoplankton growth increasing oxygen consumption and disrupting aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2019 identifying the process of nitrogen transport and transformation in channel confluences is vital to alleviate nitrogen pollution nitrogen dynamics was deemed to be involved by microorganisms eukaryotes and bacteria are directly involved in the transport and transformation of nitrogen yang et al 2021 besides interactions among multi trophic microbiota also affected nitrogen dynamics via top down forces ozen et al 2018 tso and taghon 2006 channel confluence was identified as the hotspot for nitrogen removal of the river network due to complex hydraulic conditions channel confluence enriched the microbial communities that promote nitrogen removal li et al 2020a hui et al 2022 however relevant studies mainly focus on the impact of single trophic microbial groups on nitrogen dynamics under complex hydraulic conditions especially bacteria neglecting the potential role of multi trophic microbiota kamp et al 2015 wang et al 2020 therefore this study aims to elucidate the response of benthic multi trophic microbiota to complex flow conditions in urban channel confluence areas and the effects of multi trophic microbiota on nitrogen dynamics analysis was performed to 1 identify the composition and distribution of multi trophic microbiota at channel confluence 2 illuminate the interactions among multi trophic microbiota and identify the environmental factors that influenced multi trophic community assembly 3 explore the direct and indirect effects of multi trophic microbiota on nitrogen dynamics under complex hydraulic conditions to achieve the purpose above the composition pattern of the multi trophic microbiota was explored by statistical methods based on next generation 16s and 18s rrna genes co occurrence network analysis was conducted to illustrate the correlations among multi trophic microbiota the multi trophic community assembly was quantitated by the β nearest taxon index βnti based on the community assembly method provided by stegen stegen et al 2016 the path models were set up to visualize the potential role of multi trophic microbiota in nitrogen dynamics the results in this study can help to realize the influence of hydraulic conditions changes at urban channel confluence on the benthic ecosystem and support for urban channel regulation and ecological function protection 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sample collection thirty samples were

worden et al 2015 otus of bacteria and eukaryotes were divided into six functional groups bacteria were divided into heterotrophic bacteria excluding cyanobacteria and autotrophic bacteria cyanobacteria eukaryotes were grouped as protozoans metazoans and algae duncan s new multiple range test dmrt were conducted to identify the variation in flow velocity and material concentrations principal coordinate analysis pcoa and analysis of similarities anosim were applied to investigate the difference in multi trophic microbial community composition between groups stamp v2 1 3 was used to identify the statistically significant differential taxonomic between groups parks et al 2014 co occurrence network analysis based on spearman correlation was conducted and visualized using gephi software to examine associations among multi species barberan et al 2014 otus of bacteria protozoan and metazoan with relative abundances above 2 4 and 3 respectively were selected spearman s correlations with p values 0 01 and r 0 6 were included in the network analyses which guaranteed only strong correlations included within network jones et al 2018 the βnti value calculated based on the phylogenetic null model could identify the main driving force of multi trophic microbiota phylogenetic assembly according to baselga 2010 multiple site dissimilarities containing the sørensen

2013 the potential role of multi trophic microbiota in nitrogen dynamics was explored using path model analysis the path model was set up using amos v 23 spss chicago il usa 3 result and discussion 3 1 composition and distribution of multi trophic microbiota 27 019 bacterial otus including heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria and 3409 eukaryotic otus including various algae protozoans and metazoans were observed autotrophic bacteria were not individually discussed due to heterotrophic bacteria playing dominant roles in the benthic heterotrophic food web faupel et al 2012 and almost all reads of bacteria belonged to heterotrophs table s5 at the phylum level fig 2 the most abundant protozoans were ciliophora 36 5 followed by cercozoa 21 8 and tubulinea 10 6 for the metazoan community the abundant phylum was gastrotricha 33 3 followed by nematoda 19 5 and arthropoda 15 7 the algae community was dominated by bacillariophyta 75 1 streptophyta 15 and chlorophyta 8 9 proteobacteria 42 1 was the most abundant heterotrophic bacterial community followed by chloroflexi 17 5 and acidobacteria 10 8 the dominant community in protozoans such as ciliates and heterotrophic flagellates and metazoans such as arthropods nematodes and rotifers in channel confluence were proved to be the vital components of microbial food web weitere et al 2018 to analyze the influence of hydraulic characteristics on the microbial community pcoa was applied to identify the difference of multi trophic microbiota composition among different hydraulic regions however there was no distinct difference in multi trophic microbiota composition among different regions fig s1 the hydraulic regions were classified according to flow directions riverbed morphology and locations tang et al 2017 however the external factors that directly affected the microbiota such as nutrient concentrations can be similar among various hydraulic regions yuan et al 2022 song et al 2022 therefore to identify the difference of four chemical indices and flow velocity among different hydraulic regions dmrt was conducted table s3 according to the result of dmrt all sampling points were divided into two groups group 1 g1 includes the sampling points in fst fd fse and tu group 2 g2 was formed by the sampling points in mu mv sl and fr to confirm the difference in multi trophic microbiota composition between two groups pcoa analysis was applied fig 3 higher trophic levels protozoan metazoan and algae from these two groups separated well and lower trophic level heterotrophic bacterial showed no apparent difference between two groups anosim was subsequently carried out and further confirmed that protozoan r 0 307 p 0 001 metazoan r 0 589 p 0 001 and algae r 0 307 p 0 002 were significantly different between g1 and g2 however no significant difference in heterotrophic bacteria r 0 129 p 0 053 was found between the two groups furthermore highly differential multi trophic microbiota between the two groups were identified as shown in fig 4 protozoans including ciliophora apicomplexa evosea endomyxa and perkimsozoa and metazoans including nematoda rotifera and arthropoda were enriched in g1 ciliophora was a key species in the microbial food web and strongly associated with other species ciliophora such as ciliates worked as predators of diatoms in the microbial food web loder et al 2011 and indirectly competed with metazoans such as copepods and dinoflagellates aberle et al 2007 sherr and sherr 2007 nematoda and rotifera which fed on bacteria and protozoans were the most widely reported predators in most benthic systems yang et al 2020 besides all algae species found in the study area were enriched in g1 in aquatic systems changes in algae might increase the number and abundance of primary consumers increasing the number of predators and their interactions mor et al 2018 therefore above results showed that the composition and distribution of multi trophic levels including the main components of the microbial food web differed in two regions of the channel confluence which might lead to various interactions among multi trophic microbiota 3 2 interactions among multi trophic microbiota to reveal the interactions of multi trophic microbiota and illuminate potential ecologically significant between taxa a co occurrence network was applied layeghifard et al 2017 the co occurrence network of g1 comprised 125 nodes with 25 protozoan otus 30 metazoan otus 5 algae otus and 65 bacterial otus the co occurrence network of g2 comprised 111 nodes with 12 protozoan otus 20 metazoan otus 5 algae otus and 74 bacterial otus to determine the correlations among multi trophic microorganisms different colored dots were used to indicate protozoan metazoan algae and heterotrophic bacteria various colored links were used to indicate positive and negative relationships between species fig 5 positive correlations in a network would mean that communities have similar preferences are symbiosis or have mutualistic relationships among the taxa that cooperate within the same niche negative correlations may mean that competition or predation between the taxa steele et al 2011 the results showed that the g1 network had more negatively correlated edges 32 9 than the g2 network 14 4 indicating that more microorganisms shared the same ecological niche and performed similar ecological roles in g2 on the contrary microorganisms in g1 might have more significant predation and competition relationships however such competition or predation would occur between the same or different trophic levels thus to point out whether predation and competition occur within the same trophic levels or between different trophic levels edges with different colors were used to represent links between the same trophic level and between different trophic levels fig 5 results illustrated that predation and competition between different trophic levels existed in g1 and g2 these results were consistent with literature which proved that predator prey relationships are the most essential interactions between microorganisms bjorbaekmo et al 2020 in addition more correlations between different trophic levels were found in g1 34 3 than in g2 17 8 illustrating that many edges target from lower to higher trophic levels species vice versa based on these results there were more predation and competition correlations between different trophic levels in g1 that is more top down and bottom up controls of the microbial food web existed in g1 3 3 environmental factors affecting multi trophic microbiota the assembly of microbial communities was considered to be determined by deterministic and stochastic processes which crucially affect the microbial community composition and the interactions among multi trophic microbiota martiny et al 2011 bahram et al 2016 li et al 2020d to identify the assembly of multi trophic microbiota in channel confluence the βnti metric of bacterial and eukaryotic communities were calculated respectively the results showed that eukaryotic communities of urban channel confluence were governed by deterministic processes 52 4 including homogeneous selection 32 9 and variable selection 19 5 bacterial communities were governed by stochastic processes 74 3 including homogenizing dispersal 73 8 and ecological drift 0 5 environmental pressures consistent within each group would dominated the dispersal process which governed microbial community assembly dini andreote et al 2015 the significant difference in environmental various such as hydraulic conditions and concentration of chemical indicators including different forms of nitrogen between two groups made the variable selection process dominant and finally formed the different formation of multi trophic microbiota in channel confluence the proportion of deterministic processes increasing from low trophic levels to high trophic levels indicated the response of higher trophic levels to environmental factors was intensively higher than that of lower trophic microbiota in the channel confluence these results were consistent with the distribution patterns of multi trophic microbiota by pcoa fig 3 explaining that the environmental various between groups led to significant dissimilar in higher trophic microbiota to have deeper investigations in the potential role of the environmental factors including hydraulic characteristics and nutrition concentration in regulating the multi trophic microbiota community assembly in channel confluences the βnti metric was measured as shown in fig 6 flow velocity was significantly correlated with the βnti of bacterial and eukaryotic communities p 0 05 these results indicated assembly of the microbial community assembly shifted from matched with stochastic processes βnti 2 to matched with flow velocity βnti 2 that is driven by flow velocity tn nh4 no3 and no2 were significantly correlated with the βnti of bacterial and eukaryotic communities p 0 05 which probably due to multi trophic microbiota would directly or indirectly participate in material cycles kamp et al 2015 it has long been assumed that microorganisms mediate the nitrogen cycle in riverine ecosystems gao et al 2021 and the potential role of hydrological characteristics on nitrogen dynamics have been systematically reported zhang et al 2020b the significant role of flow velocity to microbial ecological processes was investigated in our study these results indicated that the multi trophic microbiota changed in response to hydrological conditions represented by flow dynamics and significantly affected nitrogen dynamics the different ecological processes determining the community assembly was essential for forming the mutualistic and antagonistic co occurrence patterns freilich et al 2018 results of microbial ecological processes and co occurrence network in this study showed that slower flow velocity in fse fd and fst promoted more interactions among multi trophic species in g1 these results were consistent with recent studies huber et al 2020 which confirmed that due to higher niche segregation under the higher environmental heterogeneity a large number of highly related taxa were found besides biotic interactions such as predation and competition affected nitrogen dynamics via cascading effects therefore this study suggested that the higher trophic microbiota shaped by deterministic processes i e flow velocity might affect the nitrogen transformation in urban channel confluence 3 4 the potential role of multi trophic microbiota in nitrogen dynamics nitrogen dynamics in sediment were proved to be affected by multi trophic microbiota along microbial food web nguyen et al 2020 to investigate the potential role of the multi trophic microbiota along microbial food web in nitrogen dynamics of urban channel confluence a path model was conducted to investigate the correlation between different multi trophic levels and their effects on nitrogen dynamics the interactions among multi trophic levels were considered in our model such as the protozoa prey on heterotrophic bacteria and algae metazoan prey on protozoa heterotrophic bacteria and algae yang et al 2021b the hydraulic condition could directly affect the microbial communities including heterotrophic bacteria protozoan metazoan and algae which belong to different trophic levels eukaryotes have been reported to involved in nitrogen transformation in direct such as assimilation and indirect such as predation and excretion processes yang et al 2021b protozoans with high excretion rates produced large quantities of nh4 and large quantities of nh4 were excreted by metazoans when nutrients were over their growth demands heterotrophic bacteria are the direct and critical driver of nitrogen transformations in river sediments bacteria were mainly involved in processes of anammox and denitrification li et al 2020b liang et al 2022 besides heterotrophic bacteria such as chloroflexi nitrospinae and nitrospirae consumed nh4 via phototrophic nitrite oxidation and complete ammonia oxidation and then came into no3 kuypers et al 2018 these correlations were all considered in the path model and exhibited a proper fit with χ2 df 1 036 the value in the range of 1 3 is acceptable and ifi 0 944 0 9 zhang et al 2020a as shown in fig 7 negative correlations were found between protozoan and heterotrophic bacteria r 0 26 protozoan and algae r 0 33 metazoan and heterotrophic bacteria r 0 48 metazoan and algae r 0 24 the results of path models suggested that the multi trophic microorganisms in channel confluence did not exist in isolation and illustrated that top down predation forces were the main forces in controlling the microbial food web domingues et al 2017 which proved that predator prey are the most essential interactions among microorganisms bjorbaekmo et al 2020 the model showed that flow velocity had positive correlations with protozoan r 0 30 algae r 0 33 and heterotrophic bacteria r 0 06 and had negative correlations with metazoan r 0 27 these results indicated that flow velocity benefited the protozoan and heterotrophic bacteria and inhibited the abundance of metazoan in channel confluence high flow velocity contributed to the increase in nutrient and suspended solids concentrations which could accelerate the growth and development of tiny microorganisms such as protozoan and heterotrophic bacteria yang et al 2022b besides it was interesting to find that flow velocity promoted the algae abundance in channel confluence this result can be attributed to the enrichment of bacillariophyta and chlorophyta in channel confluence fig 2 bacillariophyta and chlorophyta could not move on their own making them better adapt to turbulent conditions where high flow velocity accelerate availability of nutrients zhou et al 2016 yang et al 2022a besides most bacillariophyta genera were coupled with their silica shell and had relatively large sizes making bacillariophyta more adapted to high flow velocity tréguer et al 2017 all above results suggested that hydraulic conditions might control the composition of multi trophic microbiota as well as the interactions among trophic levels to alter the patterns of the microbial food web furthermore the direct and cascading effects through multi trophic levels on nitrogen conversion were observed in regions with lower flow velocity nitrate and nitrite reduction processes were promoted via direct effect by species of different trophic levels and indirect effect by predation among multi trophic levels the reduced flow velocity enriched metazoan which was directly conducive to reducing no2 to nh4 lower flow velocity decreased the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria and protozoan which directly promoted the anammox of no2 and no3 protozoans such as flagellates and algae such as diatoms and chlorophytes reduced no3 to no2 via nitrate reduction reactions comeau et al 2019 besides metazoans and protozoans indirectly promoted the production of no3 and no2 via top down control of heterotrophic bacteria by predation the aerobic nitrification communities adapted well to the low oxygen conditions and carry out the ammoxidation of no3 and no2 kuypers et al 2018 in addition eukaryotes including protozoan such as ciliates dinoflagellate metazoan such as foraminifers and algae such as diatoms were able to store no3 intracellularly and use it for dissimilatory no3 reduction and eukaryotes might rival prokaryotes in terms of dissimilatory no3 reduction kamp et al 2015 the predation of bacteria by higher trophic levels inhibited the absorption of no2 and no3 by bacteria in channel confluence thus the no2 and no3 reduction reactions by higher trophic levels might be the main process of nitrate removal all the above results suggested that in regions with lower velocity such as fse fst and fd there were intense no2 and no3 reduction and anammox reactions via direct impacts of multi trophic microbiota and the top down control predation among multi trophic microbiota 4 conclusion in summary this study found apparent predator prey relationships exhibiting in channel confluence the velocity at the confluence was the main driver shaping the composition and distribution of multi trophic microbiota the response of higher trophic levels to flow velocity was strongly higher than that of lower trophic levels resulting in significant differences in the composition of the higher trophic level microbiota between different river confluence regions flow velocity critically affected nitrogen dynamics in the microbial food web by regulating the composition of microbial food web in regions with lower flow velocity interactions among multi trophic levels were more complex intense nitrate and nitrite reduction and anammox reactions occurred in region with lower flow velocity via direct impacts of multi trophic microbiota and the top down control predation among multi trophic microbiota we suggested that complex flow conditions significantly impact higher trophic microbiota by controlling the bottom up forces in channel confluence and in turn affect the nitrogen cycle via top down forces consequently paying attention to high trophic microorganisms and identifying responses of microbial food webs to environmental factors in urban channel with complex flow conditions is a crucial measure of urban channel management this study comprehensively described the influence of hydraulic conditions changes at urban channel confluence on the benthic ecosystem and proposed the potential ecological risks offering a guidance for urban channel
