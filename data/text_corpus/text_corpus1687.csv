8435,study region the volcano tectonic lakes basin of abaya chamo is part of the main ethiopian rift system and exhibits large variations in geomorphology physiography and climate between the rift floor and the plateau study focus despite the importance of streamflow for water resources management and planning in the basin many of the rivers there are ungauged to make quantitative estimates of streamflow for spatially resolved water availability in such a highly heterogeneous environment therefore requires numerical modeling this study is the first to quantify the surface and shallow groundwater resources in abaya chamo and to validate the physically fully distributed hydrologic model wetspass under highly data limited conditions in a complex two lake environment new hydrological insights simulated total river flow and estimated baseflow were verified at 15 gauging stations with a good agreement the wetspass model is shown to be suitable for such a complex setting with a correlation coefficient of 0 95 and 0 97 for total flow and baseflow respectively at a statistically significant level p value 0 05 the simulated annual water budget reveals that 74 6 of the 22 1 billion lit yr in total precipitation in the basin is lost through evapotranspiration 15 7 through surface runoff and only 9 7 recharges the groundwater system the simulations also revealed the surface runoff and groundwater recharge are the most sensitive to soil textural class while evapotranspiration depends more strongly on land use keywords surface water groundwater water balance wetspass abaya chamo lake basin 1 introduction the complex geological processes of the intra rift faulting and associated volcanic activities led to the formation of volcano tectonic structural depressions which became born sites and creation of several largest lakes in east africa as well as large parts of its topography le turdu et al 1999 https psugeo org africa african 20unep 20atlas africa atlas english chapter 1 pdf it forms a unique rift system including the main ethiopian rift mer which make up various lake basins in the region where the southern section of the mer occupies lakes such as awassa abaya chamo and chew bahir the present study area abaya chamo lakes basin as a part is thought to be hydrologically separate units but due to the subsurface interconnection of ne sw aligned regional faults and exhibits large variations in geomorphology physiography and climate between the rift floor across the escarpment and the plateau alemayehu et al 2005 understanding surface and groundwater systems over such a complex rift margin zone are difficult and a key issue for the sustainable management planning and development in rapidly developing countries such as ethiopia which experiences frequent water scarcity associated with its arid semi arid climate molla and tegaye 2019 halcrow 2008 jica 2012 the key challenges in the lakes basin stem from inadequate development of water resources to support the region s rapid population growth including poor sanitation and water delivery underdeveloped management and deployment of irrigation for agriculture and food production bekele 2001 the results of these challenges include poor health of the region s population flooding of river areas and loss of infrastructure and damage in general it has been recognized that there is a severe lack of coordinated research efforts to address the water resources problems in the acl basin despite the importance of streamflow for water resources management and planning in the basin many of the rivers are ungauged only a few previous studies have assessed the hydrology and hydrogeology of the region with the main objective of quantity and quality assessment of surface water and groundwater separately often using empirical and simple modeling approaches molla and tegaye 2019 bekele 2001 halcrow 2008 jica 2012 and others lake systems play an important role in surface water groundwater interaction and are especially important for the use and demand of unsustainable water resources indeed the groundwater contribution as a baseflow component is a highly desirable entity to know about water management in general as the part of total discharge that originates from delayed storages in a river catchment this parameter can also be used possibly to calibrate and validate hydrological models as well arnold et al 2000 stewart et al 2007 batelaan and de smedt 2007 combalicer et al 2008 eckhardt 2008 risser et al 2009 quantification and visualization of spatial and temporal relations of hydrological processes occurrence and pattern across the basin are difficult to figure out because of their high dynamic and continuous or discontinuous characteristics indeed selection of the appropriate input parameter and physical boundary conditions based on defining variables are far important for model creation on which there can be a variation in the results soczyńska 1989 ponce shetty 1995 fiedler ramirez 2000 batelaan de smedt 2001 dąbrowski et al 2011 methods for determining groundwater recharge are in particular of fundamental importance since groundwater resources are typically limited and their computational difficulties have been intensively discussed in previous works as either point based or lumped areal approaches simmers 1988 lerner et al 1990 de vries and simmers 2002 scanlon et al 2002 the point estimates were used as a base of extrapolation or rationalization over a large area however the outputs are not such evident as described in most studies suggest the physically distributed approaches are a more viable method to improve spatial estimates batelaan and de smedt 2007 sophocleous 1992 and jochen 2002 to make quantitative estimates of surface and shallow groundwater resource in a highly heterogeneous environment like the acl basin therefore requires numerical modeling physically based numerical hydrologic modeling has become the gold standard in modern water science for evaluation of water resources at the basin scale however the most available physically distributed models require high temporal resolution data such as swat arnold et al 2000 dream manfreda et al 2005 wetspa wang et al 1996 hbv losjo et al 1999 and svat armbruster and leibundgut 2001 these models are continuous data intensive and use more complex water balance calculations that questioning the applicability in developing countries like ethiopia where data availability at hourly or daily time scales is typically unavailable in spite of that there is a strong demand for a hydrologic model that can able to estimate the spatially varying water balance components over long term averages inordinately the water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere under quasi steady state condition wetspass model can be run using a seasonal or annual time step which dramatically reduces the requirements for input data batelaan and de smedt 2001 and 2007 xu and singh 1998 even so wetspass model was calibrated for temperate conditions in belgium al kuisi et al 2013 and needs parameter modifications as it has not been calibrated or validated in a complex surface groundwater zone such as the acl basin in the tropical setting this study is the first to quantify the surface shallow groundwater resources in the complex two lake environment of the abaya chamo basin we have deployed the physically distributed hydrologic model wetspass under highly data limited conditions which constitutes a stringent test for the simulation of spatially varying surface and shallow groundwater resources we were therefore assessed the applicability of the wetspass model to understand the spatial hydrologic pattern and the physical drivers of the annual water budget in this complex rift margin zone the results will help to build scientific and technical capacity developing nations and to generate increased connections between the scientific and policy communities in the next section 2 we describe the study region in more detail and the wetspass model configuration in section 3 we present the modeling results and section 4 contains the main conclusions and discussion 2 data and methodology 2 1 description of the study area and hydro climate the main ethiopian rift mer as part of the great east african rift system is seismically and volcanically active and virtually the only places worldwide where the transition from continental to oceanic rifting is exposed on land keir et al 2006 the abaya chamo lakes acl basin is located in southern ethiopia in the central section of the main ethiopian rift mer it is bounded by the limits from utm 307113 m to 468468 m and 598747 m to 897222 m easting and northing respectively molla and tegaye 2019 fig 1 the region s altitude varies between 3 430 m and 1 107 m above sea level and the lake basin covers an area of about 18 900 km2 topographically the basin is a fault bounded valley with a wide flat valley bottom bounded by volcanic mountains and hills that define the border of the lake s basin the rift margins are not clearly defined everywhere and the highest elevations of the surface of flanking plateaux are up to 3 430 m in the west chencha towards fonko and butajira highlands and 2 500 m in the east hagere mariam towards hagere selam where large upthrust mountains descend steeply toward the lakes molla and tegaye 2019 the climate of the area can be classified as semi humid to semi arid subtropical climate with an average annual temperature around 20 c in the rift floor with slightly lower values in the adjacent highlands and the average annual temperature is 13 c to 24 2 c with a very weak seasonal cycle mean annual rainfall varies from 951 mm to 1 653 mm in the river basins depending on local topography and position as shown in fig 2 the seasonal cycle of rainfall is strongly bimodal with two distinct wet seasons controlled by the seasonal migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz from march to june locally known as belg and from july to october locally known as kiremt molla and tegaye 2019 otterbach 1995 legesse et al 2003 the dry season locally known as bega runs from november to february in this study we therefore focus on the average hydro climate over these three seasons four month each these are denoted by the letters of the months they contain as mamj and jaso the wet seasons and ndjf the dry season molla and tegaye 2019 the main features of the drainage basin are two low lying lakes abaya 1 110 k m 2 to the north and chamo 316 k m 2 located in the center of the rift floor with inflow from the rivers of the basin the river network can be used to classify a series of sub river basins on the basis of the lake distribution and topography we are focusing here on six major rivers and their tributaries flow into abaya and chamo lakes fig 1 these sub basins are in geographical order by basin size billate 1 5 659 km2 hamessa guracha 2 1 007 km2 gidabo 3 4 199 km2 kulfo gina 4 1 369 km2 gelana 5 3 866 km2 and sife chamo 6 1 379 km2 molla tegaye 2019 jica 2012 halcrow et al 2008 the geology of the basin as shown in fig 3 is highly complicated and extremely faulted as described many previous studies molla tegaye 2019 kazmin et al 1980 halcrow 2008 woldegebriel et al 1990 jica 2012 the southern part of the study area is covered by high and low grade metamorphic rocks of the mozambican belt the pre rift tertiary volcanic succession consisting of basaltic and silicic lava plateaus covers the escarpment on both sides of the rift molla tegaye 2019 with the formation of the wonji fault belt because of tectonic movements and volcanic activity the rhyolite trachyte lava flows pumice pyroclastic unwelded tuffs ignimbrites obsidians and pitchstones are being distributed throughout the entire study area chiefly in the rift floor to the north and around the like abaya the dominant parts of the rift floor in particular the surroundings of abaya lake are covered by pleistocene holocene volcano sedimentary as one goes from the north through the rift to the south of lake chamo the age of the rock generally gets older molla tegaye 2019 as a general approach the estimation procedure for a given hydrological process involves an assessment of the distribution of the geophysical characteristics of the basin areas fig 4 shows the flow chart of the particular steps in this study on which the wetspass model links from the raw data through processing and encoding of spatiotemporal information to modeling and finally to a water balance simulation this study was employed to estimate the water balance components such as actual evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater recharge which are calibrated to historical gauged river flow and estimated baseflow data 2 2 wetspass model wetspass is a spatially distributed quasi steady state water balance numerical model to simulate and predict long term average hydrological processes at seasonal and annual basin scale batelaan and de smedt 2001 2007 this seasonal graphical user version of the model has the ability to simulate evapotranspiration interception runoff soil water balance and recharge batelaan and de smedt 2007 the wetspass model has been widely shown to be suitable for explaining the impact of changes in land use and soil texture on water balance over long periods of time in mid latitudes batelaan et al 2003 wang et al 2012 and more recently in a tropical setting over the ethiopian geba basin gebreyohannes et al 2013 by default in a humid climate setting the wetspass model calculates water balances for winter wet and summer dry over 6 month seasonal averages previous studies carried out by gebreyohannes et al 2013 abu saleem et al 2010 wang et al 2011 highlighted the importance of the clear separation of hydrological seasons length and type across different climatic regions we therefore applied the model in this study for three seasons four month each as defined above which is appropriate because the necessary input data are available with a relatively high temporal resolution the model performs the water balance computation at a raster cell level as given in eqs 1 3 the total water balance is thus calculated as the summation of each raster cell s water balance for independent vegetated bare soil open water and an impervious fraction s of a raster cell as described in batelaan and de smedt 2007 1 e t r a s t e r

total evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater recharge of a raster cell respectively each having a vegetated bare soil open water and impervious area component denoted by a v a s a o and a i respectively to separate the precipitation into surface runoff evapotranspiration an interception and groundwater recharge the model uses digital data in the seasonal version of the wetspass graphical user interface manual batelaan and de smedt 2007 the detailed methodology is provided the water balance of a basin as given in eq 4 is therefore depends on the average annual seasonal precipitation p interception fraction i surface runoff s actual transpiration aet and groundwater recharge r all with the unit of length per time lt 1 which are estimated from the vegetation type soil type slope groundwater depth and climatic variables such as precipitation potential evapotranspiration temperature and wind speed 4 p a e t s i r in order to validate the total flow simulation from the wetspass model which comprises both surface runoff and groundwater recharge observational flow data from 15 gauging stations were collected from the hydrology section of the ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie ethiopia besides the base flow estimates and results of the various previous regional and fragmented study were used here as a supplementary confirmation approach to the total flow calibration as it is supported by many previous studies such as arnold et al 2000 stewart et al 2007 batelaan and de smedt 2007 combalicer et al 2008 eckhardt 2008 risser et al 2009 which were examined under long term mean conditions where the contributions of groundwater as a baseflow flux thus the groundwater discharge can be used as a proxy way to compare the basin mean groundwater recharge here the basic assumptions are relayed on the equivalency of baseflow and the groundwater discharge of a basin and that implies the groundwater discharge to rivers is approximately equal to recharge piggott et al 2005 risser et al 2005 so that the gauged river flow records were partitioned into the surface and baseflow components using the time plot baseflow separation program time plot gabriel periodic filter algorithm equation 5 this method is based on a recursive filter commonly used in signal analysis as discussed in nathan and mcmahon 1990 and lyne and hollick 1979 molla tegaye 2019 the formulation of the filter is given by 5 f k α f k 1 1 α 2 y k y k 1 where f k is the filtered fast response at the k t h sampling time y k is the total flow and α is a filter parameter lastly the filtered baseflow is given by y k f k the observed daily total flow and baseflow component were then averaged over each season and compared to the model simulation output that estimates seasonal mean flow and groundwater recharge of the area the location and record period of the stations are shown in fig 1 and supplementary 3 2 3 input data for wetspass the model requires two types of input data i e geo spatially referenced grid maps and parameter tables batelaan and de smedt 2007 the grid maps with a cell size of 500 500 m 2 consist of slope angle land use soil texture groundwater depth and seasonal annual meteorological maps of precipitation potential evapotranspiration temperature and wind speed digital elevation model dem nasa jpl 2013 of the study area is used with a cell size of 30 m the dem is processed to prepare a topographic elevation map a slope angle map fig 5 a and river network of the abaya chamo lakes basin fig 1 and shows that slope angles range from 0 to 27 with a mean of 3 6 the south western part and eastern highlands have the highest degree of slope the land use map of the basin was derived from cloud free land sat etm satellite images of february path 168 rows 55 and 56 and november january path 169 rows 54 55 and 56 2000 nasa jpl 2013 using the standard envi supervised image classification the land use map fig 5b of the basin agriculture 43 6 wood bush land 28 1 forest 7 6 grass 10 7 swamp marsh 2 4 and open water 7 4 were identified in seven land use classes a soil map of the lakes basin of abaya chamo was extracted from the harmonized fao database fao 1998 using the topsoil percentages of particle size fractions soil type classes were translated into usgs soil texture classes in order to make the data compatible with a model requirement the textural map of the converted soil in fig 5c shows the texture of the soil classes i e clay 29 5 clay loam 15 8 sandy clay 6 7 sandy clay loam 35 7 and sandy loam 12 2 of the abaya chamo lake basin piezometric map obtained from the groundwater depth in relative to the surface elevation which is used to include the seepage fluxes in the model s calculations of the water balance therefore the study area s groundwater depth was deduced from the spatially available wells lakes level and spring points fig 5d shows the potentiometric surface elevation contour of groundwater above means sea level the meteorological conditions of a given wide and independent area are known to affect the formation of water resources so that the annual and seasonal meteorological parameters such as precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and wind speed were prepared from the available meteorological stations in order to grasp the hydro meteorological characteristics of the abaya chamo lakes basin along with other sets of data to analyze water balance of the basin fig 6 and supplementary 1 the available 46 meteorological stations as indicated in fig 1 were checked for reliability through data quality and consistency among each other and against the climatological history as well within the abaya chamo basin meteorological data are available for the period from the early 1980s for some stations though the range varies from station to station all available 46 stations have daily precipitation recordings but 23 stations have only been recorded temperature and only 10 stations for wind speed the spatial maps and the information on meteorological parameters within the study area are shown in the supplementary material 1 the parameters for land use soil type and runoff must be specified in four lookup tables required to run the wetspass model the attribute tables involve parameters related to the land use type and soil type the former land use table contains parameters such as rooting depth leaf area index and vegetation height batelaan and de smedt 2007 and which were calibrated for temperate conditions in belgium al kuisi et al 2013 indeed the application of this model as described in abu saleem et al 2010 al kuisi et al 2013 requires parameters modifications of in the lookup tables for other regions that are characterized by different climatological regions such as semi arid arid areas for instance in ethiopian condition gebreyohannes et al 2013 made some parameter adjustments to leaf area index root depth and bareness for geba basin accordingly in this study the relative differences between geba basin and the environmental setup of abaya chamo lakes basin are taken into account through professional suggestion and selected field observations therefore the modifications of seasonal land use lookup table parameters include a decrease in values of leaf area index b a substantial decrease in the depth of the root since as described in detail by jochen et al 2002 pierret alain et al 2016 the depth of rooting in humid to arid environments is likely to be shallower as water tends to be available throughout the growing season in the upper soil horizons the deeper roots in the arid area are potentially less important and so rooting depths are not strongly linked to potential evapotranspiration pet because water infiltration depths will be more limited than evaporative requirements and c 20 increase of the bareness of all land cover s proportions from each land use class 3 numerical simulation of the steady state hydro climate of the abaya chamo lakes basin 3 1 model validation the results of the wetspass model simulation were verified against observations of river flow at 15 river gauge stations of sub basins in the abaya chamo lake s basin fig 1 river measurements account for direct runoff flow surface runoff and baseflow sub surface flow that recharge the groundwater reservoir model simulation results for mean total flows were compared to mean annual flows at 15 gauging stations of the sub basins and also the simulated groundwater recharge are compared against estimated baseflow as given in fig 7 a b the estimated results of baseflow yield deduced from daily river flows time series for sub basins of 15 river gauging station within abaya chamo basin using the time plot technique for baseflow separation nathan and mcmahon 1990a is given in the supplementary 2 this was used only for validation of groundwater recharge simulated by the spatially distributed wetspass model in the analyses period the observed average annual total river flows are between 0 32 m 3 s and 17 59 m 3 s for the 15 river gauging station while the estimated average annual baseflow is between 0 13 m 3 s and 9 25 m 3 s next we compare the observed total discharge versus simulated at measuring stations and additionally the estimated baseflow versus simulated groundwater recharge respectively in the study area the scatter plots in fig 7 a b show a good agreement at 95 confidence level with a correlation coefficient of 0 95 and 0 97 respectively with the standard error of 0 12 and 0 20 these figures reflect a degree of accuracy in the application of the wetspass model in the study area which shows a strong correlation between the simulated and the observed ground truth or estimated values the tendencies of high and low peak values at the stations are quite well simulated the simulated streamflow values are generally underestimated in particular for most of the gauging stations with the exception of small overestimations at billate and hamessa guracha just north of lake abaya gauging station of bilate tena and hamessa humbo the underestimated values are mainly observed in the upper stream portions of the abaya chamo lakes basin gauging station of weira kulfo sala and u gelana see locations on supplementary 3 the areas of these stations are also associated with the major geological structures and fissured aquifers that can promote deep groundwater flow the small discrepancies are shown in fig 7 a b this can also be caused by the natural variability of hydrological processes the complex physical characteristics of the lakes basin and the uncertainty induced by the parameterization and a representation of the realistic models in addition the river flow record and the estimation of baseflow can also be a cause of error since it is never completely free of errors 3 2 simulated hydrologic components we begin by describing the mean simulated hydrologic cycle averaged over the entire basin and the associated antecedent hydrological processes precipitation rate actual evapotranspiration and surface runoff these parameter values are then combined in the water balance equation table 5 to estimate the rate of groundwater recharge and distribution fig 8 summarizes the seasonal and annual variability of each parameter the bars indicate the 25 t h q 25 50 t h q 50 and 75 t h q 75 percentiles of each distribution while the whiskers represent the extreme minimum and the maximum values the spatial distribution of the long term annual components of the simulated water balance is given in fig 9 3 2 1 actual evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration is given as a summation of evaporation from bare soil and open water bodies vegetation transpiration and evaporation of precipitation intercepted by the vegetation batelaan and de smedt 2001 the model result in fig 9 a shows that the central axis from the northeast toward the south west including lakes of abaya and chamo have high average actual evapotranspiration while the northern eastern southeastern edges of the basin have a lower value the high values are shown in table 1 which are mainly due to the availability of relatively excess precipitation surface water and the favorable combination of land use soil type from this table 1 the highest values of evapotranspiration are found in the open water forest or grassland land use classes with sandy clay loam and sandy loam soil combinations obviously forests are known for their relatively high evapotranspiration and the coarser textures of the soil that can hold more soil water while agricultural land swamp marsh along with sandy clay clay or clay loam soils have the lowest values besides the average and standard deviation values in table 1 can be used to identify the dominating factor between land cover and soil texture it implies the factor with a lower standard deviation value could have affected more than the factor with a higher value accordingly the land cover class can amplify evapotranspiration more than the soil textural type s in abaya chamo lake basin the annual value of evapotranspiration varies between 541 9 and 1307 3 m m y r with a mean of 873 26 m m y r whereas the seasonal values show significant temporal differences in the basins as given in fig 7 during the wet season kiremt and belg about 29 5 and 32 5 of the evapotranspiration takes place while the remaining 12 5 occurs during the dry season bega the seasonal variation is caused by uneven seasonal distribution of precipitation and changes in vegetation cover during the dry period for example during the dry period the energy required for evaporation is not the limiting factor but the availability of water this explains why the actual rate of evaporation is lower in wet seasons than the dry season 3 2 2 surface runoff and interception high spatial surface runoff found in the east and west of lake abaya and chamo than those in the north and south of lake abaya and chamo fig 9 b the spatial and temporal variation of the surface runoff generation can be explained primarily by the distribution of precipitation rate the combination of land cover soil texture over the physiographical arrangement as given in table 2 the largest surface runoff occurs on clay soil combinations with land use types such as agricultural land swamp marsh or wood bush land in contrast the lowest values are happening to sandy loam and sandy clay loam soils with grassland and forest the smaller standard deviation values of the runoff for different types of soil in table 2 indicate that surface runoff is more influenced by the texture of soil than land use types the mean temporal variation of surface runoff values is shown in fig 8 and supplement 2 b the annual surface runoff ranges from 1 to 637 8 m m y r with an average of 183 4 m y r during the wet season kiremt and belg about 6 8 and 7 4 of the surface runoff occur respectively while the remaining 1 6 occurs during the dry season bega there is a small seasonal variation in the surface runoff as compared to actual evapotranspiration throughout the year even though due to the significant changes in vegetated surfaces in a wet season the interception is given as a fraction of precipitation value which depends on the type and distribution of vegetation de jong and jetten 2007 roberts 1983 calder 1979 nonhebel 1987 total annual interception in the basin ranges from 0 to 14 2 m y r with an average value of 3 09 m m y r seasonal interception ranges from 0 to 6 12 0 to 1 28 and 0 to 6 24 respectively for kiremt bega and belg fig 7 in the north of lake abaya the relatively highest interceptions occur supplementary c 3 2 3 groundwater recharge the estimation of groundwater recharge is regarded as a highly challenging parameter in hydrogeology although the simulation results using spatially distributed multivariate gives the eastern highland and northern part of the basin generally have a higher groundwater recharge than those in the central basin floor and the western part of the basin this is likely due to a combination of favorable conditions such as high precipitation permeable soils gentle topography and land use cover in fig 9 d as indicated in table 3 the average annual groundwater recharge values for different combinations of land use soil classes reveal that the largest groundwater recharge is observed in soil textural classes of sandy loam and sandy clay loam along with agricultural and forest land use type this is basically because of the high permeability of these soils but it could also be partly due to lower evaporation rates and less runoff on the relatively gentle slopes of agricultural land on the other hand grassland and wood bush land yield less groundwater recharge on any type of soil due to their high potential of transpiration and interception processes especially the clay textural types this is evidently linked to a high transpiration rate particularly in the case of wood bush land which was confirmed by the research conducted by venkatraman and ashwath 2016 sophocleous 2000 batelaan 2006 as well as okoński and miller 2006 as indicated in table 3 the highest spatial variation of recharge is found by the soil textural classes which have a smaller standard deviation than land use type as a result this signifies that the recharge increases distinctly with coarse soil texture regardless of the land cover classes the annual groundwater recharge in the lake basin of the abaya chamo ranges from 0 to 540 8 m y r with an average value of 113 74 m m y r figs 8 and 9 d in regard to seasonal variation about 4 97 and 5 1 of the recharge occurs during the rainy seasons kiremt and belg respectively but here negative recharge values are observed during the dry season bega by indicating no recharge rather it signifies the groundwater contributions to surface water as discharge that is in the range between 0 to 63 6 m m y r vegetation covers therefore can maintain a higher et through groundwater osmosis in these areas besides the spatial surface runoff map in fig 9 shows that the eastern and western parts of lake abaya and chamo have a large potential surface water resource compared to the northern and southern parts of lake abaya and chamo in particular the western part of the lake as described by molla and tegaye 2019 here are also characterized by a high degree of slope and highly subjected to episodes of flash flooding that plays a major role in the transport of sediments in the lakes while the bilate river basin was generally identified as the recharge zone in the basin with their highly productive intercalated volcano sedimentary aquifers especially the eastern plateaus and north of lake abaya 3 3 surface water balance 3 3 1 surface water balances of major sub river basins as given in table 4 the magnitude of the largest annual inflow source to the lake basin occurs in gidabo about 1257 7 m m y r and gelana 1191 2 m m y r sub river basin located in the east of the lakes due to the high rate of the mean annual rainfall while the chamo sife sub river basin to south and west of lake chamo exhibit the smallest magnitude of annual rainfall consequently due to the distribution of the annual rainfall and land coverage particularly the grassland creates the highest total evapotranspiration as an outflow which is estimated 928 2 m m y r and 882 3 m m y r respectively for gidabo and billate sub river basins in contrast the kulfo gina sub river basin has a relatively lowest evaporation loss the slope steepness of kulfo gina and hamessa guracha sub basin unlike others are yield the highest annual surface runoff about 334 5 m m y r and 319 6 m m y r respectively while billate river basin has 89 8 m m y r which may be associated with the soil textural classes the water balances of sub river basins show that the groundwater recharge is largely dominated by the rate and spatial distribution of rainfall and soil textural properties indeed the distributions of relatively high permeable quaternary volcano sedimentary aquifers units in the bilate and gidabo river basin have recharged the groundwater about 157 5 m m y r and 144 9 m m y r respectively while the estimated annual recharge yield were small in the west sides of both lakes abaya and chamo where the sloppy sub rivers basins such as hamessa guracha kulfo gina and chamo sife yields only 68 5 m y r 78 8 m m y r and 67 4 m m y r respectively therefore the difference in the water balances of each sub river basins can be explained by the rate and distribution of rainfall geomorphometric physiographical characteristics land use soil elevation slope area as given by molla and tegaye 2019 and the associated response of the hydro climatic parameters 3 3 2 the total surface water balances of abaya chamo lakes basin the overall water balance of the abaya chamo lakes basin is given in table 5 the simulation of the wetspass model is presented using long term average annual condition the water balance structure is dominated by evapotranspiration which constituted 74 6 of the precipitation and is the largest water balance component in the abaya chamo lake basin about 15 7 of the annual precipitation in the abaya chamo basin accounts for the surface runoff value only a small fraction of the annual precipitation remains to be intercepted 0 3 and the rest part is groundwater recharge this makes up only 9 7 of the total annual precipitation in the lake basin these results confirmed by previous studies for example in the north of the study area in the central ethiopian rift valley by zenaw 2003 estimated that approximately 5 of the rainfall in the awassa basin was recharged as stated by wabco 1990 in the master plan of the rvlb for water resources development in ethiopia computed the recharge of more than 5 of rainfall recharge calculated from the values of average base flow shows the possibility of recharge variability in dila sheet as part of the abaya chamo lakes basin in which thomas et al 2015 estimated between 7 and 20 of the precipitation additionally the southern nation nationalist people representative snnpr water resource development bureau report on a hydrogeological mapping of gidabo basin yirgalem kilissa topo sheets estimated evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge of 806 mm yr and 135 m m y r 10 of precipitation respectively shiferaw abebe 2004 halcrow 2008 were also quantified the surface runoff from the total annual average river flow into the lake systems about 3 018 million cubic meters the small error in the water balance is about a 0 3 deficit due to the assumption that water bodies can unlimitedly evaporate at pet rate 4 conclusions and recommendation the physically distributed hydrological model wetspass was used to simulate the hydrology and water balance of the abaya chamo lakes basin in the main rift valley of southern ethiopian the model uses detailed basin characteristics and considers the effects of highly variable topography soil type and land use cover on the lake basin hydrologic characteristics comparisons of observed and simulated river flow at sub basins show the model results correspond reasonably and realistically and there was also a good agreement between the simulated recharge and the estimated baseflow at 15 gauging stations in the basin in general the model has a great potential to determine the influence on hydrological behavior of changes in land use or soil type accordingly in the case of spatial digital data limitations parameterization and regionalization of an input map needs great care and employing appropriate techniques to estimation and interpolation each of the input variables thus the wetspass model is also verified in this study for its applicability in semi arid arid with highly variable physical characteristic over complex rift margin that involves lakes system for the evaluation of the long term regional water resources the model can therefore be applied to other similar basins in particular in developing regions with limited time series and spatial data at high resolution indeed the calibrations of the simulated water balance components using parameters in the lookup tables of the land use and soil type are better adjusted using either predetermined values for a particular environment i e humid semi humid semi arid arid or needs field measurements along with professionals suggestion the total flow from the wetspass model is given by the summation of surface runoff and groundwater recharge the mean ratio of groundwater recharge to the total flow groundwater recharge total flow is about 0 38 this means the groundwater recharge is about 38 3 of the total flow which is nearly comparable to the baseflow index bfi in comparison the bfi is estimated at an average of about 0 42 across the entire basin using baseflow separation techniques as estimated by molla and tegaye 2019 this confirms the importance of both techniques to estimate the water resources available in the study area i e baseflow separation and modeling approach the water resource potential or availability summary is given in table 5 from model output shows the lake basin as a whole has a total of 22 1 billion lit yr rainfall with a mean value of 1169 5 mm year about 16 5 billion lit yr of this total is lost due to evapotranspiration with the remainder lost due to surface runoff 3 5 billion lit yr and groundwater recharge 2 1 billion lit yr our results indicate that the potential for flash flooding in the basin is significantly east west asymmetry episodes we therefore recommend that land use management should focus on the western side of lake abaya since its steep slopes give rise to high surface runoff potential and can lead to land degradation and transport of sediments into the lake areas in the eastern plateaus and north of lake abaya in particular the bilate and gidabo river basin were identified as predominant recharge zones so development activities in this area should be managed through consideration of possible contamination and pollution of lake water according to the respective potential both the surface and shallow groundwater resources in the lake basin can support the current water demands of both the potential irrigation and another development strategy however climate change is expected to bring significant changes in the region s hydro climate and thus the future studies should examine how the projected future changes in temperature and precipitation can affect the availability of water resources acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the school of earth sciences addis ababa university

8435,study region the volcano tectonic lakes basin of abaya chamo is part of the main ethiopian rift system and exhibits large variations in geomorphology physiography and climate between the rift floor and the plateau study focus despite the importance of streamflow for water resources management and planning in the basin many of the rivers there are ungauged to make quantitative estimates of streamflow for spatially resolved water availability in such a highly heterogeneous environment therefore requires numerical modeling this study is the first to quantify the surface and shallow groundwater resources in abaya chamo and to validate the physically fully distributed hydrologic model wetspass under highly data limited conditions in a complex two lake environment new hydrological insights simulated total river flow and estimated baseflow were verified at 15 gauging stations with a good agreement the wetspass model is shown to be suitable for such a complex setting with a correlation coefficient of 0 95 and 0 97 for total flow and baseflow respectively at a statistically significant level p value 0 05 the simulated annual water budget reveals that 74 6 of the 22 1 billion lit yr in total precipitation in the basin is lost through evapotranspiration 15 7 through surface runoff and only 9 7 recharges the groundwater system the simulations also revealed the surface runoff and groundwater recharge are the most sensitive to soil textural class while evapotranspiration depends more strongly on land use keywords surface water groundwater water balance wetspass abaya chamo lake basin 1 introduction the complex geological processes of the intra rift faulting and associated volcanic activities led to the formation of volcano tectonic structural depressions which became born sites and creation of several largest lakes in east africa as well as large parts of its topography le turdu et al 1999 https psugeo org africa african 20unep 20atlas africa atlas english chapter 1 pdf it forms a unique rift system including the main ethiopian rift mer which make up various lake basins in the region where the southern section of the mer occupies lakes such as awassa abaya chamo and chew bahir the present study area abaya chamo lakes basin as a part is thought to be hydrologically separate units but due to the subsurface interconnection of ne sw aligned regional faults and exhibits large variations in geomorphology physiography and climate between the rift floor across the escarpment and the plateau alemayehu et al 2005 understanding surface and groundwater systems over such a complex rift margin zone are difficult and a key issue for the sustainable management planning and development in rapidly developing countries such as ethiopia which experiences frequent water scarcity associated with its arid semi arid climate molla and tegaye 2019 halcrow 2008 jica 2012 the key challenges in the lakes basin stem from inadequate development of water resources to support the region s rapid population growth including poor sanitation and water delivery underdeveloped management and deployment of irrigation for agriculture and food production bekele 2001 the results of these challenges include poor health of the region s population flooding of river areas and loss of infrastructure and damage in general it has been recognized that there is a severe lack of coordinated research efforts to address the water resources problems in the acl basin despite the importance of streamflow for water resources management and planning in the basin many of the rivers are ungauged only a few previous studies have assessed the hydrology and hydrogeology of the region with the main objective of quantity and quality assessment of surface water and groundwater separately often using empirical and simple modeling approaches molla and tegaye 2019 bekele 2001 halcrow 2008 jica 2012 and others lake systems play an important role in surface water groundwater interaction and are especially important for the use and demand of unsustainable water resources indeed the groundwater contribution as a baseflow component is a highly desirable entity to know about water management in general as the part of total discharge that originates from delayed storages in a river catchment this parameter can also be used possibly to calibrate and validate hydrological models as well arnold et al 2000 stewart et al 2007 batelaan and de smedt 2007 combalicer et al 2008 eckhardt 2008 risser et al 2009 quantification and visualization of spatial and temporal relations of hydrological processes occurrence and pattern across the basin are difficult to figure out because of their high dynamic and continuous or discontinuous characteristics indeed selection of the appropriate input parameter and physical boundary conditions based on defining variables are far important for model creation on which there can be a variation in the results soczyńska 1989 ponce shetty 1995 fiedler ramirez 2000 batelaan de smedt 2001 dąbrowski et al 2011 methods for determining groundwater recharge are in particular of fundamental importance since groundwater resources are typically limited and their computational difficulties have been intensively discussed in previous works as either point based or lumped areal approaches simmers 1988 lerner et al 1990 de vries and simmers 2002 scanlon et al 2002 the point estimates were used as a base of extrapolation or rationalization over a large area however the outputs are not such evident as described in most studies suggest the physically distributed approaches are a more viable method to improve spatial estimates batelaan and de smedt 2007 sophocleous 1992 and jochen 2002 to make quantitative estimates of surface and shallow groundwater resource in a highly heterogeneous environment like the acl basin therefore requires numerical modeling physically based numerical hydrologic modeling has become the gold standard in modern water science for evaluation of water resources at the basin scale however the most available physically distributed models require high temporal resolution data such as swat arnold et al 2000 dream manfreda et al 2005 wetspa wang et al 1996 hbv losjo et al 1999 and svat armbruster and leibundgut 2001 these models are continuous data intensive and use more complex water balance calculations that questioning the applicability in developing countries like ethiopia where data availability at hourly or daily time scales is typically unavailable in spite of that there is a strong demand for a hydrologic model that can able to estimate the spatially varying water balance components over long term averages inordinately the water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere under quasi steady state condition wetspass model can be run using a seasonal or annual time step which dramatically reduces the requirements for input data batelaan and de smedt 2001 and 2007 xu and singh 1998 even so wetspass model was calibrated for temperate conditions in belgium al kuisi et al 2013 and needs parameter modifications as it has not been calibrated or validated in a complex surface groundwater zone such as the acl basin in the tropical setting this study is the first to quantify the surface shallow groundwater resources in the complex two lake environment of the abaya chamo basin we have deployed the physically distributed hydrologic model wetspass under highly data limited conditions which constitutes a stringent test for the simulation of spatially varying surface and shallow groundwater resources we were therefore assessed the applicability of the wetspass model to understand the spatial hydrologic pattern and the physical drivers of the annual water budget in this complex rift margin zone the results will help to build scientific and technical capacity developing nations and to generate increased connections between the scientific and policy communities in the next section 2 we describe the study region in more detail and the wetspass model configuration in section 3 we present the modeling results and section 4 contains the main conclusions and discussion 2 data and methodology 2 1 description of the study area and hydro climate the main ethiopian rift mer as part of the great east african rift system is seismically and volcanically active and virtually the only places worldwide where the transition from continental to oceanic rifting is exposed on land keir et al 2006 the abaya chamo lakes acl basin is located in southern ethiopia in the central section of the main ethiopian rift mer it is bounded by the limits from utm 307113 m to 468468 m and 598747 m to 897222 m easting and northing respectively molla and tegaye 2019 fig 1 the region s altitude varies between 3 430 m and 1 107 m above sea level and the lake basin covers an area of about 18 900 km2 topographically the basin is a fault bounded valley with a wide flat valley bottom bounded by volcanic mountains and hills that define the border of the lake s basin the rift margins are not clearly defined everywhere and the highest elevations of the surface of flanking plateaux are up to 3 430 m in the west chencha towards fonko and butajira highlands and 2 500 m in the east hagere mariam towards hagere selam where large upthrust mountains descend steeply toward the lakes molla and tegaye 2019 the climate of the area can be classified as semi humid to semi arid subtropical climate with an average annual temperature around 20 c in the rift floor with slightly lower values in the adjacent highlands and the average annual temperature is 13 c to 24 2 c with a very weak seasonal cycle mean annual rainfall varies from 951 mm to 1 653 mm in the river basins depending on local topography and position as shown in fig 2 the seasonal cycle of rainfall is strongly bimodal with two distinct wet seasons controlled by the seasonal migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz from march to june locally known as belg and from july to october locally known as kiremt molla and tegaye 2019 otterbach 1995 legesse et al 2003 the dry season locally known as bega runs from november to february in this study we therefore focus on the average hydro climate over these three seasons four month each these are denoted by the letters of the months they contain as mamj and jaso the wet seasons and ndjf the dry season molla and tegaye 2019 the main features of the drainage basin are two low lying lakes abaya 1 110 k m 2 to the north and chamo 316 k m 2 located in the center of the rift floor with inflow from the rivers of the basin the river network can be used to classify a series of sub river basins on the basis of the lake distribution and topography we are focusing here on six major rivers and their tributaries flow into abaya and chamo lakes fig 1 these sub basins are in geographical order by basin size billate 1 5 659 km2 hamessa guracha 2 1 007 km2 gidabo 3 4 199 km2 kulfo gina 4 1 369 km2 gelana 5 3 866 km2 and sife chamo 6 1 379 km2 molla tegaye 2019 jica 2012 halcrow et al 2008 the geology of the basin as shown in fig 3 is highly complicated and extremely faulted as described many previous studies molla tegaye 2019 kazmin et al 1980 halcrow 2008 woldegebriel et al 1990 jica 2012 the southern part of the study area is covered by high and low grade metamorphic rocks of the mozambican belt the pre rift tertiary volcanic succession consisting of basaltic and silicic lava plateaus covers the escarpment on both sides of the rift molla tegaye 2019 with the formation of the wonji fault belt because of tectonic movements and volcanic activity the rhyolite trachyte lava flows pumice pyroclastic unwelded tuffs ignimbrites obsidians and pitchstones are being distributed throughout the entire study area chiefly in the rift floor to the north and around the like abaya the dominant parts of the rift floor in particular the surroundings of abaya lake are covered by pleistocene holocene volcano sedimentary as one goes from the north through the rift to the south of lake chamo the age of the rock generally gets older molla tegaye 2019 as a general approach the estimation procedure for a given hydrological process involves an assessment of the distribution of the geophysical characteristics of the basin areas fig 4 shows the flow chart of the particular steps in this study on which the wetspass model links from the raw data through processing and encoding of spatiotemporal information to modeling and finally to a water balance simulation this study was employed to estimate the water balance components such as actual evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater recharge which are calibrated to historical gauged river flow and estimated baseflow data 2 2 wetspass model wetspass is a spatially distributed quasi steady state water balance numerical model to simulate and predict long term average hydrological processes at seasonal and annual basin scale batelaan and de smedt 2001 2007 this seasonal graphical user version of the model has the ability to simulate evapotranspiration interception runoff soil water balance and recharge batelaan and de smedt 2007 the wetspass model has been widely shown to be suitable for explaining the impact of changes in land use and soil texture on water balance over long periods of time in mid latitudes batelaan et al 2003 wang et al 2012 and more recently in a tropical setting over the ethiopian geba basin gebreyohannes et al 2013 by default in a humid climate setting the wetspass model calculates water balances for winter wet and summer dry over 6 month seasonal averages previous studies carried out by gebreyohannes et al 2013 abu saleem et al 2010 wang et al 2011 highlighted the importance of the clear separation of hydrological seasons length and type across different climatic regions we therefore applied the model in this study for three seasons four month each as defined above which is appropriate because the necessary input data are available with a relatively high temporal resolution the model performs the water balance computation at a raster cell level as given in eqs 1 3 the total water balance is thus calculated as the summation of each raster cell s water balance for independent vegetated bare soil open water and an impervious fraction s of a raster cell as described in batelaan and de smedt 2007 1 e t r a s t e r

total evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater recharge of a raster cell respectively each having a vegetated bare soil open water and impervious area component denoted by a v a s a o and a i respectively to separate the precipitation into surface runoff evapotranspiration an interception and groundwater recharge the model uses digital data in the seasonal version of the wetspass graphical user interface manual batelaan and de smedt 2007 the detailed methodology is provided the water balance of a basin as given in eq 4 is therefore depends on the average annual seasonal precipitation p interception fraction i surface runoff s actual transpiration aet and groundwater recharge r all with the unit of length per time lt 1 which are estimated from the vegetation type soil type slope groundwater depth and climatic variables such as precipitation potential evapotranspiration temperature and wind speed 4 p a e t s i r in order to validate the total flow simulation from the wetspass model which comprises both surface runoff and groundwater recharge observational flow data from 15 gauging stations were collected from the hydrology section of the ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie ethiopia besides the base flow estimates and results of the various previous regional and fragmented study were used here as a supplementary confirmation approach to the total flow calibration as it is supported by many previous studies such as arnold et al 2000 stewart et al 2007 batelaan and de smedt 2007 combalicer et al 2008 eckhardt 2008 risser et al 2009 which were examined under long term mean conditions where the contributions of groundwater as a baseflow flux thus the groundwater discharge can be used as a proxy way to compare the basin mean groundwater recharge here the basic assumptions are relayed on the equivalency of baseflow and the groundwater discharge of a basin and that implies the groundwater discharge to rivers is approximately equal to recharge piggott et al 2005 risser et al 2005 so that the gauged river flow records were partitioned into the surface and baseflow components using the time plot baseflow separation program time plot gabriel periodic filter algorithm equation 5 this method is based on a recursive filter commonly used in signal analysis as discussed in nathan and mcmahon 1990 and lyne and hollick 1979 molla tegaye 2019 the formulation of the filter is given by 5 f k α f k 1 1 α 2 y k y k 1 where f k is the filtered fast response at the k t h sampling time y k is the total flow and α is a filter parameter lastly the filtered baseflow is given by y k f k the observed daily total flow and baseflow component were then averaged over each season and compared to the model simulation output that estimates seasonal mean flow and groundwater recharge of the area the location and record period of the stations are shown in fig 1 and supplementary 3 2 3 input data for wetspass the model requires two types of input data i e geo spatially referenced grid maps and parameter tables batelaan and de smedt 2007 the grid maps with a cell size of 500 500 m 2 consist of slope angle land use soil texture groundwater depth and seasonal annual meteorological maps of precipitation potential evapotranspiration temperature and wind speed digital elevation model dem nasa jpl 2013 of the study area is used with a cell size of 30 m the dem is processed to prepare a topographic elevation map a slope angle map fig 5 a and river network of the abaya chamo lakes basin fig 1 and shows that slope angles range from 0 to 27 with a mean of 3 6 the south western part and eastern highlands have the highest degree of slope the land use map of the basin was derived from cloud free land sat etm satellite images of february path 168 rows 55 and 56 and november january path 169 rows 54 55 and 56 2000 nasa jpl 2013 using the standard envi supervised image classification the land use map fig 5b of the basin agriculture 43 6 wood bush land 28 1 forest 7 6 grass 10 7 swamp marsh 2 4 and open water 7 4 were identified in seven land use classes a soil map of the lakes basin of abaya chamo was extracted from the harmonized fao database fao 1998 using the topsoil percentages of particle size fractions soil type classes were translated into usgs soil texture classes in order to make the data compatible with a model requirement the textural map of the converted soil in fig 5c shows the texture of the soil classes i e clay 29 5 clay loam 15 8 sandy clay 6 7 sandy clay loam 35 7 and sandy loam 12 2 of the abaya chamo lake basin piezometric map obtained from the groundwater depth in relative to the surface elevation which is used to include the seepage fluxes in the model s calculations of the water balance therefore the study area s groundwater depth was deduced from the spatially available wells lakes level and spring points fig 5d shows the potentiometric surface elevation contour of groundwater above means sea level the meteorological conditions of a given wide and independent area are known to affect the formation of water resources so that the annual and seasonal meteorological parameters such as precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and wind speed were prepared from the available meteorological stations in order to grasp the hydro meteorological characteristics of the abaya chamo lakes basin along with other sets of data to analyze water balance of the basin fig 6 and supplementary 1 the available 46 meteorological stations as indicated in fig 1 were checked for reliability through data quality and consistency among each other and against the climatological history as well within the abaya chamo basin meteorological data are available for the period from the early 1980s for some stations though the range varies from station to station all available 46 stations have daily precipitation recordings but 23 stations have only been recorded temperature and only 10 stations for wind speed the spatial maps and the information on meteorological parameters within the study area are shown in the supplementary material 1 the parameters for land use soil type and runoff must be specified in four lookup tables required to run the wetspass model the attribute tables involve parameters related to the land use type and soil type the former land use table contains parameters such as rooting depth leaf area index and vegetation height batelaan and de smedt 2007 and which were calibrated for temperate conditions in belgium al kuisi et al 2013 indeed the application of this model as described in abu saleem et al 2010 al kuisi et al 2013 requires parameters modifications of in the lookup tables for other regions that are characterized by different climatological regions such as semi arid arid areas for instance in ethiopian condition gebreyohannes et al 2013 made some parameter adjustments to leaf area index root depth and bareness for geba basin accordingly in this study the relative differences between geba basin and the environmental setup of abaya chamo lakes basin are taken into account through professional suggestion and selected field observations therefore the modifications of seasonal land use lookup table parameters include a decrease in values of leaf area index b a substantial decrease in the depth of the root since as described in detail by jochen et al 2002 pierret alain et al 2016 the depth of rooting in humid to arid environments is likely to be shallower as water tends to be available throughout the growing season in the upper soil horizons the deeper roots in the arid area are potentially less important and so rooting depths are not strongly linked to potential evapotranspiration pet because water infiltration depths will be more limited than evaporative requirements and c 20 increase of the bareness of all land cover s proportions from each land use class 3 numerical simulation of the steady state hydro climate of the abaya chamo lakes basin 3 1 model validation the results of the wetspass model simulation were verified against observations of river flow at 15 river gauge stations of sub basins in the abaya chamo lake s basin fig 1 river measurements account for direct runoff flow surface runoff and baseflow sub surface flow that recharge the groundwater reservoir model simulation results for mean total flows were compared to mean annual flows at 15 gauging stations of the sub basins and also the simulated groundwater recharge are compared against estimated baseflow as given in fig 7 a b the estimated results of baseflow yield deduced from daily river flows time series for sub basins of 15 river gauging station within abaya chamo basin using the time plot technique for baseflow separation nathan and mcmahon 1990a is given in the supplementary 2 this was used only for validation of groundwater recharge simulated by the spatially distributed wetspass model in the analyses period the observed average annual total river flows are between 0 32 m 3 s and 17 59 m 3 s for the 15 river gauging station while the estimated average annual baseflow is between 0 13 m 3 s and 9 25 m 3 s next we compare the observed total discharge versus simulated at measuring stations and additionally the estimated baseflow versus simulated groundwater recharge respectively in the study area the scatter plots in fig 7 a b show a good agreement at 95 confidence level with a correlation coefficient of 0 95 and 0 97 respectively with the standard error of 0 12 and 0 20 these figures reflect a degree of accuracy in the application of the wetspass model in the study area which shows a strong correlation between the simulated and the observed ground truth or estimated values the tendencies of high and low peak values at the stations are quite well simulated the simulated streamflow values are generally underestimated in particular for most of the gauging stations with the exception of small overestimations at billate and hamessa guracha just north of lake abaya gauging station of bilate tena and hamessa humbo the underestimated values are mainly observed in the upper stream portions of the abaya chamo lakes basin gauging station of weira kulfo sala and u gelana see locations on supplementary 3 the areas of these stations are also associated with the major geological structures and fissured aquifers that can promote deep groundwater flow the small discrepancies are shown in fig 7 a b this can also be caused by the natural variability of hydrological processes the complex physical characteristics of the lakes basin and the uncertainty induced by the parameterization and a representation of the realistic models in addition the river flow record and the estimation of baseflow can also be a cause of error since it is never completely free of errors 3 2 simulated hydrologic components we begin by describing the mean simulated hydrologic cycle averaged over the entire basin and the associated antecedent hydrological processes precipitation rate actual evapotranspiration and surface runoff these parameter values are then combined in the water balance equation table 5 to estimate the rate of groundwater recharge and distribution fig 8 summarizes the seasonal and annual variability of each parameter the bars indicate the 25 t h q 25 50 t h q 50 and 75 t h q 75 percentiles of each distribution while the whiskers represent the extreme minimum and the maximum values the spatial distribution of the long term annual components of the simulated water balance is given in fig 9 3 2 1 actual evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration is given as a summation of evaporation from bare soil and open water bodies vegetation transpiration and evaporation of precipitation intercepted by the vegetation batelaan and de smedt 2001 the model result in fig 9 a shows that the central axis from the northeast toward the south west including lakes of abaya and chamo have high average actual evapotranspiration while the northern eastern southeastern edges of the basin have a lower value the high values are shown in table 1 which are mainly due to the availability of relatively excess precipitation surface water and the favorable combination of land use soil type from this table 1 the highest values of evapotranspiration are found in the open water forest or grassland land use classes with sandy clay loam and sandy loam soil combinations obviously forests are known for their relatively high evapotranspiration and the coarser textures of the soil that can hold more soil water while agricultural land swamp marsh along with sandy clay clay or clay loam soils have the lowest values besides the average and standard deviation values in table 1 can be used to identify the dominating factor between land cover and soil texture it implies the factor with a lower standard deviation value could have affected more than the factor with a higher value accordingly the land cover class can amplify evapotranspiration more than the soil textural type s in abaya chamo lake basin the annual value of evapotranspiration varies between 541 9 and 1307 3 m m y r with a mean of 873 26 m m y r whereas the seasonal values show significant temporal differences in the basins as given in fig 7 during the wet season kiremt and belg about 29 5 and 32 5 of the evapotranspiration takes place while the remaining 12 5 occurs during the dry season bega the seasonal variation is caused by uneven seasonal distribution of precipitation and changes in vegetation cover during the dry period for example during the dry period the energy required for evaporation is not the limiting factor but the availability of water this explains why the actual rate of evaporation is lower in wet seasons than the dry season 3 2 2 surface runoff and interception high spatial surface runoff found in the east and west of lake abaya and chamo than those in the north and south of lake abaya and chamo fig 9 b the spatial and temporal variation of the surface runoff generation can be explained primarily by the distribution of precipitation rate the combination of land cover soil texture over the physiographical arrangement as given in table 2 the largest surface runoff occurs on clay soil combinations with land use types such as agricultural land swamp marsh or wood bush land in contrast the lowest values are happening to sandy loam and sandy clay loam soils with grassland and forest the smaller standard deviation values of the runoff for different types of soil in table 2 indicate that surface runoff is more influenced by the texture of soil than land use types the mean temporal variation of surface runoff values is shown in fig 8 and supplement 2 b the annual surface runoff ranges from 1 to 637 8 m m y r with an average of 183 4 m y r during the wet season kiremt and belg about 6 8 and 7 4 of the surface runoff occur respectively while the remaining 1 6 occurs during the dry season bega there is a small seasonal variation in the surface runoff as compared to actual evapotranspiration throughout the year even though due to the significant changes in vegetated surfaces in a wet season the interception is given as a fraction of precipitation value which depends on the type and distribution of vegetation de jong and jetten 2007 roberts 1983 calder 1979 nonhebel 1987 total annual interception in the basin ranges from 0 to 14 2 m y r with an average value of 3 09 m m y r seasonal interception ranges from 0 to 6 12 0 to 1 28 and 0 to 6 24 respectively for kiremt bega and belg fig 7 in the north of lake abaya the relatively highest interceptions occur supplementary c 3 2 3 groundwater recharge the estimation of groundwater recharge is regarded as a highly challenging parameter in hydrogeology although the simulation results using spatially distributed multivariate gives the eastern highland and northern part of the basin generally have a higher groundwater recharge than those in the central basin floor and the western part of the basin this is likely due to a combination of favorable conditions such as high precipitation permeable soils gentle topography and land use cover in fig 9 d as indicated in table 3 the average annual groundwater recharge values for different combinations of land use soil classes reveal that the largest groundwater recharge is observed in soil textural classes of sandy loam and sandy clay loam along with agricultural and forest land use type this is basically because of the high permeability of these soils but it could also be partly due to lower evaporation rates and less runoff on the relatively gentle slopes of agricultural land on the other hand grassland and wood bush land yield less groundwater recharge on any type of soil due to their high potential of transpiration and interception processes especially the clay textural types this is evidently linked to a high transpiration rate particularly in the case of wood bush land which was confirmed by the research conducted by venkatraman and ashwath 2016 sophocleous 2000 batelaan 2006 as well as okoński and miller 2006 as indicated in table 3 the highest spatial variation of recharge is found by the soil textural classes which have a smaller standard deviation than land use type as a result this signifies that the recharge increases distinctly with coarse soil texture regardless of the land cover classes the annual groundwater recharge in the lake basin of the abaya chamo ranges from 0 to 540 8 m y r with an average value of 113 74 m m y r figs 8 and 9 d in regard to seasonal variation about 4 97 and 5 1 of the recharge occurs during the rainy seasons kiremt and belg respectively but here negative recharge values are observed during the dry season bega by indicating no recharge rather it signifies the groundwater contributions to surface water as discharge that is in the range between 0 to 63 6 m m y r vegetation covers therefore can maintain a higher et through groundwater osmosis in these areas besides the spatial surface runoff map in fig 9 shows that the eastern and western parts of lake abaya and chamo have a large potential surface water resource compared to the northern and southern parts of lake abaya and chamo in particular the western part of the lake as described by molla and tegaye 2019 here are also characterized by a high degree of slope and highly subjected to episodes of flash flooding that plays a major role in the transport of sediments in the lakes while the bilate river basin was generally identified as the recharge zone in the basin with their highly productive intercalated volcano sedimentary aquifers especially the eastern plateaus and north of lake abaya 3 3 surface water balance 3 3 1 surface water balances of major sub river basins as given in table 4 the magnitude of the largest annual inflow source to the lake basin occurs in gidabo about 1257 7 m m y r and gelana 1191 2 m m y r sub river basin located in the east of the lakes due to the high rate of the mean annual rainfall while the chamo sife sub river basin to south and west of lake chamo exhibit the smallest magnitude of annual rainfall consequently due to the distribution of the annual rainfall and land coverage particularly the grassland creates the highest total evapotranspiration as an outflow which is estimated 928 2 m m y r and 882 3 m m y r respectively for gidabo and billate sub river basins in contrast the kulfo gina sub river basin has a relatively lowest evaporation loss the slope steepness of kulfo gina and hamessa guracha sub basin unlike others are yield the highest annual surface runoff about 334 5 m m y r and 319 6 m m y r respectively while billate river basin has 89 8 m m y r which may be associated with the soil textural classes the water balances of sub river basins show that the groundwater recharge is largely dominated by the rate and spatial distribution of rainfall and soil textural properties indeed the distributions of relatively high permeable quaternary volcano sedimentary aquifers units in the bilate and gidabo river basin have recharged the groundwater about 157 5 m m y r and 144 9 m m y r respectively while the estimated annual recharge yield were small in the west sides of both lakes abaya and chamo where the sloppy sub rivers basins such as hamessa guracha kulfo gina and chamo sife yields only 68 5 m y r 78 8 m m y r and 67 4 m m y r respectively therefore the difference in the water balances of each sub river basins can be explained by the rate and distribution of rainfall geomorphometric physiographical characteristics land use soil elevation slope area as given by molla and tegaye 2019 and the associated response of the hydro climatic parameters 3 3 2 the total surface water balances of abaya chamo lakes basin the overall water balance of the abaya chamo lakes basin is given in table 5 the simulation of the wetspass model is presented using long term average annual condition the water balance structure is dominated by evapotranspiration which constituted 74 6 of the precipitation and is the largest water balance component in the abaya chamo lake basin about 15 7 of the annual precipitation in the abaya chamo basin accounts for the surface runoff value only a small fraction of the annual precipitation remains to be intercepted 0 3 and the rest part is groundwater recharge this makes up only 9 7 of the total annual precipitation in the lake basin these results confirmed by previous studies for example in the north of the study area in the central ethiopian rift valley by zenaw 2003 estimated that approximately 5 of the rainfall in the awassa basin was recharged as stated by wabco 1990 in the master plan of the rvlb for water resources development in ethiopia computed the recharge of more than 5 of rainfall recharge calculated from the values of average base flow shows the possibility of recharge variability in dila sheet as part of the abaya chamo lakes basin in which thomas et al 2015 estimated between 7 and 20 of the precipitation additionally the southern nation nationalist people representative snnpr water resource development bureau report on a hydrogeological mapping of gidabo basin yirgalem kilissa topo sheets estimated evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge of 806 mm yr and 135 m m y r 10 of precipitation respectively shiferaw abebe 2004 halcrow 2008 were also quantified the surface runoff from the total annual average river flow into the lake systems about 3 018 million cubic meters the small error in the water balance is about a 0 3 deficit due to the assumption that water bodies can unlimitedly evaporate at pet rate 4 conclusions and recommendation the physically distributed hydrological model wetspass was used to simulate the hydrology and water balance of the abaya chamo lakes basin in the main rift valley of southern ethiopian the model uses detailed basin characteristics and considers the effects of highly variable topography soil type and land use cover on the lake basin hydrologic characteristics comparisons of observed and simulated river flow at sub basins show the model results correspond reasonably and realistically and there was also a good agreement between the simulated recharge and the estimated baseflow at 15 gauging stations in the basin in general the model has a great potential to determine the influence on hydrological behavior of changes in land use or soil type accordingly in the case of spatial digital data limitations parameterization and regionalization of an input map needs great care and employing appropriate techniques to estimation and interpolation each of the input variables thus the wetspass model is also verified in this study for its applicability in semi arid arid with highly variable physical characteristic over complex rift margin that involves lakes system for the evaluation of the long term regional water resources the model can therefore be applied to other similar basins in particular in developing regions with limited time series and spatial data at high resolution indeed the calibrations of the simulated water balance components using parameters in the lookup tables of the land use and soil type are better adjusted using either predetermined values for a particular environment i e humid semi humid semi arid arid or needs field measurements along with professionals suggestion the total flow from the wetspass model is given by the summation of surface runoff and groundwater recharge the mean ratio of groundwater recharge to the total flow groundwater recharge total flow is about 0 38 this means the groundwater recharge is about 38 3 of the total flow which is nearly comparable to the baseflow index bfi in comparison the bfi is estimated at an average of about 0 42 across the entire basin using baseflow separation techniques as estimated by molla and tegaye 2019 this confirms the importance of both techniques to estimate the water resources available in the study area i e baseflow separation and modeling approach the water resource potential or availability summary is given in table 5 from model output shows the lake basin as a whole has a total of 22 1 billion lit yr rainfall with a mean value of 1169 5 mm year about 16 5 billion lit yr of this total is lost due to evapotranspiration with the remainder lost due to surface runoff 3 5 billion lit yr and groundwater recharge 2 1 billion lit yr our results indicate that the potential for flash flooding in the basin is significantly east west asymmetry episodes we therefore recommend that land use management should focus on the western side of lake abaya since its steep slopes give rise to high surface runoff potential and can lead to land degradation and transport of sediments into the lake areas in the eastern plateaus and north of lake abaya in particular the bilate and gidabo river basin were identified as predominant recharge zones so development activities in this area should be managed through consideration of possible contamination and pollution of lake water according to the respective potential both the surface and shallow groundwater resources in the lake basin can support the current water demands of both the potential irrigation and another development strategy however climate change is expected to bring significant changes in the region s hydro climate and thus the future studies should examine how the projected future changes in temperature and precipitation can affect the availability of water resources acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the school of earth sciences addis ababa university

8436,study region this study was undertaken in the athi sabaki river basin in kenya in east africa study focus the study focused on the determination of the influence of streamflow variability on salt fluxes this involved monitoring of river discharge and river salinity in the period between 2012 and 2018 new hydrological insights this study demonstrates that athi sabaki river discharges significant quantity of salt to the sea there are significant seasonal and inter annual variations in salt fluxes that are due to variations in river discharge and rainfall in the basin the relationship between streamflow variations and variations of salinity in the river was inverse with highest salinity concentrations and fluxes occurring during low flow conditions the river salinity and tds concentrations decreased with an increase in river discharge due to dilution effect and flushing of salt from the river the highly polluted sub basins draining through the city of nairobi exhibited relatively higher salinity and salt fluxes as compared to non polluted ones draining rural areas the total salt flux in the basin ranged between 29 103 and 261 103 tons year 1 the relatively high salinity and salt fluxes were attributed to the discharge of wastewaters seepage of groundwater and irrigation return flows the study calls for water pollution control sustainable irrigation and landuse practices in the basin keywords athi sabaki river streamflow variations salinity variations water pollution salt fluxes kenya 1 introduction the discharge of salt from rivers is the main source of salinity in world oceans and lakes salt may enter into a river through seepage of water from geological formations that contain salt or may enter through seepage of water from salinised agricultural fields the later is mainly due to inappropriate irrigation practices and high rates of evaporation in irrigation fields cf sijali et al 2003 radiro et al 2003 however despite this fact there is scarcity of data and information on the salt discharges by rivers of the world most studies of salt fluxes have mainly focused on estuaries deltas and bays and other coastal systems kaluarachchi et al 2003 zhu et al 2012 soltanias et al 2013 aristizábal and chant 2013 devkota and fang 2015 salt fluxes in estuaries and bays are controlled by physical oceanographic processes that are different from the hydrologic processes that control salt fluxes in rivers the past hydrologic research has only paid a casual attention to the discharge of salt fluxes in tropical river systems in africa and the world all over there is thus scarcity of data on the dynamics of salt discharge in rivers there has also been limited attempt to determine the contribution of african tropical rivers in terms of global salt fluxes kitheka 2017a b c this is due to the fact that most of the hydrological studies on african rivers have focused on water pollution soil erosion sediment and nutrient fluxes see kithia 1997 kithiia 1992 2006 kithiia and mutua 2006 sigleo and frick 2015 ohowa et al 1997 mahananda 2010 massdam and smith 1994 kawabata et al 2012 the study of salt fluxes in rivers has been given a wide berth this is despite the fact that transport of salt by the rivers has major implication on the extent to which river water can be used for agricultural production including urban and rural water supply and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems increased variability of streamflow in tropical river basin due to climate change is expected to lead to increased salinity levels and salt fluxes in rivers kitheka 2017a b c the increased frequency of droughts in africa can lead to an increase in the levels of salinity in water where the frequency of occurrence of flood conditions increases it is expected the capacity of the rivers to transport salt would be increased leading to greater flashing of salt in tropical rivers kitheka 2017a b c however there is limited data to demonstrate these relationships particularly that between salt transport and streamflow variability in tropical river systems of africa the study of salt fluxes in river basins is important because salt in water is an important constituent in water that has major implication in agriculture water supply and sustainability of ecosystems high levels of salinity in water can render water unsuitable for irrigation agriculture this is due to the fact that majority of the irrigated crops cannot tolerate high levels of salinity in water the variability of salinity levels in river water used for irrigation can therefore have major implication on crop production and in some cases can lead to collapse of irrigation projects this can have major socio economic implications to communities who are depended on these irrigation projects in terms of water supply high salinity in water can make water unpalatable with objectionable taste to most people this may limit the extent to which water can be used for various domestic purposes in some cases water supply projects can be rendered unsustainable due to high levels of salinity in water that causes corrosion of pipes and damages pipe fixtures u s department of the interior 2011 this can escalate operational and maintenance costs to urban and rural water supply schemes see also lasage et al 2008 despite all the major effects that salinity levels in river water can have on agriculture water supply public health and ecosystems there are still few studies on salt fluxes in tropical african river systems cf puttemans 2004 kitheka 2017c data on the relationship between streamflow salinity and salt fluxes in tropical river systems is therefore required to advice on the water resources and agricultural development programmes this is becoming important as a result of continuing heavy investments in irrigation and water supply projects in africa kitheka 2017c the main goal of this study was therefore to determine i the extent to which salinity in a tropical river is influenced by streamflow variability and ii establish the typical patterns of salt fluxes in the river in this study this was achieved through measurement of river discharges salinity total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity followed by computation of salt fluxes in the main river as well as in the sub basins of the river the study was undertaken in the athi river basin which is one of the largest river basin in kenya with perennial river discharge fig 1 the river basin receives highly erratic and seasonal rainfall which causes highly variable streamflow that is one of the major factors limiting water supply projects public health agricultural production food security and socio economic development in counties found in eastern kenya the river and its tributaries has been the main source of water for various purpose including domestic industrial irrigation and municipal uses in the recent past a lot of financial resources have been directed towards water resources development projects in arid and semi arid lands cf prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 beimers et al 2001a b burger et al 2003 munyao et al 2004 puttemans 2004 borst and de haas 2006 lasage et al 2008 kitheka 2017c however there has been little consideration of water quality issues in these projects and levels of salinity in river water are never taken into account when planning for water supply and agricultural development projects in the basin assessment of salinity levels in the river is therefore important as it can provide information on the viability and sustainability of water and agricultural development projects in arid and semi arid lands of the basin studies of this nature are also important in safeguarding public health sustaining aquatic ecosystems protecting fragile semi arid lands soils from salinisation enhancing water security and promoting socio economic development of marginalized communities 1 1 study area athi river drainage basin is the fourth largest drainage system in kenya fig 1 the basin has a total surface area of 69 930 km2 however the surface area in the upper region of the basin where this study was concentrated is about 10 276 km2 the basin extents all the way to the indian ocean coast to the main catchment areas situated in the central kenya highlands particularly in the kikuyu escarpment aberdares ranges and ngong hills the river also receives flows from seasonal rivers draining hills found in the foreland plateau of eastern kenya such as mbooni hills nzaui hills kiima kiu muumandu hills kilungu hills and iuani hills the highly polluted nairobi river contributes water to the athi river in its upper course that drains through the city of nairobi the capital of kenya other tributaries of the river in the upper parts of the basin include stony athi mbagathi ruiru and ndarugu rivers see fig 1 the basin experiences two rainfall seasons that are influenced by the convergence of the southeast and northeast monsoons in the inter tropical convergence zone cf ojany and ogendo 1986 the southeast monsoon sem occurs between mid march and mid september while the northeast monsoon nem occurs between october and early march rainfall in the upper parts of the basin ranges from 1000 to 1200 mm yr 1 however in the lower regions rainfall is much lower ranging between 500 and 750 mm yr 1 along the coast rainfall ranges between 750 and 1000 mm yr 1 however there are often large inter annual variations in rainfall partly due to el nino and la nina southern oscillation phenomena air temperature shows significant regional variability in the basin in the central kenya highlands where the river originates from temperature ranges between 18 c and 28 c in the semi arid middle region of the basin temperature range between 20 c and 32 c cf ojany and ogendo 1986 evaporation rates in the basin range between 1200 and 1500 mm yr 1 in the central kenya highlands however in the semi arid lower region of the basin evaporation rates are of the order 1800 mm yr 1 which is higher than the annual rainfall ojany and ogendo 1986 this implies that there is a water deficit in the basin during dry periods of the year the geology of the upper region of the basin is characterized by the basement complex rocks volcanic rocks phonolites of kapiti plains and yatta plateau and aruphibolites athi basin upstream the middle region of the basin is underlain by banded gneisses and granitoid gneisses nyamai et al 2003 prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 along the lower parts of the basin all the way to the coast are found triassic rocks the soils are generally deep sandy alluvium and red sandy soils in addition to patches of black cotton soils and murram soils in the basin contain little organic matter and hence have low fertility prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 the upper part of the basin in the kenya highlands is characterized by high population densities 200 300 persons km2 and intensive cultivation of land major crops grown here include various horticultural crops tea and coffee while remnants of once luxurious and expansive forests on hills still remain in the highlands there has been extensive clearance of forests for agriculture and settlements the waters of the river have not been harnessed for hydropower and only small scale irrigation is practiced on its flood plains however the construction of a mega dam thwake dam in the middle upper region of the basin is currently ongoing the dam will be 77 m high above the lowest elevation of the river bed with a crest elevation of 912 m above sea level prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 the dam is expected to store water for flood control irrigation hydropower generation and urban rural water supplies prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 and will also have major impacts along the coast kitheka 2013 2014 2 methodology 2 1 streamflow measurements streamflow measurements were undertaken at one monitoring station located at the main athi river at wamunyi and at five 5 sampling stations located at the main tributaries of the athi river namely mbagathi stony athi nairobi ruiru and ndarugu rivers fig 1 a concerted monitoring campaign was undertaken from january 2012 to july 2018 the measurement of river discharges was undertaken through measurement of flow velocities and determination of cross sectional area of river channel see also linsley et al 1988 chapman 1996 batram and balance 1996 kitheka 2017c the frequency of measurements was monthly during dry seasons when there was no major change in streamflow and daily during rainy season when river discharges changed rapidly attempt was made to determine the relationship between river discharge and salinity conductivity and tds in each of the sampling stations using regression and correlation analysis the data on river discharges together with data on salinity and tds were used to determine salt flux rates within the main river and also in the sub basins contributing flow to the main athi river see also kitheka 2017c 2 2 measurement of physico chemical parameters salinity total dissolved solids concentration tds and electrical conductivity were measured insitu using martini instruments mi306 ec tds salinity meter measurements of these parameters were undertaken in sampling stations where river discharge measurements were also undertaken the measurements of these parameters were undertaken at the middle of the river channel by lowering the probe into the water up to the mid water depth the probe was left into the water for about 5 min for the reading to stablise after which the reading was recorded in a field notebook the martini instruments mi306 ec tds salinity meter used in this study had a salinity range of 0 40 psu and an accuracy of 0 1psu the tds and electrical conductivity ranges were 0 1000 μs cm and 0 1000 mg l respectively see also kitheka 2017c according to the instruments user manual the tds and salinity were derived from conductivity and sodium chloride nacl respectively because water turbidity can influence the level of salinity we also measured turbidity of the river water using hanna instruments hi93703 microprocessor turbidity range 0 1000ftu during rainy season the frequency of sampling and measurement of these parameters was daily in order to capture the levels of these parameters during the period of highly variable streamflow during the dry seasons sampling of the physico chemical parameters was undertaken once every month as the streamflow did not change frequently 2 3 analysis of hydrologic data the data obtained from the sampling stations were subjected to statistical analyses methods such regression and correlation analysis these analyses were performed to establish whether there is a significant relationship between streamflow variations and variations in salinity conductivity and tds within the main river an attempt was made to determine the relationship between river discharge and salinity and also between river discharge and tds during the rising limb and recession limb of the streamflow hydrograph respectively this was done by separately carrying regression analysis of data for the rising and recession periods these data were then plotted separately as scatter graphs and the best regression curve was fitted based on the highest value of the coefficient of determination r2 that was derived for the relationships these analyses provided insights on the patterns of variability of salinity and tds during the period when river discharge was rising and when it was receding 2 4 determination of salt fluxes the computation of salt fluxes in the main branch of the athi river as well as in the main sub basins were based on the data on river discharge salinity and the total dissolved salts tds measurements that were undertaken using martini instruments mi306 ec tds salinity meter to allow for accurate determination of salt fluxes the measurements on river discharges and tds salinity were undertaken simultaneously in the established monitoring stations the mean monthly tds concentrations c was computed according to the following eq 1 1 c i 1 n c i n in the above equation c is the mean monthly tds concentration and ci is the monthly tds concentration the mean river discharge q was computed using eq 2 shown below 2 q i 1 n q i n in the above equation q is the mean monthly river discharge m3 s and qi is the monthly river discharge m3 month the mean monthly salt fluxes were computed using eq 3 as show below 3 s f i 1 n q c in the above equation sf is the mean monthly salt flux kg month c is the mean tds concentration and q is the mean river discharge the monthly salt fluxes sf were extrapolated to obtain the annual salt fluxes for the main river as well as for the tributaries draining from the sub basins cf also chapman 1996 in total 93 continuous monthly measurements of river discharges tds salinity and conductivity undertaken in the main branch of the river in the period between january 2012 and april 2018 were used to determine the salt fluxes in the upper athi river basin however in the tributaries only spot measurements were undertaken in dry and wet seasons to obtain insight on the magnitude of variability of streamflow and salt fluxes from the mbagathi ruiru stony athi ndarugu and nairobi river sub basins 3 results 3 1 hydrology and streamflow patterns athi river experiences significant seasonal variations in river discharges due to seasonal variation of rainfall in the basin fig 2 shows the variation of river discharges in the river at wamunyu river gauging station in the period between 2012 and 2015 the highest river discharges were measured in the period between april and may during the long rainy season and november december during the short rains the lowest river discharges occurred during the dry season months of july august and january march of each of the three years monitored in this study the long rainy season received relatively much higher streamflows as compared to the short rainy season whose high streamflows were relatively lower the maximum streamflows during the long rainy season ranged between 350 and 500 m3 s while those experienced during the short rainy season ranged between 50 and 150 m3 s there is also a significant inter annual variations in streamflow the years 2012 and 2013 experienced relatively higher river discharges as compared to the years 2014 and 2015 there is in fact a declining trend in river discharges in the period between 2012 and 2015 while the mean maximum river discharges ranged 350 500 m3 s in the years 2012 and 2013 these declined to the range of 100 150 m3 s in the years 2014 and 2015 the analysis of streamflow hydrograph of the river showed that river discharge is characterized by steep rising limb and steep recession limb with a relatively long recession period fig 2 the rising limb is from march to may while the recession limb is from may to october during the long rainy season during this period the flow recession lasts for almost 6 months during the short rainy season the rising limb is in the period october november while the flow recession limb is in the period november march during the short rainy season the flow recession lasts for 5 months and during this period the streamflow continues to decline up to the beginning of the next rainy season both the rising limb and recession limb were steep indicating the erratic and seasonal nature of flow from a catchment area that has been disturbed due various inappropriate landuse practices including urbanization and agriculture the results of this study also showed that the flow in the athi river is flashy type synonymous with rapid generation of surface runoff in the degraded catchment area during the rainy season the long flow recession period is an indication of discharge of water from the bank storage and groundwater aquifers the examination of flow duration curve showed that 95 of the flows are usually less than 3 m3 s and high flows 350m3 s occur in less than 5 of the time the low flows are therefore more frequent as compared to high streamflows the high frequency of occurrence of low streamflows also shows that the basin responds quite rapidly to rainfall input as evidenced by the steep rising limbs and recession limbs in the flow hydrograph this is typical of rivers flowing from degraded river basins in arid and semi arid lands 3 2 influence of streamflow variability on salinity and tds there is a significant relationship between river discharge and salinity in river athi fig 3 shows the extent to which the variations of river discharge influences salinity in the athi river based on the monitoring of these parameters at wamunyu rgs in the period between january 2012 and june 2018 the relationship between river discharge and salinity yielded a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 69 which is significant at 95 confidence level p 0 05 the correlation coefficient r for the relationship between streamflow and salinity was 0 83 indicating the existence of a strong positive relationship between the two parameters the relationship was best represented by an exponential equation as this yielded the best coefficient of determination r2 fig 4 shows the relationship between river discharge and both salinity and tds the relationships were also exponential with r2 value of the order 0 68 as shown in bith figs 3 and 4 the salinity was highest during periods of low streamflows 50m3 s and was lowest during medium and high streamflows 100m3 s there is an exponential decrease in salinity and tds as the streamflow increases this exponential decreasewas attributed to the dilution effect of high volume of freshwater during high streamflow conditions as was also established in the tiva river in a similar study kitheka 2017c attempt was made to establish whether there is a significant difference in the relationship between river discharge and either tds or salinity during the recession and rising flood limp periods figs 6 and 7 during the rising or flood phase and recession phase the relationship between river discharge and either salinity and tds were found to be mainly exponential there are however pertinent differences in terms of the statistical significance of these exponential relationships during the recession period the relationship between river discharge and salinity was characterized by a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 78 while during the rising limp or flood period the r2 was 0 54 also during the recession period the relationship between river discharge and tds was characterized by a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 75 while during the rising limp or flood period the r2 was 0 50 during the recession period both relationships were best represented by a power function of the form salrecess 0 17q 0 27 and tdsrecess 451 9q 0 25 during the rising or flood period the relationships were best represented by a power function of the form salflood 0 355q 0 54 and tdsflood 785 9q 0 29 these results imply that salinity variations in the river are driven by different processes during the rising flood and recession periods of streamflow during the recession period the contributions of groundwater discharge and bank storage into the flow of the river are more dominant while the surface runoff contribution is more dominant during the rising phase of streamflow during rainy season the high streamflows were characterized by relatively high turbidity low electrical conductivities low salinity and low tds during high streamflows the river water was very turbid 1000 ntu with high tssc 0 5 g l indicating high concentration of colloidal clay particles the high concentration of colloidal particles reduces the ability of water to conduct electricity hence the relatively low electrical conductivities measured during high flows during low flows the river turbidity was relatively low cf kitheka 2017c thus the variations of salinity tds and electrical conductivity were inversely related to water turbidity the salinity and electrical conductivity levels were high during periods of low streamflow when water turbidity was relatively low the same parameters were low during periods of high streamflow when river water turbidity was high these results show that the river water has relatively great ability to conduct electrical current during low streamflow conditions when the level of total dissolved solids tds is high and the level of non conducting materials e g clay particles is low during high streamflow conditions the opposite occurs the presence of large quantity of non conductance materials reduces the electrical conductivity in water kitheka 2017c in this study turbidity was also used to provide an indication on the source of water in the river whether this is from surface runoff or from groundwater aquifer the low turbidity was associated with low streamflow conditions which are basically derived from groundwater aquifers on the other hand high turbidity levels during high streamflows were associated with rapid surface runoff that usually have little time for dissolving salts in rocks through which it flows this partly explains the low salinity levels during high streamflow conditions since most of the water is associated with surface runoff 3 3 seasonal variations of salinity versus streamflow there is a significant seasonal and inter annual variations in salinity in the athi river based on the measurements that were made in the period between 2012 and 2015 fig 5 presents time series data on the variations of streamflow and salinity in the athi river in the period between january 2012 and may 2015 the highest salinity and tds occurs during the relatively dry seasons with low streamflow conditions during this period the maximum salinity and tds occurred at the end of the recession period just before the onset of rainy season the relatively low salinity and tds occurred in rainy seasons during high flow conditions in the period between 2012 and 2015 there was a progressive increase in salinity and tds particularly in the period 2013 2014 due to the progressive decrease in streamflow fig 5 the fact that during dry season the river receives contributions from wastewaters and groundwater aquifers in the basin means that the salinity of the river during low flow conditions was due to the influx of wastewaters and subterranean water from the surrounding groundwater aquifers in this respect it could be argued that salinity observed in the river during low flow conditions was partly derived from the geological formations through which the groundwater flows before it emerges in the river channel partly through discharge of wastewaters from major urban centres such as nairobi therefore progressive increase in salinity of the river water during low flow conditions may affect the use of water for irrigation and for domestic purposes during dry season when the water requirements are at their optimum table 1 shows the range of various river discharge salinity electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids tds concentrations that were measured in the athi river in the period between 2012 and 2018 river discharge ranged from 0 15 m3 s to 791 m3 s the salinity ranged from 0 3 to 4 1 while electrical conductivity varied from 148 8 to 1400 μs cm the concentration of the total dissolved solids tds varied from 74 5 mg l to 1200 mg l these results show that there is a relatively wide variation in the levels of physico chemical parameters in the athi river this could be attributed to the fact that the main sources of salinity groundwater aquifers irrigation return flows and wastewaters contributes differently as streamflow varies on seasonal basis the mean values for salinity electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids tds concentrations in the river were 0 81 439 5 μs cm and 225 2 mg l respectively these are well within world health organisation who standards the exception is during extremely low streamflow conditions when the levels are well above the who standards for drinking water who 2006 2008 this means in as far as salinity is concerned the water quality of the athi river declines during drought conditions when the streamflow becomes critically low during this period the use of water for irrigation tends to affect plant growth and productivity as confirmed by various farmers operating in the basin situation is particularly worse for crops that cannot tolerate high levels of salinity such as beans use of high salinity water for irrigation also progressively degrades the soil quality by leading to sodification and salinisation of soil in irrigated land see also kathuli et al 2013 situation improves immediately the streamflow increases above 50m3 s due to dilution effect associated with high surface runoff and subsequent flushing of salt in the river by increased streamflow salinisation is partly attributed to low rainfall and high evaporation rates in the basin cf sijali et al 2003 gok 2004 kathuli et al 2013 3 4 seasonal and inter annual variations of salt fluxes there is a significant relationship between streamflow variations and variations of salt flux in the athi river fig 8 shows the variations of streamflow and salt flux at wamunyu near wamunyu in the period 2012 and 2015 the highest salt fluxes occur during high streamflows and the lowest occurs during low flows this is attributed to the fact that it is the volume of water or streamflow that determines the quantity of salt transported by the river thus despite the fact that the highest tds occurs during low streamflow conditions and lowest occur during periods of high streamflow the highest salt fluxes occurs during high streamflow conditions there are also significant inter annual variation in salt fluxes that are related to the variations in streamflow as is also evident in fig 8 the highest salt flux occurred in 2012 while the lowest occurred in 2014 the mean salt fluxes in the period between 2012 and 2014 ranged between 646 200 kg month and 3 414 963 kg month indicating wide variations in salt fluxes tables 2 4 for the entire period of study 2012 2015 the mean salt flux was 2 473 778 kg month this is equivalent to 29 69 106 kg year or 29 68 103 tons per year these results show that the athi river transports a significant quantity of dissolved salt to the indian ocean it is important to note that the mean salt fluxes in the athi river are much lower than those measured in typical seasonal rivers e g tiva in eastern kenya which ranges between 100 103 and 270 103 tons year kitheka 2017a b c when you can consider maximum salt fluxes athi river fluxes are upto 10 times lower than those of the tiva river this could be attributed to the fact that the tiva river basin occurs predominantly within a relatively dry and arid region as compared to the athi river whose main catchment area also traverses a large segment which is humid 3 5 contribution of sub basins to salt fluxes the athi river receives flow contributions from several tributaries draining the upper parts of the basin fig 1 these include mbagathi stony athi nairobi ruiru and ndarugu rivers an attempt was made in this study to determine the contribution of these tributaries to the total streamflow and salt fluxes of the main athi river this was attempted by measuring salinity tds and river discharges at the outlets of the main sub basins followed by computation of salt fluxes the results are shown in tables 6 and 7 from these results it was observed that athi river stony athi river and nairobi river contributes the highest salt fluxes fig 9 the relatively low salt fluxes were measured at ruiru ndarugu and thwake rivers that drains mainly rural areas dominated by agricultural landuse practises the rivers with relatively high salt fluxes are those that drain though the urban environment particularly the expansive city of nairobi and nearby athi river kitengela towns the total maximum freshwater volume and maximum salt flux for all tributaries in the upper athi river basin were 26 995 597 kg month and 172 815 616 m3 month respectively these were found to be relatively higher than the maximum salt flux and maximum freshwater flux computed for the river downstream at wamunyu rgs near wamunyu the difference in the maximum salt flux and freshwater flux were 5 244 110 kg month and 33 644 170 m3 month i e 12 m3 s respectively these difference were attributed to the diversion of river water for irrigation trapping of water in weirs overbank flow in flood plains and possible river discharge measurement errors 4 discussions 4 1 sources of salinity and the influence of streamflow variability the results of this study show that there are significant seasonal variations of the levels of the river water salinity and total dissolved solids in the upper athi river basin in kenya while the levels of salinity in the river water are less than 2 psu and river water can therefore be considered to be largely freshwater the concentration of dissolved salts in river water is significant to the extent of having adverse impacts of various uses of water the highest levels of salinity occurs during periods of low river discharges in dry seasons of the year this was attributed to several factors that include the flow of subterranean water into the river from the groundwater aquifers extending into the basement complex the flow of highly polluted water from streams draining through urban centres such as the nairobi and entry of irrigation return flows from numerous small scale irrigation farms scattered along the river bank both these factors seem to be important in the basin and attempt was made to determine their possible role in determining the levels of salinity and tds in the river the discharge of highly polluted water from the city of nairobi is considered important in view of large volume of wastewater that enters the athi river through nairobi river kithiia 1992 dulo 2008 kithiia 2006 kithiia and mutua 2006 during high flows in rainy seasons the contaminated wastewater in the river is flushed downstream however there is trapping of contaminated wastewater in some sections of the river channel due to relatively low flow velocities experienced during low flow conditions the degree of flushing is a function of the river discharge and volume of wastewater within the river channel the high flows that are characterized by high flow velocities leads to rapid flushing of wastewater trapped in the river explaining the progressive decrease in the levels of tds and salinity as the river discharge increases in wet season during low flows the river has relatively high proportion of polluted water associated with the discharge of wastewaters industrial effluents and sewage that are characterized by high tds salinity and electrical conductivity levels see also kithiia 1992 dulo 2008 kithiia 2006 kithiia and mutua 2006 the flow groundwater from the surrounding aquifer into river channel during low flow conditions is also considered important in increasing the levels of salinity tds and electrical conductivity in the athi river cf kumarswamy 1991 dembere et al 1998 radiro et al 2003 kitheka 2017c the athi river basin traverses the basement complex system whose rocks are characterized by high salt content e g kankur limestone the groundwater found in this system is therefore saline and its flow into the river channel during low flow periods causes a significant increase in salinity and tds in the river water during this period the level of ionic compounds in water is high explaining high electrical conductivity levels waziri and ogugbuaja 2012 radiro et al 2003 kitheka 2017c it is important to note that during high flows the river water tends to flow into the adjacent groundwater aquifers particularly in sections of the river where permeable formations allow rapid flow into adjacent groundwater aquifers this flow is facilitated by the existence of favourable hydraulic gradient during high flows that facilitate movement of water from the river channel to the groundwater aquifers as the water level in the river declines during the recession period the favourable hydraulic gradient leads to the flow of saline groundwater from the aquifer to the river channel radiro et al 2003 kitheka 2017c this flow reaches its maximum during the lowest water level in the river channel when the hydraulic gradient is at its maximum there is also a possibility that the relatively high values of salinity and tds observed during low flow conditions in the athi river are due to irrigation return flows and high evaporation rates in irrigation fields along the river are found numerous irrigation farms that are supplied with water from the river the high evaporation rates in irrigation fields in dry season ranges 1500 1600 mm yr 1 and these have the tendency of concentrating salts in irrigated soils as freshwater is lost from the soil irrigation also increases salt concentration of the source water by consuming water through evapotranspiration and by dissolving salts in the underlying soil and geologic formations u s department of the interior 2011 lasage et al 2008 kitheka 2017c this leads to high salinity levels in irrigation return flows the results of the study showed that there is a significant difference in the levels of salinity in the main sub basins of the athi river this could be attributed to the nature of the drainage basin geology soils topography vegetation cover basin size as well as landuse practices it was observed that rivers with only 1st and 2nd order streams and short slope lengths experienced rapid flow response in such streams surface runoff generated by rainfall storms reaches the main river channel quickly and hence there is little time to dissolve soil and rock mineral salts this explains the low salt production rates in the stony athi sub basin that ranged between 3 74 and 7 36 tons m 2 yr 1 however in the main athi river which is a 3rd order stream receiving flow with relatively gentle slope and longer slope lengths there is greater infiltration of surface runoff enabling basement complex rock minerals to dissolve in water this water contains high levels of dissolved minerals flows into the main river channel as water level reduces in the channel culminating in highest seepage when water level in the river channel is at its lowest this explains the prevalence of high salinity and tds concentrations during periods of low flow in the river channel during low flows tds and salinity concentrations were well above 1000 mg l 1 which is the limit for drinking water who 2008 water with high tds and salinity concentrations can lead to progressive salinisation of the soil see also kathuli et al 2013 radiro et al 2003 kitheka 2017c however the maximum tds concentrations in the river are still lower than 2000 mg l 1 above which production of laxative effect as a result of the presence of magnesium and sodium sulphate is expected kumarswamy 1991 dembere et al 1998 therefore the high tds and salinity levels in athi river affects irrigation activities in dry season when irrigation of crops is most critical as compared to other river systems the levels of salinity tds and electrical conductivity in the athi river are quite high the electrical conductivity ranged from148 8 to 1400 μs cm 1 with mean of 439 5 μs cm 1 the conductivity levels were generally much higher than ranges of 83 to 204 μs cm 1 std of 45μs cm 1 reported by waziri and ogugbuaja 2010 2012 in yobe river in nigeria a study in polluted thome river in nairobi reported conductivity ranging between 160 and 496 μs cm 1 karanja et al 2015 which is also relatively lower than that recorded in the athi river the tds in the athi river ranged from 74 5 to 1200 mg l with a mean of 225 mg l the maximum tds levels were also relatively high as compared to other river basins in kenya in most cases the maximum electrical conductivity and tds concentrations were higher than the maximum permissible drinking water electrical conductivity and tds of 150 μs cm 1 and 500 mg l 1 respectively who 2008 the mean conductivity salinity and tds of athi river is however much lower than that of mwitasyano river which was reported in a different study to be 727 7μs cm 1 1 1 and 364 mg l 1 kitheka 2017a c the salinity in the athi river waters could be due to high levels of sulphates and chlorides and not sodium cf kathuli et al 2013 4 2 influence of streamflow on salinity variations the relationship between streamflow variations and variations of salinity and tds in the athi river was mainly non linear indicating existence of complex relationships between these variables cf williams 1966 kitheka 2017c during high flow conditions the river has high concentration of non conducting clays and silt materials that imparts high turbidity in water but lowers electrical conductivity cf waziri and ogugbuaja 2012 centeno et al 2006 waziri and ogugbuaja 2010 the seasonal variations of the concentrations of these matters which is a function of streamflow and rainfall in the basin explains seasonal variability in salinity tds and electrical conductivity observed in the athi river cf koning and ross 1999 4 3 salt fluxes in main river and sub basins the mean salt discharge for the athi river was found to be 29 64 103 tons year 1 see also tables 3 5 given that the total surface area of the basin is 69 930 km2 and the surface area in the upper region of the basin where this study was concentrated is about 10 276 km2 the mean salt production in the basin is 2 88 tons km 2 yr 1 measurements undertaken during the period of this study showed that the maximum streamflow is 129 84 106 m3 month 1 with a corresponding tds concentration of 537 mg l 1 using this data the maximum salt flux in the basin was estimated to be 261 103 tons year 1 thus it can safely be argued that salt flux in the upper region of the athi river ranges between 29 103 and 261 103 tons year 1 this flux is much higher than average salt flux of 8 8 106 tons yr 1 reported for colorado river system in united states u s department of the interior 2011 however the rate of salt flux in the upper athi river basin is much lower than that measured in the tiva river basin in eastern kenya kitheka 2017a c the determination of salt fluxes from the main sub basins of the athi river showed that the main contributors of dissolved salts into the main athi river are the nairobi river mbagathi river and stony athi river fig 9 these sub basins drains through the city of nairobi and nearby towns with the implication that as the stream flows through these urban areas the salinity and tds levels increases considerably this increase was attributed to the fact that rivers draining the city of nairobi and nearby towns receives large volume of wastewater sewage and industrial effluents that are characterized by high salinity and tds levels cf kithiia 1992 2006 kithiia and mutua 2006 dulo 2008 in tributaries of the athi river that drains rural sub basins where rainfed agriculture is the main landuse activity e g ruiru ndarugu rivers salt fluxes were relatively low considering the entire athi river basin as whole it can be argued that the relatively high salt fluxes in the basin can be attributed to relatively lower stream discharge rates and extensive irrigation activities in the basin during dry seasons irrigation is practiced in the upper athi river basin at thika for pineapple and coffee growing and there are also numerous small scale irrigation farms along the river channel the irrigation return flows from these irrigation farms usually enters the river during dry season due to prevailing hydraulic gradient 4 4 effects of salinity on water supplies and irrigation the high levels of salinity in the upper athi river basin has implication on irrigation agriculture and water supply projects the increased concentration of salinityand tds imparts objectionable taste to water and this limit the use of water for various uses cf kumarswamy 1991 dembere et al 1998 jain 1998 also the use of river water for irrigation during low flow conditions can increase salinisation and sodicity of soil and eventually affect the growth of crops cf sijali et al 2003 gok 2004 kathuli et al 2013 continued use of relatively saline water for irrigation can eventually turn arable land into wastelands due to salinisation as has been reported elsewhere in kenya sijali et al 2003 high levels of salinity can also cause corrosion of water supply pipes and fixtures u s department of the interior 2011 this can make rural water supply projects unsustainable on long term basis due to high maintenance costs construction of large dams in the athi river basin can hydrologically modify the flow of the river and hence significantly reduce salinity levels in the downstream areas see also u s department of the interior 2011 therefore the construction of thwake dam downstream in upper athi basin is therefore expected to have significant impact on salinity levels of the river increased water volume in the reservoir would significantly reduce the levels of river water salinity this could be advantageous since one of the planned uses of water from the reservoir is irrigation however there is also a possibility of increased salinity levels downstream of the dam due to reduction of streamflow particularly during the filling stage of the reservoir when downstream flow would be significantly reduced in this respect the dam operation rules should allow for the discharge of at least 50 m3 s of water daily to dilute the salinity levels downstream of the dam this will safeguard the use of river water in downstream areas up to the coast there is also a need to control irrigation practices and land degradation in the athi river basin this should be done in conjunction with activities aimed at controlling the discharge of wastewaters sewage and industrial effluents into the nairobi river which is the main contributor of polluted water with high salinity tds and conductivity levels into the athi river kithiia 1992 2006 kithiia and mutua 2006 dulo 2008 5 conclusions this study shows that there is a significant seasonal variation of salinity and tds concentrations in the athi river basin in kenya during wet seasons april june and november december the river experiences relatively low levels of salinity and tds this was attributed to the flushing dissolved salts due to increased river discharge during dry seasons january march and july october the river experiences relatively high levels of salinity and tds the salinity and tds levels progressively increases during dry season and reduces rapidly during periods of high river discharge above 50 m3s 1 in rainy season the study also established that the river transports relatively large volume of dissolved salts that range between 29 103 and 261 103 tons year 1 the sub basins that contributes large volume of dissolved salts into the main athi river include mbagathi stony athi and nairobi rivers the relatively high salt fluxes in the river were attributed to the discharge of wastewaters into the river seepage of groundwater from saline basement complex rocks and entry of irrigation return flows from numerous irrigation farms in the basin in order to ensure salinity and tds levels do not increase beyond maximum permissible level this study calls for promotion of sustainable irrigation practices and control of land degradation in the basin particularly extensive clearance of vegetation to open land for agriculture and settlement in the basin there is also a need to control the discharge of wastewaters into the tributaries of the river that drains through urban areas such as in nairobi and athi river towns the construction of water storage reservoirs in the basin can help in controlling progressive increases in salinity in the river however care must be exercised so that dam construction does not lead to major reduction in streamflow as this can lead to major increases in salinity downstream there is a also a need for studies to determine the extent to which increasing sainity in the river is affecting irrigation agriculture and water supply projects in the basin funding the author received no financial support for the research authorship and or

8436,study region this study was undertaken in the athi sabaki river basin in kenya in east africa study focus the study focused on the determination of the influence of streamflow variability on salt fluxes this involved monitoring of river discharge and river salinity in the period between 2012 and 2018 new hydrological insights this study demonstrates that athi sabaki river discharges significant quantity of salt to the sea there are significant seasonal and inter annual variations in salt fluxes that are due to variations in river discharge and rainfall in the basin the relationship between streamflow variations and variations of salinity in the river was inverse with highest salinity concentrations and fluxes occurring during low flow conditions the river salinity and tds concentrations decreased with an increase in river discharge due to dilution effect and flushing of salt from the river the highly polluted sub basins draining through the city of nairobi exhibited relatively higher salinity and salt fluxes as compared to non polluted ones draining rural areas the total salt flux in the basin ranged between 29 103 and 261 103 tons year 1 the relatively high salinity and salt fluxes were attributed to the discharge of wastewaters seepage of groundwater and irrigation return flows the study calls for water pollution control sustainable irrigation and landuse practices in the basin keywords athi sabaki river streamflow variations salinity variations water pollution salt fluxes kenya 1 introduction the discharge of salt from rivers is the main source of salinity in world oceans and lakes salt may enter into a river through seepage of water from geological formations that contain salt or may enter through seepage of water from salinised agricultural fields the later is mainly due to inappropriate irrigation practices and high rates of evaporation in irrigation fields cf sijali et al 2003 radiro et al 2003 however despite this fact there is scarcity of data and information on the salt discharges by rivers of the world most studies of salt fluxes have mainly focused on estuaries deltas and bays and other coastal systems kaluarachchi et al 2003 zhu et al 2012 soltanias et al 2013 aristizábal and chant 2013 devkota and fang 2015 salt fluxes in estuaries and bays are controlled by physical oceanographic processes that are different from the hydrologic processes that control salt fluxes in rivers the past hydrologic research has only paid a casual attention to the discharge of salt fluxes in tropical river systems in africa and the world all over there is thus scarcity of data on the dynamics of salt discharge in rivers there has also been limited attempt to determine the contribution of african tropical rivers in terms of global salt fluxes kitheka 2017a b c this is due to the fact that most of the hydrological studies on african rivers have focused on water pollution soil erosion sediment and nutrient fluxes see kithia 1997 kithiia 1992 2006 kithiia and mutua 2006 sigleo and frick 2015 ohowa et al 1997 mahananda 2010 massdam and smith 1994 kawabata et al 2012 the study of salt fluxes in rivers has been given a wide berth this is despite the fact that transport of salt by the rivers has major implication on the extent to which river water can be used for agricultural production including urban and rural water supply and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems increased variability of streamflow in tropical river basin due to climate change is expected to lead to increased salinity levels and salt fluxes in rivers kitheka 2017a b c the increased frequency of droughts in africa can lead to an increase in the levels of salinity in water where the frequency of occurrence of flood conditions increases it is expected the capacity of the rivers to transport salt would be increased leading to greater flashing of salt in tropical rivers kitheka 2017a b c however there is limited data to demonstrate these relationships particularly that between salt transport and streamflow variability in tropical river systems of africa the study of salt fluxes in river basins is important because salt in water is an important constituent in water that has major implication in agriculture water supply and sustainability of ecosystems high levels of salinity in water can render water unsuitable for irrigation agriculture this is due to the fact that majority of the irrigated crops cannot tolerate high levels of salinity in water the variability of salinity levels in river water used for irrigation can therefore have major implication on crop production and in some cases can lead to collapse of irrigation projects this can have major socio economic implications to communities who are depended on these irrigation projects in terms of water supply high salinity in water can make water unpalatable with objectionable taste to most people this may limit the extent to which water can be used for various domestic purposes in some cases water supply projects can be rendered unsustainable due to high levels of salinity in water that causes corrosion of pipes and damages pipe fixtures u s department of the interior 2011 this can escalate operational and maintenance costs to urban and rural water supply schemes see also lasage et al 2008 despite all the major effects that salinity levels in river water can have on agriculture water supply public health and ecosystems there are still few studies on salt fluxes in tropical african river systems cf puttemans 2004 kitheka 2017c data on the relationship between streamflow salinity and salt fluxes in tropical river systems is therefore required to advice on the water resources and agricultural development programmes this is becoming important as a result of continuing heavy investments in irrigation and water supply projects in africa kitheka 2017c the main goal of this study was therefore to determine i the extent to which salinity in a tropical river is influenced by streamflow variability and ii establish the typical patterns of salt fluxes in the river in this study this was achieved through measurement of river discharges salinity total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity followed by computation of salt fluxes in the main river as well as in the sub basins of the river the study was undertaken in the athi river basin which is one of the largest river basin in kenya with perennial river discharge fig 1 the river basin receives highly erratic and seasonal rainfall which causes highly variable streamflow that is one of the major factors limiting water supply projects public health agricultural production food security and socio economic development in counties found in eastern kenya the river and its tributaries has been the main source of water for various purpose including domestic industrial irrigation and municipal uses in the recent past a lot of financial resources have been directed towards water resources development projects in arid and semi arid lands cf prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 beimers et al 2001a b burger et al 2003 munyao et al 2004 puttemans 2004 borst and de haas 2006 lasage et al 2008 kitheka 2017c however there has been little consideration of water quality issues in these projects and levels of salinity in river water are never taken into account when planning for water supply and agricultural development projects in the basin assessment of salinity levels in the river is therefore important as it can provide information on the viability and sustainability of water and agricultural development projects in arid and semi arid lands of the basin studies of this nature are also important in safeguarding public health sustaining aquatic ecosystems protecting fragile semi arid lands soils from salinisation enhancing water security and promoting socio economic development of marginalized communities 1 1 study area athi river drainage basin is the fourth largest drainage system in kenya fig 1 the basin has a total surface area of 69 930 km2 however the surface area in the upper region of the basin where this study was concentrated is about 10 276 km2 the basin extents all the way to the indian ocean coast to the main catchment areas situated in the central kenya highlands particularly in the kikuyu escarpment aberdares ranges and ngong hills the river also receives flows from seasonal rivers draining hills found in the foreland plateau of eastern kenya such as mbooni hills nzaui hills kiima kiu muumandu hills kilungu hills and iuani hills the highly polluted nairobi river contributes water to the athi river in its upper course that drains through the city of nairobi the capital of kenya other tributaries of the river in the upper parts of the basin include stony athi mbagathi ruiru and ndarugu rivers see fig 1 the basin experiences two rainfall seasons that are influenced by the convergence of the southeast and northeast monsoons in the inter tropical convergence zone cf ojany and ogendo 1986 the southeast monsoon sem occurs between mid march and mid september while the northeast monsoon nem occurs between october and early march rainfall in the upper parts of the basin ranges from 1000 to 1200 mm yr 1 however in the lower regions rainfall is much lower ranging between 500 and 750 mm yr 1 along the coast rainfall ranges between 750 and 1000 mm yr 1 however there are often large inter annual variations in rainfall partly due to el nino and la nina southern oscillation phenomena air temperature shows significant regional variability in the basin in the central kenya highlands where the river originates from temperature ranges between 18 c and 28 c in the semi arid middle region of the basin temperature range between 20 c and 32 c cf ojany and ogendo 1986 evaporation rates in the basin range between 1200 and 1500 mm yr 1 in the central kenya highlands however in the semi arid lower region of the basin evaporation rates are of the order 1800 mm yr 1 which is higher than the annual rainfall ojany and ogendo 1986 this implies that there is a water deficit in the basin during dry periods of the year the geology of the upper region of the basin is characterized by the basement complex rocks volcanic rocks phonolites of kapiti plains and yatta plateau and aruphibolites athi basin upstream the middle region of the basin is underlain by banded gneisses and granitoid gneisses nyamai et al 2003 prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 along the lower parts of the basin all the way to the coast are found triassic rocks the soils are generally deep sandy alluvium and red sandy soils in addition to patches of black cotton soils and murram soils in the basin contain little organic matter and hence have low fertility prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 the upper part of the basin in the kenya highlands is characterized by high population densities 200 300 persons km2 and intensive cultivation of land major crops grown here include various horticultural crops tea and coffee while remnants of once luxurious and expansive forests on hills still remain in the highlands there has been extensive clearance of forests for agriculture and settlements the waters of the river have not been harnessed for hydropower and only small scale irrigation is practiced on its flood plains however the construction of a mega dam thwake dam in the middle upper region of the basin is currently ongoing the dam will be 77 m high above the lowest elevation of the river bed with a crest elevation of 912 m above sea level prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 the dam is expected to store water for flood control irrigation hydropower generation and urban rural water supplies prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 and will also have major impacts along the coast kitheka 2013 2014 2 methodology 2 1 streamflow measurements streamflow measurements were undertaken at one monitoring station located at the main athi river at wamunyi and at five 5 sampling stations located at the main tributaries of the athi river namely mbagathi stony athi nairobi ruiru and ndarugu rivers fig 1 a concerted monitoring campaign was undertaken from january 2012 to july 2018 the measurement of river discharges was undertaken through measurement of flow velocities and determination of cross sectional area of river channel see also linsley et al 1988 chapman 1996 batram and balance 1996 kitheka 2017c the frequency of measurements was monthly during dry seasons when there was no major change in streamflow and daily during rainy season when river discharges changed rapidly attempt was made to determine the relationship between river discharge and salinity conductivity and tds in each of the sampling stations using regression and correlation analysis the data on river discharges together with data on salinity and tds were used to determine salt flux rates within the main river and also in the sub basins contributing flow to the main athi river see also kitheka 2017c 2 2 measurement of physico chemical parameters salinity total dissolved solids concentration tds and electrical conductivity were measured insitu using martini instruments mi306 ec tds salinity meter measurements of these parameters were undertaken in sampling stations where river discharge measurements were also undertaken the measurements of these parameters were undertaken at the middle of the river channel by lowering the probe into the water up to the mid water depth the probe was left into the water for about 5 min for the reading to stablise after which the reading was recorded in a field notebook the martini instruments mi306 ec tds salinity meter used in this study had a salinity range of 0 40 psu and an accuracy of 0 1psu the tds and electrical conductivity ranges were 0 1000 μs cm and 0 1000 mg l respectively see also kitheka 2017c according to the instruments user manual the tds and salinity were derived from conductivity and sodium chloride nacl respectively because water turbidity can influence the level of salinity we also measured turbidity of the river water using hanna instruments hi93703 microprocessor turbidity range 0 1000ftu during rainy season the frequency of sampling and measurement of these parameters was daily in order to capture the levels of these parameters during the period of highly variable streamflow during the dry seasons sampling of the physico chemical parameters was undertaken once every month as the streamflow did not change frequently 2 3 analysis of hydrologic data the data obtained from the sampling stations were subjected to statistical analyses methods such regression and correlation analysis these analyses were performed to establish whether there is a significant relationship between streamflow variations and variations in salinity conductivity and tds within the main river an attempt was made to determine the relationship between river discharge and salinity and also between river discharge and tds during the rising limb and recession limb of the streamflow hydrograph respectively this was done by separately carrying regression analysis of data for the rising and recession periods these data were then plotted separately as scatter graphs and the best regression curve was fitted based on the highest value of the coefficient of determination r2 that was derived for the relationships these analyses provided insights on the patterns of variability of salinity and tds during the period when river discharge was rising and when it was receding 2 4 determination of salt fluxes the computation of salt fluxes in the main branch of the athi river as well as in the main sub basins were based on the data on river discharge salinity and the total dissolved salts tds measurements that were undertaken using martini instruments mi306 ec tds salinity meter to allow for accurate determination of salt fluxes the measurements on river discharges and tds salinity were undertaken simultaneously in the established monitoring stations the mean monthly tds concentrations c was computed according to the following eq 1 1 c i 1 n c i n in the above equation c is the mean monthly tds concentration and ci is the monthly tds concentration the mean river discharge q was computed using eq 2 shown below 2 q i 1 n q i n in the above equation q is the mean monthly river discharge m3 s and qi is the monthly river discharge m3 month the mean monthly salt fluxes were computed using eq 3 as show below 3 s f i 1 n q c in the above equation sf is the mean monthly salt flux kg month c is the mean tds concentration and q is the mean river discharge the monthly salt fluxes sf were extrapolated to obtain the annual salt fluxes for the main river as well as for the tributaries draining from the sub basins cf also chapman 1996 in total 93 continuous monthly measurements of river discharges tds salinity and conductivity undertaken in the main branch of the river in the period between january 2012 and april 2018 were used to determine the salt fluxes in the upper athi river basin however in the tributaries only spot measurements were undertaken in dry and wet seasons to obtain insight on the magnitude of variability of streamflow and salt fluxes from the mbagathi ruiru stony athi ndarugu and nairobi river sub basins 3 results 3 1 hydrology and streamflow patterns athi river experiences significant seasonal variations in river discharges due to seasonal variation of rainfall in the basin fig 2 shows the variation of river discharges in the river at wamunyu river gauging station in the period between 2012 and 2015 the highest river discharges were measured in the period between april and may during the long rainy season and november december during the short rains the lowest river discharges occurred during the dry season months of july august and january march of each of the three years monitored in this study the long rainy season received relatively much higher streamflows as compared to the short rainy season whose high streamflows were relatively lower the maximum streamflows during the long rainy season ranged between 350 and 500 m3 s while those experienced during the short rainy season ranged between 50 and 150 m3 s there is also a significant inter annual variations in streamflow the years 2012 and 2013 experienced relatively higher river discharges as compared to the years 2014 and 2015 there is in fact a declining trend in river discharges in the period between 2012 and 2015 while the mean maximum river discharges ranged 350 500 m3 s in the years 2012 and 2013 these declined to the range of 100 150 m3 s in the years 2014 and 2015 the analysis of streamflow hydrograph of the river showed that river discharge is characterized by steep rising limb and steep recession limb with a relatively long recession period fig 2 the rising limb is from march to may while the recession limb is from may to october during the long rainy season during this period the flow recession lasts for almost 6 months during the short rainy season the rising limb is in the period october november while the flow recession limb is in the period november march during the short rainy season the flow recession lasts for 5 months and during this period the streamflow continues to decline up to the beginning of the next rainy season both the rising limb and recession limb were steep indicating the erratic and seasonal nature of flow from a catchment area that has been disturbed due various inappropriate landuse practices including urbanization and agriculture the results of this study also showed that the flow in the athi river is flashy type synonymous with rapid generation of surface runoff in the degraded catchment area during the rainy season the long flow recession period is an indication of discharge of water from the bank storage and groundwater aquifers the examination of flow duration curve showed that 95 of the flows are usually less than 3 m3 s and high flows 350m3 s occur in less than 5 of the time the low flows are therefore more frequent as compared to high streamflows the high frequency of occurrence of low streamflows also shows that the basin responds quite rapidly to rainfall input as evidenced by the steep rising limbs and recession limbs in the flow hydrograph this is typical of rivers flowing from degraded river basins in arid and semi arid lands 3 2 influence of streamflow variability on salinity and tds there is a significant relationship between river discharge and salinity in river athi fig 3 shows the extent to which the variations of river discharge influences salinity in the athi river based on the monitoring of these parameters at wamunyu rgs in the period between january 2012 and june 2018 the relationship between river discharge and salinity yielded a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 69 which is significant at 95 confidence level p 0 05 the correlation coefficient r for the relationship between streamflow and salinity was 0 83 indicating the existence of a strong positive relationship between the two parameters the relationship was best represented by an exponential equation as this yielded the best coefficient of determination r2 fig 4 shows the relationship between river discharge and both salinity and tds the relationships were also exponential with r2 value of the order 0 68 as shown in bith figs 3 and 4 the salinity was highest during periods of low streamflows 50m3 s and was lowest during medium and high streamflows 100m3 s there is an exponential decrease in salinity and tds as the streamflow increases this exponential decreasewas attributed to the dilution effect of high volume of freshwater during high streamflow conditions as was also established in the tiva river in a similar study kitheka 2017c attempt was made to establish whether there is a significant difference in the relationship between river discharge and either tds or salinity during the recession and rising flood limp periods figs 6 and 7 during the rising or flood phase and recession phase the relationship between river discharge and either salinity and tds were found to be mainly exponential there are however pertinent differences in terms of the statistical significance of these exponential relationships during the recession period the relationship between river discharge and salinity was characterized by a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 78 while during the rising limp or flood period the r2 was 0 54 also during the recession period the relationship between river discharge and tds was characterized by a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 75 while during the rising limp or flood period the r2 was 0 50 during the recession period both relationships were best represented by a power function of the form salrecess 0 17q 0 27 and tdsrecess 451 9q 0 25 during the rising or flood period the relationships were best represented by a power function of the form salflood 0 355q 0 54 and tdsflood 785 9q 0 29 these results imply that salinity variations in the river are driven by different processes during the rising flood and recession periods of streamflow during the recession period the contributions of groundwater discharge and bank storage into the flow of the river are more dominant while the surface runoff contribution is more dominant during the rising phase of streamflow during rainy season the high streamflows were characterized by relatively high turbidity low electrical conductivities low salinity and low tds during high streamflows the river water was very turbid 1000 ntu with high tssc 0 5 g l indicating high concentration of colloidal clay particles the high concentration of colloidal particles reduces the ability of water to conduct electricity hence the relatively low electrical conductivities measured during high flows during low flows the river turbidity was relatively low cf kitheka 2017c thus the variations of salinity tds and electrical conductivity were inversely related to water turbidity the salinity and electrical conductivity levels were high during periods of low streamflow when water turbidity was relatively low the same parameters were low during periods of high streamflow when river water turbidity was high these results show that the river water has relatively great ability to conduct electrical current during low streamflow conditions when the level of total dissolved solids tds is high and the level of non conducting materials e g clay particles is low during high streamflow conditions the opposite occurs the presence of large quantity of non conductance materials reduces the electrical conductivity in water kitheka 2017c in this study turbidity was also used to provide an indication on the source of water in the river whether this is from surface runoff or from groundwater aquifer the low turbidity was associated with low streamflow conditions which are basically derived from groundwater aquifers on the other hand high turbidity levels during high streamflows were associated with rapid surface runoff that usually have little time for dissolving salts in rocks through which it flows this partly explains the low salinity levels during high streamflow conditions since most of the water is associated with surface runoff 3 3 seasonal variations of salinity versus streamflow there is a significant seasonal and inter annual variations in salinity in the athi river based on the measurements that were made in the period between 2012 and 2015 fig 5 presents time series data on the variations of streamflow and salinity in the athi river in the period between january 2012 and may 2015 the highest salinity and tds occurs during the relatively dry seasons with low streamflow conditions during this period the maximum salinity and tds occurred at the end of the recession period just before the onset of rainy season the relatively low salinity and tds occurred in rainy seasons during high flow conditions in the period between 2012 and 2015 there was a progressive increase in salinity and tds particularly in the period 2013 2014 due to the progressive decrease in streamflow fig 5 the fact that during dry season the river receives contributions from wastewaters and groundwater aquifers in the basin means that the salinity of the river during low flow conditions was due to the influx of wastewaters and subterranean water from the surrounding groundwater aquifers in this respect it could be argued that salinity observed in the river during low flow conditions was partly derived from the geological formations through which the groundwater flows before it emerges in the river channel partly through discharge of wastewaters from major urban centres such as nairobi therefore progressive increase in salinity of the river water during low flow conditions may affect the use of water for irrigation and for domestic purposes during dry season when the water requirements are at their optimum table 1 shows the range of various river discharge salinity electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids tds concentrations that were measured in the athi river in the period between 2012 and 2018 river discharge ranged from 0 15 m3 s to 791 m3 s the salinity ranged from 0 3 to 4 1 while electrical conductivity varied from 148 8 to 1400 μs cm the concentration of the total dissolved solids tds varied from 74 5 mg l to 1200 mg l these results show that there is a relatively wide variation in the levels of physico chemical parameters in the athi river this could be attributed to the fact that the main sources of salinity groundwater aquifers irrigation return flows and wastewaters contributes differently as streamflow varies on seasonal basis the mean values for salinity electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids tds concentrations in the river were 0 81 439 5 μs cm and 225 2 mg l respectively these are well within world health organisation who standards the exception is during extremely low streamflow conditions when the levels are well above the who standards for drinking water who 2006 2008 this means in as far as salinity is concerned the water quality of the athi river declines during drought conditions when the streamflow becomes critically low during this period the use of water for irrigation tends to affect plant growth and productivity as confirmed by various farmers operating in the basin situation is particularly worse for crops that cannot tolerate high levels of salinity such as beans use of high salinity water for irrigation also progressively degrades the soil quality by leading to sodification and salinisation of soil in irrigated land see also kathuli et al 2013 situation improves immediately the streamflow increases above 50m3 s due to dilution effect associated with high surface runoff and subsequent flushing of salt in the river by increased streamflow salinisation is partly attributed to low rainfall and high evaporation rates in the basin cf sijali et al 2003 gok 2004 kathuli et al 2013 3 4 seasonal and inter annual variations of salt fluxes there is a significant relationship between streamflow variations and variations of salt flux in the athi river fig 8 shows the variations of streamflow and salt flux at wamunyu near wamunyu in the period 2012 and 2015 the highest salt fluxes occur during high streamflows and the lowest occurs during low flows this is attributed to the fact that it is the volume of water or streamflow that determines the quantity of salt transported by the river thus despite the fact that the highest tds occurs during low streamflow conditions and lowest occur during periods of high streamflow the highest salt fluxes occurs during high streamflow conditions there are also significant inter annual variation in salt fluxes that are related to the variations in streamflow as is also evident in fig 8 the highest salt flux occurred in 2012 while the lowest occurred in 2014 the mean salt fluxes in the period between 2012 and 2014 ranged between 646 200 kg month and 3 414 963 kg month indicating wide variations in salt fluxes tables 2 4 for the entire period of study 2012 2015 the mean salt flux was 2 473 778 kg month this is equivalent to 29 69 106 kg year or 29 68 103 tons per year these results show that the athi river transports a significant quantity of dissolved salt to the indian ocean it is important to note that the mean salt fluxes in the athi river are much lower than those measured in typical seasonal rivers e g tiva in eastern kenya which ranges between 100 103 and 270 103 tons year kitheka 2017a b c when you can consider maximum salt fluxes athi river fluxes are upto 10 times lower than those of the tiva river this could be attributed to the fact that the tiva river basin occurs predominantly within a relatively dry and arid region as compared to the athi river whose main catchment area also traverses a large segment which is humid 3 5 contribution of sub basins to salt fluxes the athi river receives flow contributions from several tributaries draining the upper parts of the basin fig 1 these include mbagathi stony athi nairobi ruiru and ndarugu rivers an attempt was made in this study to determine the contribution of these tributaries to the total streamflow and salt fluxes of the main athi river this was attempted by measuring salinity tds and river discharges at the outlets of the main sub basins followed by computation of salt fluxes the results are shown in tables 6 and 7 from these results it was observed that athi river stony athi river and nairobi river contributes the highest salt fluxes fig 9 the relatively low salt fluxes were measured at ruiru ndarugu and thwake rivers that drains mainly rural areas dominated by agricultural landuse practises the rivers with relatively high salt fluxes are those that drain though the urban environment particularly the expansive city of nairobi and nearby athi river kitengela towns the total maximum freshwater volume and maximum salt flux for all tributaries in the upper athi river basin were 26 995 597 kg month and 172 815 616 m3 month respectively these were found to be relatively higher than the maximum salt flux and maximum freshwater flux computed for the river downstream at wamunyu rgs near wamunyu the difference in the maximum salt flux and freshwater flux were 5 244 110 kg month and 33 644 170 m3 month i e 12 m3 s respectively these difference were attributed to the diversion of river water for irrigation trapping of water in weirs overbank flow in flood plains and possible river discharge measurement errors 4 discussions 4 1 sources of salinity and the influence of streamflow variability the results of this study show that there are significant seasonal variations of the levels of the river water salinity and total dissolved solids in the upper athi river basin in kenya while the levels of salinity in the river water are less than 2 psu and river water can therefore be considered to be largely freshwater the concentration of dissolved salts in river water is significant to the extent of having adverse impacts of various uses of water the highest levels of salinity occurs during periods of low river discharges in dry seasons of the year this was attributed to several factors that include the flow of subterranean water into the river from the groundwater aquifers extending into the basement complex the flow of highly polluted water from streams draining through urban centres such as the nairobi and entry of irrigation return flows from numerous small scale irrigation farms scattered along the river bank both these factors seem to be important in the basin and attempt was made to determine their possible role in determining the levels of salinity and tds in the river the discharge of highly polluted water from the city of nairobi is considered important in view of large volume of wastewater that enters the athi river through nairobi river kithiia 1992 dulo 2008 kithiia 2006 kithiia and mutua 2006 during high flows in rainy seasons the contaminated wastewater in the river is flushed downstream however there is trapping of contaminated wastewater in some sections of the river channel due to relatively low flow velocities experienced during low flow conditions the degree of flushing is a function of the river discharge and volume of wastewater within the river channel the high flows that are characterized by high flow velocities leads to rapid flushing of wastewater trapped in the river explaining the progressive decrease in the levels of tds and salinity as the river discharge increases in wet season during low flows the river has relatively high proportion of polluted water associated with the discharge of wastewaters industrial effluents and sewage that are characterized by high tds salinity and electrical conductivity levels see also kithiia 1992 dulo 2008 kithiia 2006 kithiia and mutua 2006 the flow groundwater from the surrounding aquifer into river channel during low flow conditions is also considered important in increasing the levels of salinity tds and electrical conductivity in the athi river cf kumarswamy 1991 dembere et al 1998 radiro et al 2003 kitheka 2017c the athi river basin traverses the basement complex system whose rocks are characterized by high salt content e g kankur limestone the groundwater found in this system is therefore saline and its flow into the river channel during low flow periods causes a significant increase in salinity and tds in the river water during this period the level of ionic compounds in water is high explaining high electrical conductivity levels waziri and ogugbuaja 2012 radiro et al 2003 kitheka 2017c it is important to note that during high flows the river water tends to flow into the adjacent groundwater aquifers particularly in sections of the river where permeable formations allow rapid flow into adjacent groundwater aquifers this flow is facilitated by the existence of favourable hydraulic gradient during high flows that facilitate movement of water from the river channel to the groundwater aquifers as the water level in the river declines during the recession period the favourable hydraulic gradient leads to the flow of saline groundwater from the aquifer to the river channel radiro et al 2003 kitheka 2017c this flow reaches its maximum during the lowest water level in the river channel when the hydraulic gradient is at its maximum there is also a possibility that the relatively high values of salinity and tds observed during low flow conditions in the athi river are due to irrigation return flows and high evaporation rates in irrigation fields along the river are found numerous irrigation farms that are supplied with water from the river the high evaporation rates in irrigation fields in dry season ranges 1500 1600 mm yr 1 and these have the tendency of concentrating salts in irrigated soils as freshwater is lost from the soil irrigation also increases salt concentration of the source water by consuming water through evapotranspiration and by dissolving salts in the underlying soil and geologic formations u s department of the interior 2011 lasage et al 2008 kitheka 2017c this leads to high salinity levels in irrigation return flows the results of the study showed that there is a significant difference in the levels of salinity in the main sub basins of the athi river this could be attributed to the nature of the drainage basin geology soils topography vegetation cover basin size as well as landuse practices it was observed that rivers with only 1st and 2nd order streams and short slope lengths experienced rapid flow response in such streams surface runoff generated by rainfall storms reaches the main river channel quickly and hence there is little time to dissolve soil and rock mineral salts this explains the low salt production rates in the stony athi sub basin that ranged between 3 74 and 7 36 tons m 2 yr 1 however in the main athi river which is a 3rd order stream receiving flow with relatively gentle slope and longer slope lengths there is greater infiltration of surface runoff enabling basement complex rock minerals to dissolve in water this water contains high levels of dissolved minerals flows into the main river channel as water level reduces in the channel culminating in highest seepage when water level in the river channel is at its lowest this explains the prevalence of high salinity and tds concentrations during periods of low flow in the river channel during low flows tds and salinity concentrations were well above 1000 mg l 1 which is the limit for drinking water who 2008 water with high tds and salinity concentrations can lead to progressive salinisation of the soil see also kathuli et al 2013 radiro et al 2003 kitheka 2017c however the maximum tds concentrations in the river are still lower than 2000 mg l 1 above which production of laxative effect as a result of the presence of magnesium and sodium sulphate is expected kumarswamy 1991 dembere et al 1998 therefore the high tds and salinity levels in athi river affects irrigation activities in dry season when irrigation of crops is most critical as compared to other river systems the levels of salinity tds and electrical conductivity in the athi river are quite high the electrical conductivity ranged from148 8 to 1400 μs cm 1 with mean of 439 5 μs cm 1 the conductivity levels were generally much higher than ranges of 83 to 204 μs cm 1 std of 45μs cm 1 reported by waziri and ogugbuaja 2010 2012 in yobe river in nigeria a study in polluted thome river in nairobi reported conductivity ranging between 160 and 496 μs cm 1 karanja et al 2015 which is also relatively lower than that recorded in the athi river the tds in the athi river ranged from 74 5 to 1200 mg l with a mean of 225 mg l the maximum tds levels were also relatively high as compared to other river basins in kenya in most cases the maximum electrical conductivity and tds concentrations were higher than the maximum permissible drinking water electrical conductivity and tds of 150 μs cm 1 and 500 mg l 1 respectively who 2008 the mean conductivity salinity and tds of athi river is however much lower than that of mwitasyano river which was reported in a different study to be 727 7μs cm 1 1 1 and 364 mg l 1 kitheka 2017a c the salinity in the athi river waters could be due to high levels of sulphates and chlorides and not sodium cf kathuli et al 2013 4 2 influence of streamflow on salinity variations the relationship between streamflow variations and variations of salinity and tds in the athi river was mainly non linear indicating existence of complex relationships between these variables cf williams 1966 kitheka 2017c during high flow conditions the river has high concentration of non conducting clays and silt materials that imparts high turbidity in water but lowers electrical conductivity cf waziri and ogugbuaja 2012 centeno et al 2006 waziri and ogugbuaja 2010 the seasonal variations of the concentrations of these matters which is a function of streamflow and rainfall in the basin explains seasonal variability in salinity tds and electrical conductivity observed in the athi river cf koning and ross 1999 4 3 salt fluxes in main river and sub basins the mean salt discharge for the athi river was found to be 29 64 103 tons year 1 see also tables 3 5 given that the total surface area of the basin is 69 930 km2 and the surface area in the upper region of the basin where this study was concentrated is about 10 276 km2 the mean salt production in the basin is 2 88 tons km 2 yr 1 measurements undertaken during the period of this study showed that the maximum streamflow is 129 84 106 m3 month 1 with a corresponding tds concentration of 537 mg l 1 using this data the maximum salt flux in the basin was estimated to be 261 103 tons year 1 thus it can safely be argued that salt flux in the upper region of the athi river ranges between 29 103 and 261 103 tons year 1 this flux is much higher than average salt flux of 8 8 106 tons yr 1 reported for colorado river system in united states u s department of the interior 2011 however the rate of salt flux in the upper athi river basin is much lower than that measured in the tiva river basin in eastern kenya kitheka 2017a c the determination of salt fluxes from the main sub basins of the athi river showed that the main contributors of dissolved salts into the main athi river are the nairobi river mbagathi river and stony athi river fig 9 these sub basins drains through the city of nairobi and nearby towns with the implication that as the stream flows through these urban areas the salinity and tds levels increases considerably this increase was attributed to the fact that rivers draining the city of nairobi and nearby towns receives large volume of wastewater sewage and industrial effluents that are characterized by high salinity and tds levels cf kithiia 1992 2006 kithiia and mutua 2006 dulo 2008 in tributaries of the athi river that drains rural sub basins where rainfed agriculture is the main landuse activity e g ruiru ndarugu rivers salt fluxes were relatively low considering the entire athi river basin as whole it can be argued that the relatively high salt fluxes in the basin can be attributed to relatively lower stream discharge rates and extensive irrigation activities in the basin during dry seasons irrigation is practiced in the upper athi river basin at thika for pineapple and coffee growing and there are also numerous small scale irrigation farms along the river channel the irrigation return flows from these irrigation farms usually enters the river during dry season due to prevailing hydraulic gradient 4 4 effects of salinity on water supplies and irrigation the high levels of salinity in the upper athi river basin has implication on irrigation agriculture and water supply projects the increased concentration of salinityand tds imparts objectionable taste to water and this limit the use of water for various uses cf kumarswamy 1991 dembere et al 1998 jain 1998 also the use of river water for irrigation during low flow conditions can increase salinisation and sodicity of soil and eventually affect the growth of crops cf sijali et al 2003 gok 2004 kathuli et al 2013 continued use of relatively saline water for irrigation can eventually turn arable land into wastelands due to salinisation as has been reported elsewhere in kenya sijali et al 2003 high levels of salinity can also cause corrosion of water supply pipes and fixtures u s department of the interior 2011 this can make rural water supply projects unsustainable on long term basis due to high maintenance costs construction of large dams in the athi river basin can hydrologically modify the flow of the river and hence significantly reduce salinity levels in the downstream areas see also u s department of the interior 2011 therefore the construction of thwake dam downstream in upper athi basin is therefore expected to have significant impact on salinity levels of the river increased water volume in the reservoir would significantly reduce the levels of river water salinity this could be advantageous since one of the planned uses of water from the reservoir is irrigation however there is also a possibility of increased salinity levels downstream of the dam due to reduction of streamflow particularly during the filling stage of the reservoir when downstream flow would be significantly reduced in this respect the dam operation rules should allow for the discharge of at least 50 m3 s of water daily to dilute the salinity levels downstream of the dam this will safeguard the use of river water in downstream areas up to the coast there is also a need to control irrigation practices and land degradation in the athi river basin this should be done in conjunction with activities aimed at controlling the discharge of wastewaters sewage and industrial effluents into the nairobi river which is the main contributor of polluted water with high salinity tds and conductivity levels into the athi river kithiia 1992 2006 kithiia and mutua 2006 dulo 2008 5 conclusions this study shows that there is a significant seasonal variation of salinity and tds concentrations in the athi river basin in kenya during wet seasons april june and november december the river experiences relatively low levels of salinity and tds this was attributed to the flushing dissolved salts due to increased river discharge during dry seasons january march and july october the river experiences relatively high levels of salinity and tds the salinity and tds levels progressively increases during dry season and reduces rapidly during periods of high river discharge above 50 m3s 1 in rainy season the study also established that the river transports relatively large volume of dissolved salts that range between 29 103 and 261 103 tons year 1 the sub basins that contributes large volume of dissolved salts into the main athi river include mbagathi stony athi and nairobi rivers the relatively high salt fluxes in the river were attributed to the discharge of wastewaters into the river seepage of groundwater from saline basement complex rocks and entry of irrigation return flows from numerous irrigation farms in the basin in order to ensure salinity and tds levels do not increase beyond maximum permissible level this study calls for promotion of sustainable irrigation practices and control of land degradation in the basin particularly extensive clearance of vegetation to open land for agriculture and settlement in the basin there is also a need to control the discharge of wastewaters into the tributaries of the river that drains through urban areas such as in nairobi and athi river towns the construction of water storage reservoirs in the basin can help in controlling progressive increases in salinity in the river however care must be exercised so that dam construction does not lead to major reduction in streamflow as this can lead to major increases in salinity downstream there is a also a need for studies to determine the extent to which increasing sainity in the river is affecting irrigation agriculture and water supply projects in the basin funding the author received no financial support for the research authorship and or

8437,region ethiopia s rift valley focus matching agricultural water demand and supply is a growing policy challenge in drylands we investigated the water balance components in raya 3507 km2 and ashenge 80 5 km2 grabens the rainfall depth river discharge abstraction climate and soil data 2015 2017 were used to address the research question new hydrological insights the average annual rainfall of the graben s escarpment and its bottom was 806 162 and 508 110 mm respectively heavy rains produce floods up to 732 m³ s 1 in the rivers that flow into the raya graben moreover greater runoff and river discharges volumes were recorded at the graben escarpments than at the graben bottom outlets p 0 001 due to the greater contributing area p 0 001 r2 0 98 and headwater elevation p 0 001 r2 0 98 about 24 of the water entering both graben bottoms comes from the runoff from the adjacent slopes and about 40 of the runoff reaching the raya graben bottom flowed out at the outlet about 76 and 77 5 of the annual rainfall was lost through evapotranspiration from the raya and ashenge grabens respectively so about 16 and 33 of the average annual inflows infiltrated into the sediments in the raya and ashenge grabens respectively these insights provided by this study into the water balance in grabens along the rift valley can be used to help achieve sustainable agricultural development keywords

water budget terms in a limestone graben meaza et al 2018 noticed that the runoff components were very variable due to the rainfall variability overall an integrated view of the water balance components has so far been overlooked in marginal grabens worldwide our study implies a unique investigation compared to the previous studies since it used the dense set of rain and river gauge stations therefore the improvement of the rain and river gauge networks answered the research question that motivated this study how water balance components in the graben bottoms and escarpments responded to rainfall variability and headwater catchment characteristics in the study marginal grabens the hypothesis of this study is that the water balance components varied not only between graben bottoms and their escarpments but also between the studied grabens as a response to the rainfall variablity the escarpment is a steep slope formed by vertical movement of the earth s crust along a fault whereas the graben bottom a strip of the earth s crust dropped between parallel faults the hydrological characteristics varied with these spatial units with these in mind the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the spatial behaviour of the rainfall flood baseflow and abstraction in the grabens 2 to quantify the water budget components of the grabens and 3 to analyze the water storage variations in the study area this study adds to the limited literature regarding the grabens by integrating the vertical and horizontal water budget elements with such a water budget analysis in a data scarce area this study has a societal relevance as it enhance the water availability information for the farmers in the fragile grabens 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 is located in northern ethiopia in the western escarpment of northern ethiopia 11 55 12 55 n 39 23 39 40 e the north south oriented great escarpments in the west and a steep fault scarp in the east constitute the major physiographic units of the grabens the western graben shoulder is more elevated than the eastern one in the study area the western graben shoulder is more elevated than the eastern one in the study area overall the physical characteristics of the grabens are quite contrasted table 1 the agro climatic conditions in the study area range from hot semi arid lowland and hot sub moist lowland to cold and moist highlands the long average annual rainfall amounts to 775 201 mm meaza et al 2017 a bimodal rainfall pattern characterizes the study area kiremt summer is the main rainy season july to september and belg is the short spring rainy season february to april annys et al 2017 furthermore the highland has a lower and average annual temperature 16 c than the graben bottom outlet 23 c meaza et al 2017 on the graben escarpments extensive basalt is dominant whereas on the valley bottom the area is covered by alluvial deposits nadew 2003 leptosols 94 and vertisols 87 are dominant soil types of the escarpments and bottoms respectively cascape 2017 fig s1c furthermore some rivers sourced from the escarpments are perennial but they infiltrate into the thick sediment deposits when reaching the graben bottom fig 1 meaza et al 2019 the escarpment is composed of steep slopes 6 while the graben bottom is a plain composed of thick deposits fig 2 table 1 the thickness of these alluvial deposit of the graben bottoms ranges from 18 to 311 m nadew 2003 the prominent land cover types on the escarpments are bushland and farmlands table 1 meaza et al 2019 moreover agricultural land 60 and shrubland 25 are the main land covers in the graben bottoms gidey et al 2017 also the dominant farming systems include the livestock cereal system and the irrigated fruit vegetable s production field observations 2 2 methods 2 2 1 data collection and processing topographic land cover rainfall river flow water withdrawal and evapotranspiration variables were applied to address the study objective the data collection and data set processing procedures are sequentially explained below the topographic variables such as the catchment area length of the flow path elevation and slope were calculated from a dem 30 m x 30 m extracted from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm in combination with the high resolution google earth pro topographic maps 1998 1 50000 and aerial photographs 1964 1994 1 50000 the landsat images at a resolution of 30 m x 30 m 20 12 2014 of the grabens were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs we have used two adjacent landsat images tm etm and oli images to cover the entire western escarpment these images were taken in the dry period december and january to make it cloud free after correction of the images based on 500 gcps a supervised classification was utilized to map the escarpment catchments land cover to do so an intensive field campaign july august 2014 was carried out on the western escarpment to collect the ground control points gcps the overall coefficient of the land cover yielded values of 88 subsequently the land cover map was produced in idrisi 17 0 as a result the major land cover types considered in this study are bareland bushland farmland forest and grassland further detail and definition on the land cover classification and analysis processes for the study area could be found from annys et al 2017 in the study area there are 5 rainfall stations available in the public domain to have more precision particularly taking into account the contrasting topography we established 15 rain gauges at the escarpment and horsts and 10 in the graben bottoms area to record the rainfall from 2015 to 2017 fig s1a the rain gauge locations were optimally selected to represent the different regions and altitude wmo 2010 the divisions of rainfall events in 2015 2017 were based on the rainfall events received from january 1 to december 31 literally we divide the rainfall events following a single rainfall depth received in 24 h the measured rainfall event data were aggregated to a monthly and seasonal basis isohyet and topographic maps were also used to understand the rainfall patterns in the catchments the rain gauge networks were assigned to the nearest river stations and table 4 table s1d in the absence of hydrological stations in the raya graben 3507 km2 we have carried out a n s transect 110 km to identify all rivers n 26 connecting the escarpment and the graben bottom fig 1a parallel to the western escarpments we used topographic maps to locate the graben bottom outlets n 2 graben bottom outlet is the lowest point on the boundary of a drainage system in the ashenge graben fig 1b the escarpment rivers n 5 with a total catchment area of 36 km2 contributing to the graben system 80 5 km2 were identified we consulted available studies asfaha et al 2015 demissie et al 2015 to characterize the rivers in the graben escarpment and bottom we established 10 fully gauged river stations to monitor flash floods and river baseflows in 2015 2017 in this paper flood is a period of high discharge of a river resulting from rainfall also the baseflow of 16 rivers entering the graben bottoms was monitored semi gauged river stations fig 1 here baseflow is the discharge which enters a stream channel mainly from the groundwater at the gauge stations the stream flow was monitored for the entire hydrological year whereas semi gauged rivers indicate rivers monitored only during the dry season due to inaccessibility in the rainy season and this soft monitoring system concerns rivers monitored only for groundwater contributions crabit et al 2011 eventually the runoff which was originating on the hillslopes horsts and hills towards the graben bottom was considered as one ungauged catchment hereafter referred as hill at the river stations n 10 the river baseflow and flash flood streamflow was continuously monitored using pressure transducers staff gauges float velocity and cross sectional measurements fig s1a with this respect the river stations were equipped with pressure transducers to capture the height of the water column with 10 min intervals each pressure transducer was covered by a strong mesh and placed in a sturdy box 0 5 m x 0 5 m x 1 m for protecting strong floods the diver box was placed at the lowest point in the channel to measure all levels of river flows the diver data were corrected for the atmospheric pressure using measurements by baro diver to obtain the actual water column height above the riverbeds using logger data manager diver office 2017 the cross section of each river channel was measured using a leica viva ts11 total station and autocad 2017 was applied to compute the cross sectional at area for each river at different flow depths however the channel cross section at two stations the etu and hara modified due to the intense flash floods and sand mining in the rainy season thus we re measured the cross sectional areas of the stations to offset the changes over time furthermore we used the area velocity method to convert a wide range of flow depths of floods and baseflow into runoff discharges as a result stage discharge curves were set up for fully gauged rivers as shown in fig s1b and table s1b as golina is a very dynamic river with a catchment reaching up to 4025 m a s l there was a significant sediment deposition at the gauging station in 2015 thus in 2016 2017 a dam with a rectangular broad crested weir was utilized to measure the river discharges in golina river following the methodology used by hager and schwalt 1994 eq 1 1 q w c w d n where q w represents the total runoff discharge c a constant for the weir structure 1 704 for the broad crested weir hydraulic structure salmasi et al 2013 w stands for the width of the weir 58 m d the water head above the weir s crest and n is the structure variant 1 5 the river discharges of the gauged stations were used to calculate discharges in adjacent rivers and ungauged hillslopes using the area ratio method barthold et al 2008 in practice the drainage area method can be considered unbiased asquith et al 2006 when one ungauged river or hillslope is situated between two gauged rivers with similar distance to the ungauged river we selected the river that had the most similar catchment in terms of land cover soil aspect and slope gradient using the nearest measured rainfall and river discharge fig 1 crabit et al 2011 the rainfall variability and runoff coefficients were meant as input for calculating the runoff for ungaged rivers and hillslopes based on eq 2 the runoff volumes m3 of the semi gauged and ungauged rivers were computed from the neighboring gauged rivers using the catchment area a km2 the nearest average catchment rainfall depth r mm table s1d and the neighboring catchment runoff coefficient rc 2 q u q g a u a g r u r g r c u r c g where qu is the monthly runoff generated from the ungauged rivers qg is the runoff generated from the gauged rivers the subscript u and g represent the ungauged and gauged rivers respectively scholars suggest that catchment runoff coefficient could be used while transferring discharge from gauged rivers to ungauged rivers taguas et al 2017 gal et al 2016 moreover the annual catchment runoff coefficients rcg as a main indicator of catchment signature of rivers crabit et al 2011 were calculated from the total annual runoff qy mm and the rainfall r mm as 3 r c q y r we have calculated the runoff coefficient of ungauged rivers rcu by taking the discharge from the nearest river identified for catchment area and the rainfall within the catchment itself the water abstractions for domestic and livestock purposes affect the water budget in the grabens data regarding on the two main water consumers the total number of livestock and inhabitants were collected from the ofla raya azebo raya alamata and raya kobo woreda agricultural offices in 2017 water consumptions by the inhabitants were calculated assuming the consumption of 20 liters per day per household who 2000 the animal numbers were converted into tropical livestock units tlus the average water consumption of 25 liters per day per tlu was employed to estimate the annual water abstraction leta and mesele 2014 we applied the standard approaches to compute the actual evapotranspiration for the study area we collected the climatic data daily air temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours from the national meteorological service agency the reference evapotranspiration eto mm day 1 was computed using the eto calculator software raes 2009 following the guidelines as proposed by allen et al 1998 in fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 as the meteorological stations are limited in the study area we extrapolated the eto to the catchments using nearest distance approach in the ashenge graben the open evaporation of the lake surface 15 4 km2 was set equal to the eto evaporative demand from the atmosphere of the graben bottom in a data scarce areas like northern ethiopia a simple soil water balance is sufficient to estimate the actual evapotranspiration raes et al 2006 hence for the area surrounding the lake in ashenge and the entire raya grabens the daily eto results were converted to etact using the budget model raes 2002 2012 this model considers the complex atmosphere plant soil interactions by adapting the crop growth natural vegetation and management conditions using the local soil data crop parameters and management conditions we simulated etact 2015 2016 a detailed procedure from the eto and etact calculation is provided in the supplementary materials sc and meaza et al 2018 the budget model is well proved for arid and semi arid environments near to the study area descheemaeker et al 2011 2 2 2 water budget conceptual model we developed a 2d conceptual model representing the marginal grabens to understand the water balance components fig 2 better this topographic model links the surface plant atmosphere water fluxes with the graben escarpments and graben bottoms and it is applicable elsewhere for clarity we subdivided the graben into escarpments and graben bottoms units following this our numerical water budget calculation is based on the principle that the outflow of a graben unit must equal the inflow the change in storage within with the hydrological year is running from january 1 to december 31 wmo 2012 a hydrological year is continuous twelve month period during which a complete annual climatic cycle occurs in such a way that overall changes in storage are minimal wmo 2010 2012 on the escarpments the rainfall resc is input for the water balance whereas flows and hillslopes q o u t e s c the actual evapotranspiration e t a c t e s c and abstractions a e s c constitute the outflows what is remained here is the recharge i e s c the water balance is expressed for the monthly seasonal and annual periods the annual water balance for the escarpment can be expressed as follows 4 r e s c e t a c t e s c q o u t e s c a e s c i e s c the rainfall on the graben bottom rgrab and the runoff outflow from the escarpments qout esc qin grab are the input components of the graben bottom while the runoff outflow qout grab actual evapotranspiration etact grab and abstractions agrab constitute the main output of the yearly water balance in the graben bottom 5 r g r a b q i n g r a b q o u t g r a b e t a c t g r a b a g r a b i g r a b the yearly water storage in the raya and ashenge grabens are the residuals of the water budget fluxes of the escarpments i e s c and graben bottom i g r a b the residual term represents the recharge and the errors related to the estimation uncertainties of the water balance here it is important to note that the storage equation expresses the balance between the inflow outflow and the storage change for any water body during a certain period wmo 2012 the change in storage inflow outflow is expressed in the form of residuals in the water balance equation in the graben unit the remaining water is the aggregate of the groundwater recharge and deep percolation below the phreatic zone due to the presence of a series of fault lines and more than 300 m thick deposits fig 2 we assume that the groundwater of the grabens is flowing to the very thick sediment deposits 1400 m of the dallol graben 14 23 40 29 in the western afar margin hagos et al 2016 equally bense et al 2003 also noted that deep faults enhance the vertical groundwater flow through deep seepage we calculated the rate of infiltration or percolation rate i mm day 1 in the graben system using the annual water excess or change in storage see eqs 4 and 5 s mm divided by the catchment area a m2 and the number of days in a hydrological year t day domenico and schwartz 1998 6 i s a t 2 2 3 data analysis the required data set were monitored to address the main research question we applied descriptive statistics to summarize the catchment characteristics rainfall floods baseflow runoff coefficients eto etact and water abstractions next a two sample t test and the anova models were applied to compare the average values of the rainfall depth river flows and etact depths on various spatial scales in addition a pearson correlation was calculated to understand the association between the rainfall depths at different rain gauge stations and elevations moreover a multiple regression model was applied to capture the dominant factors affecting the flood production from the western escarpments ultimately we analyzed the water budget components of the grabens using the eq 4 and 5 2 2 4 data quality data quality tests on the normality and equality of variance were carried out using the q q plot to detect anomalies we also assessed the model performance of the rating curves based on the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 α 5 notably the metric staff gauges were attached to the diver access tube in order to measure the stage of the water manually at a 10 min interval to verify and validate the flow depth captured by the pressure transducers this helps to compare the flow depths measured with micro diver sensor and staff gauge manual in addition verification of the observed flood events in the 2015 2017 were undertaken table s2b using the modified rational formula salmasi et al 2013 to check the river flow data quality 3 results 3 1 rainfall distribution in the marginal grabens table 2 shows the rainfall depth on event monthly seasonal and annual distribution in the graben systems for the period 2015 2017 in the marginal grabens the timing of the rains was erratic mainly in the dry year the highest rainfall event depths in 2015 2017 were 98 7 mm belago station 95 5 mm kelesa station and 127 3 mm meshena station respectively the study area received up to 751 mm in the rainy season during which the highest rainfall depths were recorded in august 407 3 mm the average rainfall depths in jas july september are higher than the sum of jfm january march amj april june and ond october december by a factor of 1 3 table 3 next to the rainy season summer belg season february and march was found a short spring rainy season however the rest months are dry months therefore rainfall depth showed a strong seasonal variation one way anova shows that the average rainfall depths varied significantly among 2015 2017 p 0 001 where 2015 had the lowest rainfall depth furthermore the rainfall variability was particularly pronounced at the graben bottom compared to the graben escarpments and highlands figs 1 and 3 the northern part of the escarpment also had lower rainfall depth than the southern end of the western escarpment result from t test shows that the average rainfall depths were different between the escarpments and graben bottoms p 0 001 a quantity almost twice as large as the rainfall received by the graben bottom was recorded in the graben escarpments this result was further confirmed by a pearson correlation test showing a positive correlation between the rainfall depth and altitude r 0 62 p 0 001 for example the headwaters of the catchment 10 13 and 22 fig 1 have higher rainfall depths fig 3 the ashenge graben has similar rainfall depths at the raya graben escarpment 3 2 river discharges in marginal grabens 3 2 1 flood events and volumes the average number of the annual flood events at the river stations for 2016 25 2 4 2 events amounted to nearly two times the number of flood events experienced in 2015 12 3 1 3 events although the flood events were limited to august the average number of flood events in 2017 was 23 2 5 events similar to the number of flood events received in 2016 moreover the duration of the flood events ranged from 10 min at the anachu station to 37 h at the golina station with an extrme flood discharges of 732 m³ s 1 fig 4 the large number of zero flood days in 2015 resulted in low total flood volumes the flood volume indicates the amount of discharge generated in the specific time scale floods with high discharges reached the graben bottom outlets in 2016 and 2017 the annual flood volumes vary among the catchments in the study area table 3 accordingly the most significant share of the flood volumes was delivered to the raya graben bottom through the golina 39 75 mm3 and gobu 34 71 mm3 rivers in 2016 the graben bottom lost 18 19 and 13 85 mm3 through selekberi and merkehora the annual flood volumes from the raya escarpment recorded in 2015 2017 were 139 63 209 25 and 159 48 mm3 respectively table 3 as it is a closed graben system however the ashenge graben did not have surface runoff outflows in the observed years table 4 3 2 2 baseflow many springs discharge to the streams as a baseflow to the graben bottoms about half of the rivers had baseflows except for the golina river with its greater river discharge and steeper river bed gradient however these river baseflow discharges decrease when reaching the floodplain they become influent streams as they quickly returned to zero flow after the rainfall storms in this study the influent streams refer to streams losing water to the ground hence contributing water to the saturated zone at the golina station the maximum baseflow amounted to 9 4 m3 s 1 in august 2016 whereas the lowest baseflow was 0 09 m3 s 1 in may the average baseflow from the western escarpment was similar to the average baseflow leaving the raya graben similarly the western escarpments contributed to higher annual baseflows than those who left the raya graben bottom via the merkehora and selekberi outlets we found that the 5 04 10 5 and 9 mm3 baseflow volumes contributed in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively to the ashenge graben bottom the baseflows from the ashenge escarpment infiltrate the thick sediment and re emerge in the mouth of the lake the behaviour of the ashenge river baseflow was similar to the raya escarpment base flow as they have a similar waterscape fig 1 3 2 3 river discharge the spatiotemporal variabilities of the river discharges floods and baseflows mimic the rainfall depths in the marginal grabens the total annual river discharge of the raya graben escarpment was higher in 2017 than in 2015 table 3 these volumes were the input of the graben bottom however the graben bottom lost about 95 mm3 runoff discharge volume per year moreover about 11 mm3 of the river runoff entered the ashenge graben bottom per year there is no surface outflow from the ashenge graben in both grabens a higher streamflow was found in 2016 than in 2015 the flood volumes were higher than the baseflow during the period 2015 2017 fig 5 the regression equation reveals that the catchment size maximum elevation of the headwaters and steep slopes positively predicted the annual flood volumes p 0 001 r2 0 98 moreover another regression model indicates that the catchment area p 0 001 r2 0 61 and woody vegetation cover p 0 05 r2 0 61 significantly enhanced the yearly river baseflows at the western escarpment furthermore rehabilitated areas had higher baseflows than areas with less woody vegetation p 0 01 thus the river discharge volumes showed a temporal variation where severe shortages in the streamflow and surface water storage were observed in 2015 3 2 4 runoff depths and their coefficients the average of the annual runoff depth the amount of runoff recorded in the year over the three studied years at the raya graben escarpment 125 mm was larger than in the graben bottom 26 mm similarly the annual runoff depth at the ashenge graben escarpment 291 mm was larger than in the ashenge graben bottom 260 mm the ashenge graben 276 mm had higher average annual river runoff depth compared to the raya graben 76 mm similar to the annual runoff depths the runoff coefficient showed a spatial variation in the grabens fig 6 table 5 the annual runoff coefficient increased from hara 0 16 in the north to golina 0 27 in the south in the deep sediment deposits the runoff coefficient amounted to 0 12 following the river s longitudinal profile the annual runoff coefficients for the mesanu station 2460 m a s l anachu station hara station and selekberi station 1397 m a s l were 0 33 0 21 0 16 and 0 10 respectively table 5 in a nutshell the average annual runoff coefficient of the raya escarpment was 0 22 thus rehabilitating of degraded bare areas induced a runoff coefficient variation 3 3 actual evapotranspiration variabilities in the weather elements such as temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours accelerate the evaporative powers of the atmosphere fig 7 while the air temperature seldom exceeds 35 c in june when the sun is overhead in the graben bottom the minimum air temperature decreases to 12 2 c at the graben bottoms moreover high wind speed and sunshine hours induce a high atmospheric water demand in the graben bottom fig 8 and table 6 depicts the comparisons of etact and eto mm in the raya graben the daily etact of the escarpments in 2016 was 2 7 2 24 mm day 1 whereas the average daily etact of the graben plains in 2016 was 2 09 2 66 mm day 1 as a response to the rainfall depth variability the monthly etact values varied among the observation periods table 6 besides the etact of the graben escarpments was higher than the graben bottoms due to a better moisture availability to conclude the etact was prone to the altitudinal difference between the graben bottoms and escarpments in both grabens 3 4 graben water withdrawals withdrawal is the extraction of water from a surface reservoir or an aquifer in the grabens surface and groundwater resources in the grabens accommodate considerable human and livestock populations table 7 the average annual water withdrawals from the raya graben escarpment and graben bottom amounted to 16 67 and 30 32 mm3 per year respectively however the average yearly water withdrawals are insignificant in the ashenge graben table 7 3 5 dovetailing the water budget components spatiotemporal variations of water balance components exist in the marginal grabens fig 9 table 8 the inflow and outflow water fluxes in the raya graben escarpment led to an average annual water recharge of 103 mm3 at a rate of infiltration percolation of 0 16 mm day 1 besides 258 91 mm3 water volumes were recharged in the raya graben bottom at a percolation rate of 0 41 mm day 1 in the entire system 261 452 and 370 mm3 groundwater recharged in 2015 2017 respectively table 8 on the other hand an average of 1 77 mm3 water volume was recharged in the ashenge graben escarpment at an infiltration rate of 0 13 mm day 1 table 9 in addition the average annual recharge of the floodplain was 19 7 mm3 at a percolation rate of 1 21 mm day 1 in the ashenge closed graben 8 30 and 25 mm3 water of volume recharged in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively while the infiltration of the raya graben is 0 28 mm day 1 the infiltration rate of the ashenge graben is 0 73 mm day 1 generally the water balance components varied between the studied grabens fig 10 tables 8 and 9 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall is a dominant input to the graben water balance rainfall constitutes the major water resource of the fragile graben ecosystem the study indicates that rainfall shows significant temporal variations e g fig 6a and b in particular 2015 experienced a lower rainfall depth due to a most probably congruence with el niño philip et al 2018 the rainfall depths in the graben bottoms were small irregular and more variable than on the escarpments in 2015 however the rainfall volume on the graben bottom of 2016 was almost twice as much as in 2015 there were substantial rainfall gradients between the merkehora graben bottom outlet 1357 m a s l and the headwater of the golina inlet 4025 m a s l where the rainfall of the latter exceeds the former area annys et al 2017 also reported that the rainfall was higher towards the southern direction of the study area due to the latitude elevation local aspect slope and topographic effects most rain volumes 75 infiltrated on the graben escarpments the intense 2015 el niño event increased the severity of the drought in northern ethiopia philip et al 2018 our findings are align well with the results of asfaha et al 2016 demissie et al 2017 jacob et al 2013 frankl et al 2013 and lanckriet et al 2015a who reported that the rainfall showed spatial variation in northern ethiopia overall the entire grabens experienced a rainfall shortage in 2015 leading to meteorological and agricultural droughts these droughts in turn caused large harvest losses in the study area 4 2 river discharges propagated in the marginal grabens the atmospheric water supply rainfall controls the river discharges in the marginal grabens the more considerable rainfall depth in 2016 and 2017 resulted in more substantial variations of river discharges dramatic runoff decreases brought a harmful impact on the water supply fig 11 as a response graben communities diverted much of the summer floods for agricultural uses spate irrigation fig 11c these flood diversions led to several flood events that did not reach the graben bottom outlets in 2015 the differences in the flash flood runoff showed a spatial variation in the grabens because of their steep slope and better rainfall depths the runoff depths of the grabens escarpments were higher than those from the graben bottoms p 0 01 the study reports that annual runoffs of golina river in 2015 2017 were about 40 5 62 7 and 51 9 mm3 respectively the annual recharge obtained in this study is in the same order of magnitude with abdu 2011 who reported that the runoff of the golina perennial river is about 61 mm3 year 1 in this study we found that the vast catchments and elevated headwaters of the first order streams e g golina catchment produced large floods the flash floods fig 4 are obvious observations for the short and long intense floods in the semi arid environments vanmaercke et al 2010 comparatively the graben bottom experienced an inadequate surface water resources than the escarpments thus the dynamic behaviour of river discharges severely affected the blue and green waters availability in the low lying areas of the studied grabens the blue water is the water in rivers lakes wetland and shallow aquifers while green water is rainfall water stored in an unsaturated soil and later used for evapotranspiration zang et al 2012 according to our analysis the forest cover decreases from north to south on the western escarpment the area without vegetation e g baren land and farmland of the burqua catchment at the north end of the raya escarpment was 35 in 2017 conversely the bare land and farmland of the legeharo catchment at the south end of the raya graben escarpment was 64 in 2017 fig 1 the difference in land cover within the same graben escarpment could lead to a variation of the runoff coefficient between 32 legeharo and 18 burqa in northern ethiopia degraded landscapes have been enclosed nyssen et al 2015 after closure of the area integrated soil and water conservation activities e g reforestation soil bunds and stone bunds were being practiced asfaha et al 2016 with the passage of time these degraded areas were turned to greener area nyssen et al 2010 these areas we called them rehabilitated catchments in agreement with guzha et al 2018 and nyssen et al 2015 this study shows that the rehabilitated catchments e g hara catchment increased the on site river baseflow to the graben bottom in contrast the runoff coefficient for the hara rc 0 15 and etu stations rc 0 17 was higher than in the golina rc 0 09 and diqala stations rc 0 08 nyssen et al 2010 also reported that the catchment management has resulted in a higher infiltration rate and a reduction of direct runoff volume by 81 which has had a positive influence on the water balance here catchment management refers to a sound planning soil and water resources in the grabens for sustainable use it is balancing the use and conservation of natural resources on a the studied grabens this study indicates that rehabilitated areas retain the streamflow during the rainy season and later water supply in the dry season in line with meaza et al 2016 rehabilitated areas had higher baseflows and springs than areas with less woody vegetation equally other studies reveal that the afforestation increased baseflow elsewhere ahiablame et al 2017 asfaha et al 2015 demissie et al 2015 dessie et al 2014 on an annual basis guyassa 2017 also reported that the exclosures on steep slopes up to 20 absorbed 778 mm water depth in addition to the rainfall that is partially transported to the downstream area a baseflows this result indicates that the implementation of soil and water conservation measures at gira kahsu for example reduces the summer runoff the improvement in woody vegetation cover at the western escarpments resulted in a more stable water flow and a major water recharge during the wet season integrated rehabilitation interventions such as tree planting and terraces at the upper catchments can lead to an enhancement of the ecosystem services due to the increased baseflows and lateral flows garcia et al 2018 4 3 actual evapotranspiration and human activities removed the inflow in the grabens allen et al 1998 noted that the meteorological forcing elements fig 7 control the water availability of a catchment in particular etact reaches its maximum during the wet season due to the high soil moisture and warmer air temperature despite the solar radiation exposure fig 8 hence the study indicates that 80 of the annual rainfall of the raya graben bottom returned to the atmosphere similarly 82 of the rainfall left the ashenge graben bottom due to the high atmospheric water demand on a graben level 76 and 77 5 of the annual rainfall has left through the etact in the raya and ashenge grabens respectively this argument indicates that a massive water volume was lost via etact in the rainy season our result confirms the findings of zaninović and gajić čapka 2000 who reported that the atmospheric water demand in the lowlands reached up to 85 of the rainfall the abrupt changes in etact were a response to the rainfall surface temperature wind speed soil antecedent moisture crop types and crop growth stage variations despite the substantial difference in the rainfall depth between the escarpment and graben bottom there was a small change in the etact values between the graben bottoms and graben escarpments due to irrigation thus the etact shares the most significant output term in the water balance equation similarly zhang et al 2018 concluded that etact is a critical land surface flux that drives the water budget imbalance in the north china plain human activities affected the hydrological processes in the marginal grabens for example spate systems allow the flash floods to turn into productive water for irrigation fig 11c moreover inhabitants and livestock consumed water in the dry season similarly oliveira et al 2015 indicated that the water fluxes were disturbed by the degree of the human water interactions in the brazilian cerrado water abstraction by the etact household and livestock demands negatively affected the water availability in the study areas fig 11b as alluded above water depletion in the graben bottom resulted in a subtle hydrological drought in the marginal grabens following the guidelines for a sustainable land management gurtner et al 2011 windbreaks hedges living barriers and a good soil cover could contribute to minimize the excessive water losses from the irrigated farms 4 4 comparing the spatiotemporal groundwater recharges in the marginal grabens in agreement with kahsay et al 2018 the water recharges varied between the escarpments and graben bottom basins the recharge rates that pass through the vadose zone of the raya escarpment and its adjoining graben bottom were 0 16 mm day 1 and 0 41 mm day 1 respectively which is in line with the ranges of domenico and schwartz 1998 with this recharge rate the average annual recharge 2015 2017 of the raya and ashenge grabens were 103 and 267 mm respectively fig 9 however other study with limited field measurements showed that the long mean annual recharge in the basin was 55 mm kahsay et al 2018 overall the annual rate of recharge was about 258 9 mm3 in raya graben bottom including raya kobo area with this annual recharge the groundwater resource potential of raya graben bottom may about 9791 mm3 nadew et al 2018 in response to the rainfall the lowest annual groundwater recharge in the raya graben was recorded in 2015 whereas a significant volume was noticed in 2016 the average annual groundwater recharge of the raya graben escarpment and its low lying area shared 7 and 25 of the inflow to the graben respectively moreover the average percolation rate of the ashenge graben escarpment 0 13 mm day 1 was lower than its graben bottom 1 21 mm day 1 as a result the annual recharge of the ashenge escarpment and its floodplain amounted to 5 and 35 of the inflow respectively about 16 of the annual inflow to the raya graben was recharged while 30 of inflow to the ashenge terminal graben infiltrated during the observed climatic years the water balance closure problem is critical in the scientific hydrology sokolov and chapman 1974 it is crucial to note that the computations of water balance components may involve errors beven 2006 therefore the change of storage values may include errors due to the imperfections of the water balance elements the groundwater recharge of the raya graben escarpment is in line with the study which was carried out by abera et al 2017 in the upper blue nile basin located west of the study grabens the study highlights that the graben bottoms possessing thick alluvial deposits show a higher water storage capacity in the aquifers than the graben escarpments lanckriet et al 2015b also inferred that the water level in the ashenge lake has raised in the past 15 years due to the conservation efforts in the last decade deep percolations and seepages from each graben bottom to the subsequent lower basin are represented fig 10 the studies by ayenew et al 2013 and kebede et al 2008 show that the ashenge graben feeds the raya graben as a response to the hydraulic properties of the tectonic structures the deep cut fault could allow a deep drainage from the raya to the dallol graben further downstream fig 2 thus deep faulting and fracturing may permit inter basin water transfers in the danakil depression similar to the deep faults in the roer graben of germany that enhance a deep groundwater flow bense et al 2003 erratic rainfall occurrence disturbs the on site water storage in this study we observed that the moisture deficit eto etact increases while the excess of the soil water holding capacity r etact declines for almost ten months this result reveals that the climatic variability contributes to interannual variability of water balance terms carmona et al 2014 jillo et al 2017 reported that the climate variability induced a variability in the seasonal water balance moreover human activities that are linked to a high water demand provoked water storage propagations deng and chen 2017 according to fao 2011 the world experienced an increasing imbalance between the demand and availability for water resources the intensifying agriculture and etact affected the water storage in the grabens in particular coupled with the rainfall variability the rapid rates of agricultural development could increase the grabens water stress as a response appropriate basin management practices are needed in order to counter excessive and unproductive water loss via river outflows and evapotranspiration percolation ponds harvesting water and floodwater spreading could especially enhance the availability of river baseflows during the dry seasons building shallow wells and micro dams at the graben bottom outlets could raise the water table the water harvesting structures on the upstream downstream and social ecological systems are intensifying worldwide andersson et al 2011 this study indicates that the upstream water management intervention could reduce or improve the water availability for the downstream areas during the climatic year for example the large scale intensification of water harvesting in the tana graben improves the water storage for downstream areas dile et al 2016 therefore an integrated land rehabilitation on the escarpments enhances the river baseflow in the low lying area in line with roobavannan et al 2017 the on site water use efficiency through the reduction of water loss from the unwanted drainage and seepage could improve the water storage both in soil and groundwater optimizing irrigation water levels e g deficit irrigation practice saves irrigation water also improves water production in graben agricultural areas ayenew et al 2013 the water use efficiency is crucial as commercial land investors and farmers will engage in irrigated agriculture in the graben bottoms with an increasing agricultural investment in such geographical confined areas the sector is expected to be a water competitor in the near future preparing for the future decision makers and farmers could therefore benefit from this study to optimize the on site water storage in the confined grabens 5 conclusions the objective of this study was to investigate the water balance components of the potential agricultural grabens along the rift valley in northern ethiopia in the grabens 2015 was a very dry year compared to 2016 and 2017 the average annual rainfall on the escarpments was nearly twice the rainfall amount in the graben bottom the rainfall variation governed the flash floods baseflows and the actual evapotranspiration in the study area our results indicate that the flood runoff coefficient significantly varied between the vegetated catchments and the deforested slopes moreover nearly half of the runoff discharges reaching the raya graben bottom flushed through towards the outlet the study also indicates that evapotranspiration represents more than half of the annual rainfall of the graben bottom in the studied grabens the graben bottoms with thick alluvial deposits stored more water in the graben aquifers than the graben escarpments in conclusion there is a good rate of groundwater recharge in the basalt marginal graben bottoms however the recharge along the graben escarpment could be improved through integrated watershed management practices with good land and water management practices there is a strong prospect of developing water resources for sustainable agricultural development in the grabens as there are ambitious irrigation development plans this study will contribute to sustaining livelihood

8437,region ethiopia s rift valley focus matching agricultural water demand and supply is a growing policy challenge in drylands we investigated the water balance components in raya 3507 km2 and ashenge 80 5 km2 grabens the rainfall depth river discharge abstraction climate and soil data 2015 2017 were used to address the research question new hydrological insights the average annual rainfall of the graben s escarpment and its bottom was 806 162 and 508 110 mm respectively heavy rains produce floods up to 732 m³ s 1 in the rivers that flow into the raya graben moreover greater runoff and river discharges volumes were recorded at the graben escarpments than at the graben bottom outlets p 0 001 due to the greater contributing area p 0 001 r2 0 98 and headwater elevation p 0 001 r2 0 98 about 24 of the water entering both graben bottoms comes from the runoff from the adjacent slopes and about 40 of the runoff reaching the raya graben bottom flowed out at the outlet about 76 and 77 5 of the annual rainfall was lost through evapotranspiration from the raya and ashenge grabens respectively so about 16 and 33 of the average annual inflows infiltrated into the sediments in the raya and ashenge grabens respectively these insights provided by this study into the water balance in grabens along the rift valley can be used to help achieve sustainable agricultural development keywords erratic rainfall flash flood evapotranspiration recharge rift valley ethiopia 1 introduction a marginal graben is a narrow faulted valley running along the margin of a tectonic trough williams 2016 in northern ethiopia marginal grabens are transitional zones between the highlands and the danakil depression the runoff from highland plateau and escarpment feeds the graben bottoms as they trap sediments from the highlands graben bottoms have thick deposited sediments and productive farmlands hagos et al 2016 in a human modified world marginal grabens tend to have high economic and ecological values anda et al 1998 nyssen et al 2017 reported that the in ethiopia graben bottoms are fertile because of the yearly deposition of a thin layer of alluvium originating from the river headwaters owing to their fertile soils the marginal grabens have been targeted as a development corridor to meet the future growing food demand nowadays commercial land deals and urbanization increased in the raya graben of northern ethiopia elsewhere agricultural investments were made to enhance the economic growth danvi et al 2017 dawidek and ferencz 2014 sustaining water resources in the drylands water scarce areas remains a challenge for the marginal graben communities together with the rainfall variability however anthropogenic effects pose a threat to the graben resources in semi arid areas bense et al 2003 the water demand for agriculture is associated with the exploitation of land and water resources thus obtaining a sustainable water resource use under an intensifying agriculture is a critical threat for meeting the food production fao 2011 roobavannan et al 2017 balancing water for societies and environments gained momentum mainly in drylands in the arid and semi arid areas water balance studies attempted to answer a vexing question how can we optimize the available green and blue waters to enhance sustainable exploitation for agriculture mcdonnell 2003 a water balance is a numerical calculation based on the principle that the outflow from a given catchment must equal the inflows combined with the change in storage carmona et al 2014 wmo 2012 the water balance is used to make quantitative estimates of the water input and output fluxes importantly hydrological models have been developed to compute the water balance or water budget elements of a given catchment sivapalan and blöschl 2017 and thereby assist in managing agricultural water use mcdonnell 2017 therefore understanding the water budget input and output in agricultural areas is a pre requisite to guide a sustainable water use beven 2006 2016 there are many water balance studies for non graben areas worldwide e g danvi et al 2017 oliveira et al 2015 however marginal graben water balance studies are sparse thierion et al 2012 showed that the outflow exceeded the inflow in the rhine graben rift system in the chapala graben in mexico anda et al 1998 also reported that the water imbalance put the economic viability of the area at risk moreover the extremely large groundwater extractions in the roer graben affected the hydraulic head resulting in a decline of the water table bense et al 2003 in ethiopia advances in the water resources research have also been limited to a few basins like the blue nile and omo ghibe abera et al 2017 dile et al 2018 jillo et al 2017 however few studies have reported about the groundwater potential and the peak flow discharges in the raya graben asfaha et al 2016 ayenew et al 2013 demissie et al 2015 these studies did not integrate the water budget terms in a limestone graben meaza et al 2018 noticed that the runoff components were very variable due to the rainfall variability overall an integrated view of the water balance components has so far been overlooked in marginal grabens worldwide our study implies a unique investigation compared to the previous studies since it used the dense set of rain and river gauge stations therefore the improvement of the rain and river gauge networks answered the research question that motivated this study how water balance components in the graben bottoms and escarpments responded to rainfall variability and headwater catchment characteristics in the study marginal grabens the hypothesis of this study is that the water balance components varied not only between graben bottoms and their escarpments but also between the studied grabens as a response to the rainfall variablity the escarpment is a steep slope formed by vertical movement of the earth s crust along a fault whereas the graben bottom a strip of the earth s crust dropped between parallel faults the hydrological characteristics varied with these spatial units with these in mind the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the spatial behaviour of the rainfall flood baseflow and abstraction in the grabens 2 to quantify the water budget components of the grabens and 3 to analyze the water storage variations in the study area this study adds to the limited literature regarding the grabens by integrating the vertical and horizontal water budget elements with such a water budget analysis in a data scarce area this study has a societal relevance as it enhance the water availability information for the farmers in the fragile grabens 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 is located in northern ethiopia in the western escarpment of northern ethiopia 11 55 12 55 n 39 23 39 40 e the north south oriented great escarpments in the west and a steep fault scarp in the east constitute the major physiographic units of the grabens the western graben shoulder is more elevated than the eastern one in the study area the western graben shoulder is more elevated than the eastern one in the study area overall the physical characteristics of the grabens are quite contrasted table 1 the agro climatic conditions in the study area range from hot semi arid lowland and hot sub moist lowland to cold and moist highlands the long average annual rainfall amounts to 775 201 mm meaza et al 2017 a bimodal rainfall pattern characterizes the study area kiremt summer is the main rainy season july to september and belg is the short spring rainy season february to april annys et al 2017 furthermore the highland has a lower and average annual temperature 16 c than the graben bottom outlet 23 c meaza et al 2017 on the graben escarpments extensive basalt is dominant whereas on the valley bottom the area is covered by alluvial deposits nadew 2003 leptosols 94 and vertisols 87 are dominant soil types of the escarpments and bottoms respectively cascape 2017 fig s1c furthermore some rivers sourced from the escarpments are perennial but they infiltrate into the thick sediment deposits when reaching the graben bottom fig 1 meaza et al 2019 the escarpment is composed of steep slopes 6 while the graben bottom is a plain composed of thick deposits fig 2 table 1 the thickness of these alluvial deposit of the graben bottoms ranges from 18 to 311 m nadew 2003 the prominent land cover types on the escarpments are bushland and farmlands table 1 meaza et al 2019 moreover agricultural land 60 and shrubland 25 are the main land covers in the graben bottoms gidey et al 2017 also the dominant farming systems include the livestock cereal system and the irrigated fruit vegetable s production field observations 2 2 methods 2 2 1 data collection and processing topographic land cover rainfall river flow water withdrawal and evapotranspiration variables were applied to address the study objective the data collection and data set processing procedures are sequentially explained below the topographic variables such as the catchment area length of the flow path elevation and slope were calculated from a dem 30 m x 30 m extracted from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm in combination with the high resolution google earth pro topographic maps 1998 1 50000 and aerial photographs 1964 1994 1 50000 the landsat images at a resolution of 30 m x 30 m 20 12 2014 of the grabens were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs we have used two adjacent landsat images tm etm and oli images to cover the entire western escarpment these images were taken in the dry period december and january to make it cloud free after correction of the images based on 500 gcps a supervised classification was utilized to map the escarpment catchments land cover to do so an intensive field campaign july august 2014 was carried out on the western escarpment to collect the ground control points gcps the overall coefficient of the land cover yielded values of 88 subsequently the land cover map was produced in idrisi 17 0 as a result the major land cover types considered in this study are bareland bushland farmland forest and grassland further detail and definition on the land cover classification and analysis processes for the study area could be found from annys et al 2017 in the study area there are 5 rainfall stations available in the public domain to have more precision particularly taking into account the contrasting topography we established 15 rain gauges at the escarpment and horsts and 10 in the graben bottoms area to record the rainfall from 2015 to 2017 fig s1a the rain gauge locations were optimally selected to represent the different regions and altitude wmo 2010 the divisions of rainfall events in 2015 2017 were based on the rainfall events received from january 1 to december 31 literally we divide the rainfall events following a single rainfall depth received in 24 h the measured rainfall event data were aggregated to a monthly and seasonal basis isohyet and topographic maps were also used to understand the rainfall patterns in the catchments the rain gauge networks were assigned to the nearest river stations and table 4 table s1d in the absence of hydrological stations in the raya graben 3507 km2 we have carried out a n s transect 110 km to identify all rivers n 26 connecting the escarpment and the graben bottom fig 1a parallel to the western escarpments we used topographic maps to locate the graben bottom outlets n 2 graben bottom outlet is the lowest point on the boundary of a drainage system in the ashenge graben fig 1b the escarpment rivers n 5 with a total catchment area of 36 km2 contributing to the graben system 80 5 km2 were identified we consulted available studies asfaha et al 2015 demissie et al 2015 to characterize the rivers in the graben escarpment and bottom we established 10 fully gauged river stations to monitor flash floods and river baseflows in 2015 2017 in this paper flood is a period of high discharge of a river resulting from rainfall also the baseflow of 16 rivers entering the graben bottoms was monitored semi gauged river stations fig 1 here baseflow is the discharge which enters a stream channel mainly from the groundwater at the gauge stations the stream flow was monitored for the entire hydrological year whereas semi gauged rivers indicate rivers monitored only during the dry season due to inaccessibility in the rainy season and this soft monitoring system concerns rivers monitored only for groundwater contributions crabit et al 2011 eventually the runoff which was originating on the hillslopes horsts and hills towards the graben bottom was considered as one ungauged catchment hereafter referred as hill at the river stations n 10 the river baseflow and flash flood streamflow was continuously monitored using pressure transducers staff gauges float velocity and cross sectional measurements fig s1a with this respect the river stations were equipped with pressure transducers to capture the height of the water column with 10 min intervals each pressure transducer was covered by a strong mesh and placed in a sturdy box 0 5 m x 0 5 m x 1 m for protecting strong floods the diver box was placed at the lowest point in the channel to measure all levels of river flows the diver data were corrected for the atmospheric pressure using measurements by baro diver to obtain the actual water column height above the riverbeds using logger data manager diver office 2017 the cross section of each river channel was measured using a leica viva ts11 total station and autocad 2017 was applied to compute the cross sectional at area for each river at different flow depths however the channel cross section at two stations the etu and hara modified due to the intense flash floods and sand mining in the rainy season thus we re measured the cross sectional areas of the stations to offset the changes over time furthermore we used the area velocity method to convert a wide range of flow depths of floods and baseflow into runoff discharges as a result stage discharge curves were set up for fully gauged rivers as shown in fig s1b and table s1b as golina is a very dynamic river with a catchment reaching up to 4025 m a s l there was a significant sediment deposition at the gauging station in 2015 thus in 2016 2017 a dam with a rectangular broad crested weir was utilized to measure the river discharges in golina river following the methodology used by hager and schwalt 1994 eq 1 1 q w c w d n where q w represents the total runoff discharge c a constant for the weir structure 1 704 for the broad crested weir hydraulic structure salmasi et al 2013 w stands for the width of the weir 58 m d the water head above the weir s crest and n is the structure variant 1 5 the river discharges of the gauged stations were used to calculate discharges in adjacent rivers and ungauged hillslopes using the area ratio method barthold et al 2008 in practice the drainage area method can be considered unbiased asquith et al 2006 when one ungauged river or hillslope is situated between two gauged rivers with similar distance to the ungauged river we selected the river that had the most similar catchment in terms of land cover soil aspect and slope gradient using the nearest measured rainfall and river discharge fig 1 crabit et al 2011 the rainfall variability and runoff coefficients were meant as input for calculating the runoff for ungaged rivers and hillslopes based on eq 2 the runoff volumes m3 of the semi gauged and ungauged rivers were computed from the neighboring gauged rivers using the catchment area a km2 the nearest average catchment rainfall depth r mm table s1d and the neighboring catchment runoff coefficient rc 2 q u q g a u a g r u r g r c u r c g where qu is the monthly runoff generated from the ungauged rivers qg is the runoff generated from the gauged rivers the subscript u and g represent the ungauged and gauged rivers respectively scholars suggest that catchment runoff coefficient could be used while transferring discharge from gauged rivers to ungauged rivers taguas et al 2017 gal et al 2016 moreover the annual catchment runoff coefficients rcg as a main indicator of catchment signature of rivers crabit et al 2011 were calculated from the total annual runoff qy mm and the rainfall r mm as 3 r c q y r we have calculated the runoff coefficient of ungauged rivers rcu by taking the discharge from the nearest river identified for catchment area and the rainfall within the catchment itself the water abstractions for domestic and livestock purposes affect the water budget in the grabens data regarding on the two main water consumers the total number of livestock and inhabitants were collected from the ofla raya azebo raya alamata and raya kobo woreda agricultural offices in 2017 water consumptions by the inhabitants were calculated assuming the consumption of 20 liters per day per household who 2000 the animal numbers were converted into tropical livestock units tlus the average water consumption of 25 liters per day per tlu was employed to estimate the annual water abstraction leta and mesele 2014 we applied the standard approaches to compute the actual evapotranspiration for the study area we collected the climatic data daily air temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours from the national meteorological service agency the reference evapotranspiration eto mm day 1 was computed using the eto calculator software raes 2009 following the guidelines as proposed by allen et al 1998 in fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 as the meteorological stations are limited in the study area we extrapolated the eto to the catchments using nearest distance approach in the ashenge graben the open evaporation of the lake surface 15 4 km2 was set equal to the eto evaporative demand from the atmosphere of the graben bottom in a data scarce areas like northern ethiopia a simple soil water balance is sufficient to estimate the actual evapotranspiration raes et al 2006 hence for the area surrounding the lake in ashenge and the entire raya grabens the daily eto results were converted to etact using the budget model raes 2002 2012 this model considers the complex atmosphere plant soil interactions by adapting the crop growth natural vegetation and management conditions using the local soil data crop parameters and management conditions we simulated etact 2015 2016 a detailed procedure from the eto and etact calculation is provided in the supplementary materials sc and meaza et al 2018 the budget model is well proved for arid and semi arid environments near to the study area descheemaeker et al 2011 2 2 2 water budget conceptual model we developed a 2d conceptual model representing the marginal grabens to understand the water balance components fig 2 better this topographic model links the surface plant atmosphere water fluxes with the graben escarpments and graben bottoms and it is applicable elsewhere for clarity we subdivided the graben into escarpments and graben bottoms units following this our numerical water budget calculation is based on the principle that the outflow of a graben unit must equal the inflow the change in storage within with the hydrological year is running from january 1 to december 31 wmo 2012 a hydrological year is continuous twelve month period during which a complete annual climatic cycle occurs in such a way that overall changes in storage are minimal wmo 2010 2012 on the escarpments the rainfall resc is input for the water balance whereas flows and hillslopes q o u t e s c the actual evapotranspiration e t a c t e s c and abstractions a e s c constitute the outflows what is remained here is the recharge i e s c the water balance is expressed for the monthly seasonal and annual periods the annual water balance for the escarpment can be expressed as follows 4 r e s c e t a c t e s c q o u t e s c a e s c i e s c the rainfall on the graben bottom rgrab and the runoff outflow from the escarpments qout esc qin grab are the input components of the graben bottom while the runoff outflow qout grab actual evapotranspiration etact grab and abstractions agrab constitute the main output of the yearly water balance in the graben bottom 5 r g r a b q i n g r a b q o u t g r a b e t a c t g r a b a g r a b i g r a b the yearly water storage in the raya and ashenge grabens are the residuals of the water budget fluxes of the escarpments i e s c and graben bottom i g r a b the residual term represents the recharge and the errors related to the estimation uncertainties of the water balance here it is important to note that the storage equation expresses the balance between the inflow outflow and the storage change for any water body during a certain period wmo 2012 the change in storage inflow outflow is expressed in the form of residuals in the water balance equation in the graben unit the remaining water is the aggregate of the groundwater recharge and deep percolation below the phreatic zone due to the presence of a series of fault lines and more than 300 m thick deposits fig 2 we assume that the groundwater of the grabens is flowing to the very thick sediment deposits 1400 m of the dallol graben 14 23 40 29 in the western afar margin hagos et al 2016 equally bense et al 2003 also noted that deep faults enhance the vertical groundwater flow through deep seepage we calculated the rate of infiltration or percolation rate i mm day 1 in the graben system using the annual water excess or change in storage see eqs 4 and 5 s mm divided by the catchment area a m2 and the number of days in a hydrological year t day domenico and schwartz 1998 6 i s a t 2 2 3 data analysis the required data set were monitored to address the main research question we applied descriptive statistics to summarize the catchment characteristics rainfall floods baseflow runoff coefficients eto etact and water abstractions next a two sample t test and the anova models were applied to compare the average values of the rainfall depth river flows and etact depths on various spatial scales in addition a pearson correlation was calculated to understand the association between the rainfall depths at different rain gauge stations and elevations moreover a multiple regression model was applied to capture the dominant factors affecting the flood production from the western escarpments ultimately we analyzed the water budget components of the grabens using the eq 4 and 5 2 2 4 data quality data quality tests on the normality and equality of variance were carried out using the q q plot to detect anomalies we also assessed the model performance of the rating curves based on the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 α 5 notably the metric staff gauges were attached to the diver access tube in order to measure the stage of the water manually at a 10 min interval to verify and validate the flow depth captured by the pressure transducers this helps to compare the flow depths measured with micro diver sensor and staff gauge manual in addition verification of the observed flood events in the 2015 2017 were undertaken table s2b using the modified rational formula salmasi et al 2013 to check the river flow data quality 3 results 3 1 rainfall distribution in the marginal grabens table 2 shows the rainfall depth on event monthly seasonal and annual distribution in the graben systems for the period 2015 2017 in the marginal grabens the timing of the rains was erratic mainly in the dry year the highest rainfall event depths in 2015 2017 were 98 7 mm belago station 95 5 mm kelesa station and 127 3 mm meshena station respectively the study area received up to 751 mm in the rainy season during which the highest rainfall depths were recorded in august 407 3 mm the average rainfall depths in jas july september are higher than the sum of jfm january march amj april june and ond october december by a factor of 1 3 table 3 next to the rainy season summer belg season february and march was found a short spring rainy season however the rest months are dry months therefore rainfall depth showed a strong seasonal variation one way anova shows that the average rainfall depths varied significantly among 2015 2017 p 0 001 where 2015 had the lowest rainfall depth furthermore the rainfall variability was particularly pronounced at the graben bottom compared to the graben escarpments and highlands figs 1 and 3 the northern part of the escarpment also had lower rainfall depth than the southern end of the western escarpment result from t test shows that the average rainfall depths were different between the escarpments and graben bottoms p 0 001 a quantity almost twice as large as the rainfall received by the graben bottom was recorded in the graben escarpments this result was further confirmed by a pearson correlation test showing a positive correlation between the rainfall depth and altitude r 0 62 p 0 001 for example the headwaters of the catchment 10 13 and 22 fig 1 have higher rainfall depths fig 3 the ashenge graben has similar rainfall depths at the raya graben escarpment 3 2 river discharges in marginal grabens 3 2 1 flood events and volumes the average number of the annual flood events at the river stations for 2016 25 2 4 2 events amounted to nearly two times the number of flood events experienced in 2015 12 3 1 3 events although the flood events were limited to august the average number of flood events in 2017 was 23 2 5 events similar to the number of flood events received in 2016 moreover the duration of the flood events ranged from 10 min at the anachu station to 37 h at the golina station with an extrme flood discharges of 732 m³ s 1 fig 4 the large number of zero flood days in 2015 resulted in low total flood volumes the flood volume indicates the amount of discharge generated in the specific time scale floods with high discharges reached the graben bottom outlets in 2016 and 2017 the annual flood volumes vary among the catchments in the study area table 3 accordingly the most significant share of the flood volumes was delivered to the raya graben bottom through the golina 39 75 mm3 and gobu 34 71 mm3 rivers in 2016 the graben bottom lost 18 19 and 13 85 mm3 through selekberi and merkehora the annual flood volumes from the raya escarpment recorded in 2015 2017 were 139 63 209 25 and 159 48 mm3 respectively table 3 as it is a closed graben system however the ashenge graben did not have surface runoff outflows in the observed years table 4 3 2 2 baseflow many springs discharge to the streams as a baseflow to the graben bottoms about half of the rivers had baseflows except for the golina river with its greater river discharge and steeper river bed gradient however these river baseflow discharges decrease when reaching the floodplain they become influent streams as they quickly returned to zero flow after the rainfall storms in this study the influent streams refer to streams losing water to the ground hence contributing water to the saturated zone at the golina station the maximum baseflow amounted to 9 4 m3 s 1 in august 2016 whereas the lowest baseflow was 0 09 m3 s 1 in may the average baseflow from the western escarpment was similar to the average baseflow leaving the raya graben similarly the western escarpments contributed to higher annual baseflows than those who left the raya graben bottom via the merkehora and selekberi outlets we found that the 5 04 10 5 and 9 mm3 baseflow volumes contributed in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively to the ashenge graben bottom the baseflows from the ashenge escarpment infiltrate the thick sediment and re emerge in the mouth of the lake the behaviour of the ashenge river baseflow was similar to the raya escarpment base flow as they have a similar waterscape fig 1 3 2 3 river discharge the spatiotemporal variabilities of the river discharges floods and baseflows mimic the rainfall depths in the marginal grabens the total annual river discharge of the raya graben escarpment was higher in 2017 than in 2015 table 3 these volumes were the input of the graben bottom however the graben bottom lost about 95 mm3 runoff discharge volume per year moreover about 11 mm3 of the river runoff entered the ashenge graben bottom per year there is no surface outflow from the ashenge graben in both grabens a higher streamflow was found in 2016 than in 2015 the flood volumes were higher than the baseflow during the period 2015 2017 fig 5 the regression equation reveals that the catchment size maximum elevation of the headwaters and steep slopes positively predicted the annual flood volumes p 0 001 r2 0 98 moreover another regression model indicates that the catchment area p 0 001 r2 0 61 and woody vegetation cover p 0 05 r2 0 61 significantly enhanced the yearly river baseflows at the western escarpment furthermore rehabilitated areas had higher baseflows than areas with less woody vegetation p 0 01 thus the river discharge volumes showed a temporal variation where severe shortages in the streamflow and surface water storage were observed in 2015 3 2 4 runoff depths and their coefficients the average of the annual runoff depth the amount of runoff recorded in the year over the three studied years at the raya graben escarpment 125 mm was larger than in the graben bottom 26 mm similarly the annual runoff depth at the ashenge graben escarpment 291 mm was larger than in the ashenge graben bottom 260 mm the ashenge graben 276 mm had higher average annual river runoff depth compared to the raya graben 76 mm similar to the annual runoff depths the runoff coefficient showed a spatial variation in the grabens fig 6 table 5 the annual runoff coefficient increased from hara 0 16 in the north to golina 0 27 in the south in the deep sediment deposits the runoff coefficient amounted to 0 12 following the river s longitudinal profile the annual runoff coefficients for the mesanu station 2460 m a s l anachu station hara station and selekberi station 1397 m a s l were 0 33 0 21 0 16 and 0 10 respectively table 5 in a nutshell the average annual runoff coefficient of the raya escarpment was 0 22 thus rehabilitating of degraded bare areas induced a runoff coefficient variation 3 3 actual evapotranspiration variabilities in the weather elements such as temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours accelerate the evaporative powers of the atmosphere fig 7 while the air temperature seldom exceeds 35 c in june when the sun is overhead in the graben bottom the minimum air temperature decreases to 12 2 c at the graben bottoms moreover high wind speed and sunshine hours induce a high atmospheric water demand in the graben bottom fig 8 and table 6 depicts the comparisons of etact and eto mm in the raya graben the daily etact of the escarpments in 2016 was 2 7 2 24 mm day 1 whereas the average daily etact of the graben plains in 2016 was 2 09 2 66 mm day 1 as a response to the rainfall depth variability the monthly etact values varied among the observation periods table 6 besides the etact of the graben escarpments was higher than the graben bottoms due to a better moisture availability to conclude the etact was prone to the altitudinal difference between the graben bottoms and escarpments in both grabens 3 4 graben water withdrawals withdrawal is the extraction of water from a surface reservoir or an aquifer in the grabens surface and groundwater resources in the grabens accommodate considerable human and livestock populations table 7 the average annual water withdrawals from the raya graben escarpment and graben bottom amounted to 16 67 and 30 32 mm3 per year respectively however the average yearly water withdrawals are insignificant in the ashenge graben table 7 3 5 dovetailing the water budget components spatiotemporal variations of water balance components exist in the marginal grabens fig 9 table 8 the inflow and outflow water fluxes in the raya graben escarpment led to an average annual water recharge of 103 mm3 at a rate of infiltration percolation of 0 16 mm day 1 besides 258 91 mm3 water volumes were recharged in the raya graben bottom at a percolation rate of 0 41 mm day 1 in the entire system 261 452 and 370 mm3 groundwater recharged in 2015 2017 respectively table 8 on the other hand an average of 1 77 mm3 water volume was recharged in the ashenge graben escarpment at an infiltration rate of 0 13 mm day 1 table 9 in addition the average annual recharge of the floodplain was 19 7 mm3 at a percolation rate of 1 21 mm day 1 in the ashenge closed graben 8 30 and 25 mm3 water of volume recharged in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively while the infiltration of the raya graben is 0 28 mm day 1 the infiltration rate of the ashenge graben is 0 73 mm day 1 generally the water balance components varied between the studied grabens fig 10 tables 8 and 9 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall is a dominant input to the graben water balance rainfall constitutes the major water resource of the fragile graben ecosystem the study indicates that rainfall shows significant temporal variations e g fig 6a and b in particular 2015 experienced a lower rainfall depth due to a most probably congruence with el niño philip et al 2018 the rainfall depths in the graben bottoms were small irregular and more variable than on the escarpments in 2015 however the rainfall volume on the graben bottom of 2016 was almost twice as much as in 2015 there were substantial rainfall gradients between the merkehora graben bottom outlet 1357 m a s l and the headwater of the golina inlet 4025 m a s l where the rainfall of the latter exceeds the former area annys et al 2017 also reported that the rainfall was higher towards the southern direction of the study area due to the latitude elevation local aspect slope and topographic effects most rain volumes 75 infiltrated on the graben escarpments the intense 2015 el niño event increased the severity of the drought in northern ethiopia philip et al 2018 our findings are align well with the results of asfaha et al 2016 demissie et al 2017 jacob et al 2013 frankl et al 2013 and lanckriet et al 2015a who reported that the rainfall showed spatial variation in northern ethiopia overall the entire grabens experienced a rainfall shortage in 2015 leading to meteorological and agricultural droughts these droughts in turn caused large harvest losses in the study area 4 2 river discharges propagated in the marginal grabens the atmospheric water supply rainfall controls the river discharges in the marginal grabens the more considerable rainfall depth in 2016 and 2017 resulted in more substantial variations of river discharges dramatic runoff decreases brought a harmful impact on the water supply fig 11 as a response graben communities diverted much of the summer floods for agricultural uses spate irrigation fig 11c these flood diversions led to several flood events that did not reach the graben bottom outlets in 2015 the differences in the flash flood runoff showed a spatial variation in the grabens because of their steep slope and better rainfall depths the runoff depths of the grabens escarpments were higher than those from the graben bottoms p 0 01 the study reports that annual runoffs of golina river in 2015 2017 were about 40 5 62 7 and 51 9 mm3 respectively the annual recharge obtained in this study is in the same order of magnitude with abdu 2011 who reported that the runoff of the golina perennial river is about 61 mm3 year 1 in this study we found that the vast catchments and elevated headwaters of the first order streams e g golina catchment produced large floods the flash floods fig 4 are obvious observations for the short and long intense floods in the semi arid environments vanmaercke et al 2010 comparatively the graben bottom experienced an inadequate surface water resources than the escarpments thus the dynamic behaviour of river discharges severely affected the blue and green waters availability in the low lying areas of the studied grabens the blue water is the water in rivers lakes wetland and shallow aquifers while green water is rainfall water stored in an unsaturated soil and later used for evapotranspiration zang et al 2012 according to our analysis the forest cover decreases from north to south on the western escarpment the area without vegetation e g baren land and farmland of the burqua catchment at the north end of the raya escarpment was 35 in 2017 conversely the bare land and farmland of the legeharo catchment at the south end of the raya graben escarpment was 64 in 2017 fig 1 the difference in land cover within the same graben escarpment could lead to a variation of the runoff coefficient between 32 legeharo and 18 burqa in northern ethiopia degraded landscapes have been enclosed nyssen et al 2015 after closure of the area integrated soil and water conservation activities e g reforestation soil bunds and stone bunds were being practiced asfaha et al 2016 with the passage of time these degraded areas were turned to greener area nyssen et al 2010 these areas we called them rehabilitated catchments in agreement with guzha et al 2018 and nyssen et al 2015 this study shows that the rehabilitated catchments e g hara catchment increased the on site river baseflow to the graben bottom in contrast the runoff coefficient for the hara rc 0 15 and etu stations rc 0 17 was higher than in the golina rc 0 09 and diqala stations rc 0 08 nyssen et al 2010 also reported that the catchment management has resulted in a higher infiltration rate and a reduction of direct runoff volume by 81 which has had a positive influence on the water balance here catchment management refers to a sound planning soil and water resources in the grabens for sustainable use it is balancing the use and conservation of natural resources on a the studied grabens this study indicates that rehabilitated areas retain the streamflow during the rainy season and later water supply in the dry season in line with meaza et al 2016 rehabilitated areas had higher baseflows and springs than areas with less woody vegetation equally other studies reveal that the afforestation increased baseflow elsewhere ahiablame et al 2017 asfaha et al 2015 demissie et al 2015 dessie et al 2014 on an annual basis guyassa 2017 also reported that the exclosures on steep slopes up to 20 absorbed 778 mm water depth in addition to the rainfall that is partially transported to the downstream area a baseflows this result indicates that the implementation of soil and water conservation measures at gira kahsu for example reduces the summer runoff the improvement in woody vegetation cover at the western escarpments resulted in a more stable water flow and a major water recharge during the wet season integrated rehabilitation interventions such as tree planting and terraces at the upper catchments can lead to an enhancement of the ecosystem services due to the increased baseflows and lateral flows garcia et al 2018 4 3 actual evapotranspiration and human activities removed the inflow in the grabens allen et al 1998 noted that the meteorological forcing elements fig 7 control the water availability of a catchment in particular etact reaches its maximum during the wet season due to the high soil moisture and warmer air temperature despite the solar radiation exposure fig 8 hence the study indicates that 80 of the annual rainfall of the raya graben bottom returned to the atmosphere similarly 82 of the rainfall left the ashenge graben bottom due to the high atmospheric water demand on a graben level 76 and 77 5 of the annual rainfall has left through the etact in the raya and ashenge grabens respectively this argument indicates that a massive water volume was lost via etact in the rainy season our result confirms the findings of zaninović and gajić čapka 2000 who reported that the atmospheric water demand in the lowlands reached up to 85 of the rainfall the abrupt changes in etact were a response to the rainfall surface temperature wind speed soil antecedent moisture crop types and crop growth stage variations despite the substantial difference in the rainfall depth between the escarpment and graben bottom there was a small change in the etact values between the graben bottoms and graben escarpments due to irrigation thus the etact shares the most significant output term in the water balance equation similarly zhang et al 2018 concluded that etact is a critical land surface flux that drives the water budget imbalance in the north china plain human activities affected the hydrological processes in the marginal grabens for example spate systems allow the flash floods to turn into productive water for irrigation fig 11c moreover inhabitants and livestock consumed water in the dry season similarly oliveira et al 2015 indicated that the water fluxes were disturbed by the degree of the human water interactions in the brazilian cerrado water abstraction by the etact household and livestock demands negatively affected the water availability in the study areas fig 11b as alluded above water depletion in the graben bottom resulted in a subtle hydrological drought in the marginal grabens following the guidelines for a sustainable land management gurtner et al 2011 windbreaks hedges living barriers and a good soil cover could contribute to minimize the excessive water losses from the irrigated farms 4 4 comparing the spatiotemporal groundwater recharges in the marginal grabens in agreement with kahsay et al 2018 the water recharges varied between the escarpments and graben bottom basins the recharge rates that pass through the vadose zone of the raya escarpment and its adjoining graben bottom were 0 16 mm day 1 and 0 41 mm day 1 respectively which is in line with the ranges of domenico and schwartz 1998 with this recharge rate the average annual recharge 2015 2017 of the raya and ashenge grabens were 103 and 267 mm respectively fig 9 however other study with limited field measurements showed that the long mean annual recharge in the basin was 55 mm kahsay et al 2018 overall the annual rate of recharge was about 258 9 mm3 in raya graben bottom including raya kobo area with this annual recharge the groundwater resource potential of raya graben bottom may about 9791 mm3 nadew et al 2018 in response to the rainfall the lowest annual groundwater recharge in the raya graben was recorded in 2015 whereas a significant volume was noticed in 2016 the average annual groundwater recharge of the raya graben escarpment and its low lying area shared 7 and 25 of the inflow to the graben respectively moreover the average percolation rate of the ashenge graben escarpment 0 13 mm day 1 was lower than its graben bottom 1 21 mm day 1 as a result the annual recharge of the ashenge escarpment and its floodplain amounted to 5 and 35 of the inflow respectively about 16 of the annual inflow to the raya graben was recharged while 30 of inflow to the ashenge terminal graben infiltrated during the observed climatic years the water balance closure problem is critical in the scientific hydrology sokolov and chapman 1974 it is crucial to note that the computations of water balance components may involve errors beven 2006 therefore the change of storage values may include errors due to the imperfections of the water balance elements the groundwater recharge of the raya graben escarpment is in line with the study which was carried out by abera et al 2017 in the upper blue nile basin located west of the study grabens the study highlights that the graben bottoms possessing thick alluvial deposits show a higher water storage capacity in the aquifers than the graben escarpments lanckriet et al 2015b also inferred that the water level in the ashenge lake has raised in the past 15 years due to the conservation efforts in the last decade deep percolations and seepages from each graben bottom to the subsequent lower basin are represented fig 10 the studies by ayenew et al 2013 and kebede et al 2008 show that the ashenge graben feeds the raya graben as a response to the hydraulic properties of the tectonic structures the deep cut fault could allow a deep drainage from the raya to the dallol graben further downstream fig 2 thus deep faulting and fracturing may permit inter basin water transfers in the danakil depression similar to the deep faults in the roer graben of germany that enhance a deep groundwater flow bense et al 2003 erratic rainfall occurrence disturbs the on site water storage in this study we observed that the moisture deficit eto etact increases while the excess of the soil water holding capacity r etact declines for almost ten months this result reveals that the climatic variability contributes to interannual variability of water balance terms carmona et al 2014 jillo et al 2017 reported that the climate variability induced a variability in the seasonal water balance moreover human activities that are linked to a high water demand provoked water storage propagations deng and chen 2017 according to fao 2011 the world experienced an increasing imbalance between the demand and availability for water resources the intensifying agriculture and etact affected the water storage in the grabens in particular coupled with the rainfall variability the rapid rates of agricultural development could increase the grabens water stress as a response appropriate basin management practices are needed in order to counter excessive and unproductive water loss via river outflows and evapotranspiration percolation ponds harvesting water and floodwater spreading could especially enhance the availability of river baseflows during the dry seasons building shallow wells and micro dams at the graben bottom outlets could raise the water table the water harvesting structures on the upstream downstream and social ecological systems are intensifying worldwide andersson et al 2011 this study indicates that the upstream water management intervention could reduce or improve the water availability for the downstream areas during the climatic year for example the large scale intensification of water harvesting in the tana graben improves the water storage for downstream areas dile et al 2016 therefore an integrated land rehabilitation on the escarpments enhances the river baseflow in the low lying area in line with roobavannan et al 2017 the on site water use efficiency through the reduction of water loss from the unwanted drainage and seepage could improve the water storage both in soil and groundwater optimizing irrigation water levels e g deficit irrigation practice saves irrigation water also improves water production in graben agricultural areas ayenew et al 2013 the water use efficiency is crucial as commercial land investors and farmers will engage in irrigated agriculture in the graben bottoms with an increasing agricultural investment in such geographical confined areas the sector is expected to be a water competitor in the near future preparing for the future decision makers and farmers could therefore benefit from this study to optimize the on site water storage in the confined grabens 5 conclusions the objective of this study was to investigate the water balance components of the potential agricultural grabens along the rift valley in northern ethiopia in the grabens 2015 was a very dry year compared to 2016 and 2017 the average annual rainfall on the escarpments was nearly twice the rainfall amount in the graben bottom the rainfall variation governed the flash floods baseflows and the actual evapotranspiration in the study area our results indicate that the flood runoff coefficient significantly varied between the vegetated catchments and the deforested slopes moreover nearly half of the runoff discharges reaching the raya graben bottom flushed through towards the outlet the study also indicates that evapotranspiration represents more than half of the annual rainfall of the graben bottom in the studied grabens the graben bottoms with thick alluvial deposits stored more water in the graben aquifers than the graben escarpments in conclusion there is a good rate of groundwater recharge in the basalt marginal graben bottoms however the recharge along the graben escarpment could be improved through integrated watershed management practices with good land and water management practices there is a strong prospect of developing water resources for sustainable agricultural development in the grabens as there are ambitious irrigation development plans this study will contribute to sustaining livelihood

8438,study region in this study three provinces in northeast vietnam including bac kan thai nguyen and tuyen quang are examined to determine the precipitation variation characteristics study focus the average yearly temperature during the last two decades in northeast vietnam has increased by 0 72 c when compared to the period 1962 1990 the clausius clapeyron cc relation indicates that a warmer atmosphere can result in higher moisture holding capacity hence there is the possibility of increased extreme rainfall with respect to the rise in temperature we evaluate the relationship between the average 24 hour temperature and rainfall extremes using the binning method the estimation of the 24 hour probable maximum precipitation pmp is then implemented based on the moisture maximization and hershfield statistical methods new hydrological insights for the region the 99 9th percentiles of 24 hour precipitation are close to the super cc scaling up to peak points of 22 6 25 6 c and decrease at higher temperatures the hershfield method produces 24 hour pmp results ranging from 232 mm to 895 mm pmp outputs using the moisture maximization method based on the 100 year dew point are higher than those results generated from the statistical method except for chiem hoa station considering possible changes in future relative humidity under a warming climate from gcms and rcm projections for two rcp scenarios rcp 8 5 indicates the possible rise in probable extreme precipitation keywords pmp clausius clapeyron rcp gcm northeast vietnam 1 introduction lying within the southeast asian typhoon belt vietnam experiences high frequencies of storms and heavy rainfall two obvious consequences of such extreme rainfalls are floods and landslides in vietnam the northeast region is considered one of the areas that is the most prone to such disasters and increases in frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events in a warming climate le et al 2014 climate change does have great impacts on extreme precipitation events and should be taken into consideration hardwick jones et al 2010 utsumi et al 2011 jakob and walland 2016 within the context of global temperature change extremely high precipitation intensities have been observed highlighting a relationship between extreme rainfall and air temperature berg and haerter 2013 panthou et al 2014 toure halimatou et al 2017 herath et al 2018 such extreme rainfall events have also been estimated using probable maximum precipitation pmp beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 lee et al 2016 2017 rastogi et al 2017 theoretically pmp is defined by the world meteorological organization wmo 2009a as the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration meteorologically possible for a design watershed or given storm area at a particular location at a particular time of year with no allowance made for long term climatic trends normally pmp is used to determine probable maximum flood pmf for the design of hydraulic structures the moisture maximization method beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 lee et al 2016 2017 and the hershfield method hershfield 1961 1965 casas et al 2011 jothityangkoon et al 2013 alias et al 2013 represent two of the most widely used approaches in pmp estimation the statistical method which was developed by hershfield focuses on the frequency analysis and the influence of outliers on the mean and standard deviation of observed series of annual maxima at the location of interest wmo 2009 micovic et al 2015 the moisture maximization method considers the maximization ratio which is the ratio between maximum precipitable water at a certain period of the year and actual precipitable water during a storm of interest precipitable water means the total amount of vapor water in the atmospheric column in the case of unavailable radiosonde data the surface dew point is used under the assumption of a saturated pseudo adiabatic atmosphere the maximum precipitable water can be estimated from the 100 year value or maximum observed value at a certain time window wmo 2009 beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 under the influence of a changing climate temperature increases are believed to drive the higher intensity of precipitation in many areas in the world jones et al 2010 jakob and walland 2016 herath et al 2018 such projection is mainly based on the hypothesis that the increase in water holding capacity of the atmosphere is associated with the rise in air temperature as described by the clausius clapeyron cc relationship utsumi et al 2011 assessments of temperature precipitation scaling are often implemented using a binning technique in order to determine precipitation event scale properties herath et al 2018 many studies pointed out that the scaling between temperature and extreme precipitation has a close relationship with rainfall percentile rain duration time scale and geographic location jakob and walland 2016 boessenkool et al 2016 herath et al 2018 for example hardwick jones et al 2010 concluded that the scaling relationship depends on rainfall percentile in other words the cc scaling theory is mainly based on extreme events rather than average ones studies about convective precipitation have shown a super cc scaling of about 14 15 per degree celsius at higher temperatures berg et al 2013 berg and haerter 2013 while a cc like scaling 6 7 per degree celsius was found at lower temperatures similar findings were also illustrated for a daily resolution utsumi et al 2011 berg and haerter 2013 in addition based on geographic region there are three major categories of the 99th percentile of 24 hour precipitation changes with temperature namely monotonic increase monotonic decrease and a peak like structure utsumi et al 2011 the fifth ipcc report also showed that future air temperature and humidity are expected to gradually increase ipcc 2015 jakob and walland 2016 thus climate change will have a strong impact on moisture maximization and pmp as a result recent studies have suggested that pmp is likely to rise in most areas of the world under a warmer climate beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 lee et al 2016 2017 rastogi et al 2017 though most developed countries have well maintained long term hydro climatic data difficulties in data availability are always a major issue hindering many studies in developing nations such as vietnam climate change is expected to increase the northeast region s vulnerability through increasing temperature and erratic precipitation abnormal rain which was difficult to anticipate in terms of intensity time and place has occurred more frequently in recent years monre 2016 in addition the magnitudes of the maximum precipitable water could rise with increasing air temperature and thus could magnify extreme rainfall in the future kunkel et al 2013 ishida et al 2018 therefore it is important to understand the precipitation variation characteristics in northeast vietnam especially in a warming climate taking these facts into account the main aims of this paper are to i identify the relationship between extreme 24 hour precipitation and average 24 hour temperature ii estimate 24 hour pmps in the study area and iii evaluate the possible impacts of a warming climate on extreme precipitation and pmp 2 study area and data 2 1 study area in this paper we examine the precipitation characteristics of three provinces in northeast vietnam namely bac kan bk thai nguyen tn and tuyen quang tq fig 1 this area is covered by a mixture of mountainous and hilly terrain landscapes during the period of 1960 to 2016 the average annual rainfall in this area was 1380 1900 mm the rainy season often spans from may to october with average monthly rainfall and average monthly temperature of 108 317 mm and 23 8 26 9 c respectively the highest 24 hour precipitation in each month varies from 255 mm may to 506 mm july and from 375 mm to 231 mm in the remaining three months in addition the largest 24 hour precipitation at 14 out of 18 rain stations coincided with typhoon related events according to historical typhoon data from noaa chu et al 2017 about 68 tropical cyclones in north vietnam occurred from 1960 to 2016 heavy rainfall in this area is not only a result of troughs and tropical concentration lines across the delta but typhoon related events that hit inland of vietnam and south china as well for example due to the influence of typhoon bilis in 2006 in south china the greatest 24 hour precipitation rmax occurred at cho ra cr 211 mm chiem hoa ch 506 mm ham yen hy 338 mm and tuyen quang tq 316 mm this typhoon also led to heavy rainfall 166 341 mm day at five rain gauge stations in bac kan province typhoons which hit inland vietnam could lead to heavy rainfall in a larger region in each province of the study area for instance typhoon durian in 2001 brought heavy precipitation to six rain stations in thai nguyen 208 349 mm day and five rain stations in tuyen quang 160 361 mm day typhoon noname in 1986 also led to heavy precipitation 150 229 mm day at five stations in bac kan troughs low atmospheric pressure or tropical concentration lines showed rare magnitudes of 24 hour precipitations rmax at dinh hoa dh 276 mm thai nguyen tn 375 mm bac kan bk 305 mm and ngan son ns 260 mm 2 2 hydro meteorological data in bac kan thai nguyen and tuyen quang provinces there are eight meteorological stations and 34 rain gauge stations 21 stations of which were constructed before 2006 many rain gauges have discontinuous data meaning they record only some rainy months of the year or have missing data for years or months short length data recent construction stations or are manually measured by local people stations including bk cr ns dh tn ch hy and tq have been measuring surface meteorological parameters such as precipitation r temperature t and relative humidity rh since 1962 table 1 in this paper we therefore utilized the average 24 hour data of r t and rh from 1962 to 2016 from eight meteorological stations to evaluate the characteristics of precipitation to evaluate the spatial distribution of storm rainfall as a function of storm duration the depth area duration dad curve is often established wmo 1969 in this study we selected heavy storm events to envelop a depth area curve of the 24 hour rainstorm wmo 1969 2009a based on the thiessen polygon weighting method in addition to inverse distance weight idw interpolation wmo 1969 shin et al 2013 as represented in fig 2 climate data that is daily temperature data were obtained from the world climate research programme cmip5 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 for gcms and the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex in the east asia region for rcms the specification of each model is shown in table 2 using the climate data operators cdo program schulzweida 2018 we evaluated two global climate models from japan including miroc 5 mir watanabe et al 2010 and mri cgcm3 mri yukimoto et al 2012 and one regional climate model namely hadgem3 ra hag baek et al 2013 davies et al 2005 rcp4 5 stabilization scenario and rcp8 5 pessimistic emission scenario were considered regarding two time periods 2050 2021 2050 and 2080 2051 2080 3 methodology in order to evaluate the behavior of extreme precipitation in a changing climate we analyzed the relationship between temperature and extreme rainfall during the rainy season the probable maximum precipitation pmp was then estimated using historical meteorological data for simplification we estimated the possible changes in relative humidity at high temperatures based on historical data and considered the changes in projected temperature global climate models gcms and regional climate model rcm and relative humidity in order to evaluate the extent of changes in pmp under climate change condition the method developed in the present study is described in fig 3 3 1 precipitation and temperature scaling analysis it is important to understand the relationship between extreme precipitation and one of its related meteorological variable atmospheric temperature especially under changing climate conditions the binning technique has been widely applied to evaluate such a relationship between temperature and precipitation t r hardwick jones et al 2010 lenderink et al 2010 utsumi et al 2011 herath et al 2018 based on recent literature two main approaches in the t r analysis include the same bin width and the same number of samples in each temperature bin in the former method precipitation is paired with temperature with an equal width such as 1 c berg et al 2013 since the utilization of even width bin sometimes leads to fewer samples in some bins especially in lower and upper temperature ranges hardwick jones et al 2010 the equal bin width method with adjustment to assure a given minimum of samples in each bin offers an interesting alternative for example utsumi et al 2011 used the 2 c bin with minimum samples of 150 for the global study berg et al 2009 defined the minimum samples of 300 for each bin width in their study of the entire european domain in the latter method t r pairs are placed in each bin in order to have the same sample size regardless of the bin width for example 233 events per one bin in a research of hardwick jones et al 2010 however it is sometimes difficult to obtain the same sample size within each of the smallest temperature bins e g 0 1 c to determine the behavior of extreme precipitation we set up a relationship between 24 hour rainfall and average 24 hour air surface temperature for wet events which have been defined differently in various studies according to the world meteorological organization guidelines wmo 2009b precipitation depths with a threshold of 1 mm 10 mm and 20 mm are set for wet day events r1 heavy precipitation r10 and very heavy precipitation r20 respectively for a given rainfall duration wet day events were also set as 0 3 mm herath et al 2018 0 1 mm hardwick jones et al 2010 0 3 mm hour panthou et al 2014 or 20 mm toure halimatou et al 2017 in the vietnamese government standard vietnam standard 2015 the 24 hour rainfall amount from 51 mm and above r51 is considered a rain induced waterlogging event in addition the wmo guideline wmo 2009b indicates that the 95th percentile of precipitation p95 on wet days is used to determine a very wet day event while an extremely wet day event is calculated from the 99th percentile of precipitation p99 recent studies have applied the 50th hardwick jones et al 2010 herath et al 2018 75th berg and haerter 2013 90th panthou et al 2014 99th utsumi et al 2011 or 99 9th lenderink et al 2011 percentiles of precipitation for given rainfall duration in the t r scaling analysis in this study we evaluated the behavior of the 99 9th percentile precipitation p99 9 on wet days r1 and heavy rain days r51 of the rainy season may october at eight meteorological stations from 1962 to 2016 during this period the total number of wet days r1 and heavy rain days r51 at eight stations were 32 243 and 2579 for temperature ranges of 13 8 38 c and 16 6 30 7 c respectively fig 4 a illustrates the number of days in each temperature bin width of 1 c since there were great differences between sample sizes in each bin width pairs of average 24 hour temperature and rainfall were allocated in each bin width of 1 c more or less to ensure a given minimum number of samples in each bin such as 150 r1 and 50 r51 for the whole study region the cc scaling was used to examine the possible changes in the precipitation as a function of changes in temperature the exponential regression was applied to determine precipitation pt δt that related to changes in temperature δt hardwick jones et al 2010 as described in eq 1 1 p t δ t p t 1 α δ t where t is air temperature c δt refers to the rise in temperature c pt and pt δt denote rainfall at air temperature t and t δt respectively mm and α represents the rate at which precipitation changes with temperature for example α 0 07019 and α 0 0607 are equivalent to cc scaling of 7 019 per degree celsius at 4 c and 6 007 per degree celsius at 24 c respectively 3 2 estimation of the pmp 3 2 1 the statistical method this approach applies the hershfield method 1961 to estimate the pmp wmo 2009a as described in eq 2 2 p m p r n s n k m r n s n r m a x r n 1 s n 1 where pmp is probable maximum precipitation mm r and s are in mm representing mean and standard deviation sub index n and n 1 refer to annual extreme series and annual extreme series excluding the largest value respectively rmax is the maximum rainfall in the series mm km substitutes for the statistical variable which represents the maximum value within the observed series of storm events 3 2 2 the maximization method this method considers the maximization ratio between maximum precipitable water wmax at a certain period of the year and actual precipitable water ws of the storm event associated with precipitation r mm as described in eq 3 3 p m p r w m a x w s where ws refers to precipitable water estimated for the storm mm and wmax represents the maximum precipitation water indicated for the storm reference location mm in addition to station elevation dew point temperature the day of storm occurrence td is used to determine ws wmax is also computed regarding location of station and maximum dew point temperature tdmax which can be taken as the 100 year return period td 100 of maximum dew point in the month of the storm occurrence it also can be maximum dew point within 15 days td 15d 15 days after the storm event within a 30 day window td 30d 15 days before and 15 days after the storm or the largest value of tdmax series in a month of the storm event td month wmo 2009a lee et al 2016 in practice after selecting extreme rainfall events precipitable waters were determined using annex 1 of the wmo manual on the estimation of pmp wmo 2009a taking station elevation and surface dew point temperature td into consideration normally a persisting 12 hour dew point temperature is used for storm maximization according to the wmo manual a 24 hour interval can be used for longer storm duration in some tropical areas to select historical maximum dew points and representative dew points of storms wmo 2009a the application of the 24 hour dewpoint for adjusting storm rainfall can be an alternative in pmp calculation as it provides few differences from the application of the 12 hour representative storm dew point in case the td record is unavailable an average 24 hour surface dew point temperature is estimated based on the average 24 hour relative humidity rh and surface temperature t as described in eq 4 alduchov and eskridge 1996 lawrence and planck 2005 4 t d 243 04 ln r h 100 17 625 t 243 04 t 17 625 ln r h 100 17 625 t 243 04 t where td refers to dew point temperature oc rh represents relative humidity and t is surface temperature oc 3 3 pmp and climate change as mentioned in section 3 2 2 the determination of wmax which often depends on the elevation of observation location temperature and relative humidity has a critically important role in pmp calculation because raw climate model data often has a significant bias correction for a specific study site is therefore necessary the adjustment of climatic model simulations can be implemented by bias correction methods including linear scaling local intensity scaling variance scaling distribution scaling power transformation or distribution mapping terink et al 2009 2010 teutschbein and seibert 2012 chen et al 2013 fang et al 2015 while precipitation changes are often evaluated using a ratio of future to historical data changes in temperature are often estimated based on the difference between the future and historical data pierce et al 2015 being considered as an approximately normally distributed variable the temperature is often corrected through its mean and variance using the variance scaling method terink et al 2010 teutschbein and seibert 2012 hawkins et al 2013 fang et al 2015 in this approach it is assumed that bias correction would be stationary this means that the current correction parameters are valid in future cases teutschbein and seibert 2012 pierce et al 2015 using r package killick and eckley 2013 2016 we implemented a change point analysis to identify changes in mean for monthly temperature data in the rainy season at eight stations in regard to three methods amoc at most one change pelt pruned exact linear time and binseg binary segmentation in general the mean values of monthly temperature from may october in this study site experienced change points within a 10 year period fig 5 table 3 in addition according to the guidelines on the calculation of climate normals wmo 2017 the standard normal can be applied to assess climatological surface parameters such as air surface temperature the basic assumption of a stationary climate assumes that the climate is variable however the variations properties are considered to be constant with time wmo 2017 with respect to teutschbein and seibert 2012 the procedures of bias correction utilized a transformation algorithm in order to adjust the output of gcms and rcm and to identify possible biases between observation and simulation data in addition the major contributor to differences between observed data and model output are considered as a bias correction rather than climatic differences between two time periods teutschbein and seibert 2012 pierce et al 2015 according to wmo guidelines wmo 2017 normals refer to an average computational time for a uniform and relatively long period covering at least three consecutive ten year periods in this paper we therefore apply the variance scaling method to correct temperature series for 30 year periods including 1971 2000 for historical records h and 2021 2050 and 2051 2080 for future f projections with respect to observations o and climate models output m the corrected daily future temperature tf on a j th day d of an i th month m is calculated based on the relationship between mean t and standard deviation s of monthly temperature from historical observation o h and historical simulation m h as indicated in eq 5 5 t f m i d j t o h m i s o h m i s m h m i t m f m i d j t m h m i where t f m i d j represents the corrected daily future temperature oc on the jth day of the ith month t o h m i and t m h m i denote mean the monthly temperature oc in the i th month mi of historical observation data o h and historical data of model output m h respectively s o h m i and s m h m i illustrate the standard deviation of monthly temperature oc in the ith month of historical observation and historical model output respectively t m f m i d j refers to the future temperature oc obtained from the climate models projection on the j th day of the i th month regarding the projected temperature for each climate model the maximum rh rhmax was estimated based on the analysis of historical temperature and rh t rh using the binning method relative humidity was paired with temperature using the equal bin width of 0 1 c the largest value of rh within each bin was defined as the maximum magnitude of relative humidity rhmax at that temperature the upper boundary of rhmax at high temperature was then identified to evaluate possible maximum relative humidity based on projected temperature the possible maximum dew points were then computed in accordance with future projected temperatures for each gcm rcp and rcm rcp in order to determine the possible wmax and pmp in a future month 4 result 4 1 precipitation and temperature scaling analysis in general the 99 9th percentile of two datasets r51 and r1 at all stations in the rainy season from may to october mo are associated with a peak point temperature of about 26 c then they decrease at higher temperatures fig 6 the cc like relation with the rate of 7 per degree celsius almost fits the rise of p99 9 r51 mo between 20 8 c and 22 6 c significant increases in extreme precipitation to the peak point temperature demonstrates super cc rates of 15 20 per degree celsius between 22 6 c and 25 6 c for p99 r51 mo p99 r1 mo and p50 r1 mo the decrease of extreme precipitation intensities at high temperature would be associated with the decline of relative humidity hardwick jones et al 2010 utsumi et al 2011 regarding t r analysis at each station the scaling rate of the 50th percentile of r51 agrees with cc like scale from 7 per degree celsius ns dh tn and tq to 10 per degree celsius cr ch and 20 per degree celsius bk hy the super cc scaling rates of more or less than 20 per degree celsius are shown for the three lines p99 9 r1 p99 9 r51 and p50 r1 fig 7 fig 7 also indicates that peak temperatures for p50 r1 and p50 r51 can occur at the ranges of 23 5 25 6 c at station elevations below 110 m dh ch hy tq and tn and 22 6 24 6 c at stations with higher elevation bk cr and ns with regard to the behavior of extreme events p99 9 of heavy rain days r51 at each station the peak temperatures vary from 23 5 c at ngan son ns to 26 5 c at tuyen quang tq in addition ns and cho ra cr stations which are located at the same latitude although ns differs in altitude elevation of 650 m have higher values of peak precipitation p99 9 r51 255 mm at 23 5 c than cr elevation of 165 m does 209 mm at 24 6 c in general higher elevation stations have lower peak temperatures except for thai nguyen tn station which is located on hilly terrain known as a transiting region between delta and mountainous areas additionally apart from tn a midland station similar peak point temperatures and similar scaling trends are seen for both series p99 9 r1 and p50 r1 for the other stations 4 2 pmp determination 4 2 1 statistical method in the hershfield method we selected the largest value of 24 hour precipitation for each year from 1962 to 2016 to obtain a series of annual extreme 24 hour rainfall at each station the average value in each series r n varies from 94 3 mm at cho ra cr to 152 7 mm at thai nguyen tn the highest magnitude of 24 hour rainfall within each series rmax at seven stations fluctuated from 211 mm cr to 375 mm tn the greatest value of rmax was seen at chiem hoa station 506 1 mm pmp determination results at eight meteorological stations are illustrated in table 4 and fig 8 pmp which was determined by the statistical method pmp statistic varies from 232 mm cr to 895 mm ch with ratios between pmp and rmax of less than 1 8 from 1 07 at ns to 1 77 at ch almost all stations obtain km values that are less than 5 7 apart from chiem hoa ch 12 78 the differences between rmax and r n at four stations cr ns dh and tn range from 116 6 mm 124 at cho ra cr to 223 4 mm 145 at thai nguyen tn the outputs agree with the t r relationship section 4 1 in which the scaling analysis of the 99 9th percentile for two datasets r1 and r51 illustrates similar trends at those four stations fig 7 it is in favor of the fact that among 36 events of 24 hour rainfall above 200 mm at the study site there were 15 events at tn a station with the highest value of r n 152 7 mm in addition magnitudes of the largest rainfall rmax at three stations tq hy and bk are 191 211 mm 161 168 higher than the average values of the data series r n the difference between the apexes of the p99 9 r51 and p99 9 r1 scaling is 47 86 mm at the three aforementioned stations at which the km ranges from 4 58 to 5 63 interestingly the peak value in the p99 9 r51 scaling is 195 mm higher than the peak value in the p99 9 r1 scaling at chiem hoa this station also shows the greatest differences of 385 mm 318 between rmax and r n it reveals that the most extreme precipitation rmax of 506 1 mm at ch is significantly larger than values of the remaining data in the series of annual extreme 24 hour rainfall in which the second highest rain amount at this station is 195 9 mm 4 2 2 moisture maximization method pmps are computed using precipitation temperature and relative humidity data associated with some of the largest rain events at eight meteorological stations over 55 years from 1962 2016 the average number of days with rainfall amount above 200 mm at the study sites was 4 5 days 16 events at tn 1 event at cr ch and 3 4 events at other stations the computation of pmps is thus implemented based on the five storm events which were selected from the top five highest 24 hour precipitation amounts at each station the maximum result at each station was selected as the pmp at that rain gauge in practice precipitable water ws was determined using temperature and relative humidity of the day of occurrence of extreme events and related to the station elevation we calculated wmax using to four options of dew point maximization using historical data including td max corresponding to the 100 year dew point td 100 the largest value of tdmax in a month td month and maximum value within a window of 15 and 30 days td 15d td 30d of a storm event to evaluate the 100 year dew point temperatures td 100 for each selected month in which the top five highest 24 hour precipitation events occurred we tested five distributions namely the gumbel g normal n lognormal ln generalized extreme value gev including maximum likelihood estimates gev1 and probability weighted moment gev2 rousseau et al 2014 clavet gaumont et al 2017 in order to determine the best fit we conducted four goodness of fit gof tests the chi square test χ2 root mean square error rmse anderson darling test a d and kolmogorov smirnov test k s with the support of the comprehensive r archive network cran statistical packages gilleland and katz 2016 scholz and zhu 2018 the gof results are listed in table 5 the best distribution for each month of each station was obtained from the smallest gof result among the aforementioned distributions additionally the lowest ranking score which referred to the summary of each distribution s ranking results regarding each gof was represented as the selected distribution for each month at each station in summary the gev2 probability weighted moment estimator fits bk and tq the normal distribution performed well at four stations ns dh ch and hy cho ra station data is represented with the gumbel distribution however at the thai nguyen station a transition location between delta and mountain region each month has a specific distribution the selected distribution at each station except tn and selected distribution of each month at tn station were used to evaluate the 100 year dew point temperature for moisture maximization among the four approaches used to determine tdmax the td 100 and td month produce large pmps compared to the other two options i e td 15d and td 30d table 4 pmp values using the 100 year dew point option for moisture maximization at the study site are introduced in fig 8b fig 8c the distributions of pmps in the study area based on the two calculation methods have similar overall trends especially in the western region including the tuyen quang province and cr station in the bac kan province the statistical and moisture maximization methods both produced decreased pmps towards the southwest northeast direction in the upper part of the study site in addition fig 8 a illustrates the distribution of heavy rain in the study area given the influence of typhoon bilis 2006 which resulted in the most extreme 24 hour precipitation rmax at cr ch hy and tq stations section 2 1 because the bilis typhoon had direct impacts on the south china region at the study site the rainfall intensity from this typhoon reduced that of the northwest ch to the southeast tn regions however the pmp magnitudes obtained from two methods show the decrease in distribution towards the southeast northwest direction in the lower part of the study area thai nguyen province and the south region of bac kan province the result therefore depicts the great influence of terrain condition and typhoons direction or local atmospheric conditions on the distribution of extreme precipitation 4 3 future pmp estimation regarding wmo guideline wmo 2009a pmp is defined as the theoretical maximum precipitation for a given duration under modern meteorological conditions with no allowance made for long term climatic trends however in section 1 8 wmo also points out that in the 21st century it is likely to obtain the increase in the most extreme rainfall events as a result of the overall rise of moisture availability in a warming climate depth area curves moisture availability storm efficiency storm types and generalized rainfall depths are therefore considered important factors in assessing the possible influence of climate change on pmp according to two gcm models and an rcm we computed the average differences between corrected temperature using the variance scaling method t m o d e l i c o r r e c t and observation data tobs within the baseline 1971 2000 using rmse as illustrated in eq 6 6 r m s e i 1 n i 1 n t m o d e l i j c o r r e c t t o b s i j 2 where rmsei refers to root mean square error of daily temperature in the ith month c t m o d e l i j c o r r e c t represents the corrected temperature of the model on the jth day of the ith month c t o b s i j illustrates observed temperature on the jth day of the ith month c the average value of rmse within 12 months for corrected miroc 5 mri and hag at eight stations is 3 24 3 47 c 3 29 3 54 c and 3 20 3 45 c respectively the projection temperatures in each target year 2050 and 2080 for representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 corrected by the variance scaling method are illustrated in fig 9 comparing to historical data 1971 2000 an average monthly temperature at the study site regarding the gcm data is predicted to rise by 0 82 1 38 c and 1 16 2 86 c by the years 2050 and 2080 respectively rcm data generates an increase of 1 41 1 63 c in 2050 and 1 96 3 22 c in 2080 in addition hag model produces higher projected temperatures than those of miroc 5 in july and august by the year 2050 1 05 c and 2080 1 72 c respectively similar trends are illustrated in the remaining 10 months the series of 24 hour precipitation of above 200 mm at the study site illustrates that the temperature varies from 21 5 c to 28 5 c and relative humidity ranges from 85 to 99 fig 4 b the most extreme rainfall event at cr 506 1 mm occurred at considerably high rh 98 and temperature 25 9 c when compared to other precipitation events from 250 mm to 400 mm it is also predicted that there will be a rise in air moisture availability at high temperature which can lead to a higher probability of more extreme precipitation events fig 4 b in order to evaluate future scenarios of moisture maximization the possible maximum dew point temperature in the future was determined based on the rise in air temperature and relative humidity future dew point determination can be computed based on future daily average air temperature and relative humidity lee et al 2016 or scenarios of a future rise in air temperature and sea surface temperature and maximum relative humidity of 100 lee et al 2017 despite a fact that the northern region is located in a humid subtropical climate the monsoon system in relation to the variety of topographical relief results in the variation of climate from place to place during the rainy season southwesterly summer monsoon tropical cyclones from the east sea and tropical disturbances are some contributors to copious rains nguyen le et al 2014 do et al 2016 the asian summer monsoon performs a critically important role in precipitation supply and moisture transport from the indian ocean to the indochina peninsula while the western pacific sub tropical ridge fully dominates this area often has hot dry and sunny weather nguyen le et al 2014 it is also noted that the increase in air temperature itself could lead to a decrease in relative humidity to evaluate the relationship between relative humidity and temperature rh t we applied the binning method with the same bin width approach the highest value of rh within each bin width of 0 1 c in the rh t analysis was selected to evaluate the maximum relative humidity rhmax at that temperature bin fig 10 a regarding fig 10 a the rhmax at eight stations experienced declining trends associated with the rise in temperature at a threshold range of 23 26 c a peak temperature in scaling analysis of extreme precipitation therefore in this paper a larger value of rhmax at higher temperature was selected as an upper boundary of rh at that temperature points in fig 10 b the impact of station elevation on the rhmax t is also indicated in fig 10 b the upper boundary of rhmax t is therefore divided into three main types based on station elevations z i z 100 m tn hy tq ch ii 100 m z 150 m dh bk and iii z 150 m cr ns for the relative humidity future scenario the possible value of rh is determined based on projected temperature and upper boundary rhmax rhmax t regarding the three main above elevation classes rcp scenarios are described in fig 11 there is a rise in projected temperature regarding two gcms and one rcm for two rcps at the study site in addition to the critical condition of relative humidity at high temperature rhmax t pmp would therefore increase in the future 5 discussion 5 1 precipitation and temperature scaling analysis the peak structure of scaling analysis in the study area 21 22 n is suitable for the condition of mid latitude regions from 20 55 s and n utsumi et al 2011 the differences between r51 and r1 lines can show the role of extreme events in a dataset the extreme precipitation analysis depends on the rainfall threshold because small intensities of precipitation strongly affect the percentile computation as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 the p99 9 r51 which is not influenced by the small magnitude of precipitation presents greater values of extreme events than the p99 9 r1 does it is also noted that seasonal selection may affect the scaling trend at this study site heavy rain events are often associated with the occurrences of tropical typhoons and storms during the rainy season from may to october mo though downpour sometimes occurs in april due to troughs according to p99 9 r1 analysis fig 6 a temperature of 18 6 c experiences the second hump in the april to october ao dataset a slightly stable trend is illustrated within a temperature range of 17 6 19 6 c in the mo dataset when excluding april data p99 9 r1 mo from may to october is lower than p99 9 r1 ao from april to october at the temperature below 19 5 c in both cases 19 5 c can be considered a transition temperature when it provides a starting point for the second rise of the trend lines comparatively similar tendencies are seen at higher temperatures at the two datasets including and excluding april for further evaluation of scaling analysis we also set up the relationship between average 24 hour temperature and heavy precipitation r10 and very heavy precipitation r20 wmo 2009b with regards to the 99 9th percentile p99 9 of selected events r1 r10 r20 and r51 when the rainfall thresholds increase from 1 mm r1 to 51 mm r51 peak temperature at each station is stable at 23 5 25 6 c except for bk and tq stations there was a rise by 2 c in peak temperature at bk 23 5 25 5 c and tq 24 5 26 5 c fig 7 interestingly with respect to the 50th percentile determination for four options of rainfall thresholds r1 r10 r20 and r51 when the magnitudes rise from r1 to r51 peak temperatures decline by 1 c at three stations in the mountainous region ns cr and bk and at tn station and 2 c at two midland stations ch and hy a stable temperature of 24 6 c is seen at tq dh is the only station that experiences an increase of 0 9 c 24 6 25 5 c in addition the scaling rates of 10 per degree celsius for p50 r20 and p50 r10 are shown at two stations namely cr and ch while the six remaining stations experienced a rate of from 15 to 20 per degree celsius according to fig 7 the 50th percentile rainfall temperature scale values are lower than the 99 9th percentile scaling values the rise of scaling analysis associated with the rise of percentile may reveal that the temperature sensitivity for more extreme precipitation 99 9th percentile of 24 hour rainfall is higher than that for average extreme rainfall events 50th percentile of 24 hour rainfall it also implies that fully saturated conditions are likely to be present at more extreme precipitation events lenderink et al 2010 herath et al 2018 in addition we also evaluated the relationship between the logarithm of 24 hour precipitation log r and temperature t using linear regression in regard to the 99 9th p99 9 and 50th p50 percentiles of rainfall events r1 r10 r20 and r51 in general the p99 9 r51 has peak slope values from 0 038 tq to 0 218 dh within 24 27 c a range of regression slope from 0 059 ch to 0 139 hy is generated at 22 24 c relation to p99 r1 with regard to the 50th percentile when the rainfall thresholds increase from 1 mm to 51 mm there is a decrease in the temperature range which experiences a higher magnitude of linear slopes table 6a for example regarding to p50 r1 a maximum slope of 0 193 log mm c is shown at 22 26 c p50 r51 has the largest slope of 0 091 log mm c at temperature from 20 to 24 c with respect to the 50th percentile at each station the largest slope values also decrease when rainfall threshold varies from r1 to r51 table 6b 5 2 pmp and climate change in general the pmp computation corresponding to the 100 year maximum td in a storm event month are in good agreement with pmp rcp4 5 in 2050 and 2080 compared to historical data calculations the projected computations of pmp of gcms and rcm provide larger magnitudes of pmps for rcp8 5 especially in 2080 such rises occur at dh for rcm in 2050 24 5 gcm in 2080 21 7 and at ns in 2080 8 4 for gcm and 7 7 for rcm in the future climate model approach regarding stabilization scenario rcp4 5 pmp calculations at all stations are relatively stable for the two target years 2050 and 2080 there are moderate differences between historical data calculations and projected computation of pmp for rcp8 5 scenarios in the two target years especially in 2080 6 conclusion this study aims to assess the precipitation variation characteristics in northeast vietnam by identifying the relationship between extreme 24 hour rainfall and average 24 hour temperature the study also estimated the 24 hour probable maximum precipitation in the study area highlighting the possible impacts of warming climate on extreme rain and pmp results from scaling analysis of precipitation and temperature are suitable according to recent analysis berg et al 2009 hardwick jones et al 2010 utsumi et al 2011 rousseau et al 2014 such as the cc like rate at low temperature super cc rate at high temperature and the peak like structure at mid latitudes it also presents the effect of a time scale as well as the sensitive behavior of extreme rainfall towards temperatures when compared to the average approach the relationship between relative humidity and temperature reflects a similar trend in the scaling analysis same peak temperature of 25 26 c while the statistical method focuses only on the behavior of extreme rainfall events in historical data pmp results from the moisture maximization method which is based on the relationship with other meteorological parameters such as humidity and temperature and can be utilized in the further study especially in the context of a warming climate with a projected rise in temperature especially for rcp8 5 pmp is predicted to increase by the years 2050 and 2080 additionally the spatial distribution of pmps based on moisture maximization using 100 year dew point which refers to the most extreme rainfall events that possibly occur at a study area can be used in evaluating rain induce problems such as floods or landslide since statistical records are not available for public access lacking historical data has become one of the biggest difficulties for researchers in vietnam findings from this paper thus provide as an initial approach in evaluating extreme precipitation in this northeast region in cases where full meteorological data records arelacking nevertheless there are limitations in this study such as the sole application of 24 hour precipitation and air surface temperature to evaluate the cc scaling whilst the hypothesis of this scaling analysis only considers the intensity of rain events as a conditional factor for rainfall occurrence hardwick jones et al 2010 other governing factors such as sources of moisture regarding shorter durations like 1 to 6 h should be taken into further studies according to the pmp determination methods the occurrence of extreme precipitation often depends on many factors including moisture availability wind speed and direction temperature and topography condition the statistical method which only focuses on the variation of extreme precipitation reveals shortcomings pmps derived from the hershfield method tend to vary with changes in the size of annual extreme precipitation for example compared to the outputs resulting from 55 year data 1962 2016 the application of rain records from 1961 to 2016 at tq brings about a rise of 1 11 and 0 33 mm in the average and standard deviation values respectively the statistical variable km frequency factor declines by 0 13 the pmp also decreases from 363 34 mm 55 year data to 360 38 mm 56 year data in addition it is a fact that the spatial distribution of extreme rainfall is strongly affected by the orographic condition of the basin however the terrain features were neglected in the computation of moisture maximization approach in this paper the moisture maximization method which considers significant roles of available moisture in the occurrence of extreme rainfall also reveals some uncertainties such as in the procedure of determining maximum precipitable water wmax concerning the maximum dewpoint temperature tdmax in cases retrieving tdmax within a 15 day and 30 day windows regarding the date of a storm td 15d and td 30d the vapor water holding capacity of the atmosphere would decline when the condensation formation often leads to a decrease in the air temperature when the maximum dewpoint temperature is selected from the time series of annual maximum dewpoint td 100 and td month in the month that a storm occurs it is likely to obtain the series in a period that is warmer than that during the storm occurrence date since the precipitable water tends to rise with air temperature as described in the clausius clapeyron equation large maximization ratios would lead to higher pmps as discussed in section 4 2 2 moreover the paper utilized the average dewpoint temperature rather than 12 hour persisting values to represent the storm moisture it therefore would lead to the uncertainty of exaggeration in pmp values this article also based on the recommendations of the wmo guideline wmo 2017 in applying the 30 year standard normal to assess climatological surface parameters such as air surface temperature the basic assumption of stationary climate assumes that the climate is variable however the variations properties are considered to be constant with time wmo 2009b this application of a stationary climate would disregard climate change which can alter the variability and extremes of weather variables nathan et al 2016 comparisons with non stationary analyses of extreme weather variables are therefore necessary for future researches significant errors in the climate models in addition to the downscale method also would lead to uncertainties in the evaluation of future temperature at the study site whilst the pmp determination focused on the high magnitude of daily projected temperature the predicted trend of pmps under the rise of air temperature was evaluated to a certain extent conflicts of interests the authors declare

8438,study region in this study three provinces in northeast vietnam including bac kan thai nguyen and tuyen quang are examined to determine the precipitation variation characteristics study focus the average yearly temperature during the last two decades in northeast vietnam has increased by 0 72 c when compared to the period 1962 1990 the clausius clapeyron cc relation indicates that a warmer atmosphere can result in higher moisture holding capacity hence there is the possibility of increased extreme rainfall with respect to the rise in temperature we evaluate the relationship between the average 24 hour temperature and rainfall extremes using the binning method the estimation of the 24 hour probable maximum precipitation pmp is then implemented based on the moisture maximization and hershfield statistical methods new hydrological insights for the region the 99 9th percentiles of 24 hour precipitation are close to the super cc scaling up to peak points of 22 6 25 6 c and decrease at higher temperatures the hershfield method produces 24 hour pmp results ranging from 232 mm to 895 mm pmp outputs using the moisture maximization method based on the 100 year dew point are higher than those results generated from the statistical method except for chiem hoa station considering possible changes in future relative humidity under a warming climate from gcms and rcm projections for two rcp scenarios rcp 8 5 indicates the possible rise in probable extreme precipitation keywords pmp clausius clapeyron rcp gcm northeast vietnam 1 introduction lying within the southeast asian typhoon belt vietnam experiences high frequencies of storms and heavy rainfall two obvious consequences of such extreme rainfalls are floods and landslides in vietnam the northeast region is considered one of the areas that is the most prone to such disasters and increases in frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events in a warming climate le et al 2014 climate change does have great impacts on extreme precipitation events and should be taken into consideration hardwick jones et al 2010 utsumi et al 2011 jakob and walland 2016 within the context of global temperature change extremely high precipitation intensities have been observed highlighting a relationship between extreme rainfall and air temperature berg and haerter 2013 panthou et al 2014 toure halimatou et al 2017 herath et al 2018 such extreme rainfall events have also been estimated using probable maximum precipitation pmp beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 lee et al 2016 2017 rastogi et al 2017 theoretically pmp is defined by the world meteorological organization wmo 2009a as the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration meteorologically possible for a design watershed or given storm area at a particular location at a particular time of year with no allowance made for long term climatic trends normally pmp is used to determine probable maximum flood pmf for the design of hydraulic structures the moisture maximization method beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 lee et al 2016 2017 and the hershfield method hershfield 1961 1965 casas et al 2011 jothityangkoon et al 2013 alias et al 2013 represent two of the most widely used approaches in pmp estimation the statistical method which was developed by hershfield focuses on the frequency analysis and the influence of outliers on the mean and standard deviation of observed series of annual maxima at the location of interest wmo 2009 micovic et al 2015 the moisture maximization method considers the maximization ratio which is the ratio between maximum precipitable water at a certain period of the year and actual precipitable water during a storm of interest precipitable water means the total amount of vapor water in the atmospheric column in the case of unavailable radiosonde data the surface dew point is used under the assumption of a saturated pseudo adiabatic atmosphere the maximum precipitable water can be estimated from the 100 year value or maximum observed value at a certain time window wmo 2009 beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 under the influence of a changing climate temperature increases are believed to drive the higher intensity of precipitation in many areas in the world jones et al 2010 jakob and walland 2016 herath et al 2018 such projection is mainly based on the hypothesis that the increase in water holding capacity of the atmosphere is associated with the rise in air temperature as described by the clausius clapeyron cc relationship utsumi et al 2011 assessments of temperature precipitation scaling are often implemented using a binning technique in order to determine precipitation event scale properties herath et al 2018 many studies pointed out that the scaling between temperature and extreme precipitation has a close relationship with rainfall percentile rain duration time scale and geographic location jakob and walland 2016 boessenkool et al 2016 herath et al 2018 for example hardwick jones et al 2010 concluded that the scaling relationship depends on rainfall percentile in other words the cc scaling theory is mainly based on extreme events rather than average ones studies about convective precipitation have shown a super cc scaling of about 14 15 per degree celsius at higher temperatures berg et al 2013 berg and haerter 2013 while a cc like scaling 6 7 per degree celsius was found at lower temperatures similar findings were also illustrated for a daily resolution utsumi et al 2011 berg and haerter 2013 in addition based on geographic region there are three major categories of the 99th percentile of 24 hour precipitation changes with temperature namely monotonic increase monotonic decrease and a peak like structure utsumi et al 2011 the fifth ipcc report also showed that future air temperature and humidity are expected to gradually increase ipcc 2015 jakob and walland 2016 thus climate change will have a strong impact on moisture maximization and pmp as a result recent studies have suggested that pmp is likely to rise in most areas of the world under a warmer climate beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 lee et al 2016 2017 rastogi et al 2017 though most developed countries have well maintained long term hydro climatic data difficulties in data availability are always a major issue hindering many studies in developing nations such as vietnam climate change is expected to increase the northeast region s vulnerability through increasing temperature and erratic precipitation abnormal rain which was difficult to anticipate in terms of intensity time and place has occurred more frequently in recent years monre 2016 in addition the magnitudes of the maximum precipitable water could rise with increasing air temperature and thus could magnify extreme rainfall in the future kunkel et al 2013 ishida et al 2018 therefore it is important to understand the precipitation variation characteristics in northeast vietnam especially in a warming climate taking these facts into account the main aims of this paper are to i identify the relationship between extreme 24 hour precipitation and average 24 hour temperature ii estimate 24 hour pmps in the study area and iii evaluate the possible impacts of a warming climate on extreme precipitation and pmp 2 study area and data 2 1 study area in this paper we examine the precipitation characteristics of three provinces in northeast vietnam namely bac kan bk thai nguyen tn and tuyen quang tq fig 1 this area is covered by a mixture of mountainous and hilly terrain landscapes during the period of 1960 to 2016 the average annual rainfall in this area was 1380 1900 mm the rainy season often spans from may to october with average monthly rainfall and average monthly temperature of 108 317 mm and 23 8 26 9 c respectively the highest 24 hour precipitation in each month varies from 255 mm may to 506 mm july and from 375 mm to 231 mm in the remaining three months in addition the largest 24 hour precipitation at 14 out of 18 rain stations coincided with typhoon related events according to historical typhoon data from noaa chu et al 2017 about 68 tropical cyclones in north vietnam occurred from 1960 to 2016 heavy rainfall in this area is not only a result of troughs and tropical concentration lines across the delta but typhoon related events that hit inland of vietnam and south china as well for example due to the influence of typhoon bilis in 2006 in south china the greatest 24 hour precipitation rmax occurred at cho ra cr 211 mm chiem hoa ch 506 mm ham yen hy 338 mm and tuyen quang tq 316 mm this typhoon also led to heavy rainfall 166 341 mm day at five rain gauge stations in bac kan province typhoons which hit inland vietnam could lead to heavy rainfall in a larger region in each province of the study area for instance typhoon durian in 2001 brought heavy precipitation to six rain stations in thai nguyen 208 349 mm day and five rain stations in tuyen quang 160 361 mm day typhoon noname in 1986 also led to heavy precipitation 150 229 mm day at five stations in bac kan troughs low atmospheric pressure or tropical concentration lines showed rare magnitudes of 24 hour precipitations rmax at dinh hoa dh 276 mm thai nguyen tn 375 mm bac kan bk 305 mm and ngan son ns 260 mm 2 2 hydro meteorological data in bac kan thai nguyen and tuyen quang provinces there are eight meteorological stations and 34 rain gauge stations 21 stations of which were constructed before 2006 many rain gauges have discontinuous data meaning they record only some rainy months of the year or have missing data for years or months short length data recent construction stations or are manually measured by local people stations including bk cr ns dh tn ch hy and tq have been measuring surface meteorological parameters such as precipitation r temperature t and relative humidity rh since 1962 table 1 in this paper we therefore utilized the average 24 hour data of r t and rh from 1962 to 2016 from eight meteorological stations to evaluate the characteristics of precipitation to evaluate the spatial distribution of storm rainfall as a function of storm duration the depth area duration dad curve is often established wmo 1969 in this study we selected heavy storm events to envelop a depth area curve of the 24 hour rainstorm wmo 1969 2009a based on the thiessen polygon weighting method in addition to inverse distance weight idw interpolation wmo 1969 shin et al 2013 as represented in fig 2 climate data that is daily temperature data were obtained from the world climate research programme cmip5 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 for gcms and the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex in the east asia region for rcms the specification of each model is shown in table 2 using the climate data operators cdo program schulzweida 2018 we evaluated two global climate models from japan including miroc 5 mir watanabe et al 2010 and mri cgcm3 mri yukimoto et al 2012 and one regional climate model namely hadgem3 ra hag baek et al 2013 davies et al 2005 rcp4 5 stabilization scenario and rcp8 5 pessimistic emission scenario were considered regarding two time periods 2050 2021 2050 and 2080 2051 2080 3 methodology in order to evaluate the behavior of extreme precipitation in a changing climate we analyzed the relationship between temperature and extreme rainfall during the rainy season the probable maximum precipitation pmp was then estimated using historical meteorological data for simplification we estimated the possible changes in relative humidity at high temperatures based on historical data and considered the changes in projected temperature global climate models gcms and regional climate model rcm and relative humidity in order to evaluate the extent of changes in pmp under climate change condition the method developed in the present study is described in fig 3 3 1 precipitation and temperature scaling analysis it is important to understand the relationship between extreme precipitation and one of its related meteorological variable atmospheric temperature especially under changing climate conditions the binning technique has been widely applied to evaluate such a relationship between temperature and precipitation t r hardwick jones et al 2010 lenderink et al 2010 utsumi et al 2011 herath et al 2018 based on recent literature two main approaches in the t r analysis include the same bin width and the same number of samples in each temperature bin in the former method precipitation is paired with temperature with an equal width such as 1 c berg et al 2013 since the utilization of even width bin sometimes leads to fewer samples in some bins especially in lower and upper temperature ranges hardwick jones et al 2010 the equal bin width method with adjustment to assure a given minimum of samples in each bin offers an interesting alternative for example utsumi et al 2011 used the 2 c bin with minimum samples of 150 for the global study berg et al 2009 defined the minimum samples of 300 for each bin width in their study of the entire european domain in the latter method t r pairs are placed in each bin in order to have the same sample size regardless of the bin width for example 233 events per one bin in a research of hardwick jones et al 2010 however it is sometimes difficult to obtain the same sample size within each of the smallest temperature bins e g 0 1 c to determine the behavior of extreme precipitation we set up a relationship between 24 hour rainfall and average 24 hour air surface temperature for wet events which have been defined differently in various studies according to the world meteorological organization guidelines wmo 2009b precipitation depths with a threshold of 1 mm 10 mm and 20 mm are set for wet day events r1 heavy precipitation r10 and very heavy precipitation r20 respectively for a given rainfall duration wet day events were also set as 0 3 mm herath et al 2018 0 1 mm hardwick jones et al 2010 0 3 mm hour panthou et al 2014 or 20 mm toure halimatou et al 2017 in the vietnamese government standard vietnam standard 2015 the 24 hour rainfall amount from 51 mm and above r51 is considered a rain induced waterlogging event in addition the wmo guideline wmo 2009b indicates that the 95th percentile of precipitation p95 on wet days is used to determine a very wet day event while an extremely wet day event is calculated from the 99th percentile of precipitation p99 recent studies have applied the 50th hardwick jones et al 2010 herath et al 2018 75th berg and haerter 2013 90th panthou et al 2014 99th utsumi et al 2011 or 99 9th lenderink et al 2011 percentiles of precipitation for given rainfall duration in the t r scaling analysis in this study we evaluated the behavior of the 99 9th percentile precipitation p99 9 on wet days r1 and heavy rain days r51 of the rainy season may october at eight meteorological stations from 1962 to 2016 during this period the total number of wet days r1 and heavy rain days r51 at eight stations were 32 243 and 2579 for temperature ranges of 13 8 38 c and 16 6 30 7 c respectively fig 4 a illustrates the number of days in each temperature bin width of 1 c since there were great differences between sample sizes in each bin width pairs of average 24 hour temperature and rainfall were allocated in each bin width of 1 c more or less to ensure a given minimum number of samples in each bin such as 150 r1 and 50 r51 for the whole study region the cc scaling was used to examine the possible changes in the precipitation as a function of changes in temperature the exponential regression was applied to determine precipitation pt δt that related to changes in temperature δt hardwick jones et al 2010 as described in eq 1 1 p t δ t p t 1 α δ t where t is air temperature c δt refers to the rise in temperature c pt and pt δt denote rainfall at air temperature t and t δt respectively mm and α represents the rate at which precipitation changes with temperature for example α 0 07019 and α 0 0607 are equivalent to cc scaling of 7 019 per degree celsius at 4 c and 6 007 per degree celsius at 24 c respectively 3 2 estimation of the pmp 3 2 1 the statistical method this approach applies the hershfield method 1961 to estimate the pmp wmo 2009a as described in eq 2 2 p m p r n s n k m r n s n r m a x r n 1 s n 1 where pmp is probable maximum precipitation mm r and s are in mm representing mean and standard deviation sub index n and n 1 refer to annual extreme series and annual extreme series excluding the largest value respectively rmax is the maximum rainfall in the series mm km substitutes for the statistical variable which represents the maximum value within the observed series of storm events 3 2 2 the maximization method this method considers the maximization ratio between maximum precipitable water wmax at a certain period of the year and actual precipitable water ws of the storm event associated with precipitation r mm as described in eq 3 3 p m p r w m a x w s where ws refers to precipitable water estimated for the storm mm and wmax represents the maximum precipitation water indicated for the storm reference location mm in addition to station elevation dew point temperature the day of storm occurrence td is used to determine ws wmax is also computed regarding location of station and maximum dew point temperature tdmax which can be taken as the 100 year return period td 100 of maximum dew point in the month of the storm occurrence it also can be maximum dew point within 15 days td 15d 15 days after the storm event within a 30 day window td 30d 15 days before and 15 days after the storm or the largest value of tdmax series in a month of the storm event td month wmo 2009a lee et al 2016 in practice after selecting extreme rainfall events precipitable waters were determined using annex 1 of the wmo manual on the estimation of pmp wmo 2009a taking station elevation and surface dew point temperature td into consideration normally a persisting 12 hour dew point temperature is used for storm maximization according to the wmo manual a 24 hour interval can be used for longer storm duration in some tropical areas to select historical maximum dew points and representative dew points of storms wmo 2009a the application of the 24 hour dewpoint for adjusting storm rainfall can be an alternative in pmp calculation as it provides few differences from the application of the 12 hour representative storm dew point in case the td record is unavailable an average 24 hour surface dew point temperature is estimated based on the average 24 hour relative humidity rh and surface temperature t as described in eq 4 alduchov and eskridge 1996 lawrence and planck 2005 4 t d 243 04 ln r h 100 17 625 t 243 04 t 17 625 ln r h 100 17 625 t 243 04 t where td refers to dew point temperature oc rh represents relative humidity and t is surface temperature oc 3 3 pmp and climate change as mentioned in section 3 2 2 the determination of wmax which often depends on the elevation of observation location temperature and relative humidity has a critically important role in pmp calculation because raw climate model data often has a significant bias correction for a specific study site is therefore necessary the adjustment of climatic model simulations can be implemented by bias correction methods including linear scaling local intensity scaling variance scaling distribution scaling power transformation or distribution mapping terink et al 2009 2010 teutschbein and seibert 2012 chen et al 2013 fang et al 2015 while precipitation changes are often evaluated using a ratio of future to historical data changes in temperature are often estimated based on the difference between the future and historical data pierce et al 2015 being considered as an approximately normally distributed variable the temperature is often corrected through its mean and variance using the variance scaling method terink et al 2010 teutschbein and seibert 2012 hawkins et al 2013 fang et al 2015 in this approach it is assumed that bias correction would be stationary this means that the current correction parameters are valid in future cases teutschbein and seibert 2012 pierce et al 2015 using r package killick and eckley 2013 2016 we implemented a change point analysis to identify changes in mean for monthly temperature data in the rainy season at eight stations in regard to three methods amoc at most one change pelt pruned exact linear time and binseg binary segmentation in general the mean values of monthly temperature from may october in this study site experienced change points within a 10 year period fig 5 table 3 in addition according to the guidelines on the calculation of climate normals wmo 2017 the standard normal can be applied to assess climatological surface parameters such as air surface temperature the basic assumption of a stationary climate assumes that the climate is variable however the variations properties are considered to be constant with time wmo 2017 with respect to teutschbein and seibert 2012 the procedures of bias correction utilized a transformation algorithm in order to adjust the output of gcms and rcm and to identify possible biases between observation and simulation data in addition the major contributor to differences between observed data and model output are considered as a bias correction rather than climatic differences between two time periods teutschbein and seibert 2012 pierce et al 2015 according to wmo guidelines wmo 2017 normals refer to an average computational time for a uniform and relatively long period covering at least three consecutive ten year periods in this paper we therefore apply the variance scaling method to correct temperature series for 30 year periods including 1971 2000 for historical records h and 2021 2050 and 2051 2080 for future f projections with respect to observations o and climate models output m the corrected daily future temperature tf on a j th day d of an i th month m is calculated based on the relationship between mean t and standard deviation s of monthly temperature from historical observation o h and historical simulation m h as indicated in eq 5 5 t f m i d j t o h m i s o h m i s m h m i t m f m i d j t m h m i where t f m i d j represents the corrected daily future temperature oc on the jth day of the ith month t o h m i and t m h m i denote mean the monthly temperature oc in the i th month mi of historical observation data o h and historical data of model output m h respectively s o h m i and s m h m i illustrate the standard deviation of monthly temperature oc in the ith month of historical observation and historical model output respectively t m f m i d j refers to the future temperature oc obtained from the climate models projection on the j th day of the i th month regarding the projected temperature for each climate model the maximum rh rhmax was estimated based on the analysis of historical temperature and rh t rh using the binning method relative humidity was paired with temperature using the equal bin width of 0 1 c the largest value of rh within each bin was defined as the maximum magnitude of relative humidity rhmax at that temperature the upper boundary of rhmax at high temperature was then identified to evaluate possible maximum relative humidity based on projected temperature the possible maximum dew points were then computed in accordance with future projected temperatures for each gcm rcp and rcm rcp in order to determine the possible wmax and pmp in a future month 4 result 4 1 precipitation and temperature scaling analysis in general the 99 9th percentile of two datasets r51 and r1 at all stations in the rainy season from may to october mo are associated with a peak point temperature of about 26 c then they decrease at higher temperatures fig 6 the cc like relation with the rate of 7 per degree celsius almost fits the rise of p99 9 r51 mo between 20 8 c and 22 6 c significant increases in extreme precipitation to the peak point temperature demonstrates super cc rates of 15 20 per degree celsius between 22 6 c and 25 6 c for p99 r51 mo p99 r1 mo and p50 r1 mo the decrease of extreme precipitation intensities at high temperature would be associated with the decline of relative humidity hardwick jones et al 2010 utsumi et al 2011 regarding t r analysis at each station the scaling rate of the 50th percentile of r51 agrees with cc like scale from 7 per degree celsius ns dh tn and tq to 10 per degree celsius cr ch and 20 per degree celsius bk hy the super cc scaling rates of more or less than 20 per degree celsius are shown for the three lines p99 9 r1 p99 9 r51 and p50 r1 fig 7 fig 7 also indicates that peak temperatures for p50 r1 and p50 r51 can occur at the ranges of 23 5 25 6 c at station elevations below 110 m dh ch hy tq and tn and 22 6 24 6 c at stations with higher elevation bk cr and ns with regard to the behavior of extreme events p99 9 of heavy rain days r51 at each station the peak temperatures vary from 23 5 c at ngan son ns to 26 5 c at tuyen quang tq in addition ns and cho ra cr stations which are located at the same latitude although ns differs in altitude elevation of 650 m have higher values of peak precipitation p99 9 r51 255 mm at 23 5 c than cr elevation of 165 m does 209 mm at 24 6 c in general higher elevation stations have lower peak temperatures except for thai nguyen tn station which is located on hilly terrain known as a transiting region between delta and mountainous areas additionally apart from tn a midland station similar peak point temperatures and similar scaling trends are seen for both series p99 9 r1 and p50 r1 for the other stations 4 2 pmp determination 4 2 1 statistical method in the hershfield method we selected the largest value of 24 hour precipitation for each year from 1962 to 2016 to obtain a series of annual extreme 24 hour rainfall at each station the average value in each series r n varies from 94 3 mm at cho ra cr to 152 7 mm at thai nguyen tn the highest magnitude of 24 hour rainfall within each series rmax at seven stations fluctuated from 211 mm cr to 375 mm tn the greatest value of rmax was seen at chiem hoa station 506 1 mm pmp determination results at eight meteorological stations are illustrated in table 4 and fig 8 pmp which was determined by the statistical method pmp statistic varies from 232 mm cr to 895 mm ch with ratios between pmp and rmax of less than 1 8 from 1 07 at ns to 1 77 at ch almost all stations obtain km values that are less than 5 7 apart from chiem hoa ch 12 78 the differences between rmax and r n at four stations cr ns dh and tn range from 116 6 mm 124 at cho ra cr to 223 4 mm 145 at thai nguyen tn the outputs agree with the t r relationship section 4 1 in which the scaling analysis of the 99 9th percentile for two datasets r1 and r51 illustrates similar trends at those four stations fig 7 it is in favor of the fact that among 36 events of 24 hour rainfall above 200 mm at the study site there were 15 events at tn a station with the highest value of r n 152 7 mm in addition magnitudes of the largest rainfall rmax at three stations tq hy and bk are 191 211 mm 161 168 higher than the average values of the data series r n the difference between the apexes of the p99 9 r51 and p99 9 r1 scaling is 47 86 mm at the three aforementioned stations at which the km ranges from 4 58 to 5 63 interestingly the peak value in the p99 9 r51 scaling is 195 mm higher than the peak value in the p99 9 r1 scaling at chiem hoa this station also shows the greatest differences of 385 mm 318 between rmax and r n it reveals that the most extreme precipitation rmax of 506 1 mm at ch is significantly larger than values of the remaining data in the series of annual extreme 24 hour rainfall in which the second highest rain amount at this station is 195 9 mm 4 2 2 moisture maximization method pmps are computed using precipitation temperature and relative humidity data associated with some of the largest rain events at eight meteorological stations over 55 years from 1962 2016 the average number of days with rainfall amount above 200 mm at the study sites was 4 5 days 16 events at tn 1 event at cr ch and 3 4 events at other stations the computation of pmps is thus implemented based on the five storm events which were selected from the top five highest 24 hour precipitation amounts at each station the maximum result at each station was selected as the pmp at that rain gauge in practice precipitable water ws was determined using temperature and relative humidity of the day of occurrence of extreme events and related to the station elevation we calculated wmax using to four options of dew point maximization using historical data including td max corresponding to the 100 year dew point td 100 the largest value of tdmax in a month td month and maximum value within a window of 15 and 30 days td 15d td 30d of a storm event to evaluate the 100 year dew point temperatures td 100 for each selected month in which the top five highest 24 hour precipitation events occurred we tested five distributions namely the gumbel g normal n lognormal ln generalized extreme value gev including maximum likelihood estimates gev1 and probability weighted moment gev2 rousseau et al 2014 clavet gaumont et al 2017 in order to determine the best fit we conducted four goodness of fit gof tests the chi square test χ2 root mean square error rmse anderson darling test a d and kolmogorov smirnov test k s with the support of the comprehensive r archive network cran statistical packages gilleland and katz 2016 scholz and zhu 2018 the gof results are listed in table 5 the best distribution for each month of each station was obtained from the smallest gof result among the aforementioned distributions additionally the lowest ranking score which referred to the summary of each distribution s ranking results regarding each gof was represented as the selected distribution for each month at each station in summary the gev2 probability weighted moment estimator fits bk and tq the normal distribution performed well at four stations ns dh ch and hy cho ra station data is represented with the gumbel distribution however at the thai nguyen station a transition location between delta and mountain region each month has a specific distribution the selected distribution at each station except tn and selected distribution of each month at tn station were used to evaluate the 100 year dew point temperature for moisture maximization among the four approaches used to determine tdmax the td 100 and td month produce large pmps compared to the other two options i e td 15d and td 30d table 4 pmp values using the 100 year dew point option for moisture maximization at the study site are introduced in fig 8b fig 8c the distributions of pmps in the study area based on the two calculation methods have similar overall trends especially in the western region including the tuyen quang province and cr station in the bac kan province the statistical and moisture maximization methods both produced decreased pmps towards the southwest northeast direction in the upper part of the study site in addition fig 8 a illustrates the distribution of heavy rain in the study area given the influence of typhoon bilis 2006 which resulted in the most extreme 24 hour precipitation rmax at cr ch hy and tq stations section 2 1 because the bilis typhoon had direct impacts on the south china region at the study site the rainfall intensity from this typhoon reduced that of the northwest ch to the southeast tn regions however the pmp magnitudes obtained from two methods show the decrease in distribution towards the southeast northwest direction in the lower part of the study area thai nguyen province and the south region of bac kan province the result therefore depicts the great influence of terrain condition and typhoons direction or local atmospheric conditions on the distribution of extreme precipitation 4 3 future pmp estimation regarding wmo guideline wmo 2009a pmp is defined as the theoretical maximum precipitation for a given duration under modern meteorological conditions with no allowance made for long term climatic trends however in section 1 8 wmo also points out that in the 21st century it is likely to obtain the increase in the most extreme rainfall events as a result of the overall rise of moisture availability in a warming climate depth area curves moisture availability storm efficiency storm types and generalized rainfall depths are therefore considered important factors in assessing the possible influence of climate change on pmp according to two gcm models and an rcm we computed the average differences between corrected temperature using the variance scaling method t m o d e l i c o r r e c t and observation data tobs within the baseline 1971 2000 using rmse as illustrated in eq 6 6 r m s e i 1 n i 1 n t m o d e l i j c o r r e c t t o b s i j 2 where rmsei refers to root mean square error of daily temperature in the ith month c t m o d e l i j c o r r e c t represents the corrected temperature of the model on the jth day of the ith month c t o b s i j illustrates observed temperature on the jth day of the ith month c the average value of rmse within 12 months for corrected miroc 5 mri and hag at eight stations is 3 24 3 47 c 3 29 3 54 c and 3 20 3 45 c respectively the projection temperatures in each target year 2050 and 2080 for representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 corrected by the variance scaling method are illustrated in fig 9 comparing to historical data 1971 2000 an average monthly temperature at the study site regarding the gcm data is predicted to rise by 0 82 1 38 c and 1 16 2 86 c by the years 2050 and 2080 respectively rcm data generates an increase of 1 41 1 63 c in 2050 and 1 96 3 22 c in 2080 in addition hag model produces higher projected temperatures than those of miroc 5 in july and august by the year 2050 1 05 c and 2080 1 72 c respectively similar trends are illustrated in the remaining 10 months the series of 24 hour precipitation of above 200 mm at the study site illustrates that the temperature varies from 21 5 c to 28 5 c and relative humidity ranges from 85 to 99 fig 4 b the most extreme rainfall event at cr 506 1 mm occurred at considerably high rh 98 and temperature 25 9 c when compared to other precipitation events from 250 mm to 400 mm it is also predicted that there will be a rise in air moisture availability at high temperature which can lead to a higher probability of more extreme precipitation events fig 4 b in order to evaluate future scenarios of moisture maximization the possible maximum dew point temperature in the future was determined based on the rise in air temperature and relative humidity future dew point determination can be computed based on future daily average air temperature and relative humidity lee et al 2016 or scenarios of a future rise in air temperature and sea surface temperature and maximum relative humidity of 100 lee et al 2017 despite a fact that the northern region is located in a humid subtropical climate the monsoon system in relation to the variety of topographical relief results in the variation of climate from place to place during the rainy season southwesterly summer monsoon tropical cyclones from the east sea and tropical disturbances are some contributors to copious rains nguyen le et al 2014 do et al 2016 the asian summer monsoon performs a critically important role in precipitation supply and moisture transport from the indian ocean to the indochina peninsula while the western pacific sub tropical ridge fully dominates this area often has hot dry and sunny weather nguyen le et al 2014 it is also noted that the increase in air temperature itself could lead to a decrease in relative humidity to evaluate the relationship between relative humidity and temperature rh t we applied the binning method with the same bin width approach the highest value of rh within each bin width of 0 1 c in the rh t analysis was selected to evaluate the maximum relative humidity rhmax at that temperature bin fig 10 a regarding fig 10 a the rhmax at eight stations experienced declining trends associated with the rise in temperature at a threshold range of 23 26 c a peak temperature in scaling analysis of extreme precipitation therefore in this paper a larger value of rhmax at higher temperature was selected as an upper boundary of rh at that temperature points in fig 10 b the impact of station elevation on the rhmax t is also indicated in fig 10 b the upper boundary of rhmax t is therefore divided into three main types based on station elevations z i z 100 m tn hy tq ch ii 100 m z 150 m dh bk and iii z 150 m cr ns for the relative humidity future scenario the possible value of rh is determined based on projected temperature and upper boundary rhmax rhmax t regarding the three main above elevation classes rcp scenarios are described in fig 11 there is a rise in projected temperature regarding two gcms and one rcm for two rcps at the study site in addition to the critical condition of relative humidity at high temperature rhmax t pmp would therefore increase in the future 5 discussion 5 1 precipitation and temperature scaling analysis the peak structure of scaling analysis in the study area 21 22 n is suitable for the condition of mid latitude regions from 20 55 s and n utsumi et al 2011 the differences between r51 and r1 lines can show the role of extreme events in a dataset the extreme precipitation analysis depends on the rainfall threshold because small intensities of precipitation strongly affect the percentile computation as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 the p99 9 r51 which is not influenced by the small magnitude of precipitation presents greater values of extreme events than the p99 9 r1 does it is also noted that seasonal selection may affect the scaling trend at this study site heavy rain events are often associated with the occurrences of tropical typhoons and storms during the rainy season from may to october mo though downpour sometimes occurs in april due to troughs according to p99 9 r1 analysis fig 6 a temperature of 18 6 c experiences the second hump in the april to october ao dataset a slightly stable trend is illustrated within a temperature range of 17 6 19 6 c in the mo dataset when excluding april data p99 9 r1 mo from may to october is lower than p99 9 r1 ao from april to october at the temperature below 19 5 c in both cases 19 5 c can be considered a transition temperature when it provides a starting point for the second rise of the trend lines comparatively similar tendencies are seen at higher temperatures at the two datasets including and excluding april for further evaluation of scaling analysis we also set up the relationship between average 24 hour temperature and heavy precipitation r10 and very heavy precipitation r20 wmo 2009b with regards to the 99 9th percentile p99 9 of selected events r1 r10 r20 and r51 when the rainfall thresholds increase from 1 mm r1 to 51 mm r51 peak temperature at each station is stable at 23 5 25 6 c except for bk and tq stations there was a rise by 2 c in peak temperature at bk 23 5 25 5 c and tq 24 5 26 5 c fig 7 interestingly with respect to the 50th percentile determination for four options of rainfall thresholds r1 r10 r20 and r51 when the magnitudes rise from r1 to r51 peak temperatures decline by 1 c at three stations in the mountainous region ns cr and bk and at tn station and 2 c at two midland stations ch and hy a stable temperature of 24 6 c is seen at tq dh is the only station that experiences an increase of 0 9 c 24 6 25 5 c in addition the scaling rates of 10 per degree celsius for p50 r20 and p50 r10 are shown at two stations namely cr and ch while the six remaining stations experienced a rate of from 15 to 20 per degree celsius according to fig 7 the 50th percentile rainfall temperature scale values are lower than the 99 9th percentile scaling values the rise of scaling analysis associated with the rise of percentile may reveal that the temperature sensitivity for more extreme precipitation 99 9th percentile of 24 hour rainfall is higher than that for average extreme rainfall events 50th percentile of 24 hour rainfall it also implies that fully saturated conditions are likely to be present at more extreme precipitation events lenderink et al 2010 herath et al 2018 in addition we also evaluated the relationship between the logarithm of 24 hour precipitation log r and temperature t using linear regression in regard to the 99 9th p99 9 and 50th p50 percentiles of rainfall events r1 r10 r20 and r51 in general the p99 9 r51 has peak slope values from 0 038 tq to 0 218 dh within 24 27 c a range of regression slope from 0 059 ch to 0 139 hy is generated at 22 24 c relation to p99 r1 with regard to the 50th percentile when the rainfall thresholds increase from 1 mm to 51 mm there is a decrease in the temperature range which experiences a higher magnitude of linear slopes table 6a for example regarding to p50 r1 a maximum slope of 0 193 log mm c is shown at 22 26 c p50 r51 has the largest slope of 0 091 log mm c at temperature from 20 to 24 c with respect to the 50th percentile at each station the largest slope values also decrease when rainfall threshold varies from r1 to r51 table 6b 5 2 pmp and climate change in general the pmp computation corresponding to the 100 year maximum td in a storm event month are in good agreement with pmp rcp4 5 in 2050 and 2080 compared to historical data calculations the projected computations of pmp of gcms and rcm provide larger magnitudes of pmps for rcp8 5 especially in 2080 such rises occur at dh for rcm in 2050 24 5 gcm in 2080 21 7 and at ns in 2080 8 4 for gcm and 7 7 for rcm in the future climate model approach regarding stabilization scenario rcp4 5 pmp calculations at all stations are relatively stable for the two target years 2050 and 2080 there are moderate differences between historical data calculations and projected computation of pmp for rcp8 5 scenarios in the two target years especially in 2080 6 conclusion this study aims to assess the precipitation variation characteristics in northeast vietnam by identifying the relationship between extreme 24 hour rainfall and average 24 hour temperature the study also estimated the 24 hour probable maximum precipitation in the study area highlighting the possible impacts of warming climate on extreme rain and pmp results from scaling analysis of precipitation and temperature are suitable according to recent analysis berg et al 2009 hardwick jones et al 2010 utsumi et al 2011 rousseau et al 2014 such as the cc like rate at low temperature super cc rate at high temperature and the peak like structure at mid latitudes it also presents the effect of a time scale as well as the sensitive behavior of extreme rainfall towards temperatures when compared to the average approach the relationship between relative humidity and temperature reflects a similar trend in the scaling analysis same peak temperature of 25 26 c while the statistical method focuses only on the behavior of extreme rainfall events in historical data pmp results from the moisture maximization method which is based on the relationship with other meteorological parameters such as humidity and temperature and can be utilized in the further study especially in the context of a warming climate with a projected rise in temperature especially for rcp8 5 pmp is predicted to increase by the years 2050 and 2080 additionally the spatial distribution of pmps based on moisture maximization using 100 year dew point which refers to the most extreme rainfall events that possibly occur at a study area can be used in evaluating rain induce problems such as floods or landslide since statistical records are not available for public access lacking historical data has become one of the biggest difficulties for researchers in vietnam findings from this paper thus provide as an initial approach in evaluating extreme precipitation in this northeast region in cases where full meteorological data records arelacking nevertheless there are limitations in this study such as the sole application of 24 hour precipitation and air surface temperature to evaluate the cc scaling whilst the hypothesis of this scaling analysis only considers the intensity of rain events as a conditional factor for rainfall occurrence hardwick jones et al 2010 other governing factors such as sources of moisture regarding shorter durations like 1 to 6 h should be taken into further studies according to the pmp determination methods the occurrence of extreme precipitation often depends on many factors including moisture availability wind speed and direction temperature and topography condition the statistical method which only focuses on the variation of extreme precipitation reveals shortcomings pmps derived from the hershfield method tend to vary with changes in the size of annual extreme precipitation for example compared to the outputs resulting from 55 year data 1962 2016 the application of rain records from 1961 to 2016 at tq brings about a rise of 1 11 and 0 33 mm in the average and standard deviation values respectively the statistical variable km frequency factor declines by 0 13 the pmp also decreases from 363 34 mm 55 year data to 360 38 mm 56 year data in addition it is a fact that the spatial distribution of extreme rainfall is strongly affected by the orographic condition of the basin however the terrain features were neglected in the computation of moisture maximization approach in this paper the moisture maximization method which considers significant roles of available moisture in the occurrence of extreme rainfall also reveals some uncertainties such as in the procedure of determining maximum precipitable water wmax concerning the maximum dewpoint temperature tdmax in cases retrieving tdmax within a 15 day and 30 day windows regarding the date of a storm td 15d and td 30d the vapor water holding capacity of the atmosphere would decline when the condensation formation often leads to a decrease in the air temperature when the maximum dewpoint temperature is selected from the time series of annual maximum dewpoint td 100 and td month in the month that a storm occurs it is likely to obtain the series in a period that is warmer than that during the storm occurrence date since the precipitable water tends to rise with air temperature as described in the clausius clapeyron equation large maximization ratios would lead to higher pmps as discussed in section 4 2 2 moreover the paper utilized the average dewpoint temperature rather than 12 hour persisting values to represent the storm moisture it therefore would lead to the uncertainty of exaggeration in pmp values this article also based on the recommendations of the wmo guideline wmo 2017 in applying the 30 year standard normal to assess climatological surface parameters such as air surface temperature the basic assumption of stationary climate assumes that the climate is variable however the variations properties are considered to be constant with time wmo 2009b this application of a stationary climate would disregard climate change which can alter the variability and extremes of weather variables nathan et al 2016 comparisons with non stationary analyses of extreme weather variables are therefore necessary for future researches significant errors in the climate models in addition to the downscale method also would lead to uncertainties in the evaluation of future temperature at the study site whilst the pmp determination focused on the high magnitude of daily projected temperature the predicted trend of pmps under the rise of air temperature was evaluated to a certain extent conflicts of interests the authors declare

8439,study region mekong delta vietnam mkd study focus present day distribution of fresh saline groundwater is highly heterogeneous in the mkd close to the coastline fresh groundwater is found in aquifers up to 500 m below ground surface to gain better insight into the fresh saline groundwater evolution since the late pleistocene we simulated long term groundwater flow and salt transport in a two dimensional nw sw cross section over the mkd to fully consider the regression and transgression phases of sea level changes over the past 60 ka variable density groundwater flow and salt transport was simulated with seawat to reproduce characteristics of the present day distribution of fresh saline groundwater and its age we simulated nine scenarios to evaluate the most important factors controlling freshening and salinization processes of the mkd groundwater system we compared the final model stage with present day observations of groundwater salinity and age new hydrological insights for the region the sedimentation and erosion processes related to sea level changes over the last 60 ka were important drivers of the fresh saline distribution in the present mkd the two dimensional model indicates that most fresh groundwater in the mkd was recharged 60 12 ka before present when the sea level was at its lowest and the top sedimentary layers had a relatively high permeability due to deposition of a clayey top layer during the holocene at present groundwater recharge of the deeper mkd groundwater system is very limited keywords groundwater variable density

zimmermann et al 2006 smith and turner 2001 worland et al 2015 have shown that sea level changes and inundations substantially influence the present day salinity distribution in coastal areas in recent decades fresh groundwater resources in deltas worldwide have reduced due to increasing groundwater extraction caused by increasing demands from domestic industrial and agricultural sectors wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 kuenzer and renaud 2012 this increased extraction rate has led to significant challenges in the sustainable management of fresh groundwater resources especially in effectively preventing the salinization of coastal aquifers tran et al 2012 werner et al 2013 both sea level rise and greater demands on fresh groundwater resources in the future will lead to further salt water intrusion thus fresh groundwater resources in coastal aquifers are now being an increasingly rapid rate of threatening to assess the vulnerability of the groundwater resources it is essential to have sufficient information on the salinization processes vietnam is one of the countries where groundwater is an important source of water for human activities tran et al 2012 vu et al 2014 the mekong delta vietnam mkd is rapidly changing due to urbanization land use transformation and intensification of economic activities minderhoud et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 1 the associated increase of freshwater demand has led to large scale extraction of fresh groundwater with rates depleting the existing groundwater level from 0 2 to 0 3 m per year bui et al 2013 erban et al 2014 salinization of groundwater and surface water resources bui et al 2013 and land subsidence and increased flood risk resulting in land loss as well as damage to buildings and infrastructure minderhoud et al 2017 the mkd has been highly dependent on groundwater resources since the late 1990s over the past few decades groundwater extraction has increased dramatically the total quantity of groundwater extracted in 2015 was estimated at approximately 2 5 million m3 day from some 500 000 wells wagner et al 2012 bui et al 2013 minderhoud et al 2017 to sustainably fresh groundwater resources we need better insight into the functioning of the ground water system the water balance terms and the factors controlling groundwater flow and salt transport until now there are no comprehensive accounts of the infiltration of fresh and or saline groundwater in the mkd the times that salinization and freshening have taken place the extent that the groundwater system is now being recharged by surface water and whether the fresh groundwater resources are being depleted to understand the present day fresh saline groundwater dynamics in the delta we first need a comprehensive representation of the mkd in its paleo hydrogeological context modeling the mkd in a conceptual way will indicate where additional information is needed to yield more reliable estimates of the present groundwater situation and constructs scenarios about the impact of future climate change shrestha et al 2016 schmitt et al 2017 to gain reliable insight into the possible processes and mechanisms that control the ground water balance flow rates and salinization processes in the mkd groundwater system we constructed simulated and analyzed a 2d mekong like cross section a similar approach was taken for a case study in the netherlands delsman et al 2014 a paleo hydrogeological model was built to study the processes controlling the holocene evolution of groundwater salinity in a dutch deltaic coastal aquifer we applied the same approach to the mkd our aims were i to make an inventory of the most likely explanations for the present day distribution of fresh saline groundwater ii to determine to what extent fresh groundwater is being recharged at present and iii to identify the sensitive factors controlling the salinization and freshening of the mkd groundwater system in this research a 2d paleo hydrogeological model was applied in a representative mkd coastal aquifer system to consider the processes controlling the evolution of groundwater salinity over the entire holocene and late pleistocene we aimed to understand sedimentation and erosion processes related to the deposition of the clayey top layer we also aimed to understand how the sea level changes affect the fresh saline groundwater distribution in the mkd 2 description of the mekong delta vietnam 2 1 hydrogeology of the mekong delta vietnam the mkd is one of the largest deltas in the world lying at the mouth of the complex mekong river network tanabe et al 2003 it covers a total land area of about 39 700 km² and is located in the southern part of vietnam bounded by the gulf of thailand to the southwest the east sea to the south and southeast and cambodia to the north fig 2 a bui et al 2013 shrestha et al 2016 the delta surface is relatively flat with low elevation ranging from 0 3 to 2 0 m above mean sea level msl except for a few hills in the southwest in an giang and kien giang provinces minderhoud et al 2017 presently the mkd is classified as a wave influenced and tide dominated delta ta et al 2005 sediments were deposited during repeated transgression and regression events from the late neogene miocene pliocene up to the present holocene period which has resulted in a highly heterogeneous stratigraphy of the mkd basin fill the cenozoic rifting phases related to the opening of the east sea of vietnam approximately 32 15 4 million years ma ago resulted in a nw se tectonic trough nguyen et al 2004 bui et al 2013 this trough is filled with sediments ranging in age from the early miocene approximately 23 8 16 4 ma ago to the present day anderson 1978 nguyen et al 2004 the bulk of the sediments in the proximal part of the basin are of fluvial and estuarine origin but a substantial part of the delta especially the miocene and pliocene sediments is of marine origin these deposits reach a total present day thickness of up to 1000 m in the se part of the delta in the tra cu district tra vinh province situated between the bassac and mekong rivers fig 2a nguyen et al 2004 bui et al 2013 doan et al 2016 tectonic movements in particular the nw se pattern of normal faults e g the fault line stretching along the bassac river valley have likely played an important role in the formation of the fluvial patterns in the delta nguyen et al 2004 the hydrogeological cross sections fig 2b and c and data from borehole logs nguyen et al 2004 kuenzer and renaud 2012 bui et al 2013 provide an overview of the spatial distribution and interconnection of the age stratification systems in the delta s subsurface the sediments can be roughly subdivided into seven formations fig 2b and c nguyen et al 2004 bui et al 2013 doan et al 2016 each formation comprises two parts the aquitards the upper part which is composed of low permeability silt clay or silty clay and the aquifers the underlying part which is more permeable and consists of fine to coarse sand the seven aquitards and seven aquifers from surface to deeper level are holocene holo late pleistocene lplei middle late

formations from 550 m to 650 m thickness that are composed of sand clay and siltstone interleaved the upper miocene level from 450 m to 820 m thick is composed of sand and clay interleaved boehmer and kootstra 2000 presented groundwater levels in some aquifers of the mkd the groundwater level data were derived from the average pre 1990 groundwater level elevations in each aquifer from the clusters of monitoring wells all groundwater level maps show similar groundwater level patterns and similar groundwater flow patterns groundwater levels in all aquifers in the coastal low lying areas were between 0 m and 2 m above msl pre 1990 in the southern area of the mkd they were usually less than 1 m above msl and only occasionally below mean sea level this means that before 1990 regional groundwater flow was pretty limited on a regional scale while groundwater extractions were absent bui et al 2013 2 2 the age of groundwater and salinity data in the mkd the age of groundwater apparent age suckow 2014 and salinity data in the mkd were provided by the division of water resources planning and investigation for the south of vietnam louvat and ho 1989 nguyen et al 2004 2005 stable isotope and tritium analyses were performed in the iaea isotope hydrology laboratory and the 14c content of the tdic was measured at the center of nuclear techniques in ho chi minh city louvat and ho 1989 suckow 2014 suggested that we take care when using the term groundwater age he presented three basic definitions of the age of groundwater and we use his definition of apparent age fig 3 c shows the locations where the age of groundwater and salinity data were available fig 3c also shows the measurement positions relative to our 2d cross section red line in fig 2a and the age of groundwater and salinity data points for the mkd we projected all the observed data to the 2d cross section red line in fig 2a and c approximately perpendicular to the present coastline some of the projected samples are some distance from the cross section but they still belong to the mekong delta vietnam basin and therefore are valuable for our cross section study the distribution of fresh saline groundwater is very heterogeneous due to sea level regression and transgression phases over the last few millennia in the mkd and is not clearly related to depth fig 3a the horizontal axis in fig 3a and b is the red line in fig 3c with point xii yii on the left close to the present coastline fresh groundwater was found at more than 450 m below ground surface level all the groundwater samples that measure age and salinity see table 2 and fig 3 were derived from observation wells belonging to the national groundwater monitoring network in vietnam from the division for water resource planning and investigation for the south of vietnam the age of groundwater observations fig 3b were collected from vietnamese reports on the age of groundwater 14c dating louvat and ho 1989 these 14c dated groundwater samples were tested at the vietnam atomic energy institute analytical errors of the age of groundwater were determined to be from 1 0 to 8 2 ka nguyen et al 2004 well depths varied from 42 to 462 m below the surface at six different aquifers table 2 most of the observed ages varied from 5 to 18 ka before present bp and lay at less than 300 m below msl at depths below 300 m most of the observed ages were relatively old even more than 25 ka bp 3 modeling approach 3 1 paleo hydrogeology of the mekong delta vietnam analysis of the salinization and freshening processes in such a large region requires a paleo hydrogeological description over a long timescale meisler et al 1984 gossel et al 2010 the present large deltaic system was formed over the past ten million years nguyen et al 2004 ta et al 2002 truong et al 2011 groundwater flow and salt transport must be modeled over a period long enough to capture the phenomena that led to the present day distribution of fresh and saline groundwater e g delsman et al 2014 using the age of groundwater data and research indicating that salt transport in porous media on a delta scale is a very slow process meisler et al 1984 post 2004 larsen et al 2017 we simulated the salinization and freshening processes over a period of 60 ka in this long period three main phenomena must be taken into account the first is the changing hydraulic conditions and in particular sea level changes fig 4 a the second is the groundwater interaction with the surface water system and the third is the sedimentation and erosion that has taken place during the last 60 ka fig 4b we approximate the continuous changes by a number of subsequent stress periods the stress periods were chosen to capture both the changes in the sedimentation erosion process in particular during the holocene and a part of the late pleistocene as well as the changes in the hydraulic boundary conditions with respect to the sea level changes we used insights from waelbroeck et al 2002 their method is based on a transfer function between sea level and benthic δᵹ18o estimations we divided the past 60 ka into eight distinct stress periods sp from sp1 to sp8 see fig 4a and table 3 sp1 sp3 are phases of sea level decline sp4 sp6 are phases of sea level rise and sp7 sp8 are phases of slight sea level decline during sp1 from 60 to 40 ka bp sea level was estimated to be 45 80 m below present msl during sp2 from 40 to 26 ka bp sea level declined from 80 to 130 m below present msl sp3 from 26 to 18 ka bp covers the last glacial maximum lgm hanebuth et al 2000 waelbroeck et al 2002 the lgm led to a deep valley where the deepest incision is 68 m below present msl being eroded in the subsurface of the eastern branches of the present mekong river erosion during the lgm likely removed a substantial amount of the near surface deposits estimated at tens of meters ta et al 2005 2002 truong et al 2011 fig 4b during sp1 and sp2 we presume that a kind of braid plain existed that deposited fluvial sands on a part of the mkd interfluves may have contained clay and silty sands during sp3 the lgm phase deep erosion occurred that removed part of the sediments of the delta surface deposits during sp4 from 18 to 12 ka bp the valley was filled up with estuarine and tidal river sands and these were covered by fine silty sands and marsh deposits nguyen et al 2000 ta et al 2005 the sea level at that time rose from 130 m to 60 m below the present msl hanebuth et al 2000 during sp5 from 12 to 6 5 ka bp the sea level rose from 60 m to the present msl the estuarine sediments in the deep valleys grade into open bay mud facies at depths of 35 20 m below the present msl with ages around 8 6 ka nguyen et al 2000 these deposits covered a wide area stretching over the inland fluvial plain and consisted of clay silt and muddy sediments nguyen et al 2000 during sp6 from 6 5 to 4 5 ka bp the sea level reached its highest position 4 m above present msl the area up to the border with cambodia was then fully submerged by the sea and the delta advanced over 200 km towards the northwestern part of the mkd during sp7 from 4 5 to 2 5 ka bp and sp8 from 2 5 bp to the present day the sea level declined stepwise to the present mean sea level pirazzoli 1996 the river floodplain supratidal and intertidal areas gradually became silted up with fine grained clay and silt clastic material including abundant organic matter in the inland delta plain resulting in the holocene aquitard which is characterized by a high resistance fig 2b and c 3 2 setting up the 2d groundwater flow model 3 2 1 location cross section the location of the 2d model being a representative mekong like cross section is visualized by the red line in fig 2a it is fairly similar to the representative ne sw cross section a a which also has an orientation perpendicular to the present coastline we used the computer code seawat langevin et al 2008 to simulate a variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport across the 2d model we further modeled the age of groundwater directly goode 1996 by including a first order irreversible reaction as an additional factor zheng 2009 2010 this was set to zero when entering the model domain and then one year was added for every year of flow inside the model domain in addition data on the age of groundwater suggested that the modeling period should be long enough to include the late pleistocene and the entire holocene the simulation time step was 10 years this was sufficient to meet the stability criteria as required within the mt3dms seawat solute transport modeling langevin et al 2008 zheng and wang 1999 and provided accurate results each stress period out of eight consisted of a different model simulation with a different geological setting fig 6 but the model state concentration and age at the end of each stress period was used as the starting state for the subsequent period the 2d steady state flow model domain has a total length of 530 km including 30 km in cambodia 200 km of the mkd and 300 km extending into the vietnam east sea fig 2b the horizontal grid size was 2000 m we used 50 vertical layers with a thickness of 10 m each providing 500 m of total thickness for the vertical domain the surface elevation which is the upper boundary of the flow domain has changed over the past 60 ka due to the process of erosion and sedimentation table 3 ta et al 2005 truong et al 2011 seawat langevin et al 2008 was used to solve the following partial differential equation for variable density groundwater flow ρ k o h f ρ ρ f ρ f z ρ s s h f t ϕ ρ c c t ρ s s q s s where ρ is the density of the groundwater m l 3 k0 is the hydraulic conductivity tensor l t 1 hf is the freshwater head l z is the vertical coordinate l ρf is the density of fresh groundwater m l 3 ss is the specific storage coefficient l 1 t is the time t ϕ is the effective porosity c is the concentration m l 3 ρss is the density of the sink or source t 1 and qss is the sink and source term t 1 it was assumed that k0 is isotropic that the density of fresh groundwater ρ is 1000 kg m 3 and that the maximum density of the water ρss is 1025 kg m 3 a linear equation of state was used to calculate the density of the groundwater from concentration where it was assumed that only salt concentration influences the density ρ ρ f ρ c c relative salt concentrations were used ranging from 0 concentration of fresh groundwater to 35 concentration of sea water hence ρ c equals 0 7143 the governing equation for salt transport in the simulations was θ c t θ d c q c q s s c s s where d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2 t 1 q is the specific discharge vector l t 1 and css is the source and sink concentration m l 3 the groundwater flow equation and the dispersion term of the salt transport equation were formulated using a cell centered finite difference scheme the groundwater flow equation and the non advective part of the salt transport equation were solved using the pre conditioned conjugate gradient pcg and generalized conjugate gradient cgc packages respectively langevin et al 2008 zheng and wang 1999 the advection term was solved using third order total variation diminishing tvd method based on the ultimate algorithm universal limiter for transient interpolation modeling of the advective transport equations zheng and wang 1999 using this method and splitting up the advection dispersion equation into two components we envisage that the solution is mass conservative without excessive numerical dispersion and essentially oscillation free zheng and wang 1999 we also tested on our modeling case the performance of two other often used solvers within the seawat solver suite viz the finite difference fd and the method of characteristics moc methods the solvers hmoc and mmoc were not considered as they usually underperform for moc we used two parameter sets in the accurate case we used npl 16 nph 45 npmin 45 npmax 100 instead of 4 15 15 75 respectively see zheng and wang 1999 the results of all the solvers appear to be all similar and thus the tvd method was used throughout the entire modeling 3 2 2 geological dynamics in addition to these processes compaction results in a decrease of the permeability of top layers we adapted the elevation and permeability of the top layers accordingly ta et al 2002 truong et al 2011 tables 3 and 4 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity for each stress period in each aquifer and aquitard is presented in table 4 the holocene sediments were not present in sp1 sp5 the sediments were deposited in the last 6 5 ka table 4 ta et al 2001a b truong et al 2011 it is likely that the late pleistocene layers mostly disappeared due to erosion during sp1 to sp3 but after sp4 the rising sea level led to further sedimentation table 3 the estimates of aquifers and aquitards properties rely on geological processes clay compaction in particular will reduce the hydraulic conductivity furthermore other relevant variables e g recharge effective porosity have to be estimated over the whole simulation period the lack of data indicates that the conceptual geological model and the values of the hydraulic properties and other variables are disputable we do not claim to deduce the only correct geology and parameter values but by analyzing several options that change the hydraulic conductivities of aquitard layers we were able to establish a hydrogeological model that we can use to perform a plausible analysis of the most sensitive factors the starting points are the two geological cross sections given in fig 2b and c for groundwater transport phenomena the discontinuities and heterogeneity of the layers in particular the aquitards at a smaller scale are important to analyze the discontinuity and heterogeneity we simulated four 2d steady state flow model representations with aquifers and aquitards including different hydraulic conductivities this was done with the aim to find the reference model that fitted best observed salinization data four geology models were used firstly geology i has more disconnected strata and thinner aquitards fig 5 a with hydraulic properties as shown in table 4 secondly geology ii has more connected strata and thicker aquitards fig 5b with hydraulic properties as shown in table 4 thirdly geology iii has more disconnected strata and thinner aquitards being labeled as clay silt and sandy clay in fig 5a with all horizontal hydraulic conductivities of aquitards 10 times lower than geology i and finally geology iv has more disconnected strata and thinner aquitards fig 5a with all horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the aquitards equal to 10 9 m s note that all four options have the same hydraulic properties for very fine sand fine sand and coarse sand aquifers table 4 in the mekong delta the hydrogeological conceptual model consists of seven aquifers separated by seven aquitards bui et al 2013 minderhoud et al 2017 the aquifers and aquitards are heterogeneous and anisotropic the hydraulic conductivities are divided into parameter zones the top aquifer is unconfined and the other aquifers are confined the impermeable basement consists of intrusive and extrusive formations the hydraulic properties table 4 are based mainly on recent research from the division for water resource planning and investigation for the south of viet nam dwrpis these data were derived from many aquifer tests conducted by dwrpis bui et al 2013 from 1981 to 2015 there were more than 234 aquifer tests performed at the mkd bui et al 2013 the values of the horizontal conductivities were determined for seven aquifers and resulted in a range of 2 10 6 8 10 4 m s bui et al 2013 ha et al 2015 minderhoud et al 2017 there are no tests currently available for the vertical conductivities of the aquifers or for either the horizontal or vertical conductivities of the aquitards the vertical hydraulic properties for the eight stress periods were assumed to be 1 3 and 1 1 of the horizontal hydraulic properties of aquifers and aquitards respectively bagarello et al 2009 minderhoud et al 2017 wang and qiu 2017 for anisotropy we used the same values as in minderhoud et al 2017 in which a 3d model of the mekong delta was calibrated over 25 years the effective porosity was assumed to be 0 25 representing both sand and clay layers for all eight periods 3 2 3 boundary conditions we assumed dirichlet constant head boundary conditions on the southeastern side and the northwestern side of the 2d model the constant head boundary at the cambodian border was assigned the same values of the land surface geometry at that time the southeastern boundary at the coastline was based on the estimated average msl at that time figs 4 and 6 the river head boundary in the model was specified relative to the surface elevation at that time this was 5 0 m sp1 sp4 3 0 m sp5 sp7 and 0 2 m sp8 lower than the surface elevation at the cambodian border at that time and from there it dropped smoothly over the 2d cross section towards the vietnamese east sea at the corresponding time fig 6 the model had only a limited river head boundary for the three stress periods sp5 to sp7 due to full inundation from a rising sea level the formation depths are based on the 14c ages from the cores taken from the mekong delta vietnam table 3 ta et al 2005 2002 truong et al 2011 which provided the average altitude in the modeling in each stress period 3 2 4 salinity conditions we used total dissolved solids tds in g l in our modeling to represent salinity as mean sea level at 60 ka bp was approximately 70 m below msl the initial fresh saline groundwater distribution was assumed to be saline 35 tds g l similar to present tds of sea water for all model layers more than 70 m below the present msl layers 70 m above msl were assumed to be filled with fresh groundwater with 0 1 tds g l the tds concentration at the southeastern boundary was kept constant at 35 tds g l during the past 60 ka while at the northwestern boundary it was kept at a constant level of 0 1 tds g l the tds of the river and recharge remained constant with a sink source concentration value of 0 2 tds g l and 0 1 tds g l respectively for the whole simulation period fig 6 for simplicity we assumed that there was no salt water intrusion through the river system although salt water intrusion in deltaic areas was possibly important the molecular diffusion coefficient dm for porous media was assumed to be 8 64 10 5 m2d 1 e g delsman et al 2014 or oude essink et al 2010 the longitudinal dispersion coefficient αl was set to 2 0 m and the transversal ratio to longitudinal dispersion coefficient αl αth and αl αtv was set to 0 1 3 2 5 groundwater recharge the present day water balance for the mkd that links the inflow components to the aquifer system includes infiltration of rainfall and irrigation downward leakage through the semi permeable aquitards seepage from rivers streams and lakes downward flow from the overlying aquifers through the separate aquitards and subsurface inflow over the boundaries of the domain the discharge components include evapo transpiration of shallow groundwater well extraction from the aquifers flow from the mkd into the sea flow from the aquifers into the rivers canals streams and lakes and flow from the aquifers into the extensive network of surface drains bui et al 2013 boehmer and kootstra 2000 there is no long term precipitation record available for the mkd over the past 60 ka however chabangborn et al 2014 estimated that in the asian monsoon area precipitation minus evaporation was in the range of 400 800 mm year in the last glacial maximum viz 23 19 ka bp we applied a constant uniform groundwater recharge of 1 5 mm day which is equal to about 25 of the current long term precipitation average for the first four stress periods sp1 sp4 there is only a limited recharge boundary for the next three stress periods sp5 sp7 due to the sea water inundation of the whole mkd due to the increase of the resistance of the top aquitards in sp8 natural groundwater recharge was expected to be fairly small groundwater recharge was chosen to be 0 2 mm day only in addition the river conductance changes over time during the first four stress periods erosion occurs whereas during the last four periods sedimentation dominates as a result the river conductance in the first four stress periods 0 1 1 0 m2 day is smaller than in sp8 0 4 1 0 m2 day table 4 3 3 setting up the simulations the purpose of the 2d model was to gain insight into the most likely explanations for the present day fresh saline groundwater distribution and to identify the factors controlling the salinization and freshening processes the first step was to set up the reference case based on our best knowledge of the most likely parameter values we adjusted the model in such a way that the distribution of fresh saline groundwater as well as the age of the groundwater after computing 60 ka compared reasonably well with present day observations simultaneously groundwater heads groundwater velocity hydraulic parameters recharge and discharge had to lie within a plausible range during the development of the reference case we were able to identify the factors that were most sensitive to the model results based on the knowledge gained from the reference case we defined nine scenarios with a minimum and maximum value for each of the identified factors we changed only one parameter at a time so that the effects of the change could be observed individually the results of the simulations of the nine scenarios were evaluated and compared to the current distribution of saline and fresh groundwater table 5 summarizes the reference case and the nine scenarios the most sensitive parameters were expected to be hydraulic conductivities surface water level recharge river conductance longitudinal dispersion and initial tds concentration scenarios 1 4 tested the sensitivity of both horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities focusing specifically on each set of aquifers aquitards top aquitard layers and the percentage of vertical sandy shortcuts all for geology i fig 5a and table 4 for scenarios 1 3 the scenarios with the maximum parameter values are labeled a scenarios the scenarios with the minimum parameter values are labeled b scenarios the hydraulic conductivities in the maximum a scenarios were 10 times larger than the reference case while in the minimum b scenarios they were 10 times smaller than in the reference case except in scenario 1 where they were 4 times larger or smaller the top layers in scenarios 3a and 3b were continuous in scenario 4a around 25 of sandy permeable shortcuts were present in the top layer while in scenario 4b 35 of permeable shortcuts were present in scenario 5 in comparison to the reference case the river level rose by 5 m scenario 5a and dropped by 5 m scenario 5b furthermore in scenarios 6a and 6b the recharges were 20 higher and 20 lower respectively than in the reference case scenarios 7 and 8 focused on the conductance of the river and the longitudinal dispersion respectively they were multiplied a scenarios or divided b scenarios by a factor of 10 as in scenarios 2 and 3 in scenario 9 we changed the initial concentration to completely fresh groundwater in order to compare with the reference case and evaluate the effect caused by a different initial concentration 4 results 4 1 reference case the modeled distribution of fresh saline groundwater is presented in fig 7 a i at 60 40 26 18 12 6 5 4 5 2 5 ka bp and at present i e the end of stress periods respectively the age distribution of the groundwater simulated at the present time is given in fig 8 for comparison the projection of observed salinity and the age of groundwater are given in fig 7i present day and fig 8 respectively four main phases can be distinguished fig 7a i during the first phase from 60 ka to 18 ka bp there was freshening of the groundwater driven by the sea level regression and low mean sea level fresh groundwater replaced saline groundwater up to 500 m below the surface during the second phase the largest volume of fresh groundwater was present between 18 and 12 ka bp during the third phase from 12 ka to 2 5 ka bp a serious salinization of the groundwater occurred because a higher mean sea level led to sea water infiltrating the groundwater kooi et al 2000 explained that if the rate of transgression is sufficient fast the salinization of the subsurface cannot keep up by means of a lateral henry case salt water intrusion wedge development and saline water will move on top of the fresh groundwater system causing salt water to infiltrate here in our case the conditions are such that even salt water plumes also often called seawater fingers salt fingers or density fingers are bringing relatively rapidly salt groundwater into the system this fingering process is a much more rapid salinization process than diffusion is see simmons et al 1999 zimmermann et al 2006 wooding et al 1997a b the driving force of the groundwater flow and salt transport system is the transition of a relatively high gradient system into a low gradient system within a relatively short time span at this period due to the rapid rise in the sea water level however we have to remember that our model area of interest the horizontal scale a few hundreds of kilometers is quite a few orders of magnitude larger than the vertical scale some tens of meters making the high gradient system not really a topography driven groundwater flow system during this third phase saline groundwater was present in most parts of the 2d model during the last phase of the last 2 5 ka sea level dropped slightly thus a freshening process is to be expected as in the early stress periods however due to the high resistance of the top sediment layer formed during the period of high mean sea level there was no significant freshening of the groundwater to evaluate the feasibility of our reference case in detail we compared the model results at the end of sp8 with the observed salinity data table 2 and fig 3 we compared the groundwater salinity and age simulated in sp8 with the salinity and age observed at different depths in the mkd figs 7i and 8 furthermore we ensured that the groundwater heads lay within a feasible range of values during the entire calculation period for geology ii more connected strata and thicker aquitards fig 5b with hydraulic properties as shown in table 4 geology iii more disconnected strata and thinner aquitards with all horizontal hydraulic conductivities of aquitards 10 times lower than geology i and geology iv more disconnected strata and thinner aquitards with all horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the aquitards equal to 10 9 m s the freshwater from the top system recharge source could not penetrate deeper than about 350 m fig 7j u below present day surface level after a period of 60 ka this does not match with observed groundwater salinity because presently fresh groundwater is found in aquifers up to 500 m below the surface fig 3a in addition at the present day viz fig 7m q u representing the geologies ii iii and iv respectively sea water could not have infiltrated into the fresh groundwater system to form the present heterogeneous distribution of fresh saline groundwater in the study area the effect of aquitards in the top system on the development of the salt water plumes depends on their occurrences and their level of permeability per geology model figs 5 7 and table 4 when the geology model contains clay layers with hydraulic conductivities that are assumed to be normal in this mkd viz geology i then wide salt water plumes occur figs 5a 7f i when the geology model contains thick clay layers with very low hydraulic conductivities e g geology ii fig 5b salt water plumes moving through the medium were slowed down hence it took more time to get into the deeper parts of the groundwater system while less plumes are developed anyway fig 7m kooi et al 2000 even when the geology set up remains the same as in the reference case fig 5a but the existing hydraulic conductivities of the aquitards are much lower e g geology iii iv the salt water plumes were also slowed down and the deeper parts of the onshore groundwater system would not contain saline groundwater fig 7q and u in both geology models with very low permeability of the aquitards the total amount of salt water plumes was large but the number of deep plumes was pretty limited for further analysis we used the geology i option as the most likely geology for the reference case fig 7a i because we compared a 2d modeled cross section to 3d real world observations we cannot expect absolute equivalence nevertheless the spatial distribution and heterogeneity seen in figs 7a i and 8 appear to be reasonable in particular in the final stage fresh groundwater could be modeled in the deepest aquifers up to 500 m below the surface and at a short distance from the present coastline this situation was observed in tra vinh and soc trang provinces bui et al 2013 furthermore the modeled age of groundwater was also consistent with the observed data figs 3b and 8 as shown in fig 8 groundwater older than 40 ka was only present in the offshore section of the 2d model for the inland section the groundwater was not older than 40 ka bp except for small volumes in the deepest aquifers close to the bedrock where it is trapped as fairly stagnant groundwater this indicates that most of the groundwater in our 2d model was completely replaced during the past 40 60 ka fig 7a i likely older 60ka saline groundwater is trapped in areas with low permeability in the vertical and lateral direction and has not been flushed out as suggested by the results of our 2d reference model in the 3d reality flushing could more easily happen and this saline water could be better drained by slow mixing or even just only hydrodynamic diffusion this phenomenon is quite common in old saline groundwater systems and could also explain the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater ages 4 2 scenarios scenarios 1 change in aquifers 2 change in aquitards 3 change in top aquitards 7 change in river conductance 8 change in longitudinal dispersion and 9 change in initial concentration appear to be the most sensitive to groundwater salinity and age the results of the other scenarios appear to be less affected the present day distributions of groundwater salinity for the nine scenarios are given in fig 9 the present day distributions of the age of groundwater for these scenarios are given in fig 10 fig 11 shows the deepest location of fresh groundwater as a function of time for all scenarios except for scenario 9 fig 12 shows the total volume of fresh groundwater in million m3 per stretched meter as a function of time for all scenarios each scenario is shown separately with the reference case and the minimum and maximum values except for scenario 4 fig 13 shows the comparison between the volume of fresh groundwater modeled for the reference case with mean sea level relative to its fluctuations over the last 60 ka note that we inverted the y axis for this volume of fresh groundwater on purpose to better show the correlation between fresh groundwater volume and mean sea level for the reference case the deepest level of fresh groundwater as well as the volume of fresh groundwater changed dramatically with the sea level over the last 60 ka figs 11 and 12 even when the sea level rose the deepest level of fresh groundwater kept getting deeper and the volume of fresh groundwater remained stable for some millennia before it fell following the mean sea level fig 13 fig 7d and e show where freshening continues between 18ka and 12ka in the center of the study area while saltwater transgresses from the southeast boundary the delay is mainly connected to the permeability of the low permeable layers kooi et al 2000 post and kooi 2003 the volume of fresh groundwater has continued falling even to the present day thus there is apparently no steady state situation our first four scenarios focus on the conductivities of the sedimentary layers in scenarios 1a and 2a the groundwater velocity was so high that saline groundwater was quickly replaced by fresh groundwater recharge in the entire model within 60 30 ka bp thus the conductivities of both aquitards and aquifers as high as 10 and 4 times the reference case respectively were probably not truly representative for these scenarios in contrast the groundwater in scenarios 1b and 2b fig 12 moved a bit too slowly this observation was also supported by the age of groundwater modeling while the ages of groundwater were very low in scenarios 1a and 2a fig 10a and c they were too high in scenarios 1b and 2b fig 10b and d in scenarios 1b and 2b fresh groundwater could not penetrate deeper than 350 m below the present day surface level after a period of 60 ka bp the high vertical resistance that was set in scenario 2b meant that the infiltration of fresh or saline groundwater from the top layer to deeper aquifers was also too slow fig 9d the changes in top aquitards scenario 3 basically only affect the volume and depth of fresh groundwater during the last thousand years scenarios 4 more sandy shortcuts in top layer 5 river water level and 6 groundwater recharge appear to be less sensitive to the factors we identified than the others scenario 7a increase the river conductance by a factor of 10 shows that most of the fresh groundwater came from upstream cambodia and the river system in the higher northwestern parts causing the simulated age of groundwater to shift from young to old in a northwest to southeast direction fig 10g this was not consistent with the age data observed in general the age of groundwater in the mekong delta vietnam increases into the direction of groundwater flow the age of groundwater grows from young groundwater to older groundwater as we move from the upper to the lower aquifers figs 3b and 8 scenario 7b in which groundwater was rapidly and completely replaced between 60 and 40 ka bp is also not plausible in scenario 8a the dispersion coefficient was ten times higher than the reference case resulting in too much mixing of the groundwater while in scenario 8b fresh groundwater could not penetrate deeper than 460 m below the present day surface level over time in scenarios 8a and 8b the volume of fresh groundwater was notably different as observed in figs 11h and 12h the reference case and scenario 9 represent the most extreme initial concentrations almost completely saline and completely fresh respectively 5 discussion our 2d model of the mekong delta vietnam simulates variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport over the past 60 ka the final model stage after 60 ka of simulation and representing the present situation shows acceptable agreement between modeled and the observed present day distribution of both groundwater salinity and age analyses of all nine scenarios give strong indications that the groundwater present at 60 ka bp in the entire system has been almost completely replaced within 60 ka we therefore assume that our simulation period of 60 ka is long enough to avoid any strong or undesired effects from the unknown initial conditions moreover scenarios 1 2 and 3 revealed our first insight into the rather limited value of the conductivity of the entire groundwater system low vertical conductivity of the top aquitards scenario 2b would have led to the deeper parts of the mkd having a substantially larger fresh groundwater volume this would have been due to the infiltration of fresh groundwater taking place over a sufficiently long period the vertical conductivity would not have been a serious limiting factor over this time scale for the last ten thousand years a low vertical conductivity would have safeguarded the fresh groundwater resources unfortunately the most realistic vertical conductivity as used in our reference case could not protect the fresh groundwater resources from being rapid infiltrated by saline seawater over time the analysis of the geology ii model indicates that connected and homogeneous aquitards are most unlikely the freshwater from the top system could not penetrate deeper than about 350 m fig 7k below present day surface level nevertheless saline water could also not infiltrate into the groundwater system in order to form the very heterogeneous present day fresh saline distribution fig 7m in order to reproduce the present day age and salinity distribution water from the upper boundary has to infiltrate into the deeper subsoil this appears to be possible only with disconnected and or heterogeneous aquitards there is a significant change in fresh groundwater volume during the 60 ka of simulation see fig 13 on changing fresh groundwater volumes and sea level elevation it appears the delay to the sea level rise by volume is on average several thousands of years the delay is mainly linked to the permeability of the low permeable layers though the shallower the system we are focusing on the shorter the memory of the groundwater system in the deepest parts of the mkd the memory is many tens of thousands of years additionally fig 13 shows that during the period 60 12 ka bp most freshwater infiltrated the groundwater system when the sea level was very low substantial parts of the top layer had high hydraulic conductivity thereby leading to a strong freshwater infiltration it appears from our scenarios that the most sensitive parameters are the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers and aquitards scenarios 1 2 and 3 the interaction with the riverbed scenario 7 which represents the interaction between the surface water system the longitudinal dispersion scenario 8 and the initial concentration scenarios 0 and 9 as can be seen in scenarios 1 2 3 7 8 and 9 figs 9 12 these factors strongly control the salinization and freshening processes in the 2d model of the mkd although the depth of the deepest fresh groundwater and the volume of fresh groundwater change significantly between the minimum and maximum values modeled we observed that only the reference case can realistically reproduce both the observed data on salinity and the age of groundwater furthermore the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was observed to be important for the degree of mixing but its effect on the overall availability of freshwater is not substantial fig 12h sedimentation took place during the last transgression period the last 12 ka this resulted in top clay layers that have a high resistance to infiltration by fresh groundwater currently the present top layer acts more or less as a seal on the subsurface reservoir the deeper aquifers are basically separated from surface hydrology due to the low permeability of the top aquitard but the deeper aquifers still receive some groundwater influx via the upper aquifers nevertheless our 2d model result suggested that the natural groundwater recharge of fresh water in the present day is limited as a result the recharge of fresh groundwater is very limited at present and the volume of fresh groundwater was seen to decrease significantly over the last 12 ka in all the scenarios fig 13 despite the slightly falling sea level almost all the scenarios show a persistent decrease in the volume of fresh groundwater during the last 2 5 ka this is mainly due to the limited groundwater recharge and over exploitation of groundwater resources is serious problem it should be noted that we did not include groundwater extraction in the model which would lead to a much faster decrease in the fresh groundwater resources because the extractions are only relevant for the last decades they are not relevant for our scenarios we performed minimum maximum scenarios for several parameters hydraulic conductivity river conductance groundwater recharge but did not attempt to quantify the uncertainties in our 2d model as such the results from the scenarios form a conceptual analysis rather than a real world simulation or quantification of the associated uncertainties nevertheless the salinity and age in the reference case resemble the observed present day distribution of both groundwater salinity and age reasonably well and give us confidence that our model has captured the most important groundwater processes in the mkd informed by this research our future work includes compiling a 3d groundwater model using 3d geology groundwater surface water interaction salinity distribution and groundwater extractions the present research contributes to this future 3d modeling tool that can be used to inform ground water strategies regarding vulnerability of the system 6 conclusions we have simulated the evolution of the fresh saline groundwater distribution and its age through the late pleistocene and holocene periods along a 2d cross section with a variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport model based on the subsurface and geographical characteristics of the mekong delta vietnam this model enabled us to analyze the fresh saline distribution volume of fresh groundwater and age dynamics of the groundwater reservoir the erosion and sedimentation processes over the past 60 ka as well as mean sea level changes still appear to have a dominant influence on the present day distribution of fresh saline groundwater and its age most fresh groundwater infiltrated the subsurface during a period of low sea level at least more than 20 ka ago sedimentation during the last 20 ka has increased the resistance of the top layer and this currently prevents fresh groundwater from being recharged to a great extent from the last period of lowstand of mean sea level our simulations strongly suggest that the volume of fresh groundwater was consistently declining under natural conditions extraction of groundwater not included in the model over paleo time scales will amplify this decline despite the limitations of our 2d model the most sensitive factors controlling salinization and freshening processes were identified our analysis is the

8439,study region mekong delta vietnam mkd study focus present day distribution of fresh saline groundwater is highly heterogeneous in the mkd close to the coastline fresh groundwater is found in aquifers up to 500 m below ground surface to gain better insight into the fresh saline groundwater evolution since the late pleistocene we simulated long term groundwater flow and salt transport in a two dimensional nw sw cross section over the mkd to fully consider the regression and transgression phases of sea level changes over the past 60 ka variable density groundwater flow and salt transport was simulated with seawat to reproduce characteristics of the present day distribution of fresh saline groundwater and its age we simulated nine scenarios to evaluate the most important factors controlling freshening and salinization processes of the mkd groundwater system we compared the final model stage with present day observations of groundwater salinity and age new hydrological insights for the region the sedimentation and erosion processes related to sea level changes over the last 60 ka were important drivers of the fresh saline distribution in the present mkd the two dimensional model indicates that most fresh groundwater in the mkd was recharged 60 12 ka before present when the sea level was at its lowest and the top sedimentary layers had a relatively high permeability due to deposition of a clayey top layer during the holocene at present groundwater recharge of the deeper mkd groundwater system is very limited keywords groundwater variable density

zimmermann et al 2006 smith and turner 2001 worland et al 2015 have shown that sea level changes and inundations substantially influence the present day salinity distribution in coastal areas in recent decades fresh groundwater resources in deltas worldwide have reduced due to increasing groundwater extraction caused by increasing demands from domestic industrial and agricultural sectors wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 kuenzer and renaud 2012 this increased extraction rate has led to significant challenges in the sustainable management of fresh groundwater resources especially in effectively preventing the salinization of coastal aquifers tran et al 2012 werner et al 2013 both sea level rise and greater demands on fresh groundwater resources in the future will lead to further salt water intrusion thus fresh groundwater resources in coastal aquifers are now being an increasingly rapid rate of threatening to assess the vulnerability of the groundwater resources it is essential to have sufficient information on the salinization processes vietnam is one of the countries where groundwater is an important source of water for human activities tran et al 2012 vu et al 2014 the mekong delta vietnam mkd is rapidly changing due to urbanization land use transformation and intensification of economic activities minderhoud et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 1 the associated increase of freshwater demand has led to large scale extraction of fresh groundwater with rates depleting the existing groundwater level from 0 2 to 0 3 m per year bui et al 2013 erban et al 2014 salinization of groundwater and surface water resources bui et al 2013 and land subsidence and increased flood risk resulting in land loss as well as damage to buildings and infrastructure minderhoud et al 2017 the mkd has been highly dependent on groundwater resources since the late 1990s over the past few decades groundwater extraction has increased dramatically the total quantity of groundwater extracted in 2015 was estimated at approximately 2 5 million m3 day from some 500 000 wells wagner et al 2012 bui et al 2013 minderhoud et al 2017 to sustainably fresh groundwater resources we need better insight into the functioning of the ground water system the water balance terms and the factors controlling groundwater flow and salt transport until now there are no comprehensive accounts of the infiltration of fresh and or saline groundwater in the mkd the times that salinization and freshening have taken place the extent that the groundwater system is now being recharged by surface water and whether the fresh groundwater resources are being depleted to understand the present day fresh saline groundwater dynamics in the delta we first need a comprehensive representation of the mkd in its paleo hydrogeological context modeling the mkd in a conceptual way will indicate where additional information is needed to yield more reliable estimates of the present groundwater situation and constructs scenarios about the impact of future climate change shrestha et al 2016 schmitt et al 2017 to gain reliable insight into the possible processes and mechanisms that control the ground water balance flow rates and salinization processes in the mkd groundwater system we constructed simulated and analyzed a 2d mekong like cross section a similar approach was taken for a case study in the netherlands delsman et al 2014 a paleo hydrogeological model was built to study the processes controlling the holocene evolution of groundwater salinity in a dutch deltaic coastal aquifer we applied the same approach to the mkd our aims were i to make an inventory of the most likely explanations for the present day distribution of fresh saline groundwater ii to determine to what extent fresh groundwater is being recharged at present and iii to identify the sensitive factors controlling the salinization and freshening of the mkd groundwater system in this research a 2d paleo hydrogeological model was applied in a representative mkd coastal aquifer system to consider the processes controlling the evolution of groundwater salinity over the entire holocene and late pleistocene we aimed to understand sedimentation and erosion processes related to the deposition of the clayey top layer we also aimed to understand how the sea level changes affect the fresh saline groundwater distribution in the mkd 2 description of the mekong delta vietnam 2 1 hydrogeology of the mekong delta vietnam the mkd is one of the largest deltas in the world lying at the mouth of the complex mekong river network tanabe et al 2003 it covers a total land area of about 39 700 km² and is located in the southern part of vietnam bounded by the gulf of thailand to the southwest the east sea to the south and southeast and cambodia to the north fig 2 a bui et al 2013 shrestha et al 2016 the delta surface is relatively flat with low elevation ranging from 0 3 to 2 0 m above mean sea level msl except for a few hills in the southwest in an giang and kien giang provinces minderhoud et al 2017 presently the mkd is classified as a wave influenced and tide dominated delta ta et al 2005 sediments were deposited during repeated transgression and regression events from the late neogene miocene pliocene up to the present holocene period which has resulted in a highly heterogeneous stratigraphy of the mkd basin fill the cenozoic rifting phases related to the opening of the east sea of vietnam approximately 32 15 4 million years ma ago resulted in a nw se tectonic trough nguyen et al 2004 bui et al 2013 this trough is filled with sediments ranging in age from the early miocene approximately 23 8 16 4 ma ago to the present day anderson 1978 nguyen et al 2004 the bulk of the sediments in the proximal part of the basin are of fluvial and estuarine origin but a substantial part of the delta especially the miocene and pliocene sediments is of marine origin these deposits reach a total present day thickness of up to 1000 m in the se part of the delta in the tra cu district tra vinh province situated between the bassac and mekong rivers fig 2a nguyen et al 2004 bui et al 2013 doan et al 2016 tectonic movements in particular the nw se pattern of normal faults e g the fault line stretching along the bassac river valley have likely played an important role in the formation of the fluvial patterns in the delta nguyen et al 2004 the hydrogeological cross sections fig 2b and c and data from borehole logs nguyen et al 2004 kuenzer and renaud 2012 bui et al 2013 provide an overview of the spatial distribution and interconnection of the age stratification systems in the delta s subsurface the sediments can be roughly subdivided into seven formations fig 2b and c nguyen et al 2004 bui et al 2013 doan et al 2016 each formation comprises two parts the aquitards the upper part which is composed of low permeability silt clay or silty clay and the aquifers the underlying part which is more permeable and consists of fine to coarse sand the seven aquitards and seven aquifers from surface to deeper level are holocene holo late pleistocene lplei middle late pleistocene mlplei early pleistocene eplei middle pliocene mplio early pliocene eplio and late miocene lmio fig 2b and c nguyen et al 2004 bui et al 2013 doan et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016 minderhoud et al 2017 the lithological nature of the substratum and its hydraulic properties are shown in detail in table 1 the vietnam petrol corporation determined the offshore stratigraphy and found neogene q formations from 550 m to 650 m thickness that are composed of sand clay and siltstone interleaved the upper miocene level from 450 m to 820 m thick is composed of sand and clay interleaved boehmer and kootstra 2000 presented groundwater levels in some aquifers of the mkd the groundwater level data were derived from the average pre 1990 groundwater level elevations in each aquifer from the clusters of monitoring wells all groundwater level maps show similar groundwater level patterns and similar groundwater flow patterns groundwater levels in all aquifers in the coastal low lying areas were between 0 m and 2 m above msl pre 1990 in the southern area of the mkd they were usually less than 1 m above msl and only occasionally below mean sea level this means that before 1990 regional groundwater flow was pretty limited on a regional scale while groundwater extractions were absent bui et al 2013 2 2 the age of groundwater and salinity data in the mkd the age of groundwater apparent age suckow 2014 and salinity data in the mkd were provided by the division of water resources planning and investigation for the south of vietnam louvat and ho 1989 nguyen et al 2004 2005 stable isotope and tritium analyses were performed in the iaea isotope hydrology laboratory and the 14c content of the tdic was measured at the center of nuclear techniques in ho chi minh city louvat and ho 1989 suckow 2014 suggested that we take care when using the term groundwater age he presented three basic definitions of the age of groundwater and we use his definition of apparent age fig 3 c shows the locations where the age of groundwater and salinity data were available fig 3c also shows the measurement positions relative to our 2d cross section red line in fig 2a and the age of groundwater and salinity data points for the mkd we projected all the observed data to the 2d cross section red line in fig 2a and c approximately perpendicular to the present coastline some of the projected samples are some distance from the cross section but they still belong to the mekong delta vietnam basin and therefore are valuable for our cross section study the distribution of fresh saline groundwater is very heterogeneous due to sea level regression and transgression phases over the last few millennia in the mkd and is not clearly related to depth fig 3a the horizontal axis in fig 3a and b is the red line in fig 3c with point xii yii on the left close to the present coastline fresh groundwater was found at more than 450 m below ground surface level all the groundwater samples that measure age and salinity see table 2 and fig 3 were derived from observation wells belonging to the national groundwater monitoring network in vietnam from the division for water resource planning and investigation for the south of vietnam the age of groundwater observations fig 3b were collected from vietnamese reports on the age of groundwater 14c dating louvat and ho 1989 these 14c dated groundwater samples were tested at the vietnam atomic energy institute analytical errors of the age of groundwater were determined to be from 1 0 to 8 2 ka nguyen et al 2004 well depths varied from 42 to 462 m below the surface at six different aquifers table 2 most of the observed ages varied from 5 to 18 ka before present bp and lay at less than 300 m below msl at depths below 300 m most of the observed ages were relatively old even more than 25 ka bp 3 modeling approach 3 1 paleo hydrogeology of the mekong delta vietnam analysis of the salinization and freshening processes in such a large region requires a paleo hydrogeological description over a long timescale meisler et al 1984 gossel et al 2010 the present large deltaic system was formed over the past ten million years nguyen et al 2004 ta et al 2002 truong et al 2011 groundwater flow and salt transport must be modeled over a period long enough to capture the phenomena that led to the present day distribution of fresh and saline groundwater e g delsman et al 2014 using the age of groundwater data and research indicating that salt transport in porous media on a delta scale is a very slow process meisler et al 1984 post 2004 larsen et al 2017 we simulated the salinization and freshening processes over a period of 60 ka in this long period three main phenomena must be taken into account the first is the changing hydraulic conditions and in particular sea level changes fig 4 a the second is the groundwater interaction with the surface water system and the third is the sedimentation and erosion that has taken place during the last 60 ka fig 4b we approximate the continuous changes by a number of subsequent stress periods the stress periods were chosen to capture both the changes in the sedimentation erosion process in particular during the holocene and a part of the late pleistocene as well as the changes in the hydraulic boundary conditions with respect to the sea level changes we used insights from waelbroeck et al 2002 their method is based on a transfer function between sea level and benthic δᵹ18o estimations we divided the past 60 ka into eight distinct stress periods sp from sp1 to sp8 see fig 4a and table 3 sp1 sp3 are phases of sea level decline sp4 sp6 are phases of sea level rise and sp7 sp8 are phases of slight sea level decline during sp1 from 60 to 40 ka bp sea level was estimated to be 45 80 m below present msl during sp2 from 40 to 26 ka bp sea level declined from 80 to 130 m below present msl sp3 from 26 to 18 ka bp covers the last glacial maximum lgm hanebuth et al 2000 waelbroeck et al 2002 the lgm led to a deep valley where the deepest incision is 68 m below present msl being eroded in the subsurface of the eastern branches of the present mekong river erosion during the lgm likely removed a substantial amount of the near surface deposits estimated at tens of meters ta et al 2005 2002 truong et al 2011 fig 4b during sp1 and sp2 we presume that a kind of braid plain existed that deposited fluvial sands on a part of the mkd interfluves may have contained clay and silty sands during sp3 the lgm phase deep erosion occurred that removed part of the sediments of the delta surface deposits during sp4 from 18 to 12 ka bp the valley was filled up with estuarine and tidal river sands and these were covered by fine silty sands and marsh deposits nguyen et al 2000 ta et al 2005 the sea level at that time rose from 130 m to 60 m below the present msl hanebuth et al 2000 during sp5 from 12 to 6 5 ka bp the sea level rose from 60 m to the present msl the estuarine sediments in the deep valleys grade into open bay mud facies at depths of 35 20 m below the present msl with ages around 8 6 ka nguyen et al 2000 these deposits covered a wide area stretching over the inland fluvial plain and consisted of clay silt and muddy sediments nguyen et al 2000 during sp6 from 6 5 to 4 5 ka bp the sea level reached its highest position 4 m above present msl the area up to the border with cambodia was then fully submerged by the sea and the delta advanced over 200 km towards the northwestern part of the mkd during sp7 from 4 5 to 2 5 ka bp and sp8 from 2 5 bp to the present day the sea level declined stepwise to the present mean sea level pirazzoli 1996 the river floodplain supratidal and intertidal areas gradually became silted up with fine grained clay and silt clastic material including abundant organic matter in the inland delta plain resulting in the holocene aquitard which is characterized by a high resistance fig 2b and c 3 2 setting up the 2d groundwater flow model 3 2 1 location cross section the location of the 2d model being a representative mekong like cross section is visualized by the red line in fig 2a it is fairly similar to the representative ne sw cross section a a which also has an orientation perpendicular to the present coastline we used the computer code seawat langevin et al 2008 to simulate a variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport across the 2d model we further modeled the age of groundwater directly goode 1996 by including a first order irreversible reaction as an additional factor zheng 2009 2010 this was set to zero when entering the model domain and then one year was added for every year of flow inside the model domain in addition data on the age of groundwater suggested that the modeling period should be long enough to include the late pleistocene and the entire holocene the simulation time step was 10 years this was sufficient to meet the stability criteria as required within the mt3dms seawat solute transport modeling langevin et al 2008 zheng and wang 1999 and provided accurate results each stress period out of eight consisted of a different model simulation with a different geological setting fig 6 but the model state concentration and age at the end of each stress period was used as the starting state for the subsequent period the 2d steady state flow model domain has a total length of 530 km including 30 km in cambodia 200 km of the mkd and 300 km extending into the vietnam east sea fig 2b the horizontal grid size was 2000 m we used 50 vertical layers with a thickness of 10 m each providing 500 m of total thickness for the vertical domain the surface elevation which is the upper boundary of the flow domain has changed over the past 60 ka due to the process of erosion and sedimentation table 3 ta et al 2005 truong et al 2011 seawat langevin et al 2008 was used to solve the following partial differential equation for variable density groundwater flow ρ k o h f ρ ρ f ρ f z ρ s s h f t ϕ ρ c c t ρ s s q s s where ρ is the density of the groundwater m l 3 k0 is the hydraulic conductivity tensor l t 1 hf is the freshwater head l z is the vertical coordinate l ρf is the density of fresh groundwater m l 3 ss is the specific storage coefficient l 1 t is the time t ϕ is the effective porosity c is the concentration m l 3 ρss is the density of the sink or source t 1 and qss is the sink and source term t 1 it was assumed that k0 is isotropic that the density of fresh groundwater ρ is 1000 kg m 3 and that the maximum density of the water ρss is 1025 kg m 3 a linear equation of state was used to calculate the density of the groundwater from concentration where it was assumed that only salt concentration influences the density ρ ρ f ρ c c relative salt concentrations were used ranging from 0 concentration of fresh groundwater to 35 concentration of sea water hence ρ c equals 0 7143 the governing equation for salt transport in the simulations was θ c t θ d c q c q s s c s s where d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2 t 1 q is the specific discharge vector l t 1 and css is the source and sink concentration m l 3 the groundwater flow equation and the dispersion term of the salt transport equation were formulated using a cell centered finite difference scheme the groundwater flow equation and the non advective part of the salt transport equation were solved using the pre conditioned conjugate gradient pcg and generalized conjugate gradient cgc packages respectively langevin et al 2008 zheng and wang 1999 the advection term was solved using third order total variation diminishing tvd method based on the ultimate algorithm universal limiter for transient interpolation modeling of the advective transport equations zheng and wang 1999 using this method and splitting up the advection dispersion equation into two components we envisage that the solution is mass conservative without excessive numerical dispersion and essentially oscillation free zheng and wang 1999 we also tested on our modeling case the performance of two other often used solvers within the seawat solver suite viz the finite difference fd and the method of characteristics moc methods the solvers hmoc and mmoc were not considered as they usually underperform for moc we used two parameter sets in the accurate case we used npl 16 nph 45 npmin 45 npmax 100 instead of 4 15 15 75 respectively see zheng and wang 1999 the results of all the solvers appear to be all similar and thus the tvd method was used throughout the entire modeling 3 2 2 geological dynamics in addition to these processes compaction results in a decrease of the permeability of top layers we adapted the elevation and permeability of the top layers accordingly ta et al 2002 truong et al 2011 tables 3 and 4 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity for each stress period in each aquifer and aquitard is presented in table 4 the holocene sediments were not present in sp1 sp5 the sediments were deposited in the last 6 5 ka table 4 ta et al 2001a b truong et al 2011 it is likely that the late pleistocene layers mostly disappeared due to erosion during sp1 to sp3 but after sp4 the rising sea level led to further sedimentation table 3 the estimates of aquifers and aquitards properties rely on geological processes clay compaction in particular will reduce the hydraulic conductivity furthermore other relevant variables e g recharge effective porosity have to be estimated over the whole simulation period the lack of data indicates that the conceptual geological model and the values of the hydraulic properties and other variables are disputable we do not claim to deduce the only correct geology and parameter values but by analyzing several options that change the hydraulic conductivities of aquitard layers we were able to establish a hydrogeological model that we can use to perform a plausible analysis of the most sensitive factors the starting points are the two geological cross sections given in fig 2b and c for groundwater transport phenomena the discontinuities and heterogeneity of the layers in particular the aquitards at a smaller scale are important to analyze the discontinuity and heterogeneity we simulated four 2d steady state flow model representations with aquifers and aquitards including different hydraulic conductivities this was done with the aim to find the reference model that fitted best observed salinization data four geology models were used firstly geology i has more disconnected strata and thinner aquitards fig 5 a with hydraulic properties as shown in table 4 secondly geology ii has more connected strata and thicker aquitards fig 5b with hydraulic properties as shown in table 4 thirdly geology iii has more disconnected strata and thinner aquitards being labeled as clay silt and sandy clay in fig 5a with all horizontal hydraulic conductivities of aquitards 10 times lower than geology i and finally geology iv has more disconnected strata and thinner aquitards fig 5a with all horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the aquitards equal to 10 9 m s note that all four options have the same hydraulic properties for very fine sand fine sand and coarse sand aquifers table 4 in the mekong delta the hydrogeological conceptual model consists of seven aquifers separated by seven aquitards bui et al 2013 minderhoud et al 2017 the aquifers and aquitards are heterogeneous and anisotropic the hydraulic conductivities are divided into parameter zones the top aquifer is unconfined and the other aquifers are confined the impermeable basement consists of intrusive and extrusive formations the hydraulic properties table 4 are based mainly on recent research from the division for water resource planning and investigation for the south of viet nam dwrpis these data were derived from many aquifer tests conducted by dwrpis bui et al 2013 from 1981 to 2015 there were more than 234 aquifer tests performed at the mkd bui et al 2013 the values of the horizontal conductivities were determined for seven aquifers and resulted in a range of 2 10 6 8 10 4 m s bui et al 2013 ha et al 2015 minderhoud et al 2017 there are no tests currently available for the vertical conductivities of the aquifers or for either the horizontal or vertical conductivities of the aquitards the vertical hydraulic properties for the eight stress periods were assumed to be 1 3 and 1 1 of the horizontal hydraulic properties of aquifers and aquitards respectively bagarello et al 2009 minderhoud et al 2017 wang and qiu 2017 for anisotropy we used the same values as in minderhoud et al 2017 in which a 3d model of the mekong delta was calibrated over 25 years the effective porosity was assumed to be 0 25 representing both sand and clay layers for all eight periods 3 2 3 boundary conditions we assumed dirichlet constant head boundary conditions on the southeastern side and the northwestern side of the 2d model the constant head boundary at the cambodian border was assigned the same values of the land surface geometry at that time the southeastern boundary at the coastline was based on the estimated average msl at that time figs 4 and 6 the river head boundary in the model was specified relative to the surface elevation at that time this was 5 0 m sp1 sp4 3 0 m sp5 sp7 and 0 2 m sp8 lower than the surface elevation at the cambodian border at that time and from there it dropped smoothly over the 2d cross section towards the vietnamese east sea at the corresponding time fig 6 the model had only a limited river head boundary for the three stress periods sp5 to sp7 due to full inundation from a rising sea level the formation depths are based on the 14c ages from the cores taken from the mekong delta vietnam table 3 ta et al 2005 2002 truong et al 2011 which provided the average altitude in the modeling in each stress period 3 2 4 salinity conditions we used total dissolved solids tds in g l in our modeling to represent salinity as mean sea level at 60 ka bp was approximately 70 m below msl the initial fresh saline groundwater distribution was assumed to be saline 35 tds g l similar to present tds of sea water for all model layers more than 70 m below the present msl layers 70 m above msl were assumed to be filled with fresh groundwater with 0 1 tds g l the tds concentration at the southeastern boundary was kept constant at 35 tds g l during the past 60 ka while at the northwestern boundary it was kept at a constant level of 0 1 tds g l the tds of the river and recharge remained constant with a sink source concentration value of 0 2 tds g l and 0 1 tds g l respectively for the whole simulation period fig 6 for simplicity we assumed that there was no salt water intrusion through the river system although salt water intrusion in deltaic areas was possibly important the molecular diffusion coefficient dm for porous media was assumed to be 8 64 10 5 m2d 1 e g delsman et al 2014 or oude essink et al 2010 the longitudinal dispersion coefficient αl was set to 2 0 m and the transversal ratio to longitudinal dispersion coefficient αl αth and αl αtv was set to 0 1 3 2 5 groundwater recharge the present day water balance for the mkd that links the inflow components to the aquifer system includes infiltration of rainfall and irrigation downward leakage through the semi permeable aquitards seepage from rivers streams and lakes downward flow from the overlying aquifers through the separate aquitards and subsurface inflow over the boundaries of the domain the discharge components include evapo transpiration of shallow groundwater well extraction from the aquifers flow from the mkd into the sea flow from the aquifers into the rivers canals streams and lakes and flow from the aquifers into the extensive network of surface drains bui et al 2013 boehmer and kootstra 2000 there is no long term precipitation record available for the mkd over the past 60 ka however chabangborn et al 2014 estimated that in the asian monsoon area precipitation minus evaporation was in the range of 400 800 mm year in the last glacial maximum viz 23 19 ka bp we applied a constant uniform groundwater recharge of 1 5 mm day which is equal to about 25 of the current long term precipitation average for the first four stress periods sp1 sp4 there is only a limited recharge boundary for the next three stress periods sp5 sp7 due to the sea water inundation of the whole mkd due to the increase of the resistance of the top aquitards in sp8 natural groundwater recharge was expected to be fairly small groundwater recharge was chosen to be 0 2 mm day only in addition the river conductance changes over time during the first four stress periods erosion occurs whereas during the last four periods sedimentation dominates as a result the river conductance in the first four stress periods 0 1 1 0 m2 day is smaller than in sp8 0 4 1 0 m2 day table 4 3 3 setting up the simulations the purpose of the 2d model was to gain insight into the most likely explanations for the present day fresh saline groundwater distribution and to identify the factors controlling the salinization and freshening processes the first step was to set up the reference case based on our best knowledge of the most likely parameter values we adjusted the model in such a way that the distribution of fresh saline groundwater as well as the age of the groundwater after computing 60 ka compared reasonably well with present day observations simultaneously groundwater heads groundwater velocity hydraulic parameters recharge and discharge had to lie within a plausible range during the development of the reference case we were able to identify the factors that were most sensitive to the model results based on the knowledge gained from the reference case we defined nine scenarios with a minimum and maximum value for each of the identified factors we changed only one parameter at a time so that the effects of the change could be observed individually the results of the simulations of the nine scenarios were evaluated and compared to the current distribution of saline and fresh groundwater table 5 summarizes the reference case and the nine scenarios the most sensitive parameters were expected to be hydraulic conductivities surface water level recharge river conductance longitudinal dispersion and initial tds concentration scenarios 1 4 tested the sensitivity of both horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities focusing specifically on each set of aquifers aquitards top aquitard layers and the percentage of vertical sandy shortcuts all for geology i fig 5a and table 4 for scenarios 1 3 the scenarios with the maximum parameter values are labeled a scenarios the scenarios with the minimum parameter values are labeled b scenarios the hydraulic conductivities in the maximum a scenarios were 10 times larger than the reference case while in the minimum b scenarios they were 10 times smaller than in the reference case except in scenario 1 where they were 4 times larger or smaller the top layers in scenarios 3a and 3b were continuous in scenario 4a around 25 of sandy permeable shortcuts were present in the top layer while in scenario 4b 35 of permeable shortcuts were present in scenario 5 in comparison to the reference case the river level rose by 5 m scenario 5a and dropped by 5 m scenario 5b furthermore in scenarios 6a and 6b the recharges were 20 higher and 20 lower respectively than in the reference case scenarios 7 and 8 focused on the conductance of the river and the longitudinal dispersion respectively they were multiplied a scenarios or divided b scenarios by a factor of 10 as in scenarios 2 and 3 in scenario 9 we changed the initial concentration to completely fresh groundwater in order to compare with the reference case and evaluate the effect caused by a different initial concentration 4 results 4 1 reference case the modeled distribution of fresh saline groundwater is presented in fig 7 a i at 60 40 26 18 12 6 5 4 5 2 5 ka bp and at present i e the end of stress periods respectively the age distribution of the groundwater simulated at the present time is given in fig 8 for comparison the projection of observed salinity and the age of groundwater are given in fig 7i present day and fig 8 respectively four main phases can be distinguished fig 7a i during the first phase from 60 ka to 18 ka bp there was freshening of the groundwater driven by the sea level regression and low mean sea level fresh groundwater replaced saline groundwater up to 500 m below the surface during the second phase the largest volume of fresh groundwater was present between 18 and 12 ka bp during the third phase from 12 ka to 2 5 ka bp a serious salinization of the groundwater occurred because a higher mean sea level led to sea water infiltrating the groundwater kooi et al 2000 explained that if the rate of transgression is sufficient fast the salinization of the subsurface cannot keep up by means of a lateral henry case salt water intrusion wedge development and saline water will move on top of the fresh groundwater system causing salt water to infiltrate here in our case the conditions are such that even salt water plumes also often called seawater fingers salt fingers or density fingers are bringing relatively rapidly salt groundwater into the system this fingering process is a much more rapid salinization process than diffusion is see simmons et al 1999 zimmermann et al 2006 wooding et al 1997a b the driving force of the groundwater flow and salt transport system is the transition of a relatively high gradient system into a low gradient system within a relatively short time span at this period due to the rapid rise in the sea water level however we have to remember that our model area of interest the horizontal scale a few hundreds of kilometers is quite a few orders of magnitude larger than the vertical scale some tens of meters making the high gradient system not really a topography driven groundwater flow system during this third phase saline groundwater was present in most parts of the 2d model during the last phase of the last 2 5 ka sea level dropped slightly thus a freshening process is to be expected as in the early stress periods however due to the high resistance of the top sediment layer formed during the period of high mean sea level there was no significant freshening of the groundwater to evaluate the feasibility of our reference case in detail we compared the model results at the end of sp8 with the observed salinity data table 2 and fig 3 we compared the groundwater salinity and age simulated in sp8 with the salinity and age observed at different depths in the mkd figs 7i and 8 furthermore we ensured that the groundwater heads lay within a feasible range of values during the entire calculation period for geology ii more connected strata and thicker aquitards fig 5b with hydraulic properties as shown in table 4 geology iii more disconnected strata and thinner aquitards with all horizontal hydraulic conductivities of aquitards 10 times lower than geology i and geology iv more disconnected strata and thinner aquitards with all horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the aquitards equal to 10 9 m s the freshwater from the top system recharge source could not penetrate deeper than about 350 m fig 7j u below present day surface level after a period of 60 ka this does not match with observed groundwater salinity because presently fresh groundwater is found in aquifers up to 500 m below the surface fig 3a in addition at the present day viz fig 7m q u representing the geologies ii iii and iv respectively sea water could not have infiltrated into the fresh groundwater system to form the present heterogeneous distribution of fresh saline groundwater in the study area the effect of aquitards in the top system on the development of the salt water plumes depends on their occurrences and their level of permeability per geology model figs 5 7 and table 4 when the geology model contains clay layers with hydraulic conductivities that are assumed to be normal in this mkd viz geology i then wide salt water plumes occur figs 5a 7f i when the geology model contains thick clay layers with very low hydraulic conductivities e g geology ii fig 5b salt water plumes moving through the medium were slowed down hence it took more time to get into the deeper parts of the groundwater system while less plumes are developed anyway fig 7m kooi et al 2000 even when the geology set up remains the same as in the reference case fig 5a but the existing hydraulic conductivities of the aquitards are much lower e g geology iii iv the salt water plumes were also slowed down and the deeper parts of the onshore groundwater system would not contain saline groundwater fig 7q and u in both geology models with very low permeability of the aquitards the total amount of salt water plumes was large but the number of deep plumes was pretty limited for further analysis we used the geology i option as the most likely geology for the reference case fig 7a i because we compared a 2d modeled cross section to 3d real world observations we cannot expect absolute equivalence nevertheless the spatial distribution and heterogeneity seen in figs 7a i and 8 appear to be reasonable in particular in the final stage fresh groundwater could be modeled in the deepest aquifers up to 500 m below the surface and at a short distance from the present coastline this situation was observed in tra vinh and soc trang provinces bui et al 2013 furthermore the modeled age of groundwater was also consistent with the observed data figs 3b and 8 as shown in fig 8 groundwater older than 40 ka was only present in the offshore section of the 2d model for the inland section the groundwater was not older than 40 ka bp except for small volumes in the deepest aquifers close to the bedrock where it is trapped as fairly stagnant groundwater this indicates that most of the groundwater in our 2d model was completely replaced during the past 40 60 ka fig 7a i likely older 60ka saline groundwater is trapped in areas with low permeability in the vertical and lateral direction and has not been flushed out as suggested by the results of our 2d reference model in the 3d reality flushing could more easily happen and this saline water could be better drained by slow mixing or even just only hydrodynamic diffusion this phenomenon is quite common in old saline groundwater systems and could also explain the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater ages 4 2 scenarios scenarios 1 change in aquifers 2 change in aquitards 3 change in top aquitards 7 change in river conductance 8 change in longitudinal dispersion and 9 change in initial concentration appear to be the most sensitive to groundwater salinity and age the results of the other scenarios appear to be less affected the present day distributions of groundwater salinity for the nine scenarios are given in fig 9 the present day distributions of the age of groundwater for these scenarios are given in fig 10 fig 11 shows the deepest location of fresh groundwater as a function of time for all scenarios except for scenario 9 fig 12 shows the total volume of fresh groundwater in million m3 per stretched meter as a function of time for all scenarios each scenario is shown separately with the reference case and the minimum and maximum values except for scenario 4 fig 13 shows the comparison between the volume of fresh groundwater modeled for the reference case with mean sea level relative to its fluctuations over the last 60 ka note that we inverted the y axis for this volume of fresh groundwater on purpose to better show the correlation between fresh groundwater volume and mean sea level for the reference case the deepest level of fresh groundwater as well as the volume of fresh groundwater changed dramatically with the sea level over the last 60 ka figs 11 and 12 even when the sea level rose the deepest level of fresh groundwater kept getting deeper and the volume of fresh groundwater remained stable for some millennia before it fell following the mean sea level fig 13 fig 7d and e show where freshening continues between 18ka and 12ka in the center of the study area while saltwater transgresses from the southeast boundary the delay is mainly connected to the permeability of the low permeable layers kooi et al 2000 post and kooi 2003 the volume of fresh groundwater has continued falling even to the present day thus there is apparently no steady state situation our first four scenarios focus on the conductivities of the sedimentary layers in scenarios 1a and 2a the groundwater velocity was so high that saline groundwater was quickly replaced by fresh groundwater recharge in the entire model within 60 30 ka bp thus the conductivities of both aquitards and aquifers as high as 10 and 4 times the reference case respectively were probably not truly representative for these scenarios in contrast the groundwater in scenarios 1b and 2b fig 12 moved a bit too slowly this observation was also supported by the age of groundwater modeling while the ages of groundwater were very low in scenarios 1a and 2a fig 10a and c they were too high in scenarios 1b and 2b fig 10b and d in scenarios 1b and 2b fresh groundwater could not penetrate deeper than 350 m below the present day surface level after a period of 60 ka bp the high vertical resistance that was set in scenario 2b meant that the infiltration of fresh or saline groundwater from the top layer to deeper aquifers was also too slow fig 9d the changes in top aquitards scenario 3 basically only affect the volume and depth of fresh groundwater during the last thousand years scenarios 4 more sandy shortcuts in top layer 5 river water level and 6 groundwater recharge appear to be less sensitive to the factors we identified than the others scenario 7a increase the river conductance by a factor of 10 shows that most of the fresh groundwater came from upstream cambodia and the river system in the higher northwestern parts causing the simulated age of groundwater to shift from young to old in a northwest to southeast direction fig 10g this was not consistent with the age data observed in general the age of groundwater in the mekong delta vietnam increases into the direction of groundwater flow the age of groundwater grows from young groundwater to older groundwater as we move from the upper to the lower aquifers figs 3b and 8 scenario 7b in which groundwater was rapidly and completely replaced between 60 and 40 ka bp is also not plausible in scenario 8a the dispersion coefficient was ten times higher than the reference case resulting in too much mixing of the groundwater while in scenario 8b fresh groundwater could not penetrate deeper than 460 m below the present day surface level over time in scenarios 8a and 8b the volume of fresh groundwater was notably different as observed in figs 11h and 12h the reference case and scenario 9 represent the most extreme initial concentrations almost completely saline and completely fresh respectively 5 discussion our 2d model of the mekong delta vietnam simulates variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport over the past 60 ka the final model stage after 60 ka of simulation and representing the present situation shows acceptable agreement between modeled and the observed present day distribution of both groundwater salinity and age analyses of all nine scenarios give strong indications that the groundwater present at 60 ka bp in the entire system has been almost completely replaced within 60 ka we therefore assume that our simulation period of 60 ka is long enough to avoid any strong or undesired effects from the unknown initial conditions moreover scenarios 1 2 and 3 revealed our first insight into the rather limited value of the conductivity of the entire groundwater system low vertical conductivity of the top aquitards scenario 2b would have led to the deeper parts of the mkd having a substantially larger fresh groundwater volume this would have been due to the infiltration of fresh groundwater taking place over a sufficiently long period the vertical conductivity would not have been a serious limiting factor over this time scale for the last ten thousand years a low vertical conductivity would have safeguarded the fresh groundwater resources unfortunately the most realistic vertical conductivity as used in our reference case could not protect the fresh groundwater resources from being rapid infiltrated by saline seawater over time the analysis of the geology ii model indicates that connected and homogeneous aquitards are most unlikely the freshwater from the top system could not penetrate deeper than about 350 m fig 7k below present day surface level nevertheless saline water could also not infiltrate into the groundwater system in order to form the very heterogeneous present day fresh saline distribution fig 7m in order to reproduce the present day age and salinity distribution water from the upper boundary has to infiltrate into the deeper subsoil this appears to be possible only with disconnected and or heterogeneous aquitards there is a significant change in fresh groundwater volume during the 60 ka of simulation see fig 13 on changing fresh groundwater volumes and sea level elevation it appears the delay to the sea level rise by volume is on average several thousands of years the delay is mainly linked to the permeability of the low permeable layers though the shallower the system we are focusing on the shorter the memory of the groundwater system in the deepest parts of the mkd the memory is many tens of thousands of years additionally fig 13 shows that during the period 60 12 ka bp most freshwater infiltrated the groundwater system when the sea level was very low substantial parts of the top layer had high hydraulic conductivity thereby leading to a strong freshwater infiltration it appears from our scenarios that the most sensitive parameters are the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers and aquitards scenarios 1 2 and 3 the interaction with the riverbed scenario 7 which represents the interaction between the surface water system the longitudinal dispersion scenario 8 and the initial concentration scenarios 0 and 9 as can be seen in scenarios 1 2 3 7 8 and 9 figs 9 12 these factors strongly control the salinization and freshening processes in the 2d model of the mkd although the depth of the deepest fresh groundwater and the volume of fresh groundwater change significantly between the minimum and maximum values modeled we observed that only the reference case can realistically reproduce both the observed data on salinity and the age of groundwater furthermore the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was observed to be important for the degree of mixing but its effect on the overall availability of freshwater is not substantial fig 12h sedimentation took place during the last transgression period the last 12 ka this resulted in top clay layers that have a high resistance to infiltration by fresh groundwater currently the present top layer acts more or less as a seal on the subsurface reservoir the deeper aquifers are basically separated from surface hydrology due to the low permeability of the top aquitard but the deeper aquifers still receive some groundwater influx via the upper aquifers nevertheless our 2d model result suggested that the natural groundwater recharge of fresh water in the present day is limited as a result the recharge of fresh groundwater is very limited at present and the volume of fresh groundwater was seen to decrease significantly over the last 12 ka in all the scenarios fig 13 despite the slightly falling sea level almost all the scenarios show a persistent decrease in the volume of fresh groundwater during the last 2 5 ka this is mainly due to the limited groundwater recharge and over exploitation of groundwater resources is serious problem it should be noted that we did not include groundwater extraction in the model which would lead to a much faster decrease in the fresh groundwater resources because the extractions are only relevant for the last decades they are not relevant for our scenarios we performed minimum maximum scenarios for several parameters hydraulic conductivity river conductance groundwater recharge but did not attempt to quantify the uncertainties in our 2d model as such the results from the scenarios form a conceptual analysis rather than a real world simulation or quantification of the associated uncertainties nevertheless the salinity and age in the reference case resemble the observed present day distribution of both groundwater salinity and age reasonably well and give us confidence that our model has captured the most important groundwater processes in the mkd informed by this research our future work includes compiling a 3d groundwater model using 3d geology groundwater surface water interaction salinity distribution and groundwater extractions the present research contributes to this future 3d modeling tool that can be used to inform ground water strategies regarding vulnerability of the system 6 conclusions we have simulated the evolution of the fresh saline groundwater distribution and its age through the late pleistocene and holocene periods along a 2d cross section with a variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport model based on the subsurface and geographical characteristics of the mekong delta vietnam this model enabled us to analyze the fresh saline distribution volume of fresh groundwater and age dynamics of the groundwater reservoir the erosion and sedimentation processes over the past 60 ka as well as mean sea level changes still appear to have a dominant influence on the present day distribution of fresh saline groundwater and its age most fresh groundwater infiltrated the subsurface during a period of low sea level at least more than 20 ka ago sedimentation during the last 20 ka has increased the resistance of the top layer and this currently prevents fresh groundwater from being recharged to a great extent from the last period of lowstand of mean sea level our simulations strongly suggest that the volume of fresh groundwater was consistently declining under natural conditions extraction of groundwater not included in the model over paleo time scales will amplify this decline despite the limitations of our 2d model the most sensitive factors controlling salinization and freshening processes were identified our analysis is the
