19180,the occurrence of repair system in microorganisms after ultraviolet uv induced damage to them evokes concern regarding the effectiveness of uv disinfection most studies focus on the repair of bacteria but little research has been conducted on the repair of fungi in water this study aimed to investigate the photoreactivation and dark repair properties of three dominant genera of fungal spores trichoderma harzianum aspergillus niger and penicillium polonicum isolated from groundwater uv based advanced oxidation processes aops including uv peroxymonosulfate and uv hydrogen peroxide were used to control their photoreactivation the results demonstrated that the three genera of fungal spores inactivated by uv 254 nm exhibited different levels of photoreactivation under uva 365 nm exposure and the photoreactivation percentage showed that t harzianum 51 35 a niger 29 07 p polonicum 9 01 the photoreactivation process of fungal spores was well described by the first order model t harzianum had lower photoreactivation percentage but a more rapid initial photoreactivation process than e coli higher uv dosages significantly decreased the photoreactivation percentage of fungal spores however dark repair was insignificant following uv disinfection for all the three genera of fungal spores after treatment by uv based aops the fungal spores exhibited the same photoreactivation trend as those treated by uv alone however both the maximum survival ratios and photoreactivation rate constants were reduced to varying degrees this study revealed the photoreactivation rule of dominant genera of fungi isolated from groundwater following uv treatment alone and uv based aops which is effective for controlling fungi in water graphical abstract image 1 keywords fungal spores

due to its advantageous broad spectrum efficiency against various pathogens the non formation of disinfection by products dbps with its use and the ease of its operation guo et al 2009 hijnen et al 2006 uv disinfection mechanisms involve the formation of lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds and 6 4 photoproducts 6 4 pps in the genomic dna after exposure to uv light uvc 200 280 nm friedberg et al 2016 nebot sanz et al 2007 these photoproducts prevent dna replication and transcription resulting in cell death süss et al 2009 however it has been reported that many microorganisms have the ability to repair the uv induced damage through two main repair systems photoreactivation light dependent and dark repair light independent friedberg et al 2016 harm 1980 photoreactivation is a phenomenon in which cpds are disintegrated with photolyase into dimers under near uv light uva and visible light 320 480 nm lindenauer and darby 1994 oguma et al 2004 in contrast dark repair is a dna damage repair mechanism that is independent of light guintini et al 2015 sinha and häder 2002 the activity of microorganisms repairing uv induced damage reduces disinfection efficiency which causes a biological safety concern the photoreactivation and dark repair of bacteria in drinking water and wastewater have been studied in these aspects including the influencing factors bohrerova et al 2014 salcedo et al 2007 shafaei et al 2017 photoreactivation kinetics kashimada et al 1996 nebot sanz et al 2007 velez colmenares et al 2012 and control methods for reducing photoreactivation guo et al 2009 hallmich and gehr 2010 kaur et al 2016 li et al 2017 especially the uv dosage is extensively considered in the research of photoreactivation according to guo et al 2009 uv dosage plays an important role in photoreactivation that no photoreactivaion of e coli was found when a uv dosage of 15 mj cm2 was applied nebot et al nebot sanz et al 2007 also found that the photoreactivaiton of bacterium decreased after higher uvc dose treatment moreover the control method of changing uv source was proposed to reduce photoreactivation of bacteria several studies showed that photoreactivation was reduced significantly after medium pressure mp uv disinfection compared to a low pressure lp mercury lamp hu et al 2005 hu and quek 2008 kalisvaart 2004 oguma et al 2002 zimmer and slawson 2002 moreover photoreactivation and dark repair of e coli were perceptibly suppressed by 280 nm uv light emitting diodes leds li et al 2017 compared with water borne bacteria little research has been done with regards to fungal reactivation after uv irradiation several studies report that fungi also possess dna repair systems including photoreactivation and dark repair against uv induced damages berrocaltito et al 2007 bluhm and dunkle 2008 goldman and kafer 2004 however most studies focus on the reactivation of entomopathogenic fungi such as beauveria bassiana chelico et al 2005 2006 chelico and khachatourians 2008 verticillium lecanii and aphanocladium album flint et al 2002 photoreactivation of the zygomycete fungus phycomyces blakesleeanus was also reported previously galland 1996 however little research has been done regarding the reactivation of fungi in water after inactivation by uv irradiation recently fungi in aquatic environments have gained more attention oliveira et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 wen et al 2017b the occurrence of fungi in water can generate taste and odor issues and even cause ill health in immunocompromised individuals wen et al 2017a dominant fungi detected in groundwater are from the genera penicillium aspergillus trichoderma acremonium and cladosporium göttlich et al 2002 pereira et al 2009 wen et al 2017a recently we found that uv and uv peroxymonosulfate uv pms can inactivate the fungi in groundwater efficiently wen et al 2017b but the reactivation of fungi has yet to be studied thus this study aimed to 1 investigate the photoreactivation and dark repair properties of three dominant genera of fungal spores trichoderma harzianum aspergillus niger and penicillium polonicum isolated from groundwater following uv disinfection 2 explore the impact of uv dosage and uva light intensity on photoreactivation 3 illustrate uv based advanced oxidation processes aops to control the photoreactivation of fungi in pbs solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganisms three genera of fungal spores trichoderma harzianum t harzianum aspergillus niger a niger and penicillium polonicum p polonicum were used as test microorganisms because they are the dominant fungi in groundwater collected from northwest china wen et al 2017a e coli atcc25922 was chosen as a representative of bacteria to compare with fungi in the photoreactivation study 2 2 preparation of microbial suspensions fungal spores were chosen to test the photoreactivation of fungi and the fungal spores were prepared as previously described wen et al 2017a the spore suspension concentration cfu ml was determined using a light microscope bx51 olympus japan the initial concentration of fungal spores was maintained at 108 cfu ml e coli was inoculated into a 150 ml liquid nutrient broth medium and cultivated in an incubator at 37 c with shaking at 120 rpm for 24 h then the medium was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and the cells were washed twice and diluted with sterile pbs to obtain the suspensions the initial concentration of e coli was controlled at 108 cfu ml 2 3 inactivation experiments the uv inactivation and uv based aops were conducted in a collimated beam apparatus that contained three parallel lp mercury lamps wen et al 2017b the average uv fluence rate measured by iodide iodate chemical actinometry was 0 109 mw cm2 during the uv exposure process 1 ml of fungal spore suspensions 108 cfu ml were added to 99 ml of phosphate buffer pbs solution to achieve a 100 ml water sample with the final spore concentration of 106 cfu ml the water sample was placed in a petri dish 120 mm diameter exposed to uvc 254 nm and then stirred gently using magnetic stirring once the exposure time was reached a 1 ml water sample was taken and diluted using sterile pbs solution to ensure the colony count on the plate was in the range of 30 300 cfu and 0 1 ml of diluted sample was spread plated each in triplicate the plates were then incubated upright at 27 c in the dark for 2 4 days the results were recorded as cfu ml based on the average number of colonies the inactivation of three genera of fungal spores by uv based aops was similar to that of the inactivation process involving uv alone an aliquot of 1 ml reagent pms and h2o2 was added to 98 ml of pbs solution without a chloride ion in which the concentration of fungal spores was also kept at 106 cfu ml after the inactivation 1 ml sodium thiosulfate 1 mol l was added to terminate the oxidant all the inactivation experiments were conducted at a temperature of 23 c 2 4 photoreactivation and dark repair experiments after uv irradiation the petri dishes containing the samples were immediately placed under two fluorescent lamps 8 w 15 w philips holland for the photoreactivation experiments the uva irradiance wavelength was 365 nm and the uva irradiance intensity was 0 10 0 25 mw cm2 measured using a spectroradiometer uva365 sanpometer china the photoreactivation process lasted for 8 h with respect to the dark repair process after inactivation the petri dish containing inactivation samples was covered with aluminum foil for a period of 8 h kaur et al 2016 the temperature for photoreactivation and dark repair was controlled at 23 c water samples were taken at regular time intervals during photoreactivation and dark repair a 1 ml water sample was diluted using sterile pbs solution and a 0 1 ml diluted sample was spread plated each in triplicate the plates were then incubated upright at 27 c in the dark for 2 4 days the results were recorded in cfu ml based on the average number of colonies 2 5 data analysis the effects of uv and uv based aops on the inactivation of fungi were expressed as a logarithmic reduction at different uv dosages and the equation is listed as follows 1 n log n t n 0 where n 0 and n t are the concentration of fungi cfu ml at inactivation time 0 and time t and n is the value of log10 inactivation survival ratio and photoreactivation percentage were used to evaluate the photoreactivation the equations are as follows 2 survival ratio n p n 0 100 3 photoreactivation percentage n p n d n 0 n d 100 where n 0 is the initial concentration of fungi before inactivation n d and n p are the concentration of fungi after inactivation and photoreactivation respectively control efficiency ce was introduced here to describe the ability of controlling photoreactivation by uv based aops the equation is expressed as follows 4 c e s u v s u v a o p s s u v 100 where s uv is the survival ratio after 120 min of photoreactivation following inactivation with uv alone and s uv aops is the survival ratio after 120 min of photoreactivation following uv based aop inactivation the time of 120 min was chosen because t harzianum the most significant photoreactivation of the three fungal spores reached the highest photoreactivation percentage at this time 2 6 kinetics modelling 2 6 1 inactivation kinetics the inactivation processes were described by the chick watson model dalrymple et al 2010 which shows a linear relationship between the inactivation efficiency and the exposure time wen et al 2017b 5 ln n 0 n t k i t where k the slope of the line is the pseudo first order inactivation rate constant cm2 mj i represents the uv fluence rate mw cm2 and t represents the uv irradiation time s 2 6 2 photoreactivation kinetics to describe the photoreactivation process two models were applied to simulate the photoreactivation process one was a saturation type first order reaction model proposed by kashimada kashimada et al 1996 which was used to predict the reactivation phase without induction time the kinetic reaction can be expressed as follows 6 s s m s 0 1 e k 1 t s 0 the other was second order reaction model proposed by nebot sanz nebot sanz et al 2007 this model was a modification of the first order model and coincided with the classic logistic equation the second order reaction included the initial imperceptible photoreactivation followed by a rapid exponential growth and a final stabilization period the photoreactivation kinetics can be described as follows 7 s s m 1 s m s 0 1 e k 2 s m t in the two equations k 1 is the first order photoreactivation rate constant and k 2 is the new growth second order reactivation rate constant s 0 is the survival ratio after uv inactivation n d n 0 s is the survival ratio at photoreactivation time t n p n 0 and s m is the maximum survival ratio during the photoreactivation process the goodness of fit was evaluated using the correlation coefficient r 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv inactivation characteristics of fungal spores and e coli the uv inactivation of the fungal spores t harzianum p polonicum a niger and e coli were examined in pbs solution using an lp mercury lamp as shown in table 1 it was found that a greater uv dosage was required to achieve the reduction of fungi than that of e coli table s1 shows the kinetic formula of the chick watson model for the uv inactivation of fungal spores and e coli the uv inactivation rate constants k of t harzianum p polonicum and a niger are 0 0638 0 0859 and 0 0368 cm2 mj respectively which are remarkably lower than the k of e coli 0 1293 cm2 mj based on these kinetic data the order of resistance to uv irradiation was determined as e coli p polonicum t harzianum a niger this order was mainly attributed to the structural differences between the fungi and e coli wen et al 2017b 3 2 photoreactivation of fungal spores and kinetics analysis photoreactivation of fungal spores was determined in pbs solutions with a 2 log10 reduction by uv inactivation and then photoreactivation under different uva irradiation intensities 0 10 0 17 and 0 25 mw cm2 for 8 h e coli was also examined here by comparison the uv dosage for 2 log10 inactivation is shown in table s2 fig 1 shows the photoreactivation percentage of three genera of fungal spores and e coli as a function of reaction time the results indicate that the fungal spores in water underwent photoreactivation at different levels t harzianum had the most significant photoreactivation whereas p polonicum behaved a low level of photoreactivation however the three genera of fungal spores exhibited similar trends in that their photoreactivation percentage became significant at around 2 h then remained relatively stable from 2 to 8 h in general specifically t harzianum had a slow increase of photoreactivation percentage after 2 h exposure at uva irradiance intensity of 0 10 mw cm2 a niger also had a slow growth at uva irradiance intensity of 0 17 mw cm2 after 2 h photoreactivation besides the maximum photoreactivation percentage followed the order t harzianum 51 35 a niger 29 07 p polonicum 9 01 the significant differences in the photoreactivation percentage of the three genera of fungal spores may be due to the difference in cell structure and repair genes bohrerova and linden 2010 sinha and häder 2002 it was also found that a certain range of higher uva light intensity promoted the photoreactivation of fungal spores for instance with the increase of uva irradiance intensity from 0 10 to 0 25 mw cm2 the photoreactivation percentage at 120 min of p polonicum increased by nearly 3 fold from 2 74 to 6 11 for t harzianum the photoreactivaiotn percentage at 120 min reached 51 35 almost 2 5 fold higher as the uva irradiance intensity increased from 0 10 to 0 17 mw cm2 similarly after exposure to a uva irradiance intensity of 0 17 mw cm2 for 120 min the photoreactivation percentage of a niger achieved 20 higher than 12 of that at a uva irradiance of 0 10 mw cm2 these results are in accordance with those of previous studies quek and hu 2008 however it behaved a decrease in the photoreactivation percentage of t harzianum and a niger when the uva irradiance intensity increased up to 0 25 mw cm2 the results are probably attributed to that relative higher uva light intensity may exert a negative impact on some genera of fungi and probably inhibit their photoreactivation process xiao et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 compared with e coli fungal spores had lower maximum photoreactivation percentage overall for example the maximum photoreactivation percentage of t harzianum was 51 35 lower than e coli 72 83 moreover it was also found that t harzianum underwent immediate photoreactivation after uv inactivation and reached a considerable photoreactivation percentage in a short time for instance t harzianum achieved a 1 log10 recovery after 15 min of photoreactivation but by comparison there was a delayed period in the photoreactivation process of e coli specifically the photoreactivation rate of e coli was less than 1 in the initial 40 min and 1 log10 photoreactivation of e coli required as long as 60 min this significant difference in the photoreactivation between fungal spores and e coli may be the result of differences in cell structure and repair systems braga et al 2015 meroueh et al 2006 sisti et al 2012 fungi are complex eukaryotes with more organelles than e coli thus their cell activities are different the repair systems of fungi are also different from those of e coli except that the cpd and 6 4 photolyases are also found in multicellular eukaryotes bluhm and dunkle 2008 moreover the fungal photolyases have different coding genes and compositions from those of e coli and different photolyase activities resulted in different photoreactivation rates and amounts in fungal spores and e coli cells the photoreactivation kinetics of fungal spores and e coli were then examined they were found to exhibit remarkably different behavior as shown in table 2 the fitting curve is shown in fig s1 the first order model as shown in eq 6 was more suitable to fit the data of fungal spores and obtained good fitting results r2 0 92 table 2 gives the kinetic parameters of the first order model applied to the fungal photoreactivation process the kinetic rate constant k 1 on exposure to a uva irradiance intensity of 0 17 mw cm2 was in order t harzianum 0 0115 1 min a niger 0 0106 1 min p polonicum 0 0740 1 min however the logistic model eq 7 was more suitable to describe the photoreactivation of e coli with correlation coefficients r2 between 0 95 and 0 97 table 2 furthermore as shown in table 2 the behavior of k 1 and sm was seen to be with the changes in the uva irradiance intensity the photoreactivation of fungal spores was ubiquitous but dissimilar from that of e coli 3 3 photoreactivation of fungal spores after inactivation at different uv dosages fig 2 shows the impact of uv dosage on the photoreactivation of three genera of fungal spores and e coli with 120 min photoreactivation under a uva light intensity of 0 25 mw cm2 in a pbs solution table s2 shows the uv dosage reaction time required to achieve 2 log10 3 log10 and 4 log10 inactivation as shown in fig 2 high uv dosage significantly decreased the photoreactivation percentage of all fungal spores and e coli for instance the photoreactivation percentage of t harzianum reduced from 38 56 to 1 66 as the uv dosage increased from 38 mj cm2 2 log10 to 70 mj cm2 3 log10 similarly with increase in the uv dosage from 18 mj cm2 to 38 mj cm2 the photoreactivation percentage of e coli decreased from 60 72 to 2 86 when 3 log10 inactivation was achieved e coli remained at the highest photoreactivation level with the photoreactivation percentage of 2 86 furthermore increasing the uv dosage to obtain 4 log10 inactivation reduced the photoreactivation of e coli to a minimum of only 0 06 however for t harzianum and a niger the photoreactivation percentage were 0 54 and 0 16 respectively both higher than that of e coli therefore although increasing uv dosage can reduce the photoreactivation level of all fungal spores and e coli fungi are not as easily controllable as e coli at higher uv dosages when a lower photoreactivation level is expected 3 4 dark repair fig 3 shows the reactivation of fungal spores and e coli in darkness after 2 log10 inactivation by uv irradiation in a pbs solution the dark repair at 0 h represents the concentration of survival spores after 2 log10 inactivation during the dark repair time of 8 h no significant reactivation was found in the three genera of fungal spores and in e coli and the concentration of survival spores and e coli decreased slightly in the dark the results were similar to those of a previous study nebot sanz et al 2007 that reported only a slight reactivation 0 1 in the dark repair experiment and a decay period in which survival decreased li et al 2017 indicated that the maximum dark repair percentage was 0 29 by lp uv irradiation thus dark repair plays a minor role in reactivation of fungal spores indicating that the fungal spores may not contain the dna repair mechanism in darkness especially the ner pathway 3 5 control of fungal photoreactivation with uv based aops the uv based aop treatments produced reactive radicals which attacked the cell wall and cell membrane of the fungal spores resulting in the leakage of intracellular contents wen et al 2017b based on the excellent inactivation of fungi by uv based aops the control of fungal photoreactivation using uv based aops was also investigated 3 5 1 control of fungal photoreactivation using uv pms as shown in table s3 the required uv dosage decreased with the addition of pms when aiming to obtain the same inactivation efficiency 2 log10 for example for t harzianum 40 mj cm2 of uv irradiation was required to achieve a 2 log10 inactivation in the treatment with uv alone in the uv pms treatment 35 mj cm2 of uv irradiation was required with a combination of 0 1 mm pms furthermore when increasing the pms concentration up to 1 0 mm the uv dosage was decreased to 30 mj cm2 fig 4 and fig s2 show the photoreactivation processes of the three genera of fungal spores treated by uv pms with 2 log10 inactivation then under exposure of a uva light intensity of 0 25 mw cm2 the results showed that the photoreactivation processes of the three genera of fungal spores treated by uv pms were significantly different from those treated by uv alone specifically both the maximum survival ratio s m and photoreactivation rate constant k 1 reduced significantly table s5 for example the s m of t harzianum reduced from 39 39 to 24 44 and k 1 decreased from 0 0103 to 0 0064 1 min after treatment with uv pms uv dosage of 35 mj cm2 and 0 1 mm pms when compared with the treatment involving uv alone uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 table s5 when increasing the pms concentration up to 1 0 mm the s m and k 1 of t harzianum was continuously decreased to 8 93 and 0 0031 1 min table s5 respectively thus there was a better control with an increased concentration of pms which was illustrated by control efficiency ce shown in fig 6 for the three fungal spores a greater control efficiency was achieved at a higher concentration of pms using uv pms treatment t harzianum was more easily controlled by uv pms with a maximum control efficiency of 79 5 at the pms concentration of 1 0 mm and uv dosage of 30 mj cm2 for p polonicum and a niger the maximum control efficiencies using uv pms were 55 7 and 40 1 respectively 3 5 2 control of fungal photoreactivation using uv h2o2 the control of photoreactivation using uv h2o2 was also examined the three genera of fungal spores were inactivated by uv h2o2 with 2 log10 inactivation then the photoreactivation was observed according to table s4 the uv dosage was not significantly reduced with the addition of h2o2 compared with the treatment with uv alone however the reduction in photoreactivation levels of the three fungal spores treated by uv h2o2 2 log10 was noticeable which was reflected in the lower s m and k 1 values as shown in fig 5 fig s3 and table s6 the photoreactivation process after treatment by uv h2o2 exhibits the same trends as that after treatment by uv alone at the oxidant concentration of 0 1 mm the control efficiency of uv h2o2 was higher than that of uv pms however uv h2o2 had invariable control on t harzianum and p polonicum regardless of the h2o2 concentration as presented in fig 6 with respect to a niger uv h2o2 treatment showed excellent results with a higher control efficiency at all the applied h2o2 concentrations superior to those of treatments by uv pms in summary uv based aops did reduce the photoreactivation levels of the three genera of fungal spores to varying degrees which is probably attributed to the produced reactive radicals resulting in the damage to the cell wall and cell membrane and then the release of intracellular contents wen et al 2017b which cannot be repaired by the uva irradiation 4 conclusions the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the inactivation of fungal spores and e coli by uv irradiation fits the chick watson model the uv inactivation rate constants k of a niger t harzianum p polonicum and e coli are 0 0368 0 0638 0 0859 and 0 1293 cm2 mj respectively 2 fungal spores show different levels of photoreactivation after uv irradiation and t harzianum had the most significant photoreactivation whereas p polonicum exhibited the lowest level of photoreactivation moreover greater uv dosages significantly decrease the photoreactivation of fungal spores while a certain range of higher uva light intensity promotes photoreactivation the dark repair of the three genera of fungal spores is insignificant 3 the first order model fits the fungal photoreactivation process well the photoreactivation rate constant k 1 on exposure to uva irradiance of 0 17 mw cm2 was in the order t harzianum a niger p polonicum compared with e coli fungal spores have lower photoreactivation percentage particularly t harzianum reaches a considerable level of photoreactivation rapidly in contrast to the delay period in the initial photoreactivation process of e coli 4 three genera of fungal spores treated by uv based aops including uv pms and uv h2o2 have the same photoreactivation trends as those treated by uv alone however both the maximum survival ratio and photoreactivation rate constant are reduced after inactivation by uv based aops compared with uv alone acknowledgement this research was

inoculated into a 150 ml liquid nutrient broth medium and cultivated in an incubator at 37 c with shaking at 120 rpm for 24 h then the medium was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and the cells were washed twice and diluted with sterile pbs to obtain the suspensions the initial concentration of e coli was controlled at 108 cfu ml 2 3 inactivation experiments the uv inactivation and uv based aops were conducted in a collimated beam apparatus that contained three parallel lp mercury lamps wen et al 2017b the average uv fluence rate measured by iodide iodate chemical actinometry was 0 109 mw cm2 during the uv exposure process 1 ml of fungal spore suspensions 108 cfu ml were added to 99 ml of phosphate buffer pbs solution to achieve a 100 ml water sample with the final spore concentration of 106 cfu ml the water sample was placed in a petri dish 120 mm diameter exposed to uvc 254 nm and then stirred gently using magnetic stirring once the exposure time was reached a 1 ml water sample was taken and diluted using sterile pbs solution to ensure the colony count on the plate was in the range of 30 300 cfu and 0 1 ml of diluted sample was spread plated each in triplicate the plates were then incubated upright at 27 c in the dark for 2 4 days the results were recorded as cfu ml based on the average number of colonies the inactivation of three genera of fungal spores by uv based aops was similar to that of the inactivation process involving uv alone an aliquot of 1 ml reagent pms and h2o2 was added to 98 ml of pbs solution without a chloride ion in which the concentration of fungal spores was also kept at 106 cfu ml after the inactivation 1 ml sodium thiosulfate 1 mol l was added to terminate the oxidant all the inactivation experiments were conducted at a temperature of 23 c 2 4 photoreactivation and dark repair experiments after uv irradiation the petri dishes containing the samples were immediately placed under two fluorescent lamps 8 w 15 w philips holland for the photoreactivation experiments the uva irradiance wavelength was 365 nm and the uva irradiance intensity was 0 10 0 25 mw cm2 measured using a spectroradiometer uva365 sanpometer china the photoreactivation process lasted for 8 h with respect to the dark repair process after inactivation the petri dish containing inactivation samples was covered with aluminum foil for a period of 8 h kaur et al 2016 the temperature for photoreactivation and dark repair was controlled at 23 c water samples were taken at regular time intervals during photoreactivation and dark repair a 1 ml water sample was diluted using sterile pbs solution and a 0 1 ml diluted sample was spread plated each in triplicate the plates were then incubated upright at 27 c in the dark for 2 4 days the results were recorded in cfu ml based on the average number of colonies 2 5 data analysis the effects of uv and uv based aops on the inactivation of fungi were expressed as a logarithmic reduction at different uv dosages and the equation is listed as follows 1 n log n t n 0 where n 0 and n t are the concentration of fungi cfu ml at inactivation time 0 and time t and n is the value of log10 inactivation survival ratio and photoreactivation percentage were used to evaluate the photoreactivation the equations are as follows 2 survival ratio n p n 0 100 3 photoreactivation percentage n p n d n 0 n d 100 where n 0 is the initial concentration of fungi before inactivation n d and n p are the concentration of fungi after inactivation and photoreactivation respectively control efficiency ce was introduced here to describe the ability of controlling photoreactivation by uv based aops the equation is expressed as follows 4 c e s u v s u v a o p s s u v 100 where s uv is the survival ratio after 120 min of photoreactivation following inactivation with uv alone and s uv aops is the survival ratio after 120 min of photoreactivation following uv based aop inactivation the time of 120 min was chosen because t harzianum the most significant photoreactivation of the three fungal spores reached the highest photoreactivation percentage at this time 2 6 kinetics modelling 2 6 1 inactivation kinetics the inactivation processes were described by the chick watson model dalrymple et al 2010 which shows a linear relationship between the inactivation efficiency and the exposure time wen et al 2017b 5 ln n 0 n t k i t where k the slope of the line is the pseudo first order inactivation rate constant cm2 mj i represents the uv fluence rate mw cm2 and t represents the uv irradiation time s 2 6 2 photoreactivation kinetics to describe the photoreactivation process two models were applied to simulate the photoreactivation process one was a saturation type first order reaction model proposed by kashimada kashimada et al 1996 which was used to predict the reactivation phase without induction time the kinetic reaction can be expressed as follows 6 s s m s 0 1 e k 1 t s 0 the other was second order reaction model proposed by nebot sanz nebot sanz et al 2007 this model was a modification of the first order model and coincided with the classic logistic equation the second order reaction included the initial imperceptible photoreactivation followed by a rapid exponential growth and a final stabilization period the photoreactivation kinetics can be described as follows 7 s s m 1 s m s 0 1 e k 2 s m t in the two equations k 1 is the first order photoreactivation rate constant and k 2 is the new growth second order reactivation rate constant s 0 is the survival ratio after uv inactivation n d n 0 s is the survival ratio at photoreactivation time t n p n 0 and s m is the maximum survival ratio during the photoreactivation process the goodness of fit was evaluated using the correlation coefficient r 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv inactivation characteristics of fungal spores and e coli the uv inactivation of the fungal spores t harzianum p polonicum a niger and e coli were examined in pbs solution using an lp mercury lamp as shown in table 1 it was found that a greater uv dosage was required to achieve the reduction of fungi than that of e coli table s1 shows the kinetic formula of the chick watson model for the uv inactivation of fungal spores and e coli the uv inactivation rate constants k of t harzianum p polonicum and a niger are 0 0638 0 0859 and 0 0368 cm2 mj respectively which are remarkably lower than the k of e coli 0 1293 cm2 mj based on these kinetic data the order of resistance to uv irradiation was determined as e coli p polonicum t harzianum a niger this order was mainly attributed to the structural differences between the fungi and e coli wen et al 2017b 3 2 photoreactivation of fungal spores and kinetics analysis photoreactivation of fungal spores was determined in pbs solutions with a 2 log10 reduction by uv inactivation and then photoreactivation under different uva irradiation intensities 0 10 0 17 and 0 25 mw cm2 for 8 h e coli was also examined here by comparison the uv dosage for 2 log10 inactivation is shown in table s2 fig 1 shows the photoreactivation percentage of three genera of fungal spores and e coli as a function of reaction time the results indicate that the fungal spores in water underwent photoreactivation at different levels t harzianum had the most significant photoreactivation whereas p polonicum behaved a low level of photoreactivation however the three genera of fungal spores exhibited similar trends in that their photoreactivation percentage became significant at around 2 h then remained relatively stable from 2 to 8 h in general specifically t harzianum had a slow increase of photoreactivation percentage after 2 h exposure at uva irradiance intensity of 0 10 mw cm2 a niger also had a slow growth at uva irradiance intensity of 0 17 mw cm2 after 2 h photoreactivation besides the maximum photoreactivation percentage followed the order t harzianum 51 35 a niger 29 07 p polonicum 9 01 the significant differences in the photoreactivation percentage of the three genera of fungal spores may be due to the difference in cell structure and repair genes bohrerova and linden 2010 sinha and häder 2002 it was also found that a certain range of higher uva light intensity promoted the photoreactivation of fungal spores for instance with the increase of uva irradiance intensity from 0 10 to 0 25 mw cm2 the photoreactivation percentage at 120 min of p polonicum increased by nearly 3 fold from 2 74 to 6 11 for t harzianum the photoreactivaiotn percentage at 120 min reached 51 35 almost 2 5 fold higher as the uva irradiance intensity increased from 0 10 to 0 17 mw cm2 similarly after exposure to a uva irradiance intensity of 0 17 mw cm2 for 120 min the photoreactivation percentage of a niger achieved 20 higher than 12 of that at a uva irradiance of 0 10 mw cm2 these results are in accordance with those of previous studies quek and hu 2008 however it behaved a decrease in the photoreactivation percentage of t harzianum and a niger when the uva irradiance intensity increased up to 0 25 mw cm2 the results are probably attributed to that relative higher uva light intensity may exert a negative impact on some genera of fungi and probably inhibit their photoreactivation process xiao et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 compared with e coli fungal spores had lower maximum photoreactivation percentage overall for example the maximum photoreactivation percentage of t harzianum was 51 35 lower than e coli 72 83 moreover it was also found that t harzianum underwent immediate photoreactivation after uv inactivation and reached a considerable photoreactivation percentage in a short time for instance t harzianum achieved a 1 log10 recovery after 15 min of photoreactivation but by comparison there was a delayed period in the photoreactivation process of e coli specifically the photoreactivation rate of e coli was less than 1 in the initial 40 min and 1 log10 photoreactivation of e coli required as long as 60 min this significant difference in the photoreactivation between fungal spores and e coli may be the result of differences in cell structure and repair systems braga et al 2015 meroueh et al 2006 sisti et al 2012 fungi are complex eukaryotes with more organelles than e coli thus their cell activities are different the repair systems of fungi are also different from those of e coli except that the cpd and 6 4 photolyases are also found in multicellular eukaryotes bluhm and dunkle 2008 moreover the fungal photolyases have different coding genes and compositions from those of e coli and different photolyase activities resulted in different photoreactivation rates and amounts in fungal spores and e coli cells the photoreactivation kinetics of fungal spores and e coli were then examined they were found to exhibit remarkably different behavior as shown in table 2 the fitting curve is shown in fig s1 the first order model as shown in eq 6 was more suitable to fit the data of fungal spores and obtained good fitting results r2 0 92 table 2 gives the kinetic parameters of the first order model applied to the fungal photoreactivation process the kinetic rate constant k 1 on exposure to a uva irradiance intensity of 0 17 mw cm2 was in order t harzianum 0 0115 1 min a niger 0 0106 1 min p polonicum 0 0740 1 min however the logistic model eq 7 was more suitable to describe the photoreactivation of e coli with correlation coefficients r2 between 0 95 and 0 97 table 2 furthermore as shown in table 2 the behavior of k 1 and sm was seen to be with the changes in the uva irradiance intensity the photoreactivation of fungal spores was ubiquitous but dissimilar from that of e coli 3 3 photoreactivation of fungal spores after inactivation at different uv dosages fig 2 shows the impact of uv dosage on the photoreactivation of three genera of fungal spores and e coli with 120 min photoreactivation under a uva light intensity of 0 25 mw cm2 in a pbs solution table s2 shows the uv dosage reaction time required to achieve 2 log10 3 log10 and 4 log10 inactivation as shown in fig 2 high uv dosage significantly decreased the photoreactivation percentage of all fungal spores and e coli for instance the photoreactivation percentage of t harzianum reduced from 38 56 to 1 66 as the uv dosage increased from 38 mj cm2 2 log10 to 70 mj cm2 3 log10 similarly with increase in the uv dosage from 18 mj cm2 to 38 mj cm2 the photoreactivation percentage of e coli decreased from 60 72 to 2 86 when 3 log10 inactivation was achieved e coli remained at the highest photoreactivation level with the photoreactivation percentage of 2 86 furthermore increasing the uv dosage to obtain 4 log10 inactivation reduced the photoreactivation of e coli to a minimum of only 0 06 however for t harzianum and a niger the photoreactivation percentage were 0 54 and 0 16 respectively both higher than that of e coli therefore although increasing uv dosage can reduce the photoreactivation level of all fungal spores and e coli fungi are not as easily controllable as e coli at higher uv dosages when a lower photoreactivation level is expected 3 4 dark repair fig 3 shows the reactivation of fungal spores and e coli in darkness after 2 log10 inactivation by uv irradiation in a pbs solution the dark repair at 0 h represents the concentration of survival spores after 2 log10 inactivation during the dark repair time of 8 h no significant reactivation was found in the three genera of fungal spores and in e coli and the concentration of survival spores and e coli decreased slightly in the dark the results were similar to those of a previous study nebot sanz et al 2007 that reported only a slight reactivation 0 1 in the dark repair experiment and a decay period in which survival decreased li et al 2017 indicated that the maximum dark repair percentage was 0 29 by lp uv irradiation thus dark repair plays a minor role in reactivation of fungal spores indicating that the fungal spores may not contain the dna repair mechanism in darkness especially the ner pathway 3 5 control of fungal photoreactivation with uv based aops the uv based aop treatments produced reactive radicals which attacked the cell wall and cell membrane of the fungal spores resulting in the leakage of intracellular contents wen et al 2017b based on the excellent inactivation of fungi by uv based aops the control of fungal photoreactivation using uv based aops was also investigated 3 5 1 control of fungal photoreactivation using uv pms as shown in table s3 the required uv dosage decreased with the addition of pms when aiming to obtain the same inactivation efficiency 2 log10 for example for t harzianum 40 mj cm2 of uv irradiation was required to achieve a 2 log10 inactivation in the treatment with uv alone in the uv pms treatment 35 mj cm2 of uv irradiation was required with a combination of 0 1 mm pms furthermore when increasing the pms concentration up to 1 0 mm the uv dosage was decreased to 30 mj cm2 fig 4 and fig s2 show the photoreactivation processes of the three genera of fungal spores treated by uv pms with 2 log10 inactivation then under exposure of a uva light intensity of 0 25 mw cm2 the results showed that the photoreactivation processes of the three genera of fungal spores treated by uv pms were significantly different from those treated by uv alone specifically both the maximum survival ratio s m and photoreactivation rate constant k 1 reduced significantly table s5 for example the s m of t harzianum reduced from 39 39 to 24 44 and k 1 decreased from 0 0103 to 0 0064 1 min after treatment with uv pms uv dosage of 35 mj cm2 and 0 1 mm pms when compared with the treatment involving uv alone uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 table s5 when increasing the pms concentration up to 1 0 mm the s m and k 1 of t harzianum was continuously decreased to 8 93 and 0 0031 1 min table s5 respectively thus there was a better control with an increased concentration of pms which was illustrated by control efficiency ce shown in fig 6 for the three fungal spores a greater control efficiency was achieved at a higher concentration of pms using uv pms treatment t harzianum was more easily controlled by uv pms with a maximum control efficiency of 79 5 at the pms concentration of 1 0 mm and uv dosage of 30 mj cm2 for p polonicum and a niger the maximum control efficiencies using uv pms were 55 7 and 40 1 respectively 3 5 2 control of fungal photoreactivation using uv h2o2 the control of photoreactivation using uv h2o2 was also examined the three genera of fungal spores were inactivated by uv h2o2 with 2 log10 inactivation then the photoreactivation was observed according to table s4 the uv dosage was not significantly reduced with the addition of h2o2 compared with the treatment with uv alone however the reduction in photoreactivation levels of the three fungal spores treated by uv h2o2 2 log10 was noticeable which was reflected in the lower s m and k 1 values as shown in fig 5 fig s3 and table s6 the photoreactivation process after treatment by uv h2o2 exhibits the same trends as that after treatment by uv alone at the oxidant concentration of 0 1 mm the control efficiency of uv h2o2 was higher than that of uv pms however uv h2o2 had invariable control on t harzianum and p polonicum regardless of the h2o2 concentration as presented in fig 6 with respect to a niger uv h2o2 treatment showed excellent results with a higher control efficiency at all the applied h2o2 concentrations superior to those of treatments by uv pms in summary uv based aops did reduce the photoreactivation levels of the three genera of fungal spores to varying degrees which is probably attributed to the produced reactive radicals resulting in the damage to the cell wall and cell membrane and then the release of intracellular contents wen et al 2017b which cannot be repaired by the uva irradiation 4 conclusions the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the inactivation of fungal spores and e coli by uv irradiation fits the chick watson model the uv inactivation rate constants k of a niger t harzianum p polonicum and e coli are 0 0368 0 0638 0 0859 and 0 1293 cm2 mj respectively 2 fungal spores show different levels of photoreactivation after uv irradiation and t harzianum had the most significant photoreactivation whereas p polonicum exhibited the lowest level of photoreactivation moreover greater uv dosages significantly decrease the photoreactivation of fungal spores while a certain range of higher uva light intensity promotes photoreactivation the dark repair of the three genera of fungal spores is insignificant 3 the first order model fits the fungal photoreactivation process well the photoreactivation rate constant k 1 on exposure to uva irradiance of 0 17 mw cm2 was in the order t harzianum a niger p polonicum compared with e coli fungal spores have lower photoreactivation percentage particularly t harzianum reaches a considerable level of photoreactivation rapidly in contrast to the delay period in the initial photoreactivation process of e coli 4 three genera of fungal spores treated by uv based aops including uv pms and uv h2o2 have the same photoreactivation trends as those treated by uv alone however both the maximum survival ratio and photoreactivation rate constant are reduced after inactivation by uv based aops compared with uv alone acknowledgement this research was

19181,chromium isotope fractionation analysis is a promising approach for the assessment of microbial cr vi reduction in groundwater understanding the mechanisms and other parameters that control cr isotope fractionation factors between the product cr iii and reactant cr vi in microbial cr vi reduction is critical to this application to date such studies are very limited here the influence of critical factors on observed cr isotope fractionation during cr vi reduction by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 under various conditions was investigated the cr vi concentration and cr isotope ratio measurements were conducted on unreacted cr vi remaining in solution to determine cr isotope fractionation factors the changes in ambient environmental conditions e g ph temperature have limited influence on cr isotope fractionation factors however as a result of cr vi consumption as the experiments proceed the change in bioavailability of cr vi has a significant impact on cr isotope fractionation factors for example in temperature controlled experiments cr isotope fractionation showed two stage behavior during stage i the values of ε were 2 81 0 19 and 2 60 0 14 at 18 c and 34 c respectively during stage ii as cr vi reduction progressed cr isotope fractionation was significantly masked and the ε values decreased to 0 98 0 49 and 1 01 0 11 at 18 c and 34 c respectively similar two stage isotope fractionation behaviors were observed in ph controlled experiments ph 6 0 and 7 2 and in experiments with and without the addition of a competing electron acceptor nitrate masking of isotope fractionation in stage ii indicated restrictions on the bioavailability of cr vi and mass transfer limitations this study provides an explanation for the variation in cr isotope fractionation

keywords microbial cr vi reduction chromium isotope fractionation the values of ε bioavailability mass transfer limitations 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr vi is a major contaminant found at many industrial sites and its high toxicity has led to worldwide concern about cr vi levels in groundwater lu et al 2016 microbial activity can effectively reduce cr vi in groundwater chung et al 2006 however monitoring these processes is not straightforward chen and hao 1998 because traditional methods of measuring cr vi concentrations over time can be compromised by challenges in constraining sorption dilution diffusion and advection effects ellis et al 2004 chromium isotope fractionation analyses during the reduction process would help to clarify such confounding factors and thus may be a promising approach for monitoring and quantification of in situ microbial reduction of cr vi at polluted sites lu et al 2018 a wide range of cr isotope enrichment factors ε have been reported for reduction of cr vi by various microbial strains and under varying experimental conditions basu et al 2014 han et al 2012 lu et al 2018 sikora et al 2008 in a previous study sikora et al 2008 found that the ε values were within the range of 4 to 4 5 at low electron donor concentrations and 1 8 at high electron donor concentrations han et al 2012 reported that the ε values were 2 and 0 4 for pseudomonas stutzeri rch2 during aerobic and denitrifying conditions respectively basu et al 2014 reported cr isotope fractionation effects during cr vi reduction by diverse bacteria geobacter sulfurreducens pseudomonas stutzeri dcp ps1 and desulfovibrio vulgaris induced overlapping ε values 3 and the ε value was 2 17 for shewanella sp nr such variations make quantitative interpretations of the isotope fractionation data observed in the field uncertain kampara et al 2008 tiehm et al 2008 variations in environmental parameters e g ph temperature can produce wide variations in the physiological states of bacteria and in enzymatic reduction rates chen and hao 1998 wang and shen 1995 these variations may cause changes in observed isotope fractionation by altering the suite of microscale mass transfer processes before bond breakage such as diffusion in solution uptake through the cell membrane and enzyme substrate binding harding et al 2013 renpenning et al 2015 previous studies on sulfate isotope fractionation during microbial sulfate reduction have reported that ph and temperature have a significant influence on isotope fractionation canfield et al 2006 hoek et al 2006 kemp and thode 1968 nitrate is another ubiquitous pollutant mixtures of cr vi and nitrate are commonly found in contaminated groundwater gandhi et al 2002 furthermore microbial cr vi reduction can be greatly affected by nitrate dichristina 1992 han et al 2010 viamajala et al 2002 studies using p stutzeri rch2 and staphylococcus epidermidis l 02 found that the cr vi reduction rate increased significantly under denitrifying conditions in the presence of nitrate han et al 2010 vatsouria et al 2005 in contrast cr vi reduction rate was not affected under aerobic conditions with the addition of nitrate in bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas putida garbisu et al 1998 ishibashi et al 1990 research on cr isotope fractionation during cr vi reduction by p stutzeri rch2 under denitrifying conditions has shown that the presence of nitrate may have a significant influence on cr isotope fractionation han et al 2012 however the effects of nitrate on cr isotope fractionation may vary with varying species of metabolic bacteria or under varying growth conditions systematic investigation of the effects of these factors described above on cr isotope fractionation associated with cr vi bio reduction is warranted shewanella oneidensis mr 1 is a model microorganism that has attracted broad research interest owing to its remarkable ability to respire using diverse electron acceptors including cr vi myers et al 2000 tang et al 2006 tiedje 2002 in this study the effects of various environmental parameters on cr isotope fractionation including ph temperature and the presence and absence of nitrate were tested this work furthers the understanding of cr isotope as a tool in evaluating the extent of microbial cr vi reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculation and culture medium single colonies of s oneidensis mr 1 atcc 700550 from freshly streaked plates were inoculated into 0 5 ml luria bertani lb medium nacl 10 g yeast extract 5 g tryptone 10 g per liter and cultured aerobically at 30 c overnight then the cultures were transferred into 100 ml lb medium and cultured aerobically on a rotary shaker table at 30 c for 16 h to the late stationary phase the cultures were separated from the medium by centrifuging the mixture at 5000 g for 10 min at 4 c and were then washed twice via sequential centrifugation with minimal growth medium marsili et al 2008 the minimal growth medium was prepared with high purity water 18 2 mω cm obtained using a milli q reference water purification system millipore bedford ma the minimal growth medium contained per liter

supporting information 2 2 cr vi reduction experiments were performed under different conditions e g varying ph and temperature with or without the addition of nitrate all experiments were conducted in 250 ml glass serum bottles containing 200 ml of liquid medium sodium lactate 3 mm was added as an electron donor in the nitrate experiments 3 mm sodium nitrate was added to the medium the medium buffered with 50 mm 4 2 hydroxyethyl 1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid hepes was purged with n2 gas for 15 min to ensure an anaerobic environment and the ph was adjusted to the desired values e g 7 2 0 05 with the addition of koh h3po3 hepes buffered media can maintain physiological ph and are commonly used in cell culture the concentration of hepes used in the experiments is 50 mm while sodium lactate used as carbon source was added only at a concentration of 3 mm the amount of buffer substance can sufficiently buffer the change of ph during the experiment next the serum bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers after autoclaving the sealed bottles 121 c 20 min the medium was supplemented with vitamins and 0 1 mm k2cro4 metal basis 99 99 aladdin chemical co ltd shanghai china under anaerobic conditions the vitamins and k2cro4 were filtered through 0 22 μm nylon filters to remove microbial cells before being added to the medium kinetic studies were initiated by adding the purged

injected into serum bottles with anaerobic minimal growth medium in an anaerobic glove chamber whitley dg250 don whitley scientific shipley uk for cr vi reduction at 30 c for the ph controlled experiments the ph of the medium was adjusted to 6 0 0 05 7 2 0 05 and 8 5 0 05 respectively with the addition of koh h3po3 for the temperature controlled experiments the ambient temperature was set at 18 c 28 c and 34 c respectively samples were collected at given time intervals and the od600 was measured each time a sample was taken the samples were centrifuged 12 000 g 10 min immediately and the supernatants were stored at 20 c equal volumes of n2 were injected into the serum bottles with a sterile syringe before sampling to balance the gas pressure lost during the sample collection all of the reduction experiments were performed in duplicate and the experiments were also performed on the same amounts of heat killed cells as a negative control 2 3 analytical methods the cr vi concentration was determined using the diphenylcarbazide method as previously described viamajala et al 2002 first 0 15 ml of sample was loaded into a costar 48 well tissue culture plate corning inc ny a microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 540 nm for 10 min after the addition of mixed reagents to the sample synergy ht biotek hexavalent cr standards 100 50 25 12 5 6 25 μm were included on each culture plate the hexavalent cr was purified from the sample using a two step column chromatographic procedure first the samples were passed through an anion exchange column filled with 2 ml biorad ag1 x8 200 mesh resin and washed with 20 ml of 0 1 n hcl during these steps cr vi in the oxyanion form was retained on the column while cr iii matrix components and isobaric interfering elements such as fe ti v were eluted then cr vi was reduced to cr iii with a mixture of 6 n hcl and 30 h2o2 and was subsequently eluted 90 recovery was usually achieved after this column exchange step to ensure all of cr vi is reduced to cr iii and the first column does not induce extra cr isotope fractionation the before and after column values of δ53cr for cr vi standard solution aladdin chemical co ltd shanghai china were compared the values of δ53cr measured before and after the first column were identical within error then the cr cuts were spiked with a 50cr 54cr double

15 μl of 15 9 n hno3 and dried on a hot plate at 120 c for 8 times to digest the organics the samples were then passed through cation exchange columns filled with 0 33 ml biorad ag50 x8 200 400 mesh resin to further separate cr from organic compounds and other cations the columns were washed with 2 5 ml of 0 5 n hf and 8 ml of 1 n hcl before cr was eluted with 3 ml of 2 n hcl after evaporated to dryness and the cr cuts were dried in 15 μl of 15 9 n hno3 on a hot plate at 120 c for another 8 times to remove the organics chromium isotope compositions were measured using a neptune plus multiple

chromium isotope standard was also measured every fifteen to twenty samples the samples from the nitrate experiments were measured earlier than samples from other experiments the instrument was less stable when the samples from the nitrate experiments were measured thus these samples were measured twice to confirm that the values of δ53cr were reproducible samples from the other experiments were measured once 2 4 notation the 53cr 52cr ratio is expressed using δ notation 1 δ c 53 r c 53 r c 52 r s a m p l e c 53 r c 52 r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 the uncertainty of δ 53cr was the largest of the following items 2 standard deviations 2sd of the sample measurement the external error of the spiked scp standard solution analyses in the same analytical session or the long term reproducibility of the spiked scp standard solution the long term precision was 0 06 2 sd for δ 53cr of the spiked scp standard solution and nist srm 3112a the cr isotope fractionation factor α was used to express the magnitude of fractionation between the product and the reactant which is defined as 2 α r p r o d u c t r r e a c t a n t where r product and r reactant refer to the isotope ratio of the product and the reactant respectively in closed systems such as these batch experiments the δ53cr value of the remaining cr vi in the solution evolves according to the rayleigh fractionation model which can be expressed as follows 3 δ t δ 0 1000 f α 1 1000 where δ 0 and δ t are the δ53cr values of cr vi in the solution at the beginning and at time t after the beginning of the experiment respectively and f is the fraction of cr vi that remains the value of α can be derived from the slope α 1 of the best fit line to the data in the plot of ln δ t 1000 δ 0 1000 versus ln f for convenience α is usually converted to enrichment factor ε using the following equation 4 ε α 1 1000 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of ph and temperature on cr isotope fractionation the effects of ph on the magnitude of cr isotope fractionation and cr vi reduction rate were investigated for ph 6 0 7 2 and 8 5 at a temperature of 30 c it has previously been shown that ph has a significant impact on cr vi reduction rate although s oneidensis mr 1 is able to grow in a wide ph range 6 9 han et al 2016 the details of cr isotopic measurements are shown in table s2 the results of cr vi reduction as a function of time from the ph controlled experiments are presented in fig 1 b and figure s1b of the supporting information the first order rate coefficient k in first order kinetics can be used as a index to represent the cr vi reduction rate the first order rate coefficient is defined as follows 5 k l n c t c 0 t where c 0 and c t are defined as the concentration of cr vi at the beginning and at a given time during the experiments respectively t is the time interval the value of the first order rate coefficient k for the overall reaction was 0 07 h 1 r 2 0 93 at ph 7 2 the highest cr vi reduction rate by s oneidensis mr 1 observed rapid cr vi reduction accounting for 49 of the initial cr vi was observed in the first 30 min of the experiment this result was likely due to the accumulation of a large amount of highly active enzymes for reduction in s oneidensis mr 1 from the previous growth stage the values of k for the overall reaction were 0 04 h 1 r 2 0 81 and 0 01 h 1 r 2 0 74 for the experiments at ph 6 0 and ph 8 5 respectively these results suggested that the reduction rate was slower in the acidic condition ph 6 0 but it was inhibited in the alkaline condition ph 8 5 control experiments with heat killed cells showed no cr vi removal indicating that abiotic cr vi reduction can be ruled out and adsorption onto the cells was negligible the od600 measurements revealed that the cell density was similar and was relatively stable at ph 7 2 and ph 6 0 fig 1a figure s1a of the supporting information however it significantly decreased at ph 8 5 indicating that bacterial growth had probably entered the death phase which likely explains the lowest cr vi reduction rate at ph 8 5 during the experiment at ph 7 2 when 91 of the initial cr vi was reduced the cr isotope ratios in the remaining cr vi increased from 0 22 to 3 82 fig 1c table s2 however the data here did not follow a single rayleigh fractionation trend but form two rayleigh trends revealing two stage fractionation behavior instead stage i was characterized by a steep slope with an ε value of 2 66 0 19 stage ii had a shallower slope with an ε value of 1 11 0 25 table 1 the value and error 95 confidence intervals of ε are obtained by doing linear regression to the data in the ln δ t 1000 δ 0 1000 ln f space using isoplot version 4 15 following the method of han et al 2012 the k 1 value for stage i was 0 63 h 1 r 2 0 89 and the k 2 value for stage ii was 0 06 h 1 r 2 0 99 for the experiments at ph 7 2 at ph 6 0 similar two stage behavior was observed with ε values of 2 75 0 16 and 1 03 0 31 respectively the k 1 value for stage i was 0 66 h 1 r 2 0 86 and the k 2 value for stage ii was 0 03 h 1 r 2 0 99 for the experiments at ph 6 0 table 1 figure s2 the decrease in the cr isotope enrichment factor in stage ii can be interpreted as a result of masking effects of isotope fractionation by bioavailability restrictions and mass transfer limitations at ph 8 5 one stage cr isotope fractionation with a k of 0 01 h 1 r 2 0 74 and an ε of 3 04 0 58 were observed similar to the ε values observed for stage i in the experiments with ph 7 2 and ph 6 0 the absence of a second stage in this ph condition is probably due to the low reduction rate and thus the overall high bioavailability of cr and lack of a masking effect therefore although cr vi reduction rate varies significantly under different ph conditions it appears that ph has a minimal effect on the cr isotope enrichment factors for the studied ph range similar to the results from cr isotope fractionation experiments in this study ph also had little influence on stable se isotope enrichment factors during methylation of selenate by the fungus alternaria alternata at ph 4 and ph 7 schilling et al 2011 the effects of temperature were tested at 18 c 28 c and 34 c respectively the details of cr isotopic measurements are shown in table s3 at these three temperatures the od600 values were similar indicating that cell growth was not affected by temperature fig 2 a figure s1c the cr vi reduction rate was temperature dependent fig 2b figure s1d the values of k for the overall reaction were 0 04 h 1 r 2 0 70 0 05 h 1 r 2 0 81 and 0 06 h 1 r 2 0 87 for the experiments at 18 c 28 c and 34 c respectively indicating the highest reduction rate occurred at 34 c and decreased with decreasing temperature table 1 the samples tested at 18 c and 34 c were chosen for cr isotope analyses the cr isotope fractionation behavior also showed a two stage trend in these experiments at 18 c the ε values for stage i and stage ii were 2 81 0 19 and 0 98 0 49 respectively table 1 fig 2c at 34 c the ε values were 2 60 0 14 and 1 01 0 11 respectively in good agreement with the values from the corresponding stages at 18 c table 1 fig 2c these findings indicate that cr isotope fractionation was not affected in the tested temperature range temperature and ph can affect a wide array of cellular processes such as the expression and activity of reductive enzymes bashir et al 2013 thus the reduction rate and mass transfer processes such as the process of binding to enzymes can be affected by temperature and ph even so the lack of resolvable influence of temperature and ph on the isotope fractionation for cr could potentially be attributed to the unchanged relative magnitude of mass transfer rates to rates of cr o bond breakage that is to say changes in temperature and ph accelerate decelerate the reactions in the cr vi reduction reaction chain proportionally this finding is important because ph and temperature often vary in surface environments so the relative independence of isotope enrichment factors with temperature and ph means that the enrichment factors observed under laboratory conditions can find wider real world applications 3 2 effect of the presence of nitrate on cr isotope fractionation nitrate is one of the most common competing electron acceptors present during microbial cr vi reduction in cr vi contaminated systems middleton et al 2003 the effects of nitrate on cr isotope fractionation were investigated by comparing the results from cr vi reduction experiments in the presence and absence of nitrate the details of the cr isotope data are also presented in table s4 the cell density was relatively stable under both conditions although in the absence of nitrate the cell density was slightly lower than in the presence of nitrate fig 3 a figure s1e the values of k were similar in both experiments table 1 fig 3b indicating that the ability of s oneidensis mr 1 to reduce cr vi was not inhibited in the presence of nitrate viamajala et al 2002 found that the cr vi reduction rate was not affected by nitrate under denitrifying conditions in fumarate grown cells of s oneidensis mr 1 consistent with the results of this study the results in this study suggest that electron transport to cr vi and nitrate may proceed through two physiologically uncoupled pathways in s oneidensis mr 1 rather than sharing the same electron transport chain a similar mechanism is observed in microbial fe iii reduction in the presence of nitrate dichristina 1992 in the presence of nitrate cr isotope fractionation showed a two stage process where the values of ε were 2 37 0 14 for stage i and 0 93 0 48 for stage ii and the corresponding k values are 0 71 h 1 r 2 0 99 and 0 05 h 1 r 2 0 99 respectively table 1 fig 3c in the absence of nitrate similar ε values k values and a two stage fractionation process were also observed table 1 fig 3c however han et al 2012 reported a significant reduction in the ε value 0 4 for p stutzeri rch2 under denitrifying conditions indicating that the intrinsic isotope fractionation for cr o bond breakage was almost completely masked by mass transfer processes the contrasting response of ε to the presence of nitrate may be attributed to the different metabolic pathways in s oneidensis mr 1 and p stutzeri rch2 in p stutzeri rch2 cr vi is transported into cells by the energy dependent sulfate uptake pathway and cr vi is reduced inside the cell ohtake et al 1987 viti et al 2014 it has been hypothesized that the process of cr vi uptake into the cell may be affected in the presence of nitrate and may become rate limiting han et al 2012 if this was the case the uptake process could have exerted an additional masking effect on cr isotope fractionation however in s oneidensis mr 1 cr vi is mainly reduced on the cell surface by outer membrane cytochromes mtrc and omca when the initial cr vi concentration is low belchik et al 2011 daulton et al 2002 wang et al 2013 thus the process of cr vi uptake through the cell membrane did not occur in the presence of nitrate in this study therefore the uptake process was unlikely to be an extra rate limiting step and cr isotope fractionation would not be masked by the uptake process leading to similar values of ε with and without nitrate in this study 3 3 bioavailability dependent two stage cr isotope fractionation chromium isotope fractionation exhibited two stage behavior for most of the experiments in this study documenting a clear masking of the magnitude of isotope fractionation in the later stages of cr vi reduction the masking of cr isotope fractionation in stage ii in the experiments was likely attributed to cr vi bioavailability restrictions as was established for sulfur isotope fractionation during microbial sulfate reduction in a multi step process the slowest step acts as the rate limiting step for the overall process johnson 2004 the observed isotope fractionation is the sum of the equilibrium isotope effect in each proceeding step and plus the kinetic effect at the rate limiting step the steps after the rate limiting step become practically irreversible and do not contribute to the observed isotope fractionation of the overall process brunner and bernasconi 2005 johnston et al 2007 qin and wang 2017 rees 1973 the intrinsic kinetic isotope fractionation in the case of cr vi bio reduction is mainly caused by cr o bond reconfiguration which is the first irreversible step in this multi step processes basu and johnson 2012 the mass transfer processes before the cr o bond reconfiguration are insensitive isotope steps and do not cause any significant isotope fractionation thullner et al 2012 however when the mass transfer processes become the rate limiting step the observed isotope fractionation can be significantly masked lollar et al 2010 bioavailable chemicals can freely cross the cell membrane or come to the cell surface to react with enzymes from an organism in the medium at any given time semple et al 2004 when such a compound is metabolized a consumptive process occurs this process strives towards a transient steady state between uptake and redelivery of the chemical by the medium and the bacteria thullner et al 2013 the bioavailability can be evaluated as the relative ratio of the rate of mass transfer to the bacteria to the rate of intrinsic enzymatic activity for bond breakage haws et al 2006 the bioavailability index can be described by the following equation haws et al 2006 6 b i r m r b where bi is the bioavailability index r m is the mass transfer rate and r b is the cr vi reduction rate the threshold of the masking effect is the particular point at which suppression of isotope fractionation begins in a given medium kritee et al 2008 the masking effect can be explained by two extremes in one extreme case when r m becomes much lower than r b extreme mass transfer rate limitations will occur and the observed isotope fractionation will be completely masked in the other extreme case when r b becomes much lower than r m extreme limitation of the cr vi reduction rate will occur and masking of the intrinsic isotope fractionation becomes negligible resulting in the observed isotope fractionation being equal in magnitude to the intrinsic isotope fractionation fig 4 a the bioavailability can be limited by the mass transfer processes and the masking effect on isotope fractionation becomes bioavailability dependent thullner et al 2008 thullner et al 2013 illustrated the relationship between isotope fractionation and bioavailability in three hypothetical scenarios fig 4b and c the arrow a in fig 4b represent substrate concentration and bioavailability index in the experiments was high resulting in large value of ε in fig 4c arrow c in fig 4b represents low value of substrate concentration and bioavailability leading to small value of ε in the experiments fig 4c arrow b in fig 4b indicates a rather sudden changes in bioavailability and substrate concentration as the reaction progressed resulting in an apparent two stage process of isotope fractionation in fig 4c similar simulated virtual batch experiments with different values of initial substrate concentration also reveal a process of two stage isotope fractionation which was induced by bioavailability restrictions figure s3 thullner et al 2008 in most of experiments in this study two stage cr isotope fractionation was observed and the k value in stage i was much higher than that in stage ii table 1 in stage i at high concentrations of cr vi most of the reductase at the cell surface of s oneidensis mr 1 confined to enzyme substrate complexes and little free reductase was left behind under such conditions cr vi was relatively bioavailable most cr vi bearing molecules diffused back into solution so that the masking effect on cr isotope fractionation during the enzymatic reaction was weaker however owing to high value of k in stage i in most of experiments in this study large amount of cr vi was consumed as the reaction proceeded whereas the cell density remained relatively high thus less reductase was engaged in enzyme substrate complexes and more free reductase was present cr vi was no longer bioavailable and molecules of cr vi could not escape back into solution consequently the threshold of the masking effect was reached and the observed cr isotope fractionation was highly suppressed therefore even if all other parameters are held constant during such a transition the observable cr isotope fractionation can be suppressed because of the bioavailability restrictions for the experiment at ph 8 5 the cell density decreased progressively and the extent of cr vi reduction and the value of k were relatively lower as a result the bioavailability remained relatively high over the course of the whole experiment resulting in a constant ε value throughout the experiments chromium isotope fractionation reported by sikora et al 2008 appeared to follow a single rayleigh trend during cr vi reduction by s oneidensis mr 1 under both donor rich and donor poor conditions this indicates that the bioavailability of cr vi remained unchanged during the course of their experiments under both conditions however in their study the value of ε was 4 2 in electron donor poor 5 100 μm lactate conditions and 1 8 in electron donor rich conditions 10 mm lactate when the concentration of electron donor became higher the first order rate coefficient k value became higher this led to a larger amount of cr vi consumption and the bioavailability index became lower resulting in lower value of ε in the work of basu et al 2014 cr isotope fractionation also followed single rayleigh trends during cr vi reduction by four different microbial species including g sulfurreducens shewanella sp nr p stutzeri dcp ps1 and d vulgaris except for experiments with shewanella sp nr which produced a much lower ε value of 2 the other three bacteria strains all produced ε values of 3 the lower ε value produced by shewanella sp nr was accompanied by the highest cr consumption rate suggesting lower cr bioavailability it has been shown bioavailability may vary with different strains and culture conditions and that different strains have different microbial characteristics including physiological morphological and behavioral adaptations of single cells and populations thullner et al 2013 all of these microbial characteristics may contribute to the variability in bioavailability in some previous studies cr isotope fractionation during abiotic cr vi reduction also appeared to follow two stage processes jamieson hanes et al 2012 2014 2015 for instance in the work of jamieson hanes et al 2014 cr isotope fractionation was investigated during cr vi reduction by granular zero valent iron zvi the values of ε were 0 2 in stage i and 1 2 to 1 5 in stage ii in their study the mechanism causing the two stage fractionation during abiotic cr vi reduction was very different from that during microbial cr vi reduction in this study in their work in stage i cr vi reacted with reactive surface sites of zvi this direct pathway induced fast reduction rate with small enrichment factors in stage ii as the reaction progressed the iron surface was passivated by secondary mineral precipitation and the reduction rate decreased with greater enrichment factors other than cr isotopes experimental observations of hg isotope fractionation reveal suppression of isotope fractionation with the bioavailability restrictions and mass transfer limitations during microbial reduction of hg ii to hg 0 and microbial degradation of monomethylmercury kritee et al 2008 2009 2013 shi et al 2016 reported a two stage process of fe isotope fractionation with decreased isotope enrichment factors in stage ii during microbial fe iii reduction due to the consumption of bioavailable fe iii many other experimental studies also observed decreasing isotope enrichment factors at lower substrate concentrations during the microbial reduction calder and parker 1973 kampara et al 2008 2009 4 conclusions in this study the effects of different environmental parameters on cr isotope fractionation were investigated under anaerobic conditions the major conclusions are the cr isotope enrichment factor during cr vi reduction by s oneidensis mr 1 was unaffected by changes in ambient temperature ph or by the presence or absence of a competing electron acceptor nitrate these results allow for increased confidence in the application of cr isotope enrichment factors obtained in well controlled laboratory settings to assess the extent of cr vi reduction in the field the cr isotope fractionation during cr vi reduction via microbial pathways in most of the experiments in this study showed a two stage trend resulting from changes in bioavailability of cr as the reduction progressed this helps to explain the variation in the magnitude of cr isotope fractionation during microbial cr vi reduction in laboratory and natural systems bioavailability restrictions and microbial mass transfer limitations can contribute to systematic masking of cr isotope fractionation this masking effect should be fully taken into account when interpreting cr isotope data from natural settings chromium isotope analysis is a useful approach to identify rate limiting steps in complex biochemical transformation reactions chromium isotope fractionation is also a promising tool for identifying bioavailability indices as the bioavailability of contaminants to microorganisms is reduced so is their bioavailability to other receptors including humans thus bioavailability indices are essential for long term risk control linking bioavailability indices to cr isotope fractionation is potentially useful for evaluating the feasibility of microbial cr vi reduction and determining

19181,chromium isotope fractionation analysis is a promising approach for the assessment of microbial cr vi reduction in groundwater understanding the mechanisms and other parameters that control cr isotope fractionation factors between the product cr iii and reactant cr vi in microbial cr vi reduction is critical to this application to date such studies are very limited here the influence of critical factors on observed cr isotope fractionation during cr vi reduction by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 under various conditions was investigated the cr vi concentration and cr isotope ratio measurements were conducted on unreacted cr vi remaining in solution to determine cr isotope fractionation factors the changes in ambient environmental conditions e g ph temperature have limited influence on cr isotope fractionation factors however as a result of cr vi consumption as the experiments proceed the change in bioavailability of cr vi has a significant impact on cr isotope fractionation factors for example in temperature controlled experiments cr isotope fractionation showed two stage behavior during stage i the values of ε were 2 81 0 19 and 2 60 0 14 at 18 c and 34 c respectively during stage ii as cr vi reduction progressed cr isotope fractionation was significantly masked and the ε values decreased to 0 98 0 49 and 1 01 0 11 at 18 c and 34 c respectively similar two stage isotope fractionation behaviors were observed in ph controlled experiments ph 6 0 and 7 2 and in experiments with and without the addition of a competing electron acceptor nitrate masking of isotope fractionation in stage ii indicated restrictions on the bioavailability of cr vi and mass transfer limitations this study provides an explanation for the variation in cr isotope fractionation factors during microbial cr vi reduction in the environment furthering the viability of cr isotope ratio analysis as an approach in understanding cr biogeochemical cycling graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial cr vi reduction chromium isotope fractionation the values of ε bioavailability mass transfer limitations 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr vi is a major contaminant found at many industrial sites and its high toxicity has led to worldwide concern about cr vi levels in groundwater lu et al 2016 microbial activity can effectively reduce cr vi in groundwater chung et al 2006 however monitoring these processes is not straightforward chen and hao 1998 because traditional methods of measuring cr vi concentrations over time can be compromised by challenges in constraining sorption dilution diffusion and advection effects ellis et al 2004 chromium isotope fractionation analyses during the reduction process would help to clarify such confounding factors and thus may be a promising approach for monitoring and quantification of in situ microbial reduction of cr vi at polluted sites lu et al 2018 a wide range of cr isotope enrichment factors ε have been reported for reduction of cr vi by various microbial strains and under varying experimental conditions basu et al 2014 han et al 2012 lu et al 2018 sikora et al 2008 in a previous study sikora et al 2008 found that the ε values were within the range of 4 to 4 5 at low electron donor concentrations and 1 8 at high electron donor concentrations han et al 2012 reported that the ε values were 2 and 0 4 for pseudomonas stutzeri rch2 during aerobic and denitrifying conditions respectively basu et al 2014 reported cr isotope fractionation effects during cr vi reduction by diverse bacteria geobacter sulfurreducens pseudomonas stutzeri dcp ps1 and desulfovibrio vulgaris induced overlapping ε values 3 and the ε value was 2 17 for shewanella sp nr such variations make quantitative interpretations of the isotope fractionation data observed in the field uncertain kampara et al 2008 tiehm et al 2008 variations in environmental parameters e g ph temperature can produce wide variations in the physiological states of bacteria and in enzymatic reduction rates chen and hao 1998 wang and shen 1995 these variations may cause changes in observed isotope fractionation by altering the suite of microscale mass transfer processes before bond breakage such as diffusion in solution uptake through the cell membrane and enzyme substrate binding harding et al 2013 renpenning et al 2015 previous studies on sulfate isotope fractionation during microbial sulfate reduction have reported that ph and temperature have a significant influence on isotope fractionation canfield et al 2006 hoek et al 2006 kemp and thode 1968 nitrate is another ubiquitous pollutant mixtures of cr vi and nitrate are commonly found in contaminated groundwater gandhi et al 2002 furthermore microbial cr vi reduction can be greatly affected by nitrate dichristina 1992 han et al 2010 viamajala et al 2002 studies using p stutzeri rch2 and staphylococcus epidermidis l 02 found that the cr vi reduction rate increased significantly under denitrifying conditions in the presence of nitrate han et al 2010 vatsouria et al 2005 in contrast cr vi reduction rate was not affected under aerobic conditions with the addition of nitrate in bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas putida garbisu et al 1998 ishibashi et al 1990 research on cr isotope fractionation during cr vi reduction by p stutzeri rch2 under denitrifying conditions has shown that the presence of nitrate may have a significant influence on cr isotope fractionation han et al 2012 however the effects of nitrate on cr isotope fractionation may vary with varying species of metabolic bacteria or under varying growth conditions systematic investigation of the effects of these factors described above on cr isotope fractionation associated with cr vi bio reduction is warranted shewanella oneidensis mr 1 is a model microorganism that has attracted broad research interest owing to its remarkable ability to respire using diverse electron acceptors including cr vi myers et al 2000 tang et al 2006 tiedje 2002 in this study the effects of various environmental parameters on cr isotope fractionation including ph temperature and the presence and absence of nitrate were tested this work furthers the understanding of cr isotope as a tool in evaluating the extent of microbial cr vi reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculation and culture medium single colonies of s oneidensis mr 1 atcc 700550 from freshly streaked plates were inoculated into 0 5 ml luria bertani lb medium nacl 10 g yeast extract 5 g tryptone 10 g per liter and cultured aerobically at 30 c overnight then the cultures were transferred into 100 ml lb medium and cultured aerobically on a rotary shaker table at 30 c for 16 h to the late stationary phase the cultures were separated from the medium by centrifuging the mixture at 5000 g for 10 min at 4 c and were then washed twice via sequential centrifugation with minimal growth medium marsili et al 2008

supporting information 2 2 cr vi reduction experiments were performed under different conditions e g varying ph and temperature with or without the addition of nitrate all experiments were conducted in 250 ml glass serum bottles containing 200 ml of liquid medium sodium lactate 3 mm was added as an electron donor in the nitrate experiments 3 mm sodium nitrate was added to the medium the medium buffered with 50 mm 4 2 hydroxyethyl 1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid hepes was purged with n2 gas for 15 min to ensure an anaerobic environment and the ph was adjusted to the desired values e g 7 2 0

lactate used as carbon source was added only at a concentration of 3 mm the amount of buffer substance can sufficiently buffer the change of ph during the experiment next the serum bottles were sealed

at 18 c 28 c and 34 c respectively samples were collected at given time intervals and the od600 was measured each time a sample was taken the samples were centrifuged 12 000 g 10 min immediately and the supernatants were stored at 20 c equal volumes of n2 were injected into the serum bottles with a sterile syringe before sampling to balance the gas pressure lost during the sample collection all of the reduction experiments were performed in duplicate and the experiments were also performed on the same amounts of heat killed cells as a negative control 2 3 analytical methods the cr vi

ny a microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 540 nm for 10 min after the addition of mixed reagents to the sample synergy ht biotek hexavalent cr standards 100 50 25 12 5 6 25 μm were included on each culture plate the hexavalent cr was purified from the sample using a two step column chromatographic procedure first the samples were passed through an anion exchange column filled with 2 ml biorad ag1 x8 200 mesh resin and washed with 20 ml of 0 1 n hcl during these steps cr vi in the oxyanion form was retained on the column while cr iii matrix components and isobaric interfering elements such as fe ti v were eluted then cr vi was reduced to cr iii with a mixture of 6 n hcl and 30 h2o2 and was subsequently eluted 90 recovery was usually achieved after this column exchange step to ensure all of cr vi is reduced to cr iii and the first column does not induce extra cr isotope fractionation the before and after column values of δ53cr for cr vi standard solution aladdin chemical co ltd shanghai china were compared the values of δ53cr measured before and after the first column were identical within error then the cr cuts were spiked with a 50cr 54cr double

15 μl of 15 9 n hno3 and dried on a hot plate at 120 c for 8 times to digest the organics the samples were then passed through cation exchange columns filled with 0 33 ml biorad ag50 x8 200 400 mesh resin to further separate cr from organic compounds and other cations the columns were washed with 2 5 ml of 0 5 n hf and 8 ml of 1 n hcl before cr was eluted with 3 ml of 2 n hcl after evaporated to dryness and the cr cuts were dried in 15 μl of 15 9 n hno3 on a hot plate at 120 c for another 8 times to remove the organics chromium isotope compositions were measured using a neptune plus multiple

the university of science and technology of china hefei china the method is detailed in shen et al 2018 and is only briefly described in the following the samples were nebulized with an aridus ii desolvating nebulizer system with an uptake rate of 50 μl min chromium isotope signals 50cr 52cr 53cr and 54cr were acquired on faraday collectors the signals of 49ti 51v and 56fe were collected to monitor the interference on 54cr from 54fe as well as that on 50cr from 50ti and 50v molecular interferences such as 40ar14n or 40ar16o were minimized in medium resolution mode with mass resolution 5500 each analysis consisted of 4 blocks of 30 cycles with each cycle integrating the ion intensity for 8 389 s the cr isotope ratios were calculated according to the double spike calculation equations using iteration method rudge et al 2009 see supporting information for details the scp cr solution standard scp science on canada was used as our internal standard before each analysis sequence the spiked scp solution standard was analyzed five or six times to ensure that instrumental stability was achieved each sequence began with one measurement of the spiked scp standard and this solution was analyzed every four or five samples to monitor the drift in the instrumental mass fractionation national institute of standards and technology nist standard reference material srm 3112a chromium isotope standard was also measured every fifteen to twenty samples the samples from the nitrate experiments were measured earlier than samples from other experiments the instrument was less stable when the samples from the nitrate experiments were measured thus these samples were measured twice to confirm that the values of δ53cr were reproducible samples from the other experiments were measured once 2 4 notation the 53cr 52cr ratio is expressed using δ notation 1 δ c 53 r c 53 r c 52 r s a m p l e c 53 r c 52 r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 the uncertainty of δ 53cr was the largest of the following items 2 standard deviations 2sd of the sample measurement the external error of the spiked scp standard solution analyses in the same analytical session or the long term reproducibility of the spiked scp standard solution the long term precision was 0 06 2 sd for δ 53cr of the spiked scp standard solution and nist srm 3112a the cr isotope fractionation factor α was used to express the magnitude of fractionation between the product and the reactant which is defined as 2 α r p r o d u c t r r e a c t a n t where r product and r reactant refer to the isotope ratio of the product and the reactant respectively in closed systems such as these batch experiments the δ53cr value of the remaining cr vi in the solution evolves according to the rayleigh fractionation model which can be expressed as follows 3 δ t δ 0 1000 f α 1 1000 where δ 0 and δ t are the δ53cr values of cr vi in the solution at the beginning and at time t after the beginning of the experiment respectively and f is the fraction of cr vi that remains the value of α can be derived from the slope α 1 of the best fit line to the data in the plot of ln δ t 1000 δ 0 1000 versus ln f for convenience α is usually converted to enrichment factor ε using the following equation 4 ε α 1 1000 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of ph and temperature on cr isotope fractionation the effects of ph on the magnitude of cr isotope fractionation and cr vi reduction rate were investigated for ph 6 0 7 2 and 8 5 at a temperature of 30 c it has previously been shown that ph has a significant impact on cr vi reduction rate although s oneidensis mr 1 is able to grow in a wide ph range 6 9 han et al 2016 the details of cr isotopic measurements are shown in table s2 the results of cr vi reduction as a function of time from the ph controlled experiments are presented in fig 1 b and figure s1b of the supporting information the first order rate coefficient k in first order kinetics can be used as a index to represent the cr vi reduction rate the first order rate coefficient is defined as follows 5 k l n c t c 0 t where c 0 and c t are defined as the concentration of cr vi at the beginning and at a given time during the experiments respectively t is the time interval the value of the first order rate coefficient k for the overall reaction was 0 07 h 1 r 2 0 93 at ph 7 2 the highest cr vi reduction rate by s oneidensis mr 1 observed rapid cr vi reduction accounting for 49 of the initial cr vi was observed in the first 30 min of the experiment this result was likely due to the accumulation of a large amount of highly active enzymes for reduction in s oneidensis mr 1 from the previous growth stage the values of k for the overall reaction were 0 04 h 1 r 2 0 81 and 0 01 h 1 r 2 0 74 for the experiments at ph 6 0 and ph 8 5 respectively these results suggested that the reduction rate was slower in the acidic condition ph 6 0 but it was inhibited in the alkaline condition ph 8 5 control experiments with heat killed cells showed no cr vi removal indicating that abiotic cr vi reduction can be ruled out and adsorption onto the cells was negligible the od600 measurements revealed that the cell density was similar and was relatively stable at ph 7 2 and ph 6 0 fig 1a figure s1a of the supporting information however it significantly decreased at ph 8 5 indicating that bacterial growth had probably entered the death phase which likely explains the lowest cr vi reduction rate at ph 8 5 during the experiment at ph 7 2 when 91 of the initial cr vi was reduced the cr isotope ratios in the remaining cr vi increased from 0 22 to 3 82 fig 1c table s2 however the data here did not follow a single rayleigh fractionation trend but form two rayleigh trends revealing two stage fractionation behavior instead stage i was characterized by a steep slope with an ε value of 2 66 0 19 stage ii had a shallower slope with an ε value of 1 11 0 25 table 1 the value and error 95 confidence intervals of ε are obtained by doing linear regression to the data in the ln δ t 1000 δ 0 1000 ln f space using isoplot version 4 15 following the method of han et al 2012 the k 1 value for stage i was 0 63 h 1 r 2 0 89 and the k 2 value for stage ii was 0 06 h 1 r 2 0 99 for the experiments at ph 7 2 at ph 6 0 similar two stage behavior was observed with ε values of 2 75 0 16 and 1 03 0 31 respectively the k 1 value for stage i was 0 66 h 1 r 2 0 86 and the k 2 value for stage ii was 0 03 h 1 r 2 0 99 for the experiments at ph 6 0 table 1 figure s2 the decrease in the cr isotope enrichment factor in stage ii can be interpreted as a result of masking effects of isotope fractionation by bioavailability restrictions and mass transfer limitations at ph 8 5 one stage cr isotope fractionation with a k of 0 01 h 1 r 2 0 74 and an ε of 3 04 0 58 were observed similar to the ε values observed for stage i in the experiments with ph 7 2 and ph 6 0 the absence of a second stage in this ph condition is probably due to the low reduction rate and thus the overall high bioavailability of cr and lack of a masking effect therefore although cr vi reduction rate varies significantly under different ph conditions it appears that ph has a minimal effect on the cr isotope enrichment factors for the studied ph range similar to the results from cr isotope fractionation experiments in this study ph also had little influence on stable se isotope enrichment factors during methylation of selenate by the fungus alternaria alternata at ph 4 and ph 7 schilling et al 2011 the effects of temperature were tested at 18 c 28 c and 34 c respectively the details of cr isotopic measurements are shown in table s3 at these three temperatures the od600 values were similar indicating that cell growth was not affected by temperature fig 2 a figure s1c the cr vi reduction rate was temperature dependent fig 2b figure s1d the values of k for the overall reaction were 0 04 h 1 r 2 0 70 0 05 h 1 r 2 0 81 and 0 06 h 1 r 2 0 87 for the experiments at 18 c 28 c and 34 c respectively indicating the highest reduction rate occurred at 34 c and decreased with decreasing temperature table 1 the samples tested at 18 c and 34 c were chosen for cr isotope analyses the cr isotope fractionation behavior also showed a two stage trend in these experiments at 18 c the ε values for stage i and stage ii were 2 81 0 19 and 0 98 0 49 respectively table 1 fig 2c at 34 c the ε values were 2 60 0 14 and 1 01 0 11 respectively in good agreement with the values from the corresponding stages at 18 c table 1 fig 2c these findings indicate that cr isotope fractionation was not affected in the tested temperature range temperature and ph can affect a wide array of cellular processes such as the expression and activity of reductive enzymes bashir et al 2013 thus the reduction rate and mass transfer processes such as the process of binding to enzymes can be affected by temperature and ph even so the lack of resolvable influence of temperature and ph on the isotope fractionation for cr could potentially be attributed to the unchanged relative magnitude of mass transfer rates to rates of cr o bond breakage that is to say changes in temperature and ph accelerate decelerate the reactions in the cr vi reduction reaction chain proportionally this finding is important because ph and temperature often vary in surface environments so the relative independence of isotope enrichment factors with temperature and ph means that the enrichment factors observed under laboratory conditions can find wider real world applications 3 2 effect of the presence of nitrate on cr isotope fractionation nitrate is one of the most common competing electron acceptors present during microbial cr vi reduction in cr vi contaminated systems middleton et al 2003 the effects of nitrate on cr isotope fractionation were investigated by comparing the results from cr vi reduction experiments in the presence and absence of nitrate the details of the cr isotope data are also presented in table s4 the cell density was relatively stable under both conditions although in the absence of nitrate the cell density was slightly lower than in the presence of nitrate fig 3 a figure s1e the values of k were similar in both experiments table 1 fig 3b indicating that the ability of s oneidensis mr 1 to reduce cr vi was not inhibited in the presence of nitrate viamajala et al 2002 found that the cr vi reduction rate was not affected by nitrate under denitrifying conditions in fumarate grown cells of s oneidensis mr 1 consistent with the results of this study the results in this study suggest that electron transport to cr vi and nitrate may proceed through two physiologically uncoupled pathways in s oneidensis mr 1 rather than sharing the same electron transport chain a similar mechanism is observed in microbial fe iii reduction in the presence of nitrate dichristina 1992 in the presence of nitrate cr isotope fractionation showed a two stage process where the values of ε were 2 37 0 14 for stage i and 0 93 0 48 for stage ii and the corresponding k values are 0 71 h 1 r 2 0 99 and 0 05 h 1 r 2 0 99 respectively table 1 fig 3c in the absence of nitrate similar ε values k values and a two stage fractionation process were also observed table 1 fig 3c however han et al 2012 reported a significant reduction in the ε value 0 4 for p stutzeri rch2 under denitrifying conditions indicating that the intrinsic isotope fractionation for cr o bond breakage was almost completely masked by mass transfer processes the contrasting response of ε to the presence of nitrate may be attributed to the different metabolic pathways in s oneidensis mr 1 and p stutzeri rch2 in p stutzeri rch2 cr vi is transported into cells by the energy dependent sulfate uptake pathway and cr vi is reduced inside the cell ohtake et al 1987 viti et al 2014 it has been hypothesized that the process of cr vi uptake into the cell may be affected in the presence of nitrate and may become rate limiting han et al 2012 if this was the case the uptake process could have exerted an additional masking effect on cr isotope fractionation however in s oneidensis mr 1 cr vi is mainly reduced on the cell surface by outer membrane cytochromes mtrc and omca when the initial cr vi concentration is low belchik et al 2011 daulton et al 2002 wang et al 2013 thus the process of cr vi uptake through the cell membrane did not occur in the presence of nitrate in this study therefore the uptake process was unlikely to be an extra rate limiting step and cr isotope fractionation would not be masked by the uptake process leading to similar values of ε with and without nitrate in this study 3 3 bioavailability dependent two stage cr isotope fractionation chromium isotope fractionation exhibited two stage behavior for most of the experiments in this study documenting a clear masking of the magnitude of isotope fractionation in the later stages of cr vi reduction the masking of cr isotope fractionation in stage ii in the experiments was likely attributed to cr vi bioavailability restrictions as was established for sulfur isotope fractionation during microbial sulfate reduction in a multi step process the slowest step acts as the rate limiting step for the overall process johnson 2004 the observed isotope fractionation is the sum of the equilibrium isotope effect in each proceeding step and plus the kinetic effect at the rate limiting step the steps after the rate limiting step become practically irreversible and do not contribute to the observed isotope fractionation of the overall process brunner and bernasconi 2005 johnston et al 2007 qin and wang 2017 rees 1973 the intrinsic kinetic isotope fractionation in the case of cr vi bio reduction is mainly caused by cr o bond reconfiguration which is the first irreversible step in this multi step processes basu and johnson 2012 the mass transfer processes before the cr o bond reconfiguration are insensitive isotope steps and do not cause any significant isotope fractionation thullner et al 2012 however when the mass transfer processes become the rate limiting step the observed isotope fractionation can be significantly masked lollar et al 2010 bioavailable chemicals can freely cross the cell membrane or come to the cell surface to react with enzymes from an organism in the medium at any given time semple et al 2004 when such a compound is metabolized a consumptive process occurs this process strives towards a transient steady state between uptake and redelivery of the chemical by the medium and the bacteria thullner et al 2013 the bioavailability can be evaluated as the relative ratio of the rate of mass transfer to the bacteria to the rate of intrinsic enzymatic activity for bond breakage haws et al 2006 the bioavailability index can be described by the following equation haws et al 2006 6 b i r m r b where bi is the bioavailability index r m is the mass transfer rate and r b is the cr vi reduction rate the threshold of the masking effect is the particular point at which suppression of isotope fractionation begins in a given medium kritee et al 2008 the masking effect can be explained by two extremes in one extreme case when r m becomes much lower than r b extreme mass transfer rate limitations will occur and the observed isotope fractionation will be completely masked in the other extreme case when r b becomes much lower than r m extreme limitation of the cr vi reduction rate will occur and masking of the intrinsic isotope fractionation becomes negligible resulting in the observed isotope fractionation being equal in magnitude to the intrinsic isotope fractionation fig 4 a the bioavailability can be limited by the mass transfer processes and the masking effect on isotope fractionation becomes bioavailability dependent thullner et al 2008 thullner et al 2013 illustrated the relationship between isotope fractionation and bioavailability in three hypothetical scenarios fig 4b and c the arrow a in fig 4b represent substrate concentration and bioavailability index in the experiments was high resulting in large value of ε in fig 4c arrow c in fig 4b represents low value of substrate concentration and bioavailability leading to small value of ε in the experiments fig 4c arrow b in fig 4b indicates a rather sudden changes in bioavailability and substrate concentration as the reaction progressed resulting in an apparent two stage process of isotope fractionation in fig 4c similar simulated virtual batch experiments with different values of initial substrate concentration also reveal a process of two stage isotope fractionation which was induced by bioavailability restrictions figure s3 thullner et al 2008 in most of experiments in this study two stage cr isotope fractionation was observed and the k value in stage i was much higher than that in stage ii table 1 in stage i at high concentrations of cr vi most of the reductase at the cell surface of s oneidensis mr 1 confined to enzyme substrate complexes and little free reductase was left behind under such conditions cr vi was relatively bioavailable most cr vi bearing molecules diffused back into solution so that the masking effect on cr isotope fractionation during the enzymatic reaction was weaker however owing to high value of k in stage i in most of experiments in this study large amount of cr vi was consumed as the reaction proceeded whereas the cell density remained relatively high thus less reductase was engaged in enzyme substrate complexes and more free reductase was present cr vi was no longer bioavailable and molecules of cr vi could not escape back into solution consequently the threshold of the masking effect was reached and the observed cr isotope fractionation was highly suppressed therefore even if all other parameters are held constant during such a transition the observable cr isotope fractionation can be suppressed because of the bioavailability restrictions for the experiment at ph 8 5 the cell density decreased progressively and the extent of cr vi reduction and the value of k were relatively lower as a result the bioavailability remained relatively high over the course of the whole experiment resulting in a constant ε value throughout the experiments chromium isotope fractionation reported by sikora et al 2008 appeared to follow a single rayleigh trend during cr vi reduction by s oneidensis mr 1 under both donor rich and donor poor conditions this indicates that the bioavailability of cr vi remained unchanged during the course of their experiments under both conditions however in their study the value of ε was 4 2 in electron donor poor 5 100 μm lactate conditions and 1 8 in electron donor rich conditions 10 mm lactate when the concentration of electron donor became higher the first order rate coefficient k value became higher this led to a larger amount of cr vi consumption and the bioavailability index became lower resulting in lower value of ε in the work of basu et al 2014 cr isotope fractionation also followed single rayleigh trends during cr vi reduction by four different microbial species including g sulfurreducens shewanella sp nr p stutzeri dcp ps1 and d vulgaris except for experiments with shewanella sp nr which produced a much lower ε value of 2 the other three bacteria strains all produced ε values of 3 the lower ε value produced by shewanella sp nr was accompanied by the highest cr consumption rate suggesting lower cr bioavailability it has been shown bioavailability may vary with different strains and culture conditions and that different strains have different microbial characteristics including physiological morphological and behavioral adaptations of single cells and populations thullner et al 2013 all of these microbial characteristics may contribute to the variability in bioavailability in some previous studies cr isotope fractionation during abiotic cr vi reduction also appeared to follow two stage processes jamieson hanes et al 2012 2014 2015 for instance in the work of jamieson hanes et al 2014 cr isotope fractionation was investigated during cr vi reduction by granular zero valent iron zvi the values of ε were 0 2 in stage i and 1 2 to 1 5 in stage ii in their study the mechanism causing the two stage fractionation during abiotic cr vi reduction was very different from that during microbial cr vi reduction in this study in their work in stage i cr vi reacted with reactive surface sites of zvi this direct pathway induced fast reduction rate with small enrichment factors in stage ii as the reaction progressed the iron surface was passivated by secondary mineral precipitation and the reduction rate decreased with greater enrichment factors other than cr isotopes experimental observations of hg isotope fractionation reveal suppression of isotope fractionation with the bioavailability restrictions and mass transfer limitations during microbial reduction of hg ii to hg 0 and microbial degradation of monomethylmercury kritee et al 2008 2009 2013 shi et al 2016 reported a two stage process of fe isotope fractionation with decreased isotope enrichment factors in stage ii during microbial fe iii reduction due to the consumption of bioavailable fe iii many other experimental studies also observed decreasing isotope enrichment factors at lower substrate concentrations during the microbial reduction calder and parker 1973 kampara et al 2008 2009 4 conclusions in this study the effects of different environmental parameters on cr isotope fractionation were investigated under anaerobic conditions the major conclusions are the cr isotope enrichment factor during cr vi reduction by s oneidensis mr 1 was unaffected by changes in ambient temperature ph or by the presence or absence of a competing electron acceptor nitrate these results allow for increased confidence in the application of cr isotope enrichment factors obtained in well controlled laboratory settings to assess the extent of cr vi reduction in the field the cr isotope fractionation during cr vi reduction via microbial pathways in most of the experiments in this study showed a two stage trend resulting from changes in bioavailability of cr as the reduction progressed this helps to explain the variation in the magnitude of cr isotope fractionation during microbial cr vi reduction in laboratory and natural systems bioavailability restrictions and microbial mass transfer limitations can contribute to systematic masking of cr isotope fractionation this masking effect should be fully taken into account when interpreting cr isotope data from natural settings chromium isotope analysis is a useful approach to identify rate limiting steps in complex biochemical transformation reactions chromium isotope fractionation is also a promising tool for identifying bioavailability indices as the bioavailability of contaminants to microorganisms is reduced so is their bioavailability to other receptors including humans thus bioavailability indices are essential for long term risk control linking bioavailability indices to cr isotope fractionation is potentially useful for evaluating the feasibility of microbial cr vi reduction and determining

19182,to scale up microbial fuel cells mfcs larger cathodes need to be developed that can use air directly rather than dissolved oxygen and have good electrochemical performance a new type of cathode design was examined here that uses a window pane approach with fifteen smaller cathodes welded to a single conductive metal sheet to maintain good electrical conductivity across the cathode with an increase in total area abiotic electrochemical tests were conducted to evaluate the impact of the cathode size exposed areas of 7 cm2 33 cm2 and 6200 cm2 on performance for all cathodes having the same active catalyst material increasing the size of the exposed area of the electrodes to the electrolyte from 7 cm2 to 33 cm2 a single cathode panel decreased the cathode potential by 5 and a further increase in size to 6200 cm2 using the multi panel cathode reduced the electrode potential by 55 at 0 6 a m 2 in a 50 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs in 85 l mfc tests with the largest cathode using wastewater as a fuel the maximum power density based on polarization data was 0 083 0 006 w m 2 using 22 brush anodes to fully cover the cathode and 0 061 0 003 w m 2 with 8 brush anodes 40 of cathode projected area compared to 0 304 0 009 w m 2 obtained in the 28 ml mfc recovering power from large mfcs will therefore be challenging but several approaches identified in this study can be pursued to maintain performance when increasing the size of the electrodes graphical abstract image 1 keywords mfc scaling up wastewater chronopotentiometry air cathode 1 introduction microbial fuel cells mfcs have been intensively studied for achieving energy neutral wastewater treatment or even generating net power production during treatment logan and rabaey 2012 logan et al 2015 lovley 2006 recent advances in mfc reactor architecture and electrode materials have increased energy efficiencies in laboratory scale reactors and simultaneously lowered material costs santoro et al 2017 sleutels et al 2012 zhang et al 2014b however most mfc studies have used acetate as a substrate rather than actual wastewaters as the fuel or well buffered solutions with higher conductivities than those of typical wastewaters and reactor volumes 1 l zhang et al 2013 small electrode sizes and more favourable test conditions relative to wastewaters including high substrate concentrations more conductive solutions and elevated temperatures 30 c can result in performance levels that are much better than those possible using low strength wastewaters typical at municipal wastewater treatment facilities he et al 2016b zhang et al 2013 although power densities have reached 4 7 0 2 w m 2 for small mfcs 0 028 l fed phosphate buffer solutions pbs 200 mm amended with sodium acetate yang and logan 2016 and 0 8 0 03 w m 2 using domestic wastewater from a primary clarifier yang and logan 2016 few systems have been examined at reactor sizes of 10 l or more the main challenges for scaling up mfcs are improving power densities with low conductivity wastewaters fornero et al 2010 lanas et al 2014 stager et al 2017 having direct air cathodes rather than dissolved oxygen cathodes and using inexpensive materials and simple designs for their manufacture li et al 2013 most of the large scale mfcs volume 10 l to date had two chamber configurations that use an aqueous catholyte dekker et al 2009 lu et al 2017 vilajeliu pons et al 2017 wu et al 2016 one disadvantage of this two chamber design is that oxygen must be dissolved in the catholyte which can consume more energy than produced by the mfc in these systems with air cathodes oxygen transfer is passive and thus it consumes no energy dekker et al 2009 another disadvantage is that having a second liquid chamber adds additional ohmic resistance to the system which will increase the internal resistance and thus lower power production liu and logan 2004 power densities for larger scale mfcs with aerated catholyte systems are low and in the range of 0 002 0 72 w m 2 0 002 w m 2 lu et al 2017 0 67 w m 2 vilajeliu pons et al 2017 and 0 72 w m 2 dekker et al 2009 using an acidified catholyte ph 4 although a high power density of 7 58 w m 2 125 w m 3 was recently reported for a two chamber mfc design liang et al 2018 the values were at least an order of magnitude too large based on conventional methods to report power densities if the power was normalized by the total of 5 membranes 5 separate circuits in the module rather than one membrane area the maximum power from polarization tests would be 1 52 w m 2 if the total reactor volume was used rather than a single net anolyte volume the power density would be 15 w m 3 however power densities were produced under steady conditions were only 0 085 w m 2 0 98 w m 3 air cathodes have only been used in a few larger scale mfcs in one study a power density of 0 18 w m 2 was obtained with a 90 l mfc treating a brewery wastewater but individual cathodes had surface areas of only 600 cm2 dong et al 2015 in another study where a 10000 cm2 cathode was used the maximum power density was only 0 058 w m 2 and the design required a thin horizontal flow flow rate 42 l d 1 to minimize hydrostatic pressure and prevent water leakage feng et al 2014 when scaling up mfcs the electrode design should be reasonably compact and allow for easy installation and maintenance he et al 2016b logan et al 2015 for a flat plate and frame type mfc the electrode packing density is calculated from the spacing between repeating cathode and anode units for example for an anode chamber width of 2 cm filled with graphite fiber brush anodes and a cathode chamber width of 2 cm a 4 cm wide anode cathode unit the electrode specific surface area is 25 m2 m 3 area of the cathode per volume of the reactor logan et al 2015 very high electrode packing densities should be avoided to minimize clogging or short circuiting between the electrodes li et al 2013 and the design should allow easy access for maintenance or replacement one plate and frame configuration called a cassette mfc was made by bolting the anode and cathode together as part of the same cassette miyahara et al 2013 zhuang et al 2012 while this allows for good installation and cassette removal a single electrode cannot be extracted without removing and disassembling the whole cassette in addition this design provided only one cathode per anode more recently a modular design was developed that used repeating anode and cathode modules so that anode or cathode modules could be manufactured installed and removed without removing the counter electrodes he et al 2016a 2016b for this specific modular architecture the anode module was constructed from an array of anode brushes wired together while a cathode module was formed from two cathodes joined together with an air space between them he et al 2016a 2016b logan et al 2015 these modules were wired so that each anode was connected to two cathodes one on each side to improve power production and reduce treatment times anode brushes have been frequently used in large scale systems cusick et al 2011 logan 2010 but not air cathodes two challenges for building large air cathodes are the impact of water pressure on cathode performance ahn et al 2014 cheng et al 2014a and increased electrode overpotentials due to reduced electrical conductivities cheng et al 2014b as the hydraulic pressure on the cathode is increased with the height of the water in the reactor even if the cathode does not leak its performance could be reduced due to the high water pressure that reduces the area of the catalyst exposed to the air yang et al 2015 for example an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis of air cathodes showed that the charge transfer resistance increased from 23 ω to 44 ω when the water pressure increased from 0 1 m to 2 m against the electrode cheng et al 2014a electrical conductivities are a major concern during scale up as electrode dimension gets larger ohmic resistance increases because the distance between where electrons are generated and the leading out terminal where current flows out of anode increases cheng et al 2014b even though cathodes are made with relatively conductive carbon materials there can be substantial power losses due to the electrode overpotentials with the increased size of the electrodes for example it was estimated that the electrical power loss could be as much as 47 by increasing the size of a carbon mesh anode from 10 cm2 to 1 m2 current density of 3 a m 2 based on only one connection to the electrode cheng et al 2014b in order to obtain large cathodes with good electrical conductivity and performance we designed and tested a new multi panel cathode that contained many smaller cathodes welded into a single metal sheet much like windows are made of many panes of glass fig 1 patent application no ep17194627 using a metal sheet provided good electrical connections for all individual cathode panes to the circuit for the individual panels we used commercially available cathodes with a size of 18 by 18 cm 324 cm2 pant et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 2014a to evaluate the impact of this design on performance we constructed a cathode containing 15 individual cathode panes 3 cathodes high 5 cathodes wide 6800 cm2 total projected area 6200 cm2 exposed area performance was examined in an 85 l tank under abiotic conditions using chronoamperometry and in biotic mfc fed with domestic wastewater we compared the electrochemical performance of this larger cathode with two smaller cathodes made from a portion of a single cathode pane 11 3 cm2 total projected area square cathodes 7 cm2 exposed area typically used in 0 028 l mfcs yang et al 2017a and larger 52 cm2 33 cm2 exposed area cathodes in a specially designed reactor 0 22 l following electrochemical tests the large multi paned cathode was examined for power production in an mfc using an anode module with 8 or 22 brush anodes in multiple fed batch tests using domestic wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode materials the cathodes used in electrochemical tests and mfcs were all prepared using sheets 18 by 18 cm 324 cm2 0 45 mm thick that were manufactured by vito mol belgium using a proprietary process vito core based on pressing together a mixture of activated carbon ac 70 90 wt norit sx plus norit americas inc tx and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe binder onto a stainless steel mesh current collector a ptfe diffusion layer 70 porosity was then added on top of the catalyst layer which became the air side of the cathode pant et al 2010 the cathodes for the small 11 3 cm2 and medium 52 cm2 chambers were made from portions cut from these cathode sheets a circular cathode 3 8 cm in diameter 11 3 cm2 was used for the smallest reactor 0 028 l and a rectangular cathode of 9 2 cm by 5 6 cm 52 cm2 was used in the middle sized reactor 0 22 l the large cathode 107 cm long by 0 64 cm in height 6800 cm2 was manufactured by vito based on a specified overall electrode size and contained 15 cathode sheets that were welded into laser cut holes window panes in the stainless steel frame to allow the cathode sheets to be exposed to water on one side and air on the other side fig 1 the use of a single metal panel enabled a low resistance of 0 2 ω between the center of any cathode panel and any part of the external stainless steel panel brush anodes were made with two different sizes for the various sized chamber mfc tests for the smaller reactor brushes were 2 5 cm in diameter and 2 5 cm

al 2010 2 2 bench and pilot scale reactors three different electrochemical cells were constructed to evaluate the impact of scaling up the cathode size on the electrochemical performance fig 1 the small cell sc was a single chamber cube shaped reactor constructed from a polycarbonate block 4 cm in length 5 cm 5 cm with an inside cylindrical chamber having a diameter of 3 cm 0 028 l total volume and an exposed cathode area of 7 cm2 that has been used in many previous mfc laboratory studies fig 1c yang et al 2017a the cathode specific surface area was 25 m2 m 3 anolyte volume the medium sized cell mc was a polycarbonate rectangular shaped reactor with an anolyte chamber 10 9 cm long 3 5 cm wide and 6 2 cm high filled with 0 22 l of electrolyte fig 1d fig s1 the cell had a bracket slot 3 5 cm from the wall of the water side where the cathode was attached separating the anolyte chamber from the air cathode chamber the cathodes were secured to the frame with 10 screws using a plastic u

rectangular tank 1 1 m long 0 15 m wide and 0 85 m height that was used to examine the physical properties of the cathodes such as mechanical strength deformation when filled and the resistance to water pressure based on leaking as well as to evaluate the electrochemical characteristics of the cathodes fig 1e the tank had a bracket slot 10 cm from the wall of the water side where the cathode was attached to form the anolyte chamber the cathodes were secured to the frame with 25 screws using a plastic u shape fastener and a gasket closed cell pvc vinyl foam the anolyte tank was filled with 85 l of water and examined by eye for deformation and water leakage when filled the cathode specific surface area was 7 3 m2 m 3 anolyte volume this lower specific area of the cathode was used here in order to accommodate the larger diameter anode brushes and to enable easy inspection of the condition of the electrodes the cathode air chamber was formed by sliding a sheet of pvc into a slotted groove 5 cm from the cathode to reduce the cathode deformation due to the pressure of the water on the cathode the space between the clear pvc sheet and the cathode was filled with 19 spacers constructed by rolling polypropylene mesh xn3110 48p industrial netting usa into tubes 4 cm diameter by 1 m long with the rolled tubes held together using zip ties fig s2 to examine actual power generation in the lc an anode module made of polyvinyl chloride pvc was constructed using a linear array of graphite fiber brushes the pvc module held either 8 or 22 brushes as indicated with the ends of the brushes secured at the top and bottom of the module fig s3 the brush module was placed parallel to the cathode in the middle of the anode chamber producing a distance of 3 5 cm between the edge of the anode brushes and the cathode surface in initial tests lanas et al 2014 the anodes were connected in parallel to the circuit by an external single titanium wire at the top of the anode module a clip was used to reduce the bending of the cathode sheet and to secure it in position while improving its electrical connection fig s4 for the smaller chamber the anodes were placed horizontally in the middle of mfc chambers perpendicular to the cathode with a distance of 1 4 cm between the edge of the brush and the cathode vargas et al 2013 yang et al 2017b to avoid any short circuiting and reduce biofilm growth on the cathode all reactors were operated during the biotic tests with a separator placed on the cathode pz 1212 contec usa wei et al 2013 yang et al 2017b for the sc a separator with the same area of the cathode was cut from a 30 cm by 30 cm wipe separator in the lc 12 separators were sewn together and cut to the final area same as the cathode 6800 cm2 2 3 electrochemical

anodes in the sc were fully acclimated to wastewater in mfcs for over four months at a fixed external resistance of 1000 ω at a constant temperature 30 c domestic wastewater was collected once a week from the effluent of the primary clarifier at the pennsylvania state university wastewater treatment plant and stored at 4 c prior to use total and soluble cod were measured using method 5220 hach cod system hach company loveland colorado single cycle polarization tests were conducted by varying the external resistance from 1000 500 200 100 and 75 ω at a 20 min interval after open circuiting for 2 h with a total test duration of 3 7 h in a constant temperature room 30 c the lc was operated at room temperature in a laboratory at the pennsylvania state university wastewater treatment plant in order to feed it directly with fresh primary effluent wastewater ww during acclimation of the anodes for the first week of operation the feed solution was 35 l of primary effluent wastewater mixed with 40 l of 0 5 g l 1 sodium acetate in 50 mm pbs and 10 l effluent collected over several weeks from mfcs fed acetate and wastewater the external resistance was 1000 ω for the first two days and then was decreased daily to 100 ω 25 ω 10 ω and 5 ω over the following four days for the second week of acclimation the solution was 55 l of wastewater 20 l of 50 mm pbs containing 0 5 g l 1 sodium acetate and 10 l of mfc effluent thereafter the lc was operated using only primary effluent wastewater after a stable potential production for three successive fed batch cycles single cycle polarization tests were conducted on the lc by feeding the reactor with fresh wastewater and holding the system at open circuit conditions for 2 h and then varying the external resistance from 100 25

of different sizes showed differences in performance with the smaller cathodes producing the lowest overpotentials at the different set current densities fig 2 a fig s5 for example at 0 61 0 00 a m 2 the smaller cathode produced 0 35 0 00 v which was only 5 higher than the potential produced by the middle sized cathode 0 33 0 00 v at 0 62 0 01 a m 2 but 121 higher than that obtained with the large cathode 0 16 0 03 v at 0 64 0 00 a m 2 the adverse impact of the increased size of an electrode on performance was consistent with previous studies that showed a loss in power as cathode sizes were increased cheng et al 2014b dewan et al 2008 chronopotentiometry tests were conducted on the different size cathodes in tap water amended with sodium chloride κ 1 45 0 05 ms cm 1 to evaluate performance in an unbuffered solution with a conductivity similar to that of domestic wastewater fig 2b the overpotentials of all cathodes were larger in the less conductive solution with the large cathode having much higher overpotentials with respect to the other two cathodes at a given current density for example at a current density of 0 64 0 00 a m 2 the potential of largest cathode was 0 09 0 01 v which was much lower than that of 0 23 0 00 v of the medium size cathode 0 63 0 00 a m 2 and 0 26 0 01 v 0 62 0 00 a m 2 for the smallest cathode additional chronoamperometry tests were conducted using the large cell to evaluate the impact of the presence of the separator on the electrochemical performance of the cathode over a current density range relevant to operation of the large mfc using wastewater fig s6a the presence of the extra layer of the separator reduced the potential output at 0 64 a m 2 from 0 16 0 03 v to 0 13 0 01 v in pbs and from 0 09 0 01 v to 0 06 0 00 v in a low conductivity solution insufficient airflow in the cathode chamber could reduce oxygen availability and thus cathode performance yang et al 2012 therefore an additional electrochemical test was conducted by blowing air into the bottom of the air chamber at 0 5 l min 1 fig s6b this airflow across the cathode did not impact the cathode performance indicating that the size of the air chamber was sufficient to passively provide oxygen transfer to the cathode and that the spacers did not impede passive air flow 3 2 power production of the 85 l mfc fed domestic wastewater 22 anodes following acclimation of the 85 l mfc with the anode module fig s3 over three fed batch cycles polarization tests were conducted using domestic wastewater fig 3 the maximum power density was 0 083 0 006 w m 2 which was 73 lower than that obtained in the small chamber mfc 0 304 0 009 w m 2 in wastewater the cathode potentials were similar in the abiotic and biotic tests in the 85 l and in the 28 ml reactors fig 3a and b there was a significant difference between the open circuit potential ocp of the biotic 0 32 0 00 v and abiotic 0 44 0 00 v tests for the small chamber but the cathode potentials matched well over the current density range relevant to operation of wastewater fed mfcs the anode performance was a factor in the reduced power production by the 85 l mfc compared to the 28 ml mfc for example after correction for the solution resistance the slope of the trendline from the linearization of the anode potential was 0 29 ω m2 in lc biotic test 3 6 higher than the 0 08 ω m2 from the sc biotic tests fig 3d fig s7 however there was a much larger reduction in the cathode performance change of 0 30 v from 0 37 0 04 v at ocp to 0 07 0 02 v at 0 46 0 03 a m 2 compared to that of the anodes change of 0 13 v from 0 31 0 01 v at ocp to 0 18 0 02 v at 0 46 0 03 a m 2 this larger difference for the cathode indicated that in this system the cathode was primarily limiting power production the decrease in the anode performance was likely a result of both increased size of the anodes and the cathode performance the anodes in the 85 l mfc were much longer and had a larger diameter than those in the small mfc which both could have contributed to higher overpotentials cheng et al 2014b dewan et al 2008 the increase in water pressure could also have decreased the performance of the cathodes particularly at the bottom of the mfc where the water pressure was the highest relative to those at the top of the reactor cheng et al 2014a this change in the cathode performance could have impacted performance of the anodes opposite to the cathode in the bottom of the large reactor the reduced active area of the cathode due to the metal frame could also have been a factor in reducing electrode performance as the metal frame accounted for 23 of the exposed projected area of the cathode fig 1 normalizing the power produced by only the active cathode area results in a power density of 0 10 w m 2 3 3 power production of the 85 l mfc fed domestic wastewater using 8 anodes to further examine the impact of the anodes on performance we conducted tests using 8 anodes instead of 22 anodes reducing the number of anodes decreased the anodic projected area by 58 from 6000 cm2 to 2500 cm2 but this decreased the maximum power density by only 27 from 0 083 0 006 w m 2 to 0 061 0 003 w m 2 based on the cathode projected area fig 4 power normalized to the projected anode area was 0 152 0 009 w m 2 which is consistent with previous results showing that using two electrodes with different projected areas improves the relative performance of the smaller electrode he et al 2016a oh and logan 2006 reducing the number of anodes resulted in slightly increased anode overpotentials for example the anode potential at the maximum power density was 0 177 0 002 v at 0 206 0 006 a m 2 normalized to the projected cathode area compared to 0 23 0 01 v at the highest current density of 0 250 0 006 a m 2 with 22 anodes thus maximizing full coverage of the cathodes by the anodes is needed to improve power production lanas and logan 2013 3 4 impact of the operation time on the mfc performance following polarization tests with the 8 anodes the impact of cathode fouling was examined by comparing the maximum power densities with the existing cathode which had been operated for 1 month to the same cathode that was cleaned to remove the surface biofilm and to a new cathode the maximum power density increased to 0 057 w m 2 after removing the biofilm which was 36 higher than that obtained prior to biofilm cleaning 0 042 w m 2 fig 5 when a new cathode was used the maximum power density was 0 064 w m 2 which was essentially the same as that originally obtained at the start of the experiments with 8 anodes the maximum power density decreased by 34 after one month of operation with 23 due to biofilm formation on the solution side of the cathode and the remaining 11 due to a combination of the precipitation of salts an et al 2017 and the adsorption of organic matter in the wastewater such as humic acids yang et al 2016 and metabolic by products such as extracellular polymers liu et al 2018 this decrease is only slightly lower than the 39 decrease in the performance previously reported for small chamber mfcs 28 ml volume 7 cm2 exposed cathode area after one month of operation rossi et al 2018 this fouled smaller cathode was shown to be successfully cleaned by soaking in a weakly acidic solution for several hours rossi et al 2017 zhang et al 2014a but this approach might not be practical for larger cathodes we are currently investigating easier ways to clean fouled cathodes no corrosion of the stainless steel structure was observed after one month of operation the decline in the cathode potentials further demonstrated that the main reason for the reduced performance of the mfc after one month of operation was the cathode performance for example at the maximum power density the potential of the new cathode was 0 19 v at 0 212 a m 2 compared to 0 07 v at 0 171 a m 2 for the used cathode after scraping off the biofilm from the solution side of the fouled cathode the electrode potential reached 0 16 v 0 200 a m 2 at the maximum power density which was an overall decrease of 11 compared to the new cathode 3 5 treatment performance based on cod removal the mfc with 8 or 22 anodes achieved similar cod removal efficiencies of 75 80 the presence of a higher number of anodes therefore did not increase the rate of cod removal although the number of anodes did impact the amount of cod converted to electricity the total cod decreased from 428 12 mg l 1 to 88 4 mg l 1 after 9 days in the 8 anode configuration with 22 anodes the cod decreased from 376 4 mg l 1 to 90 5 mg l 1 in 11 days the longer time needed to reduce the cod with 22 anodes was likely due to the higher oxygen content in the 8 anode configuration that might have increased the cod removal rate the coulombic efficiency logan et al 2006 ce was 27 when using 22 anodes but it decreased to 13 with 8 anodes the ce obtained here is essentially the same as the 22 previously achieved in small chamber mfc for domestic wastewater at low external resistance 100 ω zhang et al 2015 3 6 approaches to improve electrochemical performance increasing the sizes of the anodes and cathodes resulted in a decrease in the electrode performance despite maintaining the same catalyst and reactor configuration the greatest impact on performance was due to the cathode the power density of the large mfc was about one order of magnitude lower than that obtained in the small mfc 0 083 0 006 w m 2 vs 0 304 0 009 w m 2 fortunately there are a number of changes in the reactor or electrode design which could be made to improve performance it should be possible to further improve performance in the large mfc by connecting the anode arrays to two cathodes rather than one cathode as done in this study the test chamber used here was designed primarily to test hydraulic stability and electrochemical performance of an abiotic cathode and thus it was only possible to connect an array of anodes to a single cathode however we have previously demonstrated that connecting an anode array with two cathodes one on either side of the anode array increased the maximum power density by 62 in fed batch mfcs cheng and logan 2011 and by 39 53 for mfcs operated in continuous flow with a feed of domestic wastewater kim et al 2015 it might be possible to improve performance by changing the diameter or the fiber density of the brush anodes for the tests conducted here we used anodes with a diameter of 5 1 cm due to their availability from a previous mec reactor design cusick et al 2011 this larger diameter could have resulted in reduced power due to the average distance of the anode from the wire core to the cathode it was previously shown that reducing 2 5 cm diameter anodes to 0 8 cm improved power as long as the anode cathode spacing was not changed this reduction in size resulted in a 49 increase of the maximum power density from 0 690 w m 2 to 1 030 w m 2 using acetate as a substrate in continuous flow mfcs stager et al 2017 however additional tests with the very small brushes 0 8 cm with a wastewater feed resulted in unstable mfc performance while the use of 2 5 cm diameter brushes did not stager et al 2017 thus a decrease in brush size from 5 1 cm to 2 5 cm might improve mfc performance without adversely impacting stable power generation but only if the anode resistance is a substantial part of the overall internal resistance reducing the spacing between two deployed electrodes will reduce the ohmic drop and could increase power output and thus a further reduction in electrode spacing could also improve the performance if the ohmic losses are a main factor in power production li et al 2013 for example the solution resistance in the large chamber with a 3 5 cm electrode spacing was 0 47 ω which was 21 of the internal resistance of the reactor 2 19 ω reducing the spacing from 3 5 cm to 1 4 cm could further decrease the solution resistance by 60 to 0 19 ω and raise the maximum power density increasing the active area of the cathode and operating with lower hydraulic pressure could also improve its performance the stainless steel frame used here reduced the active area of the cathode by 23 and thus reducing the size of the frame relative to the cathode panels could help improve performance the hydraulic pressure against the cathode has been shown to reduce the performance of some cathodes likely due to the increased catalyst flooding with water ahn et al 2014 cheng et al 2014a further experiments should be conducted on the impact of hydraulic pressure on large scale cathodes by carrying out abiotic tests with different volumes of electrolyte in the chamber it might be possible to improve the cathode performance by making them more hydrophobic by varying binder content or diffusion layer porosities or by using a different type of diffusion layer yang et al 2015 it might also be possible to use different cathodes in the bottom of the chamber where the water pressure is greatest compared to cathodes at the top where water pressure is lower as previously noted a critical factor in scaling up mfcs is maintaining sufficient cathode surface area per volume cathode specific surface area as the reactor size is increased in order to achieve rapid cod removal and maintain a good volumetric power density logan et al 2015 the cathode specific surface area of the large chamber used in this study was only 7 3 m2 m 3 due to the original design factors for evaluating abiotic cathode performance this is much lower than the 25 m2 m 3 previously used in many mfc tests he et al 2016b logan et al 2015 thus the overall performance in terms of cod removal rate as well as power density will be increased in planned larger scale designs based on closer electrode spacing and connecting an anode array to two cathodes 4 conclusions a 6200 cm2 air cathode made of fifteen smaller cathodes welded to a single conductive metal sheet was examined in abiotic and biotic tests overall the performance of the large cathode 6200 cm2 decreased relative to the smaller cathodes 7 cm2 33 cm2 however the maximum power density of 0 083 0 006 w m 2 was comparable to that obtained in other larger scale aqueous catholyte mfcs but there was no catholyte or water aeration needed for our system thus the design provided an energy positive system due to passive oxygen transfer to the air cathode full coverage of the cathode by the brush anodes was needed as reducing the anode projected area from 6000 cm2 to 2500 cm2 decreased the maximum power density by 27 to 0 061 0 003 w m 2 these tests showed the first time that an air cathode could function in a large scale mfc at a high hydrostatic water pressure 85 cm water height several design factors were discussed that could lead to further improvements in overall power production such as closer electrode spacing and a more

19182,to scale up microbial fuel cells mfcs larger cathodes need to be developed that can use air directly rather than dissolved oxygen and have good electrochemical performance a new type of cathode design was examined here that uses a window pane approach with fifteen smaller cathodes welded to a single conductive metal sheet to maintain good electrical conductivity across the cathode with an increase in total area abiotic electrochemical tests were conducted to evaluate the impact of the cathode size exposed areas of 7 cm2 33 cm2 and 6200 cm2 on performance for all cathodes having the same active catalyst material increasing the size of the exposed area of the electrodes to the electrolyte from 7 cm2 to 33 cm2 a single cathode panel decreased the cathode potential by 5 and a further increase in size to 6200 cm2 using the multi panel cathode reduced the electrode potential by 55 at 0 6 a m 2 in a 50 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs in 85 l mfc tests with the largest cathode using wastewater as a fuel the maximum power density based on polarization data was 0 083 0 006 w m 2 using 22 brush anodes to fully cover the cathode and 0 061 0 003 w m 2 with 8 brush anodes 40 of cathode projected area compared to 0 304 0 009 w m 2 obtained in the 28 ml mfc recovering power from large mfcs will therefore be challenging but several approaches identified in this study can be pursued to maintain performance when increasing the size of the electrodes graphical abstract image 1 keywords mfc scaling up wastewater chronopotentiometry air cathode 1 introduction microbial fuel cells mfcs have been intensively studied for achieving energy neutral wastewater treatment or even generating net power production during treatment logan and rabaey 2012 logan et al 2015 lovley 2006 recent advances in mfc reactor architecture and electrode materials have increased energy efficiencies in laboratory scale reactors and simultaneously lowered material costs santoro et al 2017 sleutels et al 2012 zhang et al 2014b however most mfc studies have used acetate as a substrate rather than actual wastewaters as the fuel or well buffered solutions with higher conductivities than those of typical wastewaters and reactor volumes 1 l zhang et al 2013 small electrode sizes and more favourable test conditions relative to wastewaters including high substrate concentrations more conductive solutions and elevated temperatures 30 c can result in performance levels that are much better than those possible using low strength wastewaters typical at municipal wastewater treatment

logan 2016 and 0 8 0 03 w m 2 using domestic wastewater from a primary clarifier yang and logan 2016 few systems have been examined at reactor sizes of 10 l or more the main challenges for scaling up mfcs are improving power densities with low conductivity wastewaters fornero et al 2010 lanas et al 2014 stager et al 2017 having direct air cathodes rather than dissolved oxygen cathodes and using inexpensive materials and simple designs for their manufacture li et al 2013 most of the large scale mfcs volume 10 l to date had two chamber configurations that use an aqueous catholyte dekker et al 2009 lu et al 2017 vilajeliu pons et al 2017 wu et al 2016 one disadvantage of this two chamber design is that oxygen must be dissolved in the catholyte which can consume more energy than produced by the mfc in these systems with air cathodes oxygen transfer is passive and thus it consumes no energy dekker et al 2009 another disadvantage is that having a second liquid chamber adds additional ohmic resistance to the system which will increase the internal resistance and thus lower power production liu and logan 2004 power densities for larger scale mfcs with aerated catholyte systems are low and in the range of 0 002 0 72 w m 2 0 002 w m 2 lu et al 2017 0 67 w m 2 vilajeliu pons et al 2017 and 0 72 w m 2 dekker et al 2009 using an acidified catholyte ph 4 although a high power density of 7 58 w m 2 125 w m 3 was recently reported for a two chamber mfc design liang et al 2018 the values were at least an order of magnitude too large based on conventional methods to report power densities if the power was normalized by the total of 5 membranes 5 separate circuits in the module rather than one membrane area the maximum power from polarization tests would be 1 52 w m 2 if the total reactor volume was used rather than a single net anolyte volume the power density would be 15 w m 3 however power densities were produced under steady conditions were only 0 085 w m 2 0 98 w m 3 air cathodes have only been used in a few larger scale mfcs in one study a power density of 0 18 w m 2 was obtained with a 90 l mfc treating a brewery wastewater but individual cathodes had surface areas of only 600 cm2 dong et al 2015 in another study where a 10000 cm2 cathode was used the maximum power density was only 0 058 w m 2 and the design required a thin horizontal flow flow rate 42 l d 1 to minimize hydrostatic pressure and prevent water leakage feng et al 2014 when scaling up mfcs the electrode design should be reasonably compact and allow for easy installation and maintenance he et al 2016b logan et al 2015 for a flat plate and frame type mfc the electrode packing density is calculated from the spacing between repeating cathode and anode units for example for an anode chamber width of 2 cm filled with graphite fiber brush anodes and a cathode chamber width of 2 cm a 4 cm wide anode cathode unit the electrode specific surface area is 25 m2 m 3 area of the cathode per volume of the reactor logan et al 2015 very high electrode packing densities should be avoided to minimize clogging or short circuiting between the electrodes li et al 2013 and the design should allow easy access for maintenance or replacement one plate and frame configuration called a cassette mfc was made by bolting the anode and cathode together as part of the same cassette miyahara et al 2013 zhuang et al 2012 while this allows for good installation and cassette removal a single electrode cannot be extracted without removing and disassembling the whole cassette in addition this design provided only one cathode per anode more recently a modular design was developed that used repeating anode and cathode modules so that anode or cathode modules could be manufactured installed and removed without removing the counter electrodes he et al 2016a 2016b for this specific modular architecture the anode module was constructed from an array of anode brushes wired together while a cathode module was formed from two cathodes joined together with an air space between them he et al 2016a 2016b logan et al 2015 these modules were wired so that each anode was connected to two cathodes one on each side to improve power production and reduce treatment times anode brushes have been frequently used in large scale systems cusick et al 2011 logan 2010 but not air cathodes two challenges for building large air cathodes are the impact of water pressure on cathode performance ahn et al 2014 cheng et al 2014a and increased electrode overpotentials due to reduced electrical conductivities cheng et al 2014b as the hydraulic pressure on the cathode is increased with the height of the water in the reactor even if the cathode does not leak its performance could be reduced due to the high water pressure that reduces the area of the catalyst exposed to the air yang et al 2015 for example an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis of air cathodes showed that the charge transfer resistance increased from 23 ω to 44 ω when the water pressure increased from 0 1 m to 2 m against the electrode cheng et al 2014a electrical conductivities are a major concern during scale up as electrode dimension gets larger ohmic resistance increases because the distance between where electrons are generated and the leading out terminal where current flows out of anode increases cheng et al 2014b even though cathodes are made with relatively conductive carbon materials there can be substantial power losses due to the electrode overpotentials with the increased size of the electrodes for example it was estimated that the electrical power loss could be as much as 47 by increasing the size of a carbon mesh anode from 10 cm2 to 1 m2 current density of 3 a m 2 based on only one connection to the electrode cheng et al 2014b in order to obtain large cathodes with good electrical conductivity and performance we designed and tested a new multi panel cathode that contained many smaller cathodes welded into a single metal sheet much like windows are made of many panes of glass fig 1 patent application no ep17194627 using a metal sheet provided good electrical connections for all individual cathode panes to the circuit for the individual panels we used commercially available cathodes with a size of 18 by 18 cm 324 cm2 pant et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 2014a to evaluate the impact of this design on performance we constructed a cathode containing 15 individual cathode panes 3 cathodes high 5 cathodes wide 6800 cm2 total projected area 6200 cm2 exposed area performance was examined in an 85 l tank under abiotic conditions using chronoamperometry and in biotic mfc fed with domestic wastewater we compared the electrochemical performance of this larger cathode with two

norit americas inc tx and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe binder onto a stainless steel mesh current collector a ptfe diffusion layer 70 porosity was then added on top of the catalyst layer which became the air side of the cathode pant et al 2010 the cathodes for the small 11 3 cm2 and medium 52 cm2 chambers were made from portions cut from these cathode sheets a circular cathode 3 8 cm in diameter 11 3 cm2 was used for the smallest reactor 0 028 l and a rectangular cathode of 9 2 cm by 5 6 cm 52 cm2 was used in the middle sized reactor 0 22 l the large cathode 107 cm long by 0 64 cm in height 6800 cm2 was manufactured by vito based on a specified overall electrode size and contained 15 cathode sheets that were welded into laser cut holes window panes in the stainless steel frame to allow the cathode sheets to be exposed to water on one side and air on the other side fig 1 the use of a single metal panel enabled a low resistance of 0 2 ω between the center of any cathode panel and any part of the external stainless steel panel brush anodes were made with two different sizes for the various sized chamber mfc tests for the smaller reactor brushes were 2 5 cm in diameter and 2 5 cm

al 2010 2 2 bench and pilot scale reactors three different electrochemical cells were constructed to evaluate the impact of scaling up the cathode size on the electrochemical performance fig 1 the small cell sc was a single chamber cube shaped reactor constructed from a polycarbonate block 4 cm in length 5 cm 5 cm with an inside cylindrical chamber having a diameter of 3 cm 0 028 l total volume and an exposed cathode area of 7 cm2 that has been used in many previous mfc laboratory studies fig 1c yang et al 2017a the cathode specific surface area was 25 m2 m 3 anolyte volume the medium sized cell mc was a polycarbonate rectangular shaped reactor with an anolyte chamber 10 9 cm long 3 5 cm wide and 6 2 cm high filled with 0 22 l of electrolyte fig 1d fig s1 the cell had a bracket slot 3 5 cm from the wall of the water side where the cathode was attached separating the anolyte chamber from the air cathode chamber the cathodes were secured to the frame with 10 screws using a plastic u

rectangular tank 1 1 m long 0 15 m wide and 0 85 m height that was used to examine the physical properties of the cathodes such as mechanical strength deformation when filled and the resistance to water pressure based on leaking as well as to evaluate the electrochemical characteristics of the cathodes fig 1e the tank had a bracket slot 10 cm from the wall of the water side where the cathode was attached to form the anolyte chamber the cathodes were secured to the frame with 25 screws using a plastic u shape fastener and a gasket closed cell pvc vinyl foam the anolyte tank was filled with 85 l of water and examined by eye for deformation and water leakage when filled the cathode specific surface area was 7 3 m2 m 3 anolyte volume this lower specific area of the cathode was used here in order to accommodate the larger diameter anode brushes and to enable easy inspection of the condition of the electrodes the cathode air chamber was formed by sliding a sheet of pvc into a slotted groove 5 cm from the cathode to reduce the cathode deformation due to the pressure of the water on the cathode the space between the clear pvc sheet and the cathode was filled with 19 spacers constructed by rolling polypropylene mesh xn3110 48p industrial netting usa into tubes 4 cm diameter by 1 m long with the rolled tubes held together using zip ties fig s2 to examine actual power generation in the lc an anode module made of polyvinyl chloride pvc was constructed using a linear array of graphite fiber brushes the pvc module held either 8 or 22 brushes as indicated with the ends of the brushes secured at the top and bottom of the module fig s3 the brush module was placed parallel to the cathode in the middle of the anode chamber producing a distance of 3 5 cm between the edge of the anode brushes and the cathode surface in initial tests lanas et al 2014 the anodes were connected in parallel to the circuit by an external single titanium wire at the top of the anode module a clip was used to reduce the bending of the cathode sheet and to secure it in position while improving its electrical connection fig s4 for the smaller chamber the anodes were placed horizontally in the middle of mfc chambers perpendicular to the cathode with a distance of 1 4 cm between the edge of the brush and the cathode vargas et al 2013 yang et al 2017b to avoid any short circuiting and reduce biofilm growth on the cathode all reactors were operated during the biotic tests with a separator placed on the cathode pz 1212 contec usa wei et al 2013 yang et al 2017b for the sc a separator with the same area of the cathode was cut from a 30 cm by 30 cm wipe separator in the lc 12 separators were sewn together and cut to the final area same as the cathode 6800 cm2 2 3 electrochemical

anodes in the sc were fully acclimated to wastewater in mfcs for over four months at a fixed external resistance of 1000 ω at a constant temperature 30 c domestic wastewater was collected once a week from the effluent of the primary clarifier at the pennsylvania state university wastewater treatment plant and stored at 4 c prior to use total and soluble cod were measured using method 5220 hach cod system hach company loveland colorado single cycle polarization tests were conducted by varying the external resistance from 1000 500 200 100 and 75 ω at a 20 min interval after open circuiting for 2 h with a total test duration of 3 7 h in a constant temperature room 30 c the lc was operated at room temperature in a laboratory at the pennsylvania state university wastewater treatment plant in order to feed it directly with fresh primary effluent wastewater ww during acclimation of the anodes for the first week of operation the feed solution was 35 l of primary effluent wastewater mixed with 40 l of 0 5 g l 1 sodium acetate in 50 mm pbs and 10 l effluent collected over several weeks from mfcs fed acetate and wastewater the external resistance was 1000 ω for the first two days and then was decreased daily to 100 ω 25 ω 10 ω and 5 ω over the following four days for the second week of acclimation the solution was 55 l of wastewater 20 l of 50 mm pbs containing 0 5 g l 1 sodium acetate and 10 l of mfc effluent thereafter the lc was operated using only primary effluent wastewater after a stable potential production for three successive fed batch cycles single cycle polarization tests were conducted on the lc by feeding the reactor with fresh wastewater and holding the system at open circuit conditions for 2 h and then varying the external resistance from 100 25

of different sizes showed differences in performance with the smaller cathodes producing the lowest overpotentials at the different set current densities fig 2 a fig s5 for example at 0 61 0 00 a m 2 the smaller cathode produced 0 35 0 00 v which was only 5 higher than the potential produced by the middle sized cathode 0 33 0 00 v at 0 62 0 01 a m 2 but 121 higher than that obtained with the large cathode 0 16 0 03 v at 0 64 0 00 a m 2 the adverse impact of the increased size of an electrode on performance was consistent with previous studies that showed a loss in power as cathode sizes were increased cheng et al 2014b dewan et al 2008 chronopotentiometry tests were conducted on the different size cathodes in tap water amended with sodium chloride κ 1 45 0 05 ms cm 1 to evaluate performance in an unbuffered solution with a conductivity similar to that of domestic wastewater fig 2b the overpotentials of all cathodes were larger in the less conductive solution with the large cathode having much higher overpotentials with respect to the other two cathodes at a given current density for example at a current density of 0 64 0 00 a m 2 the potential of largest cathode was 0 09 0 01 v which was much lower than that of 0 23 0 00 v of the medium size cathode 0 63 0 00 a m 2 and 0 26 0 01 v 0 62 0 00 a m 2 for the smallest cathode additional chronoamperometry tests were conducted using the large cell to evaluate the impact of the presence of the separator on the electrochemical performance of the cathode over a current density range relevant to operation of the large mfc using wastewater fig s6a the presence of the extra layer of the separator reduced the potential output at 0 64 a m 2 from 0 16 0 03 v to 0 13 0 01 v in pbs and from 0 09 0 01 v to 0 06 0 00 v in a low conductivity solution insufficient airflow in the cathode chamber could reduce oxygen availability and thus cathode performance yang et al 2012 therefore an additional electrochemical test was conducted by blowing air into the bottom of the air chamber at 0 5 l min 1 fig s6b this airflow across the cathode did not impact the cathode performance indicating that the size of the air chamber was sufficient to passively provide oxygen transfer to the cathode and that the spacers did not impede passive air flow 3 2 power production of the 85 l mfc fed domestic wastewater 22 anodes following acclimation of the 85 l mfc with the anode module fig s3 over three fed batch cycles polarization tests were conducted using domestic wastewater fig 3 the maximum power density was 0 083 0 006 w m 2 which was 73 lower than that obtained in the small chamber mfc 0 304 0 009 w m 2 in wastewater the cathode potentials were similar in the abiotic and biotic tests in the 85 l and in the 28 ml reactors fig 3a and b there was a significant difference between the open circuit potential ocp of the biotic 0 32 0 00 v and abiotic 0 44 0 00 v tests for the small chamber but the cathode potentials matched well over the current density range relevant to operation of wastewater fed mfcs the anode performance was a factor in the reduced power production by the 85 l mfc compared to the 28 ml mfc for example after correction for the solution resistance the slope of the trendline from the linearization of the anode potential was 0 29 ω m2 in lc biotic test 3 6 higher than the 0 08 ω m2 from the sc biotic tests fig 3d fig s7 however there was a much larger reduction in the cathode performance change of 0 30 v from 0 37 0 04 v at ocp to 0 07 0 02 v at 0 46 0 03 a m 2 compared to that of the anodes change of 0 13 v from 0 31 0 01 v at ocp to 0 18 0 02 v at 0 46 0 03 a m 2 this larger difference for the cathode indicated that in this system the cathode was primarily limiting power production the decrease in the anode performance was likely a result of both increased size of the anodes and the cathode performance the anodes in the 85 l mfc were much longer and had a larger diameter than those in the small mfc which both could have contributed to higher overpotentials cheng et al 2014b dewan et al 2008 the increase in water pressure could also have decreased the performance of the cathodes particularly at the bottom of the mfc where the water pressure was the highest relative to those at the top of the reactor cheng et al 2014a this change in the cathode performance could have impacted performance of the anodes opposite to the cathode in the bottom of the large reactor the reduced active area of the cathode due to the metal frame could also have been a factor in reducing electrode performance as the metal frame accounted for 23 of the exposed projected area of the cathode fig 1 normalizing the power produced by only the active cathode area results in a power density of 0 10 w m 2 3 3 power production of the 85 l mfc fed domestic wastewater using 8 anodes to further examine the impact of the anodes on performance we conducted tests using 8 anodes instead of 22 anodes reducing the number of anodes decreased the anodic projected area by 58 from 6000 cm2 to 2500 cm2 but this decreased the maximum power density by only 27 from 0 083 0 006 w m 2 to 0 061 0 003 w m 2 based on the cathode projected area fig 4 power normalized to the projected anode area was 0 152 0 009 w m 2 which is consistent with previous results showing that using two electrodes with different projected areas improves the relative performance of the smaller electrode he et al 2016a oh and logan 2006 reducing the number of anodes resulted in slightly increased anode overpotentials for example the anode potential at the maximum power density was 0 177 0 002 v at 0 206 0 006 a m 2 normalized to the projected cathode area compared to 0 23 0 01 v at the highest current density of 0 250 0 006 a m 2 with 22 anodes thus maximizing full coverage of the cathodes by the anodes is needed to improve power production lanas and logan 2013 3 4 impact of the operation time on the mfc performance following polarization tests with the 8 anodes the impact of cathode fouling was examined by comparing the maximum power densities with the existing cathode which had been operated for 1 month to the same cathode that was cleaned to remove the surface biofilm and to a new cathode the maximum power density increased to 0 057 w m 2 after removing the biofilm which was 36 higher than that obtained prior to biofilm cleaning 0 042 w m 2 fig 5 when a new cathode was used the maximum power density was 0 064 w m 2 which was essentially the same as that originally obtained at the start of the experiments with 8 anodes the maximum power density decreased by 34 after one month of operation with 23 due to biofilm formation on the solution side of the cathode and the remaining 11 due to a combination of the precipitation of salts an et al 2017 and the adsorption of organic matter in the wastewater such as humic acids yang et al 2016 and metabolic by products such as extracellular polymers liu et al 2018 this decrease is only slightly lower than the 39 decrease in the performance previously reported for small chamber mfcs 28 ml volume 7 cm2 exposed cathode area after one month of operation rossi et al 2018 this fouled smaller cathode was shown to be successfully cleaned by soaking in a weakly acidic solution for several hours rossi et al 2017 zhang et al 2014a but this approach might not be practical for larger cathodes we are currently investigating easier ways to clean fouled cathodes no corrosion of the stainless steel structure was observed after one month of operation the decline in the cathode potentials further demonstrated that the main reason for the reduced performance of the mfc after one month of operation was the cathode performance for example at the maximum power density the potential of the new cathode was 0 19 v at 0 212 a m 2 compared to 0 07 v at 0 171 a m 2 for the used cathode after scraping off the biofilm from the solution side of the fouled cathode the electrode potential reached 0 16 v 0 200 a m 2 at the maximum power density which was an overall decrease of 11 compared to the new cathode 3 5 treatment performance based on cod removal the mfc with 8 or 22 anodes achieved similar cod removal efficiencies of 75 80 the presence of a higher number of anodes therefore did not increase the rate of cod removal although the number of anodes did impact the amount of cod converted to electricity the total cod decreased from 428 12 mg l 1 to 88 4 mg l 1 after 9 days in the 8 anode configuration with 22 anodes the cod decreased from 376 4 mg l 1 to 90 5 mg l 1 in 11 days the longer time needed to reduce the cod with 22 anodes was likely due to the higher oxygen content in the 8 anode configuration that might have increased the cod removal rate the coulombic efficiency logan et al 2006 ce was 27 when using 22 anodes but it decreased to 13 with 8 anodes the ce obtained here is essentially the same as the 22 previously achieved in small chamber mfc for domestic wastewater at low external resistance 100 ω zhang et al 2015 3 6 approaches to improve electrochemical performance increasing the sizes of the anodes and cathodes resulted in a decrease in the electrode performance despite maintaining the same catalyst and reactor configuration the greatest impact on performance was due to the cathode the power density of the large mfc was about one order of magnitude lower than that obtained in the small mfc 0 083 0 006 w m 2 vs 0 304 0 009 w m 2 fortunately there are a number of changes in the reactor or electrode design which could be made to improve performance it should be possible to further improve performance in the large mfc by connecting the anode arrays to two cathodes rather than one cathode as done in this study the test chamber used here was designed primarily to test hydraulic stability and electrochemical performance of an abiotic cathode and thus it was only possible to connect an array of anodes to a single cathode however we have previously demonstrated that connecting an anode array with two cathodes one on either side of the anode array increased the maximum power density by 62 in fed batch mfcs cheng and logan 2011 and by 39 53 for mfcs operated in continuous flow with a feed of domestic wastewater kim et al 2015 it might be possible to improve performance by changing the diameter or the fiber density of the brush anodes for the tests conducted here we used anodes with a diameter of 5 1 cm due to their availability from a previous mec reactor design cusick et al 2011 this larger diameter could have resulted in reduced power due to the average distance of the anode from the wire core to the cathode it was previously shown that reducing 2 5 cm diameter anodes to 0 8 cm improved power as long as the anode cathode spacing was not changed this reduction in size resulted in a 49 increase of the maximum power density from 0 690 w m 2 to 1 030 w m 2 using acetate as a substrate in continuous flow mfcs stager et al 2017 however additional tests with the very small brushes 0 8 cm with a wastewater feed resulted in unstable mfc performance while the use of 2 5 cm diameter brushes did not stager et al 2017 thus a decrease in brush size from 5 1 cm to 2 5 cm might improve mfc performance without adversely impacting stable power generation but only if the anode resistance is a substantial part of the overall internal resistance reducing the spacing between two deployed electrodes will reduce the ohmic drop and could increase power output and thus a further reduction in electrode spacing could also improve the performance if the ohmic losses are a main factor in power production li et al 2013 for example the solution resistance in the large chamber with a 3 5 cm electrode spacing was 0 47 ω which was 21 of the internal resistance of the reactor 2 19 ω reducing the spacing from 3 5 cm to 1 4 cm could further decrease the solution resistance by 60 to 0 19 ω and raise the maximum power density increasing the active area of the cathode and operating with lower hydraulic pressure could also improve its performance the stainless steel frame used here reduced the active area of the cathode by 23 and thus reducing the size of the frame relative to the cathode panels could help improve performance the hydraulic pressure against the cathode has been shown to reduce the performance of some cathodes likely due to the increased catalyst flooding with water ahn et al 2014 cheng et al 2014a further experiments should be conducted on the impact of hydraulic pressure on large scale cathodes by carrying out abiotic tests with different volumes of electrolyte in the chamber it might be possible to improve the cathode performance by making them more hydrophobic by varying binder content or diffusion layer porosities or by using a different type of diffusion layer yang et al 2015 it might also be possible to use different cathodes in the bottom of the chamber where the water pressure is greatest compared to cathodes at the top where water pressure is lower as previously noted a critical factor in scaling up mfcs is maintaining sufficient cathode surface area per volume cathode specific surface area as the reactor size is increased in order to achieve rapid cod removal and maintain a good volumetric power density logan et al 2015 the cathode specific surface area of the large chamber used in this study was only 7 3 m2 m 3 due to the original design factors for evaluating abiotic cathode performance this is much lower than the 25 m2 m 3 previously used in many mfc tests he et al 2016b logan et al 2015 thus the overall performance in terms of cod removal rate as well as power density will be increased in planned larger scale designs based on closer electrode spacing and connecting an anode array to two cathodes 4 conclusions a 6200 cm2 air cathode made of fifteen smaller cathodes welded to a single conductive metal sheet was examined in abiotic and biotic tests overall the performance of the large cathode 6200 cm2 decreased relative to the smaller cathodes 7 cm2 33 cm2 however the maximum power density of 0 083 0 006 w m 2 was comparable to that obtained in other larger scale aqueous catholyte mfcs but there was no catholyte or water aeration needed for our system thus the design provided an energy positive system due to passive oxygen transfer to the air cathode full coverage of the cathode by the brush anodes was needed as reducing the anode projected area from 6000 cm2 to 2500 cm2 decreased the maximum power density by 27 to 0 061 0 003 w m 2 these tests showed the first time that an air cathode could function in a large scale mfc at a high hydrostatic water pressure 85 cm water height several design factors were discussed that could lead to further improvements in overall power production such as closer electrode spacing and a more

bautista et al 2010 in addition hydrogen peroxide was a hazardous chemical which was limited in transportation and usage neyens et al 2004 hypochlorite e g sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite is a safety oxidant and it is less expensive compared with hydrogen peroxide persulfate and calcium peroxide in wastewater treatment hydrogen peroxide could be replaced by sodium hypochlorite in decolorization of aqueous solution with reaction in a wide range of ph values kałużna czaplińska et al 2010 fe2 naocl was utilized to degrade toluene diisocyanate in real wastewater and it was a cost effective process for chemical oxygen demand cod removal behin et al 2017 however to our best knowledge limited study has been conducted to use hypochlorous acid in sludge reduction preteatment on the other hand dewatered sludge can be utilized in agricultural lands without restrictions by a reduction of fecal coliforms in biosolids to below 1000 mpn most probable number g total solid according to the us epa navab daneshmand et al 2012 hypochlorous acid had a distinguishing effect as disinfectant for escherichia coli inactivation cho et al 2010 hence deep dewatering and innocuity of sludge cake can be achieved simultaneously under sludge conditioned by hypochlorous acid however the sodium hypochlorite was unstable and the solution of sodium hypochlorite was of low concentration and high alkalinity the ph of conditioning sludge would be increased beyond 7 after the addition of sodium hypochlorite moreover the sodium ions would disintegrate sludge flocs to deteriorate sludge dewatering performance sobeck and higgins 2002 therefore calcium hypochlorite instead of sodium hypochlorite was used in sludge pretreatment the oxidation ability of hypochlorous acid was weaker than fenton s reagent cho et al 2010 different oxidation intensity had various cell lysis mechanisms strong oxidant caused cell surface damage while weaker oxidant induced a destruction in inner cell components cho et al 2010 fan et al 2013 cells are the major component of organic constitute in sludge flocs sanin and vesilind 1994 the release of intracellular organic matter and intracellular bound water has significant effects on sludge dewaterability and stabilization he et al 2017 reported that intracellular water could be released by cell lysis under acidic conditions to enhance sludge dewaterability zhen et al 2018 reported that sulfate radicals damaged sludge cells which released intracellular materials and converted cell water to free water so as to improve water transport and separation he et al 2015 reported that cell lysis could release bound water after fenton like reaction reactive radicals had a very short half life e g hydroxyl radical of 10 9 s and sulfate radicals of 10 5 s finaud et al 2006 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 cell lysis caused by reactive radicals was dependent on the generation region of aops reaction however little is known about the accurate reaction region of aops in sludge pretreatment in addition sludge flocs have a three dimensional spatial structure eps was on the outside of cells and attached tightly with the cells surface christensen et al 2015 intracellular organic matter released by cell lysis might result in an increase of organic matter in eps layer high amount of organic matter in eps layer led to a worse dewatering performance yu et al 2017 hence the improvement of sludge dewaterability by cell lysis is a contradiction in previous literature in this study calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by ferrous iron was used as an advanced oxidation process in sludge conditioning the objectives of this study were to 1 determine optimal ph of initial sludge ferrous iron content and calcium hypochlorite content by using the response

jpn the pretreatment and stained processes of the sludge samples were as same as section 2 5 2 2 6 microbial enumeration a modified mpn method were used to detect total coliforms of sludge navab daneshmand et al 2012 colilert reagents were dissolved in 100 ml of pbs solution the concentration of nacl kcl na2hpo4 and kh2po4 were 80 2 14 4 and 2 4 g l respectively to reconstitute the medium 1

by a flexstation 3 microplate reader molecular devices usa 2 7 eps extraction and analysis an ultrasound method were utilized to extract different eps layers in this study yu et al 2008 50 ml sludge was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min and the centrifugation liquor was regarded as soluble eps s eps 0 05 w v nacl solution was used to resuspend the pellet in the centrifuge tube and shaked for 1 min the resuspended solution was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min and the centrifugation liquor was regarded as loosely bound eps lb eps the residual pellet was resuspended with aforementioned buffer and extracted after ultrasound at 20 khz for 10 min the resuspended solution was centrifuged at 8000 g for 15 min and the centrifugation liquor was regarded as tightly bound eps tb eps extracted solution was filtrated by 0 45 μm membrane before detection protein pn and polysaccharide ps were measured with the modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 and anthrone method chow et al 2008 respectively total organic carbon toc was detected by a multi n c 2100 toc analyzer analytik jena de three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem was utilized to analyse organic compounds by a fp 6500 fluorescence spectrometer jasco jpn the excitation range and emission range were 230 520 nm and 230 545 nm respectively xiao et al 2016 the sampling intervals scan rate and slit bandwidths were 5 nm 12 000 nm min and 5 nm respectively 2 8 fe3 extraction and analysis during sludge conditioning 10 ml sludge was extracted by a injector to a centrifuge tube without any delay the sludge was centrifugated at 8000 g for 10 s for separation fe3 in centrifugal liquor was regarded as fe3 content in filtrate the pellet was resuspended by 40 ml of 0 5m hcl and shaked at ambient temperatures for 4 h fe3 in extraction solution was regarded as fe3 content in sludge flocs the fe3 content was calculated and determined with 1 10 phenanthroline method rasmussen and nielsen 1996 2 9 other parameters water content of sludge was tested after being dried at 105 c for 12 h the measurement of specific resistance filtration srf and capillary suction time cst were followed by liu et al 2012 total solid ts volatile solid vs soluble chemical oxygen demand scod and ph were determined following the standard methods apha 1998 the particle sizes of sludge flocs were determined with a bt 9300st laser particle size analyzer bettersize china zhang et al 2014 the bound water content which was not freezed at 20 c was measured through a q2000 differential scanning calorimetry dsc analyzer ta usa katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 3 results and discussion 3 1 rsm optimization approximate functions for dependent variables were yielded through experimental results the fitting polynomial equations are shown in eqs 1 and 2 1 y1 49 22 0 98 x1 2 49 x2 0 69 x3 0 2 x1 x2 0 84 x1 x3 0 97 x2 x3 1 43 x1 2 1 58 x2 2 1 49 x3 2 2 y2 5 55 0 29 x1 1 07 x2 1 21 x3 where x1 x2 and x3 were the coded values of the dosages of sulfuric acid ferrous iron and calcium hypochlorite respectively the water content of dewatered cake wt can be predicted through eq 1 and is listed in table s1 the predicted data are in agreement with the corresponding experimental results the regression coefficient r2 model f value and value of prob f are 0 99 60 35 and 0 0001 respectively the ph values of the filtrate can be predicted through eq 2 and are listed in table s1 the predicted data are in agreement with experimental results the regression coefficient r2 model f value and value of prob f are 0 73 9 97 and 0 0018 respectively models of eqs 1 and 2 are significant which can forecast the composite conditioners on the dewatering performance and the ph of the filtrate the independent factors of x2 and x3 and the interaction effect of x1x3 and x2x3 have great influences on sludge dewaterability table s4 negative coefficients reveal that the increase dosages of ferrous iron and calcium hypochlorite can improve sludge dewatering performance without any acidification of sludge the optimization of ferrous iron dosage and calcium hypochlorite dosage are 106 1 and 234 5 mg g vs respectively table s5 three additional experiments were conducted under optimal dosages to validate the model accuracy the water content of the dewatered cake and the ph of the filtrate were 51 9 0 1 wt and 5 8 0 2 which confirmed the reliability of the model table s5 3 2 free radicals in contrast experiments oh is the main radical in fenton reaction and calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by ferrous iron fig s3 it is characterized by four split lines dmpo oh with 1 2 2 1 height ratio zhang et al 2015a b through the fitting curve the concentration of dmpo oh radicals can be calculated by the absolute number of spins in water as control group the concentration of dmpo oh radicals in fenton reaction is nearly four times higher than those measured by calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by ferrous iron 11 24 10 5 m vs 2 94 10 5 m table 4 in the conditioned sludge the concentration of dmpo oh radicals in fenton reaction is as high as 9 86 10 5 m however little dmpo oh radicals was determined in the sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 which indicated consumption of the radicals in the sludge the result revealed that fenton reaction had a better oxidation effect which could generate more hydroxyl radicals in the sludge conditioning compared with calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by ferrous iron calcium hypochlorite dissolved in water and then hypochlorite acid hocl rapidly generated eq 4 the rate of fenton reaction was 70 mol l s neyens and baeyens 2003 the reaction rate between fe2 and hocl was about three orders of magnitude faster than that between fe2 and h2o2 folkes et al 1995 according to thermodynamic arguments the reaction between fe2 and hocl could obtain oh eq 5 and cl eq 6 folkes et al 1995 few oh was determined in the sludge conditioned with fe2 ca clo 2 fig s3 eq 6 would be the main reaction cl rapidly combines with cl hocl and ocl so as to generate cl2 and clo eqs 7 9 fang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 cl2 and clo were oxidants with redox potentials of 2 0 and 1 5 1 8 v which were weaker than oh with 2 8 v redox potentials fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 hence the oxidation ability of fe2 ca clo 2 is weaker than that of fenton s reagent in addition hocl itself also had oxidation ability which relied on oxidation addition and electrophilic substitution reactions deborde and von 2008 3 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 4 ca clo 2 2h2o ca oh 2 2hocl 5 fe2 hocl fe3 oh cl 6 fe2 hocl fe3 oh cl cl cl k 1 k 2 cl 2 7 k1 6 5 109 m 1s 1 and k2 1 1 105 m 1s 1 8 cl hocl clo h cl k 3 109 m 1s 1 9 cl ocl clo cl k 8 2 109 m 1s 1 3 3 cell lysis of sludge ldh was in all cell cytoplasm the breakage of the cell membrane and increase in cell permeability resulted in the release of ldh guo et al 2015 hence the extracellular ldh could be regarded as an indicator for cell lysis he et al 2017 rs was used as control as shown in fig 2 a relative ldh release of sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 and by fe2 ca clo 2 were as high as 971 and 631 respectively relative ldh release of sludge samples conditioned by fe2 h2o2 and fenton s reagent individually changed very slightly which were 110 77 and 40 respectively live dead cells fractions of rs and conditioned sludge are further confirmed the difference of cell lysis fig 2b living cell fraction of sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 and by fe2 ca clo 2 are as low as undetectable and 18 3 respectively the reason for lower living cell fraction of sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 compared with sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 was that a portion of ca clo 2 was consumed by fe2 eqs 5 and 6 living cell fraction of sludge conditioned by fe2 h2o2 and fenton reagent individually were as high as 79 1 77 7 and 84 3 respectively sludge flocs had a three dimensional spatial structure cells and eps constituted organic matter of sludge flocs eps existed in outside of cells and filled in sludge flocs sheng et al 2010 the distribution of live dead cells in the rs and the conditioning sludge could be directly observed by a clsm fig 3 through the live dead cells distribution reaction region of different chemical conditioning used in sludge pretreatment could be investigated no living cell fraction of sludge conditioned by calcium hypochlorite revealed that hypochlorous acid could penetrate through eps and react with living cells in sludge flocs hypochlorous acid was a weaker oxidant and therefore the diffusive transport through the protective barrier was less retarded by reaction with cell wall components it would attack inner cell components including intracellular enzyme which resulted in cell inactivation cho et al 2010 in contrast hydroxyl radicals could react with lipid protein and lipid in the surface of cell leading to a large scale cleavage of the cell walls yu et al 2018 in this study fenton s reagent generated more hydroxyl radicals compared with calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by fe2 table 4 but few cells in sludge flocs were damaged the result revealed that hydroxyl radicals generated by fenton s reagent did not react with cells of sludge flocs fenton reaction only happened at surface and outside of sludge flocs such as eps layer and liquid phase 3 4 microbial inactivation as shown in fig 4 a total coliforms decreased significantly after sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 and by fe2 ca clo 2 which were 419 and 270 mpn g ts respectively much lower than the epa stipulation of class a 1000 mpn g ts in contrast total coliforms of the sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent were 1099 mpn g ts total coliforms of sludge conditioned by fe2 alone and by h2o2 alone changed very slightly compared with rs 7194 mpn g ts the sludge conditined by fe2 ca clo 2 had a fast inactivation rate total coliforms reached the detection limits 141 mpn g ts at 10 s after calcium hypochlorite addition fig 4b the result revealed that hypochlorous acid had an excellent sterilization ability sludge was rapidly stabilized after conditioned by calcium hypochlorite alone which could be used as land utilization the sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent had a progressive inactivation effect the mpn values for total coliforms were reduced from 7194 mpn g ts to 3090 mpn g ts at 10 s and 1288 mpn g ts at 5 min at the initial stage of fenton reaction the inactivation effect was induced by the generation of hydroxyl radical latifi et al 2009 because the molar ratio of h2o2 to fe2 was 1 32 table 3 h2o2 rapidly decomposed at the beginning of fenton reaction hence the inactivation effect after 1 min was caused by acidic environment after fenton reaction ph 3 6 in this study yu et al 2016 3 5 particle size flocs sizes of the rs and the sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 h2o2 and fe2 ca clo 2 individually were similar with each other which were 57 3 56 8 56 5 56 1 and 56 7 μm respectively fig s4 fenton reaction could effectively decrease particle size of sludge flocs 50 1 μm of d50 which was similar to other studies liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a b hydroxyl radicals had significant oxidation effect to degrade the organics from large molecular sizes into small ones tony et al 2008 their generation region and reaction region were at surface of sludge flocs table 4 and fig s4 hence the oxidation effect of sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent could destruct the eps structure and break sludge flocs into smaller ones sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 generated few hydroxyl radicals which had less influence on particle size compared with rs 56 7 μm vs 57 3 μm of d50 cell lysis of sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 and by fe2 ca clo 2 did not apparently reduce particle size of sludge flocs the eps structure was not destructed by hypochlorous acid oxidation on the other hand eps was very important for stabilization of sludge flocs structure although cells in sludge flocs were destructed and intracellular organic matter was released the eps could serve as flexible skeleton to maintain stabilization of sludge flocs structure 3 6 extracellular polymeric substances the toc contents of all eps layers of sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 were much higher than those of rs and the other conditioned sludge fig 5 a hypochlorous acid induced cell lysis of sludge which released intracellular organic matter to filtrate and all eps layers s eps lb eps and tb eps s eps of sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent was larger than sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 which was consistent with the result of table 4 more hydroxyl radicals were generated in eps layer so portion of eps was degraded and dissolved in liquid the distributions of pn and ps are consistent with those of toc fig 5b intracellular pn and ps release of sludge conditioned by calcium hypochlorite resulted in more extraction of all eps layers natural organic matters could be characterized by 3d eem with fluorescent response zhang et al 2017 four fluorescent peaks were determined in all eps layers of the rs and the conditioned sludge tryptopha protein λex em 280 305 aromatic protein λex em 230 305 fulvic acid λex em 260 460 and humic acid λex em 325 390 table 5 chen et al 2003 tryptopha protein and aromatic protein in s eps and lb eps fractions of rs significantly reduced after the sludge was conditioned by calcium hypochlorite alone and by fenton s reagent alone tryptophan like proteins were unstable and mainly originated from indole group zhang et al 2015a b it could be readily damaged by hypochlorite acid and hydroxyl radical the increase of total protein content in filtrate fig 5b and the reduction of fluorescent intensities table 5 indicated that the release and degradation were synchronous zhang et al 2015a b the difference was that one of the protein was released from intracellular organics and the other one was released from eps in addition the fluorescent intensities of fulvic acid and humic acid in all eps layers of sludge conditioned by calcium hypochlorite were more than those of the rs and the other conditioned sludge the humic acids and fulvic acids had many high molecular fractions and were more stable to aops than protein like substances zhang et al 2016 cell lysis resulted in the increase of fulvic acid and humic acid in all eps layers of sludge 3 7 fe3 content distribution in sludge flocs and filtrate fe3 content of sludge flocs conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 rapidly increased from 0 12 to 47 65 mg g ds in 10 s and further increased to 49 6 mg g ds in 30 min fig 6 fe3 content in filtrate of sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 was low which was 29 2 mg l in 10 s and 7 5 mg l in 30 min in contrast fe3 content of sludge flocs conditioned by fenton s reagent was less than that of conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 which increased from 0 12 to 35 67 mg g ds in 10 s and further increased to 41 97 mg g ds in 30 min fe3 content in filtrate decreased from 129 2 mg l in 10 s 31 mg l in 30 min the result revealed that both calcium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide had a rapid reaction rate with fe2 more than 90 of ferrous iron in sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 and more than 75 of fe2 in sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent were oxidized to fe3 in 10 s in addition intracellular organic matter such as protein like substance released to eps layers provided many affinity sites for ferric iron chen et al 2015 yu et al 2008 more ferric iron content in sludge flocs resulted in better coagulation effects yu et al 2016 which caused double electric layer compression and sludge flocs densification niu et al 2013 3 8 dewatering performance the second batch of rs had more organic matter content than the first batch of rs which caused a worse sludge dewaterability as shown in fig 7 a the water content of the dewatered cake decreased from 86 1 wt of rs to 64 9 wt of the sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 and decreased to 58 2 wt of the sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent the water content of the dewatered cake conditioned by fe2 by ca clo 2 and by h2o2 alone were 80 9 86 4 and 83 9 wt respectively it revealed that individual utilization of fe2 calcium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide had little effect to improve sludge dewatering performance the dsc endothermic curves are shown in fig s5 the bound water content of sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 and by fenton s reagent could reduce from 2 71 g g ds of rs to 1 56 and 1 27 g g ds fig 7a sludge conditioned by fe2 by ca clo 2 and by h2o2 alone reduce few bound water content which are 2 16 2 85 and 2 26 g g ds respectively the bound water content has the same trend with the sludge dewaterability fig 7a the sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 has a remarkable ability of cell lysis but the bound water content was higher than rs 2 85 vs 2 71 g g ds this result was inconsistent with he et al 2015 who reported that cell lysis could release bound water after fenton like reaction the cst and srf of the rs were 172 7 s and 1 9 1013 m kg respectively fig 7b sludge conditioned individually by fe2 ca clo 2 and fenton s reagent dramatically reduced cst and srf to 29 3 s and 0 1 1013 m kg and 22 3 s and 0 1 1013 m kg respectively individual addition of ferrous iron barely decreased cst and srf to 108 2 s and 1 5 1013 m kg fig 7b in addition individual usage of calcium hypochlorite has a bad dewatering performance with the cst and srf of conditioning sludge reaching 295 5 s and 2 7 1013 m kg more eps content resulted in worse dewaterability liang et al 2015 yu et al 2017 many hydrophilic groups from intracellular protein such as hydroxyl phosphoric and carboxyl groups exposed in sludge flocs and attached more bound water hence the release of intracellular organic matter of sludge conditioned by hypochlorite acid resulted in worse dewaterability of sludge 3 9 mechanism of different oxidation effects in sludge conditioning fenton s reagent oxidation large amount of hydroxyl radicals with high reactivity and short half life 10 9 s were generated by fenton s reagent finaud et al 2006 in sludge conditioning process the hydroxyl radicals reacted with eps layer at surface of sludge flocs fractional eps were degraded into dissolved organics and sludge flocs were disintegrated into small ones fig 8 cells in sludge flocs were integrated ferrous iron was oxidized to ferric iron and then ferric iron was adsorbed to sludge flocs by electrostatic adsorption a good dewatering performance was achieved this oxidation effect could be referred to extracellular oxidation in sludge pretreatment hypochlorite oxidation less amount of hydroxyl radicals were generated in calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by ferrous iron its oxidation effect was mainly dependent on hypochlorite acid which could permeate through eps layer and attack inner cell components resulting in cell lysis fig 8 sludge conditioned by hypochlorite acid had a significant effect on total coliforms inactivation the flocs size of sludge did not decrease intracellular organic matter released to filtrate and all portions of eps region resulting in a worse dewatering performance even after re coagulation by ferric iron in this oxidation the eps structure was not destructed and further kept the stabilization of sludge flocs structure this oxidation effect could be referred to intracellular oxidation in sludge pretreatment 4 conclusion both intracellular and extracellular oxidation of sludge with different oxidants hocl vs h2o2 catalyzed by ferrous iron were investigated in waste activated sludge dewatering higher amount of living cells 84 3 and hydroxyl radicals 9 86 10 5 m and more fragmentized sludge flocs particle sizes of d50 was 50 1 vs 57 3 μm of rs were detected in sludge conditioned by fe2 h2o2 which implied that fenton reaction mainly happened at surface and outside of sludge flocs such as eps layer and liquid phase hence it could be regarded as extracellular oxidation where hydroxyl radicals reacted with eps layer from the outer layers of sludge flocs to disintegrate the large flocs into smaller fractions while keeping cells in flocs viable fewer living cells undetectable fewer amount of hydroxyl radicals undetectable in sludge and more integrated sludge flocs particle size of d50 was 56 1 vs 57 3 μm of rs were determined in sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 where hypochlorite acid permeated through eps layer and attacked from the inner cell components to lyse cells although cells in sludge flocs were destructed and intracellular organic matters were released eps structures were maintained and served as flexible skeleton to hold sludge flocs its stable form intracellular organic matter released to the filtrate and the eps structures resulting in worse dewatering performance compared with sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent besides the sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 had a fast inactivation rate and total coliforms reached their detection limits at 10 s acknowledgments the research was supported by national key research and development program of china 2017yfc0703103 the national natural science

19183,cell lysis in sludge pretreatment by advanced oxidation process aop has a great effect on sludge dewaterability cell lysis caused by reactive radicals e g hydroxyl radical was dependent on the reaction site of aop however little is known about the accurate radical generation site of aop in sludge pretreatment in this study two kinds of oxidation behaviors from different oxidants hocl vs h2o2 catalyzed by ferrous iron were comparatively investigated higher amount of living cells 84 3 and hydroxyl radicals 9 86 10 5 m and more fragmentized sludge flocs particle sizes of d50 was 50 1 vs 57 3 μm of rs were detected in sludge conditioned by fe2 h2o2 which implied that fenton reaction mainly happened at surface and outside of sludge flocs such as eps layer and liquid phase thus it could be regarded as extracellular oxidation fewer living cells undetectable fewer amount of hydroxyl radicals undetectable in sludge and more integrated sludge flocs particle size of d50 was 56 1 vs 57 3 μm of rs were determined in sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 hence it could be regarded as intracellular oxidation in addition sludge pretreatment based on fe2 ca clo 2 could achieve simultaneous deep dewatering performance and total coliforms inactivation based on response surface methodology the optimal dosages of fe2 and ca clo 2 were proposed as 106 1 and 234 5 mg g volatile solids respectively without any acidification of sludge under these optimal dosages the water content of dewatered sludge cake was 51 9 0 1 wt and the ph of the final filtrate was 5 8 0 2 total coliforms of sludge could be inactivated in 10 s after fe2 ca clo 2 addition graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge deep dewatering hypochlorite acid oxidation intensity extracellular and intracellular oxidation cell lysis 1 introduction waste activated sludge dewatering is an effective approach to reduce the cost of subsequential sludge treatment and disposal in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps cai et al 2018 kuriqi 2014 2016 however deep dewatering of sludge requires pretreatment to destruct the rigid structures of cell walls and extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge flocs converting the bound water to free water kim et al 2016 zhen et al 2018 for decades many sludge pretreatment methods including freezing sun et al 2017 ultrasonication and acidification cai et al 2018 hydrothermal process wang et al 2017 low boiling point solvents he et al 2014 xu et al 2018 advanced oxidation processes aops xiao et al 2017 zhen et al 2018 electrosmosis dewatering navab daneshmand et al 2012 and enhanced coagulation zhang et al 2017 have been developed fenton s reagent was commomly used to enhance sludge dewatering performance by degrading eps liang et al 2015 mo et al 2015 in our previous studies no initial acidification was found necessary in fenton conditioning yu et al 2016 hydroxyl radicals oh were generated by a mixture of ferrous iron and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and reacted non selectively with most organic compounds bokare and choi 2014 when treating with high organic loads the consumption of hydrogen peroxide was a main economic drawback bautista et al 2010 in addition hydrogen peroxide was a hazardous chemical which was limited in transportation and usage neyens et al 2004 hypochlorite e g sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite is a safety oxidant and it is less expensive compared with hydrogen peroxide persulfate and calcium peroxide in wastewater treatment hydrogen peroxide could be replaced by sodium hypochlorite in decolorization of aqueous solution with reaction in a wide range of ph values kałużna czaplińska et al 2010 fe2 naocl was utilized to degrade toluene diisocyanate in real wastewater and it was a cost effective process for chemical oxygen demand cod removal behin et al 2017 however to our best knowledge limited study has been conducted to use hypochlorous acid in sludge reduction preteatment on the other hand dewatered sludge can be utilized in agricultural lands without restrictions by a reduction of fecal coliforms in biosolids to below 1000 mpn most probable number g total solid according to the us epa navab daneshmand et al 2012 hypochlorous acid had a distinguishing effect as disinfectant for escherichia coli inactivation cho et al 2010 hence deep dewatering and innocuity of sludge cake can be achieved simultaneously under sludge conditioned by hypochlorous acid however the sodium hypochlorite was unstable and the solution of sodium hypochlorite was of low concentration and high alkalinity the ph of conditioning sludge would be increased beyond 7 after the addition of sodium hypochlorite moreover the sodium ions would disintegrate sludge flocs to deteriorate sludge dewatering performance sobeck and higgins 2002 therefore calcium hypochlorite instead of sodium hypochlorite was used in sludge pretreatment the oxidation ability of hypochlorous acid was weaker than fenton s reagent cho et al 2010 different oxidation intensity had various cell lysis mechanisms strong oxidant caused cell surface damage while weaker oxidant induced a destruction in inner cell components cho et al 2010 fan et al 2013 cells are the major component of organic constitute in sludge flocs sanin and vesilind 1994 the release of intracellular organic matter and intracellular bound water has significant effects on sludge dewaterability and stabilization he et al 2017 reported that intracellular water could be released by cell lysis under acidic conditions to enhance sludge dewaterability zhen et al 2018 reported that sulfate radicals damaged sludge cells which released intracellular materials and converted cell water to free water so as to improve water transport and separation he et al 2015 reported that cell lysis could release bound water after fenton like reaction reactive radicals had a very short half life e g hydroxyl radical of 10 9 s and sulfate radicals of 10 5 s finaud et al 2006 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 cell lysis caused by reactive radicals was dependent on the generation region of aops reaction however little is known about the accurate reaction region of aops in sludge pretreatment in addition sludge flocs have a three dimensional spatial structure eps was on the outside of cells and attached tightly with the cells surface christensen et al 2015 intracellular organic matter released by cell lysis might result in an increase of organic matter in eps layer high amount of organic matter in eps layer led to a worse dewatering performance yu et al 2017 hence the improvement of sludge dewaterability by cell lysis is a contradiction in previous literature in this study calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by ferrous iron was used as an advanced oxidation process in sludge conditioning the objectives of this study were to 1 determine optimal ph of initial sludge ferrous iron content and calcium hypochlorite content by using the response surface methodology rsm and 2 compare intracellular oxidation fe2 ca clo 2 and extracellular oxidation fenton s reagent through oxidation intensity oxidation region physicochemical properties and

jpn the pretreatment and stained processes of the sludge samples were as same as section 2 5 2 2 6 microbial enumeration a modified mpn method were used to detect total coliforms of sludge navab daneshmand et al 2012 colilert reagents were dissolved in 100 ml of pbs solution the concentration of nacl kcl na2hpo4 and kh2po4 were 80 2 14 4 and 2 4 g l respectively to reconstitute the medium 1

by a flexstation 3 microplate reader molecular devices usa 2 7 eps extraction and analysis an ultrasound method were utilized to extract different eps layers in this study yu et al 2008 50 ml sludge was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min and the centrifugation liquor was regarded as soluble eps s eps 0 05 w v nacl solution was used to resuspend the pellet in the centrifuge tube and shaked for 1 min the resuspended solution was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min and the centrifugation liquor was regarded as loosely bound eps lb eps the residual pellet was resuspended with aforementioned buffer and extracted after ultrasound at 20 khz for 10 min the resuspended solution was centrifuged at 8000 g for 15 min and the centrifugation liquor was regarded as tightly bound eps tb eps extracted solution was filtrated by 0 45 μm membrane before detection protein pn and polysaccharide ps were measured with the modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 and anthrone method chow et al 2008 respectively total organic carbon toc was detected by a multi n c 2100 toc analyzer analytik jena de three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem was utilized to analyse organic compounds by a fp 6500 fluorescence spectrometer jasco jpn the excitation range and emission range were 230 520 nm and 230 545 nm respectively xiao et al 2016 the sampling intervals scan rate and slit bandwidths were 5 nm 12 000 nm min and 5 nm respectively 2 8 fe3 extraction and analysis during sludge conditioning 10 ml sludge was extracted by a injector to a centrifuge tube without any delay the sludge was centrifugated at 8000 g for 10 s for separation fe3 in centrifugal liquor was regarded as fe3 content in filtrate the pellet was resuspended by 40 ml of 0 5m hcl and shaked at ambient temperatures for 4 h fe3 in extraction solution was regarded as fe3 content in sludge flocs the fe3 content was calculated and determined with 1 10 phenanthroline method rasmussen and nielsen 1996 2 9 other parameters water content of sludge was tested after being dried at 105 c for 12 h the measurement of specific resistance filtration srf and capillary suction time cst were followed by liu et al 2012 total solid ts volatile solid vs soluble chemical oxygen demand scod and ph were determined following the standard methods apha 1998 the particle sizes of sludge flocs were determined with a bt 9300st laser particle size analyzer bettersize china zhang et al 2014 the bound water content which was not freezed at 20 c was measured through a q2000 differential scanning calorimetry dsc analyzer ta usa katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 3 results and discussion 3 1 rsm optimization approximate functions for dependent variables were yielded through experimental results the fitting polynomial equations are shown in eqs 1 and 2 1 y1 49 22 0 98 x1 2 49 x2 0 69 x3 0 2 x1 x2 0 84 x1 x3 0 97 x2 x3 1 43 x1 2 1 58 x2 2 1 49 x3 2 2 y2 5 55 0 29 x1 1 07 x2 1 21 x3 where x1 x2 and x3 were the coded values of the dosages of sulfuric acid ferrous iron and calcium hypochlorite respectively the water content of dewatered cake wt can be predicted through eq 1 and is listed in table s1 the predicted data are in agreement with the corresponding experimental results the regression coefficient r2 model f value and value of prob f are 0 99 60 35 and 0 0001 respectively the ph values of the filtrate can be predicted through eq 2 and are listed in table s1 the predicted data are in agreement with experimental results the regression coefficient r2 model f value and value of prob f are 0 73 9 97 and 0 0018 respectively models of eqs 1 and 2 are significant which can forecast the composite conditioners on the dewatering performance and the ph of the filtrate the independent factors of x2 and x3 and the interaction effect of x1x3 and x2x3 have great influences on sludge dewaterability table s4 negative coefficients reveal that the increase dosages of ferrous iron and calcium hypochlorite can improve sludge dewatering performance without any acidification of sludge the optimization of ferrous iron dosage and calcium hypochlorite dosage are 106 1 and 234 5 mg g vs respectively table s5 three additional experiments were conducted under optimal dosages to validate the model accuracy the water content of the dewatered cake and the ph of the filtrate were 51 9 0 1 wt and 5 8 0 2 which confirmed the reliability of the model table s5 3 2 free radicals in contrast experiments oh is the main radical in fenton reaction and calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by ferrous iron fig s3 it is characterized by four split lines dmpo oh with 1 2 2 1 height ratio zhang et al 2015a b through the fitting curve the concentration of dmpo oh radicals can be calculated by the absolute number of spins in water as control group the concentration of dmpo oh radicals in fenton reaction is nearly four times higher than those measured by calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by ferrous iron 11 24 10 5 m vs 2 94 10 5 m table 4 in the conditioned sludge the concentration of dmpo oh radicals in fenton reaction is as high as 9 86 10 5 m however little dmpo oh radicals was determined in the sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 which indicated consumption of the radicals in the sludge the result revealed that fenton reaction had a better oxidation effect which could generate more hydroxyl radicals in the sludge conditioning compared with calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by ferrous iron calcium hypochlorite dissolved in water and then hypochlorite acid hocl rapidly generated eq 4 the rate of fenton reaction was 70 mol l s neyens and baeyens 2003 the reaction rate between fe2 and hocl was about three orders of magnitude faster than that between fe2 and h2o2 folkes et al 1995 according to thermodynamic arguments the reaction between fe2 and hocl could obtain oh eq 5 and cl eq 6 folkes et al 1995 few oh was determined in the sludge conditioned with fe2 ca clo 2 fig s3 eq 6 would be the main reaction cl rapidly combines with cl hocl and ocl so as to generate cl2 and clo eqs 7 9 fang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 cl2 and clo were oxidants with redox potentials of 2 0 and 1 5 1 8 v which were weaker than oh with 2 8 v redox potentials fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 hence the oxidation ability of fe2 ca clo 2 is weaker than that of fenton s reagent in addition hocl itself also had oxidation ability which relied on oxidation addition and electrophilic substitution reactions deborde and von 2008 3 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 4 ca clo 2 2h2o ca oh 2 2hocl 5 fe2 hocl fe3 oh cl 6 fe2 hocl fe3 oh cl cl cl k 1 k 2 cl 2 7 k1 6 5 109 m 1s 1 and k2 1 1 105 m 1s 1 8 cl hocl clo h cl k 3 109 m 1s 1 9 cl ocl clo cl k 8 2 109 m 1s 1 3 3 cell lysis of sludge ldh was in all cell cytoplasm the breakage of the cell membrane and increase in cell permeability resulted in the release of ldh guo et al 2015 hence the extracellular ldh could be regarded as an indicator for cell lysis he et al 2017 rs was used as control as shown in fig 2 a relative ldh release of sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 and by fe2 ca clo 2 were as high as 971 and 631 respectively relative ldh release of sludge samples conditioned by fe2 h2o2 and fenton s reagent individually changed very slightly which were 110 77 and 40 respectively live dead cells fractions of rs and conditioned sludge are further confirmed the difference of cell lysis fig 2b living cell fraction of sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 and by fe2 ca clo 2 are as low as undetectable and 18 3 respectively the reason for lower living cell fraction of sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 compared with sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 was that a portion of ca clo 2 was consumed by fe2 eqs 5 and 6 living cell fraction of sludge conditioned by fe2 h2o2 and fenton reagent individually were as high as 79 1 77 7 and 84 3 respectively sludge flocs had a three dimensional spatial structure cells and eps constituted organic matter of sludge flocs eps existed in outside of cells and filled in sludge flocs sheng et al 2010 the distribution of live dead cells in the rs and the conditioning sludge could be directly observed by a clsm fig 3 through the live dead cells distribution reaction region of different chemical conditioning used in sludge pretreatment could be investigated no living cell fraction of sludge conditioned by calcium hypochlorite revealed that hypochlorous acid could penetrate through eps and react with living cells in sludge flocs hypochlorous acid was a weaker oxidant and therefore the diffusive transport through the protective barrier was less retarded by reaction with cell wall components it would attack inner cell components including intracellular enzyme which resulted in cell inactivation cho et al 2010 in contrast hydroxyl radicals could react with lipid protein and lipid in the surface of cell leading to a large scale cleavage of the cell walls yu et al 2018 in this study fenton s reagent generated more hydroxyl radicals compared with calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by fe2 table 4 but few cells in sludge flocs were damaged the result revealed that hydroxyl radicals generated by fenton s reagent did not react with cells of sludge flocs fenton reaction only happened at surface and outside of sludge flocs such as eps layer and liquid phase 3 4 microbial inactivation as shown in fig 4 a total coliforms decreased significantly after sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 and by fe2 ca clo 2 which were 419 and 270 mpn g ts respectively much lower than the epa stipulation of class a 1000 mpn g ts in contrast total coliforms of the sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent were 1099 mpn g ts total coliforms of sludge conditioned by fe2 alone and by h2o2 alone changed very slightly compared with rs 7194 mpn g ts the sludge conditined by fe2 ca clo 2 had a fast inactivation rate total coliforms reached the detection limits 141 mpn g ts at 10 s after calcium hypochlorite addition fig 4b the result revealed that hypochlorous acid had an excellent sterilization ability sludge was rapidly stabilized after conditioned by calcium hypochlorite alone which could be used as land utilization the sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent had a progressive inactivation effect the mpn values for total coliforms were reduced from 7194 mpn g ts to 3090 mpn g ts at 10 s and 1288 mpn g ts at 5 min at the initial stage of fenton reaction the inactivation effect was induced by the generation of hydroxyl radical latifi et al 2009 because the molar ratio of h2o2 to fe2 was 1 32 table 3 h2o2 rapidly decomposed at the beginning of fenton reaction hence the inactivation effect after 1 min was caused by acidic environment after fenton reaction ph 3 6 in this study yu et al 2016 3 5 particle size flocs sizes of the rs and the sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 h2o2 and fe2 ca clo 2 individually were similar with each other which were 57 3 56 8 56 5 56 1 and 56 7 μm respectively fig s4 fenton reaction could effectively decrease particle size of sludge flocs 50 1 μm of d50 which was similar to other studies liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a b hydroxyl radicals had significant oxidation effect to degrade the organics from large molecular sizes into small ones tony et al 2008 their generation region and reaction region were at surface of sludge flocs table 4 and fig s4 hence the oxidation effect of sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent could destruct the eps structure and break sludge flocs into smaller ones sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 generated few hydroxyl radicals which had less influence on particle size compared with rs 56 7 μm vs 57 3 μm of d50 cell lysis of sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 and by fe2 ca clo 2 did not apparently reduce particle size of sludge flocs the eps structure was not destructed by hypochlorous acid oxidation on the other hand eps was very important for stabilization of sludge flocs structure although cells in sludge flocs were destructed and intracellular organic matter was released the eps could serve as flexible skeleton to maintain stabilization of sludge flocs structure 3 6 extracellular polymeric substances the toc contents of all eps layers of sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 were much higher than those of rs and the other conditioned sludge fig 5 a hypochlorous acid induced cell lysis of sludge which released intracellular organic matter to filtrate and all eps layers s eps lb eps and tb eps s eps of sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent was larger than sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 which was consistent with the result of table 4 more hydroxyl radicals were generated in eps layer so portion of eps was degraded and dissolved in liquid the distributions of pn and ps are consistent with those of toc fig 5b intracellular pn and ps release of sludge conditioned by calcium hypochlorite resulted in more extraction of all eps layers natural organic matters could be characterized by 3d eem with fluorescent response zhang et al 2017 four fluorescent peaks were determined in all eps layers of the rs and the conditioned sludge tryptopha protein λex em 280 305 aromatic protein λex em 230 305 fulvic acid λex em 260 460 and humic acid λex em 325 390 table 5 chen et al 2003 tryptopha protein and aromatic protein in s eps and lb eps fractions of rs significantly reduced after the sludge was conditioned by calcium hypochlorite alone and by fenton s reagent alone tryptophan like proteins were unstable and mainly originated from indole group zhang et al 2015a b it could be readily damaged by hypochlorite acid and hydroxyl radical the increase of total protein content in filtrate fig 5b and the reduction of fluorescent intensities table 5 indicated that the release and degradation were synchronous zhang et al 2015a b the difference was that one of the protein was released from intracellular organics and the other one was released from eps in addition the fluorescent intensities of fulvic acid and humic acid in all eps layers of sludge conditioned by calcium hypochlorite were more than those of the rs and the other conditioned sludge the humic acids and fulvic acids had many high molecular fractions and were more stable to aops than protein like substances zhang et al 2016 cell lysis resulted in the increase of fulvic acid and humic acid in all eps layers of sludge 3 7 fe3 content distribution in sludge flocs and filtrate fe3 content of sludge flocs conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 rapidly increased from 0 12 to 47 65 mg g ds in 10 s and further increased to 49 6 mg g ds in 30 min fig 6 fe3 content in filtrate of sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 was low which was 29 2 mg l in 10 s and 7 5 mg l in 30 min in contrast fe3 content of sludge flocs conditioned by fenton s reagent was less than that of conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 which increased from 0 12 to 35 67 mg g ds in 10 s and further increased to 41 97 mg g ds in 30 min fe3 content in filtrate decreased from 129 2 mg l in 10 s 31 mg l in 30 min the result revealed that both calcium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide had a rapid reaction rate with fe2 more than 90 of ferrous iron in sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 and more than 75 of fe2 in sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent were oxidized to fe3 in 10 s in addition intracellular organic matter such as protein like substance released to eps layers provided many affinity sites for ferric iron chen et al 2015 yu et al 2008 more ferric iron content in sludge flocs resulted in better coagulation effects yu et al 2016 which caused double electric layer compression and sludge flocs densification niu et al 2013 3 8 dewatering performance the second batch of rs had more organic matter content than the first batch of rs which caused a worse sludge dewaterability as shown in fig 7 a the water content of the dewatered cake decreased from 86 1 wt of rs to 64 9 wt of the sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 and decreased to 58 2 wt of the sludge conditioned by fenton s reagent the water content of the dewatered cake conditioned by fe2 by ca clo 2 and by h2o2 alone were 80 9 86 4 and 83 9 wt respectively it revealed that individual utilization of fe2 calcium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide had little effect to improve sludge dewatering performance the dsc endothermic curves are shown in fig s5 the bound water content of sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 and by fenton s reagent could reduce from 2 71 g g ds of rs to 1 56 and 1 27 g g ds fig 7a sludge conditioned by fe2 by ca clo 2 and by h2o2 alone reduce few bound water content which are 2 16 2 85 and 2 26 g g ds respectively the bound water content has the same trend with the sludge dewaterability fig 7a the sludge conditioned by ca clo 2 has a remarkable ability of cell lysis but the bound water content was higher than rs 2 85 vs 2 71 g g ds this result was inconsistent with he et al 2015 who reported that cell lysis could release bound water after fenton like reaction the cst and srf of the rs were 172 7 s and 1 9 1013 m kg respectively fig 7b sludge conditioned individually by fe2 ca clo 2 and fenton s reagent dramatically reduced cst and srf to 29 3 s and 0 1 1013 m kg and 22 3 s and 0 1 1013 m kg respectively individual addition of ferrous iron barely decreased cst and srf to 108 2 s and 1 5 1013 m kg fig 7b in addition individual usage of calcium hypochlorite has a bad dewatering performance with the cst and srf of conditioning sludge reaching 295 5 s and 2 7 1013 m kg more eps content resulted in worse dewaterability liang et al 2015 yu et al 2017 many hydrophilic groups from intracellular protein such as hydroxyl phosphoric and carboxyl groups exposed in sludge flocs and attached more bound water hence the release of intracellular organic matter of sludge conditioned by hypochlorite acid resulted in worse dewaterability of sludge 3 9 mechanism of different oxidation effects in sludge conditioning fenton s reagent oxidation large amount of hydroxyl radicals with high reactivity and short half life 10 9 s were generated by fenton s reagent finaud et al 2006 in sludge conditioning process the hydroxyl radicals reacted with eps layer at surface of sludge flocs fractional eps were degraded into dissolved organics and sludge flocs were disintegrated into small ones fig 8 cells in sludge flocs were integrated ferrous iron was oxidized to ferric iron and then ferric iron was adsorbed to sludge flocs by electrostatic adsorption a good dewatering performance was achieved this oxidation effect could be referred to extracellular oxidation in sludge pretreatment hypochlorite oxidation less amount of hydroxyl radicals were generated in calcium hypochlorite catalyzed by ferrous iron its oxidation effect was mainly dependent on hypochlorite acid which could permeate through eps layer and attack inner cell components resulting in cell lysis fig 8 sludge conditioned by hypochlorite acid had a significant effect on total coliforms inactivation the flocs size of sludge did not decrease intracellular organic matter released to filtrate and all portions of eps region resulting in a worse dewatering performance even after re coagulation by ferric iron in this oxidation the eps structure was not destructed and further kept the stabilization of sludge flocs structure this oxidation effect could be referred to intracellular oxidation in sludge pretreatment 4 conclusion both intracellular and extracellular oxidation of sludge with different oxidants hocl vs h2o2 catalyzed by ferrous iron were investigated in waste activated sludge dewatering higher amount of living cells 84 3 and hydroxyl radicals 9 86 10 5 m and more fragmentized sludge flocs particle sizes of d50 was 50 1 vs 57 3 μm of rs were detected in sludge conditioned by fe2 h2o2 which implied that fenton reaction mainly happened at surface and outside of sludge flocs such as eps layer and liquid phase hence it could be regarded as extracellular oxidation where hydroxyl radicals reacted with eps layer from the outer layers of sludge flocs to disintegrate the large flocs into smaller fractions while keeping cells in flocs viable fewer living cells undetectable fewer amount of hydroxyl radicals undetectable in sludge and more integrated sludge flocs particle size of d50 was 56 1 vs 57 3 μm of rs were determined in sludge conditioned by fe2 ca clo 2 where hypochlorite acid permeated through eps layer and attacked from the inner cell components to lyse cells although cells in sludge flocs were destructed and intracellular organic matters were released eps structures were maintained and served as flexible skeleton to hold sludge flocs its stable form intracellular organic matter released to the filtrate

19184,in situ fluorometers can be used as a real time cyanobacteria detection tool to maintain safe drinking and recreational water standards however previous studies into fluorometers have established issues arising mainly from measurement inaccuracies due to green algae interference therefore this study focusses on developing correction factors from a systematic study on the impact of green algae as an interference source this study brings a novel technique where the chlorophyll a chl a and phycocyanin measurements are used to correct the fluorometer output for interference bias four fluorometers were tested against three key cyanobacterial species and the relationship between phycocyanin output green algae and cyanobacteria concentrations were investigated good correlation r2 0 9 p value 0 05 was found between the fluorometer phycocyanin output and increasing green algae concentration the optimal correction method was selected for each of the fluorometer and cyanobacteria species pairs by validating against data from the investigation of green algae as an interference source the correction factors determined in this study reduced the measurement error for almost all the fluorometers and species tested by 21 99 depending on the species and fluorometer compared to previous published correction factors in which the measurement error was reduced by approximately 11 81 field validation of the correction factors showed reduction in fluorometer measurement error at sites in which cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by a single species graphical abstract image 1 keywords source management phycocyanin in situ probe algae and cyanobacteria 1 introduction real time management of cyanobacteria remains a growing challenge for water utilities and health authorities to maintain water supplies to a safe and aesthetically acceptable standard ho et al 2009 newcombe et al 2009 otten and paerl 2015 zamyadi et al 2016a climate change and increased human activities have prompted favourable conditions for the proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms merel et al 2013 additionally environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient loading can influence the size frequency and composition of cyanobacterial blooms cyanobacteria remain a concern as the presence of blooms may indicate the potential production of cyanotoxins which can have detrimental health impacts carmichael and boyer 2016 in addition direct contact with blooms in recreational waters is another source of cyanotoxin exposure which has authorities concerned otten and paerl 2015 furthermore nuisance taste and odour compounds produced by cyanobacteria are a major source of consumer complaints ho et al 2009 newcombe et al 2009 and often give consumers the false impression that the water is unsafe for consumption water utilities and health authorities require a method for rapid cyanobacteria detection to adequately respond to fluctuations in cyanobacterial blooms this makes detection in real time a pressing issue in both recreational and drinking water sources bowling et al 2016 merel et al 2013 current techniques used to detect cyanobacteria include laboratory analysis of field samples such as microscopic enumeration and speciation chorus and bartram 1999 particle imaging analysis flow cytometry pigment quantification such as chlorophyll a extraction lawrenz et al 2011 and polymerase chain reaction pcr gaget et al 2017 routine monitoring of lakes reservoirs and other bodies through remote sensing randolph et al 2008 stumpf et al 2016 has also been used by utilities however the main issues with these detection techniques are that analytical methods can be slow delays attributed to transport of samples preparation and analysis of samples costly and may require highly trained personnel for obtaining and interpreting the data izydorczyk et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2016a consequently delays in obtaining monitoring results will delay the application of adequate treatment adjustments by drinking water treatment plants dwtps which could lead to the breakthrough of cyanobacteria cells and their harmful metabolites in the product water zamyadi et al 2016b similarly health authorities will have less time to respond to blooms and take necessary actions to reduce the risk of public exposure to harmful cyanobacterial blooms koreivienė et al 2014 consequently a method that has attracted renewed interest and can address the need for real time cyanobacteria monitoring is the application of in situ fluorometers zamyadi et al 2016a however certain problems have been associated with the use of in situ fluorometers such as measurement inaccuracy which has significantly impacted the fluorometer s ability to deliver reliable measurements bowling et al 2016 choo et al 2018 zamyadi et al 2016a bertone et al 2018 previous studies have reviewed the interference sources that impact fluorometers and measured their inaccuracy catherine et al 2012 chang et al 2012 choo et al 2018 kring et al 2014 zamyadi et al 2012 the main contributors to fluorometer measurement inaccuracy are the impact of green algae and to a lesser extent turbidity choo et al 2018 richardson et al 2010 zamyadi et al 2016a bertone et al 2018 previous investigations into real time fluorescence measurement inaccuracies have rarely analysed several fluorometers and cyanobacteria species in a systemic investigation beutler et al 2002 catherine et al 2012 chang et al 2011 choo et al 2018 izydorczyk et al 2009 jakob et al 2005 kring et al 2014 ziegmann et al 2010 even less so have correction factors been developed from available studies chang et al 2012 zamyadi et al 2012 correction factors were developed from investigation of microcystis aeruginosa and one fluorometer 2012 and the correction factors have been published chang et al 2012 other corrections have been applied but the method is not published and the results cannot be validated loisa et al 2015 measurement inaccuracy has been systematically investigated choo et al 2018 and a need to develop tailored correction factors was demonstrated correction methods reviewed depend on 1 one cyanobacteria species usually microcystis aeruginosa used to develop the correction factor 2 compensation of chl a through a factor generated from known concentrations of green algae and 3 correction factors rely on measured samples and requires knowledge of the cyanobacteria and green algae concentration in the sample development of interference source compensating correction methods through a systematic examination of chl a has rarely been undertaken chang et al 2012 zamyadi et al 2012 therefore the objective of this study was to develop the most suitable correction method to minimise the impact of chl a interference for several fluorometers and key cyanobacterial species of interest to public health correction factor methods were developed by a combination of 1 utilising the chl a and phycocyanin fluorometer measurements collected from the investigation of green algae as an interference source 2 evaluating the performance of correction factors in samples with green algae and turbidity as interference sources and 3 using data collected from five sampling events at two southern australian drinking water treatment plants dwtps the novelty in these correction factors is that they rely on the fluorometer phycocyanin and chlorophyll a outputs which all the fluorometers have sensors for and do not require the determination of green algae concentrations either by chl a extraction or cell enumeration 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experimental set up 2 1 1 fluorometer description for this study correction factors and the subsequent selection protocol for the optimal correction factor were developed for four commonly used in situ fluorometers zamyadi et al 2016a exo2 ysi usa v6600 ysi usa algaetorch at bbe moldaenke germany and the microflu mf trios germany fluorometer specifications were presented in choo et al 2018 the main factor that differentiates the fluorometers from each other is the optic design specifications the bandpass filter width for the excitation wavelength light source and emission wavelength detectors the phycocyanin and chlorophyll a chl a sensors were attached to the fluorometers turbidity sensors were also utilised where possible for this study the phycocyanin and chl a measurements were used to develop the correction factors turbidity was also analysed as a complementary variable using a benchtop 2100an laboratory turbidimeter hach usa to determine if the developed correction method is impacted by the presence of another interference source 2 1 2 cell culture maintenance the cyanobacteria used in this study were 1 two strains of microcystis aeruginosa reference strain mic338 australian water quality centre awqc south australia and reference strain cs 564 australian national algae culture collection anacc australia 2 three strains of dolichospermum circinale reference strain ana131cr and ana188b awqc south australia and reference strain cs 553 anacc and 3 two strains of cylindrospermopsis raciborskii reference strain cyp011k awqc adelaide sa australia and reference strain cs 508 anacc two green algae species were used in these experiments chlorella vulgaris reference strain cs 42 anacc and ankistrodesmus sp reference strain ank011a awqc asm 1 media was used to sustain the mic338 ana131cr and cyp011k mla media was used to sustain cs 564 cs 553 cs 508 jaworski media was used to sustain cs 42 and ank001a for this study cyanobacteria and green algae cells in the stationary phase were used and cultures were maintained under a 16 8 h white fluorescent based light cycle at 21 c the light intensity in the incubator was approximately 770 μmol m2 s whereas the light intensity experienced in australia can range from 53 to 1864 μmol m2 s based on daily global solar exposure values bom 2009 sager and mcfarlane 1998 2 1 3 experiments to determine correction factors for this study five species specific calibration curves were prepared using serial dilutions for m aeruginosa d circinale c raciborskii c vulgaris and ankistrodesmus sp an aliquot of cultured cells was diluted into de chlorinated tap water to form a suspension of known concentration the fluorometers were used to measure seven cell concentrations 0 cells ml 2000 cells ml 10 000 cells ml 20 000 cells ml 65 000 cells ml 100 000 cells ml and 170 000 cells ml determination of the amount of culture stock needed to achieve the specified cell concentrations was calculated using the dilution equation and through microscopic enumeration as per choo et al 2018 correction factors were developed through investigating the impact of green algae on fluorometer phycocyanin measurements this experiment used a similar setup as the species specific calibration curves but increasing concentrations of green algae 1000 cells ml 10 000 cells ml 20 000 cells ml 65 000 cells ml 100 000 cells ml and 170 000 cells ml were added to three increasing predetermined cyanobacteria concentrations for instance using m aeruginosa 1000 cells ml 30 000 cells ml 130 000 cells ml chl a and phycocyanin measurements were taken for the four fluorometers as well as samples for cell enumeration this experiment was repeated for d circinale and c raciborskii for the three cyanobacteria concentrations details published in choo et al 2018 2 1 4 experiments to validate correction factors to validate the correction factors developed from the experiments in section 2 1 3 the factors were applied to bench scale samples containing a mixture of cyanobacteria green algae and turbidity for these sets of experiments a predetermined concentration of chl a as green algae and turbidity as 4 g l bentonite or kaolin solution in milli q water which gave a working stock solution of 100 ntu was added to a predetermined concentration of cyanobacteria m aeruginosa d circinale and c raciborskii the fluorometer measurements were collected in triplicate the concentrations of green algae cyanobacteria and turbidity added for each suspension is listed in table 1 for all the experiments measurements were recorded 2 min after the fluorometers were submerged into the suspension with samples also collected for microscopic enumeration and turbidity analysis biovolume was calculated following calculations developed by depi 2014 the mono species suspensions curves were used to determine the appropriate multiplier factor to convert fluorometer output to cell biovolume equivalent measurement 2 2 analysis of fluorometer data to confirm systematic measurement error to develop the correction factors and equations for the four fluorometers the data was analysed for the presence of systematic measurement error that is was there a proportionate change in the fluorometer measurement error with respect to an observed increase in green algae concentration gujer 2008 salkind 2010 the presence of systematic measurement error is determined if the phycocyanin measurements increase proportionately to the increasing green algae concentrations fitting the data through linear regression for this study systematic error was judged to be significant and was quantified through linear regression analysis 2 3 development selection and evaluation of correction factors 2 3 1 development and selection of correction factors the correction factor methods were developed through multiple regression using the chl a and phycocyanin fluorometer measurements from the experiments investigating the impact of green algae as an interference source and the species specific calibration curves relationships between growing green algae concentration and phycocyanin fluorometer response in suspensions containing a green algae only and b predetermined concentrations of cyanobacteria and green algae were found these relationships were compiled in an attempt to quantify the raw fluorometer phycocyanin output as a combination of signals detected from excited phycocyanin and chl a pigments chang et al 2012 choo et al 2018 waters 2009 zamyadi et al 2016a ziegmann et al 2010 a standard t test was applied to determine if there was a statically significant difference between the corrected and uncorrected measurements to select the best fluorometer correction method for each fluorometer and species pair all four correction factor methods were applied to the green algae interference experiments the corrected fluorometer measurements were then compared to the true cyanobacteria concentration through microscopic enumeration the correction method that was the closest to the true cyanobacteria concentration was selected as the best correction method for the fluorometer and cyanobacteria species pair this optimal correction method was determined by averaging the measurement error values and selecting the value with the lowest measurement inaccuracy chang et al 2012 developed a correction method for the v6600 and m aeruginosa the method developed by chang et al 2012 was applied to the experiments investigating the impact of green algae and turbidity to determine if the correction factor can be transferred successfully to the other fluorometers and the other cyanobacteria species the corrected fluorometer measurements using the method developed by chang et al 2012 was compared directly with the correction factors found in this study a t test was applied between the groups to determining if there were any statistically significant differences between the two tested correction factors 2 4 validation of correction factors 2 4 1 evaluation of correction factor performance with bench scale laboratory samples containing green algae and turbidity as sources of interference the correction methods were also applied to the results of measurements found in the green algae and turbidity experiments turbidity was measured to determine if a secondary impact source can impact the performance of the correction factors the corrected measurements were compared to corrected measurements from a previously developed method by chang et al 2012 the correction factor methods were applied to all four fluorometers and the three cyanobacteria species tested a standard t test was applied to determine if there was a statically significant difference between the corrected and uncorrected measurements 2 4 2 validation of correction factors using field data two sites wtp1 and wtp2 were used in southern australia to validate the developed fluorometer correction factors fluorometer sampling and grab sampling for microscopic enumeration was collected through key treatment points raw water intake clarified water and supernatant return three visits were conducted at wtp1 and two visits were conducted for wtp2 fluorometer measurements were converted to cell count equivalent from mono species calibrations and were compared for association through a standard t test water quality parameters for both sites can be found in supplementary data table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 confirmation of systematic measurement error the results of the experiments described in section 2 3 1 were subject to regression analysis to determine if the measurement error exhibited by the fluorometers were systematic and to validate the method development three out of the four fluorometers showed systematic measurement error fig 1 a there was an increase in the fluorometer phycocyanin output in the absence of cyanobacteria as the presence of green algae increased a strong linear correlation r 0 9 p value 0 05 via a pearson s product moment correlation was found for the exo2 v6600 and mf this was not the case for the at r 0 35 p value 0 05 however the at had been shown to have irregular fluctuations over and under estimation of fluorometer output in the presence of green algae choo et al 2018 hence correction factors were also developed for the at the exo2 v6600 and mf outputs increased systematically in response to increases in both green algae and turbidity sources fig 1b a strong correlation was found for the exo2 and v6600 r2 0 89 p value 0 05 while a weaker relationship r2 0 68 p value 0 05 was found between the mf output and interference sources increasing the concentration of turbidity increased the fluorometer output at similar concentrations of green algae for instance at an added concentration of green algae of 20 mm3 l the fluorometer output was approximately double at the higher concentration of added turbidity 8 1 rfu than that of the lower turbidity 3 4 rfu this is also seen for the other two cyanobacteria species tested supplementary data fig s1 overall the measurement inaccuracy is dependent on the fluorometer for a cyanobacteria species type fig 1a and b this means that previously published correction factors which were developed for one fluorometer and species chang et al 2012 may not be applicable for other fluorometers and species this highlights the limitation of previously developed correction factors as those factors do not incorporate the range in variability between fluorometers and species tested consequently new correction factors will need to be adjusted and developed to cover a wider range of fluorometers and species 3 2 development of correction factors for one interference source green algae 3 2 1 correction factor derivation for one interference source green algae four correction methods were found through multiple regressions equations 1 3 5 and 6 the full derivation of the correction factor method is shown in si section a of the supplementary data 3 2 1 1 correction method 1 1 c o r r e c t e d f l u o r o m e t e r o u t p u t 1 r a w f l u o r o m e t e r b g a o u t p u t c v f b g a g a b i o v o l u m e m o n o s u s

algae bgaga is the component of chlorophyll a response that should only correlate to cyanobacteria the units for the raw fluorometer output can vary ie rfu or μg l cvfs were derived through linear regression and the units are fluorometer output mm3 l correction methods 2 and 3 rely on similar principles and assumptions that were used for method 1 the correction factors are developed through experiments where green algae and cyanobacteria are present in the suspension correction method 2 equation 3 uses a conversion factor calculated from the green algae interference experiments the conversion factor is cvf4 and is the gradient between the green algae cell biovolume and the fluorometer reading for the specific concentration of cyanobacteria 3 2 1 2 correction method 2 based on

developed for all four fluorometers and the three cyanobacteria species tested 3 2 2 analysis of correction methods and selection of most appropriate factor four correction factors c1 c2 c3 and c4 were developed for all four fluorometers and three species of cyanobacteria see table 2 for full list of all the corresponding factors not all correction methods had the same efficacy for each fluorometer and species pair fig 2 for example for the corrected values of the exo2 and v6600 underestimation of up to 200 was observed for high concentrations of green algae and medium to high concentrations of cyanobacteria this was most likely caused by an over compensation for chl a consequently certain correction factors were more suited for particular fluorometer species pairs fig 3 using m aeruginosa as an example fig 3 compared to the uncorrected fluorometer measurement error most correction factors reduced the relative measurement error correction method 1 reduced the relative measurement error for the exo2 600 to 200 and the mf 20 2 but did not reduce the measurement error for the at 15 30 and the v6600 100 to 250 similar observations were observed for the reduction in measurement of the fluorometers for the other species supplementary data figs s2 s3 fig 3 also illustrates that certain correction factor methods were more effective than others correction method 1 had the smallest relative measurement error compared to the other correction methods for the at and the mf correction method 2 gave the v6600 the smallest relative measurement error and correction method 3 gave the exo2 the smallest relative measurement error for m aeruginosa additionally the correction factors between the same fluorometer models should be transferrable but not between different models of the same manufacturer this is seen through the different values for the correction factors table 2 between models of the same manufacturer such as exo2 and v6600 the optimal correction method for each fluorometer and cyanobacterial species pair is summarized in table 3 it was possible to correct for all cyanobacteria species although certain fluorometers performed better without a correction method added to the output correction factors contributed to fluorometer underestimation of cyanobacterial biovolume see correction method 1 for the exo2 and mf from fig 3 and correction method 2 for the v6600 also some fluorometers perform poorly with correction factors applied for example the at and mf using m aeruginosa in fig 3 unexpectedly the best performing fluorometer after the application of correction factors was the exo2 while the mf and at were the worst performing fluorometers after correction factors the correction factors developed relied on the phycocyanin and chlorophyll a measurements produced by the fluorometers and not on cell enumerations of green algae or cyanobacteria the varying success of the correction factors rely on the following assumptions 1 the only source of interference in the experiments was from the green algae 2 the raw fluorometer output for cyanobacteria comprises the fluorescence signal from the cyanobacteria and the overlapping fluorescence signal from the green algae chang et al 2012 choo et al 2018 waters 2009 zamyadi et al 2016a ziegmann et al 2010 and 3 the measurement error is systematic and correlational gujer 2008 salkind 2010 however a limitation of this method is that the measurement error was systematic and correlational to the cyanobacterial species used in this study even though previous studies bowling et al 2016 choo et al 2018 zamyadi et al 2016a found that the exo2 exhibited high measurement inaccuracy in the presence of green algae the findings and correction factors developed in this study indicate that the interference exhibited by the exo2 is in fact systematic consequently the exo2 becomes the best performing fluorometer post correction the exo2 output was able to be successfully corrected by applying three of the four correction factors unlike the at and mf and showed the lowest corrected measurement error table 3 fig 1 and figs s1 3 the measurement error reduction for the exo2 responds well to the correction factors as error exhibited by the exo2 is systematically correlated fig 1 and also shown to have the second strongest correlation between fluorometer output and presence of green algae out of the four fluorometers tested the error was easily compensated by the correction factor as a certain portion of the exo2 chl a output was attributed to correlational systematic interference which can be estimated based on fig 1 a possible explanation for the poorer response of the mf and at to correction is that the fluorometers might have had low measurement inaccuracy to begin with and an application of a correction factor method over compensates the interference of green algae which in turn results in a huge underestimation of the cyanobacteria see progression of underestimation as the corrections for mf are applied in fig 3 another possible explanation specific to the at is that the interference of green algae is not systematic as seen in fig 1a where the cyanobacteria concentration does not increase in response to an increasing green algae concentration as a result the correction factors developed for the at may not necessarily be the most suitable another possible factor that can influence the success of the correction factor could be the morphology of the species and the design optics and limitations that exist in the fluorometer catherine et al 2012 richardson et al 2010 choo et al 2018 and waters 2009 showed that fluorometer optic design can greatly impact the fluorometer detection accuracy that is wider bandpasses are more susceptible to background noise and other signals other studies catherine et al 2012 chang et al 2012 richardson et al 2010 zamyadi et al 2012 have shown that morphology and impact of self shading can impact fluorometer measurements as well overall certain fluorometers may not necessarily have success with certain correction factors fluorometers with high measurement inaccuracy could be easily corrected while fluorometers with low measurement inaccuracy were often over corrected 3 3 correction factor validation through bench scale and field samples 3 3 1 comparison of corrected fluorometer performance with the addition of green algae and turbidity application of the correction factors on the data found in the green algae and turbidity impact experiments showed a reduction in measurement error exhibited by the fluorometers at low green algae concentrations 0 10 mm3 l the optimal correction method for the exo2 m aeruginosa pair reduced the average relative measurement error from 800 to 200 fig 4 a similarly at high green algae concentrations 10 52 mm3 l the optimal correction method reduced the average relative measurement error from 400 to 180 the correction factor for the v6600 changed the average relative measurement error at low and high green algae concentrations from 24 to 60 and 50 to 20 respectively the correction factors for the exo2 m aeruginosa pair reduced the measurement error by four times at low green algae concentrations and by two times at high green algae concentrations the v6600 exhibited mixed results as the correction factor worked more successfully at high concentrations of green algae than at low concentrations fig 4 the measurement inaccuracy exhibited by the exo2 was observed to be systematic as the error was minimised to approximately 100 400 overestimation for all concentrations of green algae tested fig 4a most of the measurement error observed by the exo2 was overestimation however the v6600 tended to overestimate the cyanobacteria at low concentrations of interference sources and underestimate the cyanobacteria concentration at high concentrations of interference sources fig 4b this has led to an initial underestimation in the cyanobacteria concentration after the correction factors were applied to the v6600 the corrected relative measurement errors fluctuate from 150 to 50 for the v6600 on the other hand the at and mf fig 4c and d performed poorly with the added correction factors however the uncorrected relative measurement error was also low the correction factor for the at changed the average relative measurement error at low and high green algae concentrations from 70 to 150 and 110 to 40 respectively the correction factor for the mf changed the average relative measurement error at low and high green algae concentrations from 100 to 32 and 30 to 114 figs s4 and s5 for the other tested species when comparing the uncorrected fluorometer measurements with the corrected measurements fig 4a the turbidity did not adversely impact the correction factors this was observed in fig 4a as the relative fluorometer measurement for the exo2 fluctuates from 0 to 400 even with the increase of green algae and turbidity it suggests that correction factors may not be applicable for certain fluorometer species pairs and that the uncorrected measurement output can give the closest cyanobacteria estimate in these cases for this study a range of turbidity was selected based on historic data that was provided for a range of waterbodies frequently challenged by cyanobacteria cyanobacterial blooms were typically found in waters of average turbidity between 0 and 100 ntu hence turbidity within the range 0 350 ntu was considered in this study additionally the composition of turbidity can differ as well in natural waters nhmrc 2013 however in this study turbidity does not adversely impact the correction factor efficiency and some fluorometers are better suited for uncorrected measurements 3 3 2 validation with previously published correction factor methods fig 4a and b showed that the correction factors developed in this study were able to reduce the relative measurement error in the presence of two interference sources to the best of the authors knowledge there are only a couple of published studies where correction factors have been applied to in situ fluorometer measurements chang et al 2012 loisa et al 2015 out of the few studies only chang et al 2012 published a correction factor equation the correction factor was produced for the v6600 and m aeruginosa in their study fig 4a showed that the correction factors developed in this study yielded lower relative measurement errors than the correction factor developed by chang et al 2012 the correction factor found in this study produced a lower relative measurement error 200 compared with the method developed by chang et al 2012 835 at low green algae concentration similarly at high green algae concentrations after application of the correction method determined in this study a lower relative measurement error 180 was obtained when compared to the method developed by chang et al 2012 460 statistical analysis shows that the corrections found in this study were significantly different to corrections found by chang et al 2012 through the welch two sample t test p 0 05 on the other hand in terms of magnitude the correction factor developed by chang et al 2012 produced a lower relative measurement error than the correction factor found in this study 14 from the method developed by chang et al 2012 compared with 16 against the study s correction method fig 4b statistical analysis shows that the corrections found in this study were significantly different to corrections found by chang et al 2012 through two sample t test p value 0 05 when the method developed by chang et al 2012 was applied to the other fluorometers and other species the correction methods found in this study yielded lower relative measurement errors fig 4 and supplementary data figs s4 5 this study was able to validate the method developed by chang et al 2012 for the v6600 and m aeruginosa and showed the method was slightly better than the correction method developed in this study however this study also showed that the correction factor developed by chang 2012 was not as robust for other fluorometers and cyanobacterial species fig 4 and si figs s4 5 the correction factors found in this study provided an adjusted method for correcting outputs for different fluorometers and target species 3 3 3 fluorometer field application the corrected fluorometer outputs which have been converted to cell count equivalent through the adaption of the method proposed by choo et al 2018 were similar to the cell counts determined through microscopic enumeration fig 5 a statistically there was not enough evidence to suggest the two groups true difference in means were not equal to zero p value 0 05 there was a strong correlation between the corrected fluorometer output and the cell counts pearson s product moment correlation r 0 95 p value 0 05 this suggests that using the best correction method in this case no correction method for the fluorometer mf d circinale the fluorometer was able to give an estimate of the cyanobacteria concentration with the largest measurement error of 30 during the three visits for wtp1 the most likely reason for the similar results is because the cyanobacteria found at and throughout the treatment plant was mainly d circinale on the other hand the corrected fluorometer outputs showed a larger variance from the cell count for wtp2 fig 5b and c for day 1 at wtp2 both fluorometers overestimated the cyanobacteria concentration for the raw water intake and tended to underestimate the cyanobacteria concentration throughout the treatment process application of the correction factors were able to reduce the measurement error shown by fluorometers but not to the same extent as in wtp1 the smallest reduction was seen by the application of the correction factor for the exo2 with a reduction from 1120 to 900 at the raw inlet sample although the measurement reduction shown by the correction factors was small it was still an improvement from the uncorrected measurements during the second sampling trip the exo2 gave similar results to the cell count measurement error of 6 but the mf was still overestimating the cyanobacteria concentration overestimation of 42 the variability between the corrected fluorometer and the cell counts could be attributed to the variability of the bloom diversity the samples collected from the second water treatment plant showed a mixed community of dolichospermum aphanizomenon and pseudanabaena the combination of the different cyanobacterial species present and the lack of correction factors for the two later species may provide conditions too uncertain for the correction factor to work for the fluorometers this suggests that the fluorometers should be able to reasonably estimate the concentration of cyanobacterial cells present in the water if the bloom was predominantly comprised of one species when the cyanobacterial bloom comprises of a mixture of different cyanobacterial species the correction methods were not as effective additionally fluorometers can only detect total phycocyanin and no available fluorometer is currently able to distinguish between species bertone et al 2018 choo et al 2018 zamyadi et al 2016a as a result the fluorometers are more practical for sites with a history of blooms dominated by single species 4 conclusion this study aimed to develop correction factors which minimise the impact of green algae on fluorometer measurements for cyanobacteria detection the main message from this paper is that tailored chl a compensation correction factors can be developed and applied to the fluorometers for measurement error reduction additionally this study found the following outcomes different correction methods for fluorometer and species pairs have varying degrees of success which meant that selection for the optimal correction method for each pair is critical the efficiency of correction methods is species dependent field validation shows that current correction factor methods work better for sites which are dominated by a single cyanobacteria species than for sites with co dominated or mixed blooms a limitation was that some of the correction factors require modification as the measurement inaccuracy caused by the presence of green algae was not systematic consequently for water utilities and regulators there is a balance between measurement accuracy cost and effort required to achieve adequate results it is important to know which fluorometer is used and the historical background of the intended site such as the cyanobacteria which usually bloom which allows for the application of the most suitable correction factor there are still fluorometers that have been untested as well as other cyanobacteria species which have the potential to cause issues for water utilities and health authorities such as pseudanabaena and aphanizomenon further work is needed in developing correction factors for different and mixed species and other fluorometers to augment the practicability of these methods also developing correction methods through non linear regression and exploring the impact of turbidity should also be investigated to determine if more accurate corrections can be achieved although the correction methods can reduce the measurement error there will always be some level of measurement inaccuracy exhibited by the fluorometers incorporating these correction factors into the fluorometer algorithms requires further investigations although conditions simulated in the laboratory can vary highly to field conditions the work presented in this study shows that developing site specific correction factors should be considered acknowledgements this publication was supported by australian research council s linkage projects funding scheme project number

19184,in situ fluorometers can be used as a real time cyanobacteria detection tool to maintain safe drinking and recreational water standards however previous studies into fluorometers have established issues arising mainly from measurement inaccuracies due to green algae interference therefore this study focusses on developing correction factors from a systematic study on the impact of green algae as an interference source this study brings a novel technique where the chlorophyll a chl a and phycocyanin measurements are used to correct the fluorometer output for interference bias four fluorometers were tested against three key cyanobacterial species and the relationship between phycocyanin output green algae and cyanobacteria concentrations were investigated good correlation r2 0 9 p value 0 05 was found between the fluorometer phycocyanin output and increasing green algae concentration the optimal correction method was selected for each of the fluorometer and cyanobacteria species pairs by validating against data from the investigation of green algae as an interference source the correction factors determined in this study reduced the measurement error for almost all the fluorometers and species tested by 21 99 depending on the species and fluorometer compared to previous published correction factors in which the measurement error was reduced by approximately 11 81 field validation of the correction factors showed reduction in fluorometer measurement error at sites in which cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by a single species graphical abstract image 1 keywords source management phycocyanin in situ probe algae and cyanobacteria 1 introduction real time management of cyanobacteria remains a growing challenge for water utilities and health authorities to maintain water supplies to a safe and aesthetically acceptable standard ho et al 2009 newcombe et al 2009 otten and paerl 2015 zamyadi et al 2016a climate change and increased human activities have prompted favourable conditions for the proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms merel et al 2013 additionally environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient loading can influence the size frequency and composition of cyanobacterial blooms cyanobacteria remain a concern as the presence of blooms may indicate the potential production of cyanotoxins which can have detrimental health impacts carmichael and boyer 2016 in addition direct contact with blooms in recreational waters is another source of cyanotoxin exposure which has authorities concerned otten and paerl 2015 furthermore nuisance taste and odour compounds produced by cyanobacteria are a major source of consumer complaints ho et al 2009 newcombe et al 2009 and often give consumers the false impression that the water is unsafe for consumption water utilities and health authorities require a method for rapid cyanobacteria detection to adequately respond to fluctuations in cyanobacterial blooms this makes detection in real time a pressing issue in both recreational and drinking water sources bowling et al 2016 merel et al 2013 current techniques used to detect cyanobacteria include laboratory analysis of field samples such as microscopic enumeration and speciation chorus and bartram 1999 particle imaging analysis flow cytometry pigment quantification such as chlorophyll a extraction lawrenz et al 2011 and polymerase chain reaction pcr gaget et al 2017 routine monitoring of lakes reservoirs and other bodies through remote sensing randolph et al 2008 stumpf et al 2016 has also been used by utilities however the main issues with these detection techniques are that analytical methods can be slow delays attributed to transport of samples preparation and analysis of samples costly and may require highly trained personnel for obtaining and interpreting the data izydorczyk et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2016a consequently delays in obtaining monitoring results will delay the application of adequate treatment adjustments by drinking water treatment plants dwtps which could lead to the breakthrough of cyanobacteria cells and their harmful metabolites in the product water zamyadi et al 2016b similarly health authorities will have less time to respond to blooms and take necessary actions to reduce the risk of public exposure to harmful cyanobacterial blooms koreivienė et al 2014 consequently a method that has attracted renewed interest and can address the need for real time cyanobacteria monitoring is the application of in situ fluorometers zamyadi et al 2016a however certain problems have been associated with the use of in situ fluorometers such as measurement inaccuracy which has significantly impacted the fluorometer s ability to deliver reliable measurements bowling et al 2016 choo et al 2018 zamyadi et al 2016a bertone et al 2018 previous studies have reviewed the interference sources that impact fluorometers and measured their inaccuracy catherine et al 2012 chang et al 2012 choo et al 2018 kring et al 2014 zamyadi et al 2012 the main contributors to fluorometer measurement inaccuracy are the impact of green algae and to a lesser extent turbidity choo et al 2018 richardson et al 2010 zamyadi et al 2016a bertone et al 2018 previous investigations into real time fluorescence measurement inaccuracies have rarely analysed several fluorometers and cyanobacteria species in a systemic investigation beutler et al 2002 catherine et al 2012 chang et al 2011 choo et al 2018 izydorczyk et al 2009 jakob et al 2005 kring et al 2014 ziegmann et al 2010 even less so have correction factors been developed from available studies chang et al 2012 zamyadi et al 2012 correction factors were developed from investigation of microcystis aeruginosa and one fluorometer 2012 and the correction factors have been published chang et al 2012 other corrections have been applied but the method is not published and the results cannot be validated loisa et al 2015 measurement inaccuracy has been systematically investigated choo et al 2018 and a need to develop tailored correction factors was demonstrated correction methods reviewed depend on 1 one cyanobacteria species usually microcystis aeruginosa used to develop the correction factor 2 compensation of chl a through a factor generated from known concentrations of green algae and 3 correction factors rely on measured samples and requires knowledge of the cyanobacteria and green algae concentration in the sample development of interference source compensating correction methods through a systematic examination of chl a has rarely been undertaken chang et al 2012 zamyadi et al 2012 therefore the objective of this study was to develop the most suitable correction method to minimise the impact of chl a interference for several fluorometers and key cyanobacterial species of interest to public health correction factor methods were developed by a combination of 1 utilising the chl a and phycocyanin fluorometer measurements collected from the investigation of green algae as an interference source 2 evaluating the performance of correction factors in samples with green algae and turbidity as interference sources and 3 using data collected from five sampling events at two southern australian drinking water treatment plants dwtps the novelty in these correction factors is that they rely on the fluorometer phycocyanin and chlorophyll a outputs which all the fluorometers have sensors for and do not require the determination of green algae concentrations either by chl a extraction or cell enumeration 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experimental set up 2 1 1 fluorometer description for this study correction factors and the subsequent selection protocol for the optimal correction factor were developed for four commonly used in situ fluorometers zamyadi et al 2016a exo2 ysi usa v6600 ysi usa algaetorch at bbe moldaenke germany and the microflu mf trios germany fluorometer specifications were presented in choo et al 2018 the main factor that differentiates the fluorometers from each other is the optic design specifications the bandpass filter width for the excitation wavelength light source and emission wavelength detectors the phycocyanin and chlorophyll a chl a sensors were attached to the fluorometers turbidity sensors were also utilised where possible for this study the phycocyanin and chl a measurements were used to develop the correction factors turbidity was also analysed as a complementary variable using a benchtop 2100an laboratory turbidimeter hach usa to determine if the developed correction method is impacted by the presence of another interference source 2 1 2 cell culture maintenance the cyanobacteria used in this study were 1 two strains of microcystis aeruginosa reference strain mic338 australian water quality centre awqc south australia and reference strain cs 564 australian national algae culture collection anacc australia 2 three strains of dolichospermum circinale reference strain ana131cr and ana188b awqc south australia and reference strain cs 553 anacc and 3 two strains of cylindrospermopsis raciborskii reference strain cyp011k awqc adelaide sa australia and reference strain cs 508 anacc two green algae species were used in these experiments chlorella vulgaris reference strain cs 42 anacc and ankistrodesmus sp reference strain ank011a awqc asm 1 media was used to sustain the mic338 ana131cr and cyp011k mla media was used to sustain cs 564 cs 553 cs 508 jaworski media was used to sustain cs 42 and ank001a for this study cyanobacteria and green algae cells in the stationary phase were used and cultures were maintained under a 16 8 h white fluorescent based light cycle at 21 c the light intensity in the incubator was approximately 770 μmol m2 s whereas the light intensity experienced in australia can range from 53 to 1864 μmol m2 s based on daily global solar exposure values bom 2009 sager and mcfarlane 1998 2 1 3 experiments to determine correction factors for this study five species specific calibration curves were prepared using serial dilutions for m aeruginosa d circinale c raciborskii c vulgaris and ankistrodesmus sp an aliquot of cultured cells was diluted into de chlorinated tap water to form a suspension of known concentration the fluorometers were used to measure seven cell concentrations 0 cells ml 2000 cells ml 10 000 cells ml 20 000 cells ml 65 000 cells ml 100 000 cells ml and 170 000 cells ml determination of the amount of culture stock needed to achieve the specified cell concentrations was calculated using the dilution equation and through microscopic enumeration as per choo et al 2018 correction factors were developed through investigating the impact of green algae on fluorometer phycocyanin measurements this experiment used a similar setup as the species specific calibration curves but increasing concentrations of green algae 1000 cells ml 10 000 cells ml 20 000 cells ml 65 000 cells ml 100 000 cells ml and 170 000 cells ml were added to three increasing predetermined cyanobacteria concentrations for instance using m aeruginosa 1000 cells ml 30 000 cells ml 130 000 cells ml chl a and phycocyanin measurements were taken for the four fluorometers as well as samples for cell enumeration this experiment was repeated for d circinale and c raciborskii for the three cyanobacteria concentrations details published in choo et al 2018 2 1 4 experiments to validate correction factors to validate the correction factors developed from the experiments in section 2 1 3 the factors were applied to bench scale samples containing a mixture of cyanobacteria green algae and turbidity for these sets of experiments a predetermined concentration of chl a as green algae and turbidity as 4 g l bentonite or kaolin solution in milli q water which gave a working stock solution of 100 ntu was added to a predetermined concentration of cyanobacteria m aeruginosa d circinale and c raciborskii the fluorometer measurements were collected in triplicate the concentrations of green algae cyanobacteria and turbidity added for each suspension is listed in table 1 for all the experiments measurements were recorded 2 min after the fluorometers were submerged into the suspension with samples also collected for microscopic enumeration and turbidity analysis biovolume was calculated following calculations developed by depi 2014 the mono species suspensions curves were used to determine the appropriate multiplier factor to convert fluorometer output to cell biovolume equivalent measurement 2 2 analysis of fluorometer data to confirm systematic measurement error to develop the correction factors and equations for the four fluorometers the data was analysed for the presence of systematic measurement error that is was there a proportionate change in the fluorometer measurement error with respect to an observed increase in green algae concentration gujer 2008 salkind 2010 the presence of systematic measurement error is determined if the phycocyanin measurements increase proportionately to the increasing green algae concentrations fitting the data through linear regression for this study systematic error was judged to be significant and was quantified through linear regression analysis 2 3 development selection and evaluation of correction factors 2 3 1 development and selection of correction factors the correction factor methods were developed through multiple regression using the chl a and phycocyanin fluorometer measurements from the experiments investigating the impact of green algae as an interference source and the species specific calibration curves relationships between growing green algae concentration and phycocyanin fluorometer response in suspensions containing a green algae only and b predetermined concentrations of cyanobacteria and green algae were found these relationships were compiled in an attempt to quantify the raw fluorometer phycocyanin output as a combination of signals detected from excited phycocyanin and chl a pigments chang et al 2012 choo et al 2018 waters 2009 zamyadi et al 2016a ziegmann et al 2010 a standard t test was applied to determine if there was a statically significant difference between the corrected and uncorrected measurements to select the best fluorometer correction method for each fluorometer and species pair all four correction factor methods were applied to the green algae interference experiments the corrected fluorometer measurements were then compared to the true cyanobacteria concentration through microscopic enumeration the correction method that was the closest to the true cyanobacteria concentration was selected as the best correction method for the fluorometer and cyanobacteria species pair this optimal correction method was determined by averaging the measurement error values and selecting the value with the lowest measurement inaccuracy chang et al 2012 developed a correction method for the v6600 and m aeruginosa the method developed by chang et al 2012 was applied to the experiments investigating the impact of green algae and turbidity to determine if the correction factor can be transferred successfully to the other fluorometers and the other cyanobacteria species the corrected fluorometer measurements using the method developed by chang et al 2012 was compared directly with the correction factors found in this study a t test was applied between the groups to determining if there were any statistically significant differences between the two tested correction factors 2 4 validation of correction factors 2 4 1 evaluation of correction factor performance with bench scale laboratory samples containing green algae and turbidity as sources of interference the correction methods were also applied to the results of measurements found in the green algae and turbidity experiments turbidity was measured to determine if a secondary impact source can impact the performance of the correction factors the corrected measurements were compared to corrected measurements from a previously developed method by chang et al 2012 the correction factor methods were applied to all four fluorometers and the three cyanobacteria species tested a standard t test was applied to determine if there was a statically significant difference between the corrected and uncorrected measurements 2 4 2 validation of correction factors using field data two sites wtp1 and wtp2 were used in southern australia to validate the developed fluorometer correction factors fluorometer sampling and grab sampling for microscopic enumeration was collected through key treatment points raw water intake clarified water and supernatant return three visits were conducted at wtp1 and two visits were conducted for wtp2 fluorometer measurements were converted to cell count equivalent from mono species calibrations and were compared for association through a standard t test water quality parameters for both sites can be found in supplementary data table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 confirmation of systematic measurement error the results of the experiments described in section 2 3 1 were subject to regression analysis to determine if the measurement error exhibited by the fluorometers were systematic and to validate the method development three out of the four fluorometers showed systematic measurement error fig 1 a there was an increase in the fluorometer phycocyanin output in the absence of cyanobacteria as the presence of green algae increased a strong linear correlation r 0 9 p value 0 05 via a pearson s product moment correlation was found for the exo2 v6600 and mf this was not the case for the at r 0 35 p value 0 05 however the at had been shown to have irregular fluctuations over and under estimation of fluorometer output in the presence of green algae choo et al 2018 hence correction factors were also developed for the at the exo2 v6600 and mf outputs increased systematically in response to increases in both green algae and turbidity sources fig 1b a strong correlation was found for the exo2 and v6600 r2 0 89 p value 0 05 while a weaker relationship r2 0 68 p value 0 05 was found between the mf output and interference sources increasing the concentration of turbidity increased the fluorometer output at similar concentrations of green algae for instance at an added concentration of green algae of 20 mm3 l the fluorometer output was approximately double at the higher concentration of added turbidity 8 1 rfu than that of the lower turbidity 3 4 rfu this is also seen for the other two cyanobacteria species tested supplementary data fig s1 overall the measurement inaccuracy is dependent on the fluorometer for a cyanobacteria species type fig 1a and b this means that previously published correction factors which were developed for one fluorometer and species chang et al 2012 may not be applicable for other fluorometers and species this highlights the limitation of previously developed correction factors as those factors do not incorporate the range in variability between fluorometers and species tested consequently new correction factors will need to be adjusted and developed to cover a wider range of fluorometers and species 3 2 development of correction factors for one interference source green algae 3 2 1 correction factor derivation for one interference source green algae four correction methods were found through multiple regressions equations 1 3 5 and 6 the full derivation of the correction factor method is shown in si section a of

regression and the units are fluorometer output mm3 l correction methods 2 and 3 rely on similar principles and assumptions that were used for method 1 the correction factors are developed through experiments where green algae and cyanobacteria are present in the suspension correction method 2 equation 3 uses a conversion factor calculated from the green algae interference experiments the conversion factor is cvf4 and is the gradient between the green algae cell biovolume and the fluorometer reading for the specific concentration of cyanobacteria 3 2 1 2 correction method 2 based on

developed for all four fluorometers and the three cyanobacteria species tested 3 2 2 analysis of correction methods and selection of most appropriate factor four correction factors c1 c2 c3 and c4 were developed for all four fluorometers and three species of cyanobacteria see table 2 for full list of all the corresponding factors not all correction methods had the same efficacy for each fluorometer and species pair fig 2 for example for the corrected values of the exo2 and v6600 underestimation of up to 200 was observed for high concentrations of green algae and medium to high concentrations of cyanobacteria this was most likely caused by an over compensation for chl a consequently certain correction factors were more suited for particular fluorometer species pairs fig 3 using m aeruginosa as an example fig 3 compared to the uncorrected fluorometer measurement error most correction factors reduced the relative measurement error correction method 1 reduced the relative measurement error for the exo2 600 to 200 and the mf 20 2 but did not reduce the measurement error for the at 15 30 and the v6600 100 to 250 similar observations were observed for the reduction in measurement of the fluorometers for the other species supplementary data figs s2 s3 fig 3 also illustrates that certain correction factor methods were more effective than others correction method 1 had the smallest relative measurement error compared to the other correction methods for the at and the mf correction method 2 gave the v6600 the smallest relative measurement error and correction method 3 gave the exo2 the smallest relative measurement error for m aeruginosa additionally the correction factors between the same fluorometer models should be transferrable but not between different models of the same manufacturer this is seen through the different values for the correction factors table 2 between models of the same manufacturer such as exo2 and v6600 the optimal correction method for each fluorometer and cyanobacterial species pair is summarized in table 3 it was possible to correct for all cyanobacteria species although certain fluorometers performed better without a correction method added to the output correction factors contributed to fluorometer underestimation of cyanobacterial biovolume see correction method 1 for the exo2 and mf from fig 3 and correction method 2 for the v6600 also some fluorometers perform poorly with correction factors applied for example the at and mf using m aeruginosa in fig 3 unexpectedly the best performing fluorometer after the application of correction factors was the exo2 while the mf and at were the worst performing fluorometers after correction factors the correction factors developed relied on the phycocyanin and chlorophyll a measurements produced by the fluorometers and not on cell enumerations of green algae or cyanobacteria the varying success of the correction factors rely on the following assumptions 1 the only source of interference in the experiments was from the green algae 2 the raw fluorometer output for cyanobacteria comprises the fluorescence signal from the cyanobacteria and the overlapping fluorescence signal from the green algae chang et al 2012 choo et al 2018 waters 2009 zamyadi et al 2016a ziegmann et al 2010 and 3 the measurement error is systematic and correlational gujer 2008 salkind 2010 however a limitation of this method is that the measurement error was systematic and correlational to the cyanobacterial species used in this study even though previous studies bowling et al 2016 choo et al 2018 zamyadi et al 2016a found that the exo2 exhibited high measurement inaccuracy in the presence of green algae the findings and correction factors developed in this study indicate that the interference exhibited by the exo2 is in fact systematic consequently the exo2 becomes the best performing fluorometer post correction the exo2 output was able to be successfully corrected by applying three of the four correction factors unlike the at and mf and showed the lowest corrected measurement error table 3 fig 1 and figs s1 3 the measurement error reduction for the exo2 responds well to the correction factors as error exhibited by the exo2 is systematically correlated fig 1 and also shown to have the second strongest correlation between fluorometer output and presence of green algae out of the four fluorometers tested the error was easily compensated by the correction factor as a certain portion of the exo2 chl a output was attributed to correlational systematic interference which can be estimated based on fig 1 a possible explanation for the poorer response of the mf and at to correction is that the fluorometers might have had low measurement inaccuracy to begin with and an application of a correction factor method over compensates the interference of green algae which in turn results in a huge underestimation of the cyanobacteria see progression of underestimation as the corrections for mf are applied in fig 3 another possible explanation specific to the at is that the interference of green algae is not systematic as seen in fig 1a where the cyanobacteria concentration does not increase in response to an increasing green algae concentration as a result the correction factors developed for the at may not necessarily be the most suitable another possible factor that can influence the success of the correction factor could be the morphology of the species and the design optics and limitations that exist in the fluorometer catherine et al 2012 richardson et al 2010 choo et al 2018 and waters 2009 showed that fluorometer optic design can greatly impact the fluorometer detection accuracy that is wider bandpasses are more susceptible to background noise and other signals other studies catherine et al 2012 chang et al 2012 richardson et al 2010 zamyadi et al 2012 have shown that morphology and impact of self shading can impact fluorometer measurements as well overall certain fluorometers may not necessarily have success with certain correction factors fluorometers with high measurement inaccuracy could be easily corrected while fluorometers with low measurement inaccuracy were often over corrected 3 3 correction factor validation through bench scale and field samples 3 3 1 comparison of corrected fluorometer performance with the addition of green algae and turbidity application of the correction factors on the data found in the green algae and turbidity impact experiments showed a reduction in measurement error exhibited by the fluorometers at low green algae concentrations 0 10 mm3 l the optimal correction method for the exo2 m aeruginosa pair reduced the average relative measurement error from 800 to 200 fig 4 a similarly at high green algae concentrations 10 52 mm3 l the optimal correction method reduced the average relative measurement error from 400 to 180 the correction factor for the v6600 changed the average relative measurement error at low and high green algae concentrations from 24 to 60 and 50 to 20 respectively the correction factors for the exo2 m aeruginosa pair reduced the measurement error by four times at low green algae concentrations and by two times at high green algae concentrations the v6600 exhibited mixed results as the correction factor worked more successfully at high concentrations of green algae than at low concentrations fig 4 the measurement inaccuracy exhibited by the exo2 was observed to be systematic as the error was minimised to approximately 100 400 overestimation for all concentrations of green algae tested fig 4a most of the measurement error observed by the exo2 was overestimation however the v6600 tended to overestimate the cyanobacteria at low concentrations of interference sources and underestimate the cyanobacteria concentration at high concentrations of interference sources fig 4b this has led to an initial underestimation in the cyanobacteria concentration after the correction factors were applied to the v6600 the corrected relative measurement errors fluctuate from 150 to 50 for the v6600 on the other hand the at and mf fig 4c and d performed poorly with the added correction factors however the uncorrected relative measurement error was also low the correction factor for the at changed the average relative measurement error at low and high green algae concentrations from 70 to 150 and 110 to 40 respectively the correction factor for the mf changed the average relative measurement error at low and high green algae concentrations from 100 to 32 and 30 to 114 figs s4 and s5 for the other tested species when comparing the uncorrected fluorometer measurements with the corrected measurements fig 4a the turbidity did not adversely impact the correction factors this was observed in fig 4a as the relative fluorometer measurement for the exo2 fluctuates from 0 to 400 even with the increase of green algae and turbidity it suggests that correction factors may not be applicable for certain fluorometer species pairs and that the uncorrected measurement output can give the closest cyanobacteria estimate in these cases for this study a range of turbidity was selected based on historic data that was provided for a range of waterbodies frequently challenged by cyanobacteria cyanobacterial blooms were typically found in waters of average turbidity between 0 and 100 ntu hence turbidity within the range 0 350 ntu was considered in this study additionally the composition of turbidity can differ as well in natural waters nhmrc 2013 however in this study turbidity does not adversely impact the correction factor efficiency and some fluorometers are better suited for uncorrected measurements 3 3 2 validation with previously published correction factor methods fig 4a and b showed that the correction factors developed in this study were able to reduce the relative measurement error in the presence of two interference sources to the best of the authors knowledge there are only a couple of published studies where correction factors have been applied to in situ fluorometer measurements chang et al 2012 loisa et al 2015 out of the few studies only chang et al 2012 published a correction factor equation the correction factor was produced for the v6600 and m aeruginosa in their study fig 4a showed that the correction factors developed in this study yielded lower relative measurement errors than the correction factor developed by chang et al 2012 the correction factor found in this study produced a lower relative measurement error 200 compared with the method developed by chang et al 2012 835 at low green algae concentration similarly at high green algae concentrations after application of the correction method determined in this study a lower relative measurement error 180 was obtained when compared to the method developed by chang et al 2012 460 statistical analysis shows that the corrections found in this study were significantly different to corrections found by chang et al 2012 through the welch two sample t test p 0 05 on the other hand in terms of magnitude the correction factor developed by chang et al 2012 produced a lower relative measurement error than the correction factor found in this study 14 from the method developed by chang et al 2012 compared with 16 against the study s correction method fig 4b statistical analysis shows that the corrections found in this study were significantly different to corrections found by chang et al 2012 through two sample t test p value 0 05 when the method developed by chang et al 2012 was applied to the other fluorometers and other species the correction methods found in this study yielded lower relative measurement errors fig 4 and supplementary data figs s4 5 this study was able to validate the method developed by chang et al 2012 for the v6600 and m aeruginosa and showed the method was slightly better than the correction method developed in this study however this study also showed that the correction factor developed by chang 2012 was not as robust for other fluorometers and cyanobacterial species fig 4 and si figs s4 5 the correction factors found in this study provided an adjusted method for correcting outputs for different fluorometers and target species 3 3 3 fluorometer field application the corrected fluorometer outputs which have been converted to cell count equivalent through the adaption of the method proposed by choo et al 2018 were similar to the cell counts determined through microscopic enumeration fig 5 a statistically there was not enough evidence to suggest the two groups true difference in means were not equal to zero p value 0 05 there was a strong correlation between the corrected fluorometer output and the cell counts pearson s product moment correlation r 0 95 p value 0 05 this suggests that using the best correction method in this case no correction method for the fluorometer mf d circinale the fluorometer was able to give an estimate of the cyanobacteria concentration with the largest measurement error of 30 during the three visits for wtp1 the most likely reason for the similar results is because the cyanobacteria found at and throughout the treatment plant was mainly d circinale on the other hand the corrected fluorometer outputs showed a larger variance from the cell count for wtp2 fig 5b and c for day 1 at wtp2 both fluorometers overestimated the cyanobacteria concentration for the raw water intake and tended to underestimate the cyanobacteria concentration throughout the treatment process application of the correction factors were able to reduce the measurement error shown by fluorometers but not to the same extent as in wtp1 the smallest reduction was seen by the application of the correction factor for the exo2 with a reduction from 1120 to 900 at the raw inlet sample although the measurement reduction shown by the correction factors was small it was still an improvement from the uncorrected measurements during the second sampling trip the exo2 gave similar results to the cell count measurement error of 6 but the mf was still overestimating the cyanobacteria concentration overestimation of 42 the variability between the corrected fluorometer and the cell counts could be attributed to the variability of the bloom diversity the samples collected from the second water treatment plant showed a mixed community of dolichospermum aphanizomenon and pseudanabaena the combination of the different cyanobacterial species present and the lack of correction factors for the two later species may provide conditions too uncertain for the correction factor to work for the fluorometers this suggests that the fluorometers should be able to reasonably estimate the concentration of cyanobacterial cells present in the water if the bloom was predominantly comprised of one species when the cyanobacterial bloom comprises of a mixture of different cyanobacterial species the correction methods were not as effective additionally fluorometers can only detect total phycocyanin and no available fluorometer is currently able to distinguish between species bertone et al 2018 choo et al 2018 zamyadi et al 2016a as a result the fluorometers are more practical for sites with a history of blooms dominated by single species 4 conclusion this study aimed to develop correction factors which minimise the impact of green algae on fluorometer measurements for cyanobacteria detection the main message from this paper is that tailored chl a compensation correction factors can be developed and applied to the fluorometers for measurement error reduction additionally this study found the following outcomes different correction methods for fluorometer and species pairs have varying degrees of success which meant that selection for the optimal correction method for each pair is critical the efficiency of correction methods is species dependent field validation shows that current correction factor methods work better for sites which are dominated by a single cyanobacteria species than for sites with co dominated or mixed blooms a limitation was that some of the correction factors require modification as the measurement inaccuracy caused by the presence of green algae was not systematic consequently for water utilities and regulators there is a balance between measurement accuracy cost and effort required to achieve adequate results it is important to know which fluorometer is used and the historical background of the intended site such as the cyanobacteria which usually bloom which allows for the application of the most suitable correction factor there are still fluorometers that have been untested as well as other cyanobacteria species which have the potential to cause issues for water utilities and health authorities such as pseudanabaena and aphanizomenon further work is needed in developing correction factors for different and mixed species and other fluorometers to augment the practicability of these methods also developing correction methods through non linear regression and exploring the impact of turbidity should also be investigated to determine if more accurate corrections can be achieved although the correction methods can reduce the measurement error there will always be some level of measurement inaccuracy exhibited by the fluorometers incorporating these correction factors into the fluorometer algorithms requires further investigations although conditions simulated in the laboratory can vary highly to field conditions the work presented in this study shows that developing site specific correction factors should be considered acknowledgements this publication was supported by australian research council s linkage projects funding scheme project number
