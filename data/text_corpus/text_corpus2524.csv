12620,efficient phosphorus removal from wastewater is of paramount importance however the design of low cost high performance materials for phosphorus removal is faced with a huge challenge herein a waste brick slag loaded with iron oxide and lanthanum hydroxide wb fe2o3 la oh 3 has been prepared by sequential deposition of fe2o3 and la oh 3 nanoparticles on the surface of brick slag particles and applied to removal of phosphate from wastewater via column separation and the maximum phosphate separation efficiency can reach 99 more importantly it shows a high phosphate removal efficiency 90 over the wide range of ph 3 0 8 0 in addition to a high separation selectivity toward phosphate and high throughput during separation process the low cost and high removal efficiency benefit from the use of building waste bricks and column separation which due to its full contact with the target the ligand exchange and the chemical precipitation are mainly responsible for the phosphate removal by wb fe2o3 la oh 3 therefore the prepared wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles with the high phosphate separation efficiency and column separation for phosphate removal developed has the potential to become an excellent candidate for practical application in phosphate separation and provides a reference path for building waste brick recycling graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phosphate removal column separation waste brick residue fe2o3 la oh 3 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus plays an important role for all forms of life which involves in the formation of rna dna molecules and relates to cellular energy transport via atp 1 2 however excessive phosphate a form of phosphorus which mainly from the phosphate containing wastewater from human activities in natural water is undesirable because it causes eutrophication and severe water quality deterioration 3 4 therefore the removal of phosphate from wastewater is of great significance for environmental protection and water resource recovery considering it many technologies have been developed for phosphate removal from aqueous solutions including chemical precipitation 5 7 biological technology 3 8 adsorption method 9 11 and membrane separation technology 12 14 however development and applications of these phosphate removal technologies are hindered currently based on the following reasons 1 secondary pollution may be caused by the discharge of pollutants by chemical precipitation and adsorption method 2 biological technology requires appropriate temperature and amounts of oxygen for microorganism requiring many tedious and time consuming processes 3 the high cost of membrane equipment and membrane fouling restrict their practical application by membrane separation technology hence enhanced phosphate removal technologies with the multiple advantages of with high separation efficiency simple operation low cost and environmental friendliness remains a challenge among the various presented technologies due to the advantage of simple operation and low cost adsorption separation has been intensively investigated which offers satisfactory results for phosphate removal for instance the efficiently removal rates of bioceramic fezn layered double hydroxides ldhs adsorbent with simple operation could reach 71 58 for total phosphorous 15 li et al fabricated magnetic 3d fe3o4 zno with ultrafast capture of phosphate 94 8 in 5 min 16 although adsorption separation can quickly and efficiently separate phosphate in water 17 the loss of nano adsorbents derived from dissolution would reduce the recycling properties and form secondary pollution in addition the disadvantage of adsorption separation are its poor reusability properties for most adsorption systems and easy to agglomerate in applications as they are usually powdered 18 20 excellent carriers such as fibers and nanowires are an effective way to solve this problem 21 22 but these carriers are often accompanied by complex preparation process and high cost however building waste brick slag can be considered as an effective choice due to its low price hierarchical porous structure good mechanical and chemical stability 23 25 therefore it is of great significance to construct resource based waste brick slag to remove phosphate lanthanum hydroxide la oh 3 is considered to be an effective material for phosphate removal because of the mechanism of complexing 26 28 the construction of la oh 3 composite waste brick slag is expected to achieve effective removal of phosphate however the negatively charged la oh 3 is difficult to adhere to the surface of negatively charged brick slag because there is no strong chemical action site due to its positive charge ferric oxide fe2o3 is pre introduced into the surface of brick slag to enhance the positive charge 29 31 and then it adheres to the surface with fe2o3 through electrostatic interaction to form functional brick slag wb fe2o3 la oh 3 as a consequence the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 has the ability to remove phosphate from wastewater due to the synergistic effect of la oh 3 and fe2o3 materials however wb fe2o3 la oh 3 has poor dispersion in aqueous solution and fewer action sites of the target substance therefore column separation is considered to be an effective method because of the advantages of close stacking of filler layers 32 which can increase the action sites of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 and the target to achieve high removal efficiency meanwhile the porosity of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 can achieve efficient phosphate removal while maintaining high flux with limited energy and cost savings herein wb fe2o3 la oh 3 is prepared by two step deposition of metal compounds with building waste brick particles as the carrier which can effectively remove phosphate while maintaining high flux and realize the resource utilization of waste brick residue and the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 was further employed for phosphate decontamination in an aqueous solution via column separation method additionally phosphate removal has been systematically studied including different influencing factors such as initial phosphate concentrations solution ph interfering ions and cyclicity and the removal mechanism of phosphate is analyzed in detail the waste to resource and waste control waste strategy for fabrication wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles and column separation for phosphate removal developed herein can be extended for the fabrication of other functional materials from solid wastes for water treatment

nh3 h2o 25 28 and potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 99 5 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china all chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification brick slag were collected from construction waste in the campus of jiangsu university zhenjiang city china and washed thoroughly with deionized water before use 2 2 pretreatment of wb the waste brick was treated by hydrochloric acid to remove impurities and expand the porous structure 33 in a typical experiment the coarse brick slag was obtained by crushing large construction waste bricks and sieved below 100 meshes then 5 g of the coarse brick slag was immersed in 100 ml of 0 1 mol l hydrochloric acid and placed for 24 h subsequently the brick slag powder was filtered and washed with deionized water to a neutral ph value after repeated hydrochloric acid immersion for 3 times the brick slag powder was collected and dried at 80 c for 6 h to obtain pretreated wb for later use the pretreatment process of wb is shown in scheme 1a 2 3 preparation of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles were prepared by sequential deposition of fe2o3 and la oh 3 nanoparticles on the surface of brick slag particles according to the reported methods with a modification 34 typically 5 406 g of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved into 50 ml ethanol to form a homogeneous solution then 10 g of wb was immersed into above mixture solution and the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 0 with dilute hydrochloric acid after that the mixture was placed in a 0 5 l of flask and maintained at a temperature of 80 c with continual mechanical stirring for 20 h the resulting solid was filtered washed with deionized water and dried at 80 c in an air oven finally the dried products were calcined in the muffle furnace at 400 c for 4 h to obtain the iron oxide loaded waste brick particles wb fe2o3 the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles were fabricated by deposition of la oh 3 using wb fe2o3 as supports in a typical procedure 10 g of wb fe2o3 particles were immersed into 200 ml of mixture solution containing 12 98 g of la no3 3 6h2o with the ph value adjusted to 8 with ammonium hydroxide followed by stirring of the mixture for 2 h after that the resulting precipitate was left 20 h at 80 c for aging after which the slurry was filtered and washed three times with distilled water to obtain wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles the preparation process of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 is shown in scheme 1b 2 4 characterization the morphology and surface structure of wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta 200 usa and the composition of samples was measured by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds jem 2100 the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and pore structure of wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 were investigated by a micromeritics asap 3020 volumetric adsorption analyzer the crystal structures of these particles were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd jeol jdx 3530 tokyo japan with cu kα radiation with a scanning speed of 4 min in the 2θ range from 10 to 80 the surface groups of the samples were analyzed by fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrophotometer thermo nicolet nexus tm in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 the surface element composition and chemical valences of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 before and after phosphate adsorption were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps on thermo escalab 250 xi 2 5 batch phosphate separation experiment the phosphate separation was carried out by batch penetration experiments and conducted by the separation column the inner diameter is 1 1 cm whose packing was wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles with different concentrations of phosphate solution the column separation process was completely driven by gravity without an external force in a typical phosphate separation process the as prepared wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles was tightly packed in a separation column and then the liquid passes through the packing layer under the drive of gravity the phosphate separation experiment process was described in scheme 2 the properties of the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles in terms of the separation efficiency for the treatment of phosphate solution under different influencing factors such as solution ph initial phosphate concentration packing layer thickness presence of interfering ions after phosphate separation the separated filtrate is collected into a clean centrifuge tube at a constant flow rate and the phosphate content in the separated filtrate was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkin elmer optima 2100dv all phosphate separation experiments were replicated twice 2 6 performance testing in the process of phosphate removal the separation efficiency and permeation flux were studied and the separation properties of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles under different operating conditions were analyzed the calculation method of permeation flux j is as follows 1 j v a δt where v l is the volume of permeable liquid a m2 is the effective separation area and δt h is the permeable time the separation efficiency r can be calculated by the following formula 2 r 1 c f c 0 100 where c0 mg l and cf mg l are respectively the phosphate concentration in the wastewater before separation and the phosphate concentration in the filtrate after separation 3 results and discussion the surface properties of surface functionalized particles such as microstructure and chemical composition play an important role in phosphate separation the microstructure and surface morphology of wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 were characterized by sem fig 1 shows the sem images of wb particles and surface functionalized particles with different magnifications as can be seen from fig 1a after mechanical grinding the surface of the wb presents uneven particles most of which are distributed in the diameter of 10 30 μm this micrometer sized wb is a suitable column packing material allowing the separation column to maintain a high permeation flux but the lack of corresponding active adsorption sites on the surface is a limitation fig 1b shows that the single granular surface is relatively smooth and the surface structure of the wb provides a large area for the deposition of metal hydroxides and oxides fig 1c and d show the morphology of wb fe2o3 indicating that the curved gullies in the pre treated brick slag are partially buried by amorphous iron oxide meanwhile compared with the bare brick slag the pore structure is more obvious the diameter of the pore is about 2 μm which is easy to precipitate la oh 3 on the surface as shown in fig 1e the morphology of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 is similar to that of the original brick slag but the original surface is covered by cluster la oh 3 precipitates the diameter of uneven particles is about 1 5 times larger than that of the bare wb particles and the zigzag gullies between particles are narrowed as shown in the enlarged fig 1f the surface roughness of the material increases significantly and enriched a large number of micro nano particles which provides abundant active sites and is conducive to the removal of phosphate in the wastewater in conclusion the micron structure of particles make it maintain high mechanical strength and high permeation flux while weakening the dissolution effect of nano particles combined with abundant active sites on the particles the feasibility of column separation and phosphorus removal was ensured meanwhile x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds analysis was performed the fig s1 showed more peaks of la and fe indicating that the corresponding compounds of la and fe were successfully loaded on the slag surface ft ir spectra and xrd patterns can reveal the loading process and structural evolution of metal oxides and hydroxides on the waste brick slag the wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 composition were investigated by ft ir and the results are shown in fig 2a as shown in fig 2a wb fe2o3 la oh 3 shows two peaks at about 3500 cm 1 and 1500 cm 1 which is caused by the stretching vibration of ho bond on the material surface 4 since there are fewer ho bonds on the surface of discarded brick slag when metal hydroxide and oxide are not loaded there is no obvious peak of wb curve by observing the ft ir fingerprint region fig 2a it was found that compared with the wb curve the characteristic peak of feo bond appeared in the wb fe2o3 curve at about 441 cm 1 similarly the characteristic peaks of feo bond and lao bond appear at 441 cm 1 and 428 cm 1 respectively in wb fe2o3 la oh 3 curve 27 it can be preliminarily determined that fe oxide and la hydroxide were loaded on the surface of waste brick slag successively to investigate the composition and crystallinity transformations of the samples the wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 were analyzed by xrd and the results are shown in fig 2b the typical characteristic peaks of the wb appear at 2θ 20 7 26 6 36 3 39 4 42 5 50 0 59 8 and 68 0 corresponding to the crystal planes of 100 011 100 102 200 112 121 and 203 of sio2 jcpds card no 74 1811 apart from the characteristic reflections of the sio2 four new characteristic peaks of at 2θ 24 3 29 8 55 0 64 3 and 76 5 were observed in wb fe2o3 samples and indexed to the 012 220 116 300 and 553 planes of fe2o3 jcpds card no 33 0664 compared with the wb the characteristic reflections of sio2 are slightly decreased implying that fe2o3 particles are successfully deposited on the surfaces of wb particles the xrd pattern of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 shows that the sio2 characteristic peak in the waste brick slag originally located at 2θ 20 7 26 6 50 0 and 68 0 is obviously weakened while the characteristic peak of fe2o3 appears the characteristic peaks of la oh 3 appear at 2θ 27 3 27 9 39 5 48 2 48 5 and 55 2 110 101 201 300 211 and 112 planes correspond to la oh 3 jcpds card no 83 2034 respectively the above results indicate that wb fe2o3 la oh 3 has been successfully prepared in order to determine the surface properties and pore structure changes of the as fabricated materials the bjh pore size distribution and specific surface area of wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 were determined by nitrogen adsorption and desorption n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of wb is shown in fig s2 fig 3a and b shows that the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 are of type iv and the adsorption hysteresis ring appears in the middle and back section which is usually related to the capillary condensation effect in mesoporous materials the results show that wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles have mesoporous structure the adsorption hysteresis ring shows that it has no obvious saturated adsorption platform and is a type of h3 or h4 mesoporous hysteresis ring in addition the pore size distribution of bjh indicates that the mesopore diameter of wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles is widely distributed ranging from 1 nm to 15 nm the pore size distribution of bjh in both of them retains the characteristics of the porous structure of the original brick slag and is conducive to the removal of phosphate in water this mesoporous nanostructure enables the particles to possess strong adsorption capacity and at the same time combined with micron particles ensures high permeation flux and phosphate separation efficiency during column separation process the results show that the specific surface area of the original waste brick slag particles is 4 50 m2 g and the specific surface area of wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles is 51 82 m2 g and 56 11 m2 g respectively compared with the bare wb particles the specific surface area of the brick slag is increased by 12 times after loading fe2o3 and la oh 3 which greatly increases the specific surface area of the material the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles have good porous structure and larger specific surface area than the original brick slag which provides convenience for the removal of phosphate in wastewater in order to study the changes of surface chemical composition during phosphate separation xps analysis were performed on the sample materials the composition changes of particles before and after phosphate removal were investigated by xps and the results are shown in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4a the absorption peaks of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles appear at binding energies of 284 37 ev 531 19 ev and 102 51 ev which are characteristic peaks of c o and si respectively consistent with the main composition of the original brick slag the absorption peaks at 835 01 ev and 710 41 ev represent the existence of lao and feo bonds respectively the results show that wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles are successfully synthesized which is consistent with the ft ir and xrd patterns after the phosphate separation experiment a new absorption peak appeared on wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle as shown in in fig 4a and d which corresponded to p2p in phosphate in wastewater in fig 4b the la3d spectrum at 835 855 ev binding energy corresponds to the la3d in la oh 3 on wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle after the phosphate separation test it can be seen that the peak strength decreased significantly in fig 4c the fe2p spectrum at the binding energy of 705 730 ev corresponds to the fe2p spectrum in fe2o3 on wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle after the phosphate separation experiment the peak strength does not change significantly this is because in the process of phosphate separation la oh 3 in wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle plays a major chemical role the separation mechanism process is shown in scheme 3 and the mechanism of action is as follows 21 3 la oh h 2 po 4 la h 2 p o 4 oh 4 la oh hpo 4 la hp o 4 oh 5 la oh po 4 3 la p o 4 oh based on the above xps results ft ir spectra shown in fig s3 and the mechanism equation the basic process of phosphate removal with wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles was expounded when the wastewater passes through wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle layer by self weight infiltration the chemical reaction of kh2po4 in the wastewater occurs as above to generate lapo4 precipitate due to the super binding ability of la and phosphate the phosphate in the wastewater is fixed in the form of precipitation which achieves the purpose of phosphate removal from the wastewater the actual environment is a complex system of many factors to evaluate the application potential of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles the separation performance of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles under different conditions including ph separation flux initial phosphate concentration and coexisting ions was investigated it is very important to study the effect of ph on the separation process because the surface active components of materials are affected by the acid base environment the effect of ph value on the phosphate separation efficiency of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles was studied in the range of ph 3 0 11 0 by using an initial phosphate concentration of 100 mg l the results are shown in fig 5a which proves that ph has a certain influence on the separation process it can be clearly observed from fig 5a that wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle has a relatively high separation efficiency 85 in a wide ph range 3 0 8 0 and the maximum phosphate separation efficiency reaches 93 47 when the ph is 3 0 4 0 when the ph value was 9 0 the separation efficiency decreases gradually in alkaline environment from 77 7 to 53 6 this is because the protonation of the sample material is expected to make the surface of la oh 3 positively charged in the acid environment and promote the formation of lapo4 with the anion group h2po4 or hpo4 2 through electrostatic attraction so that the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle has a higher separation efficiency the alkaline deprotonated surface is dominated by negative charge and the electrostatic repulsion increases which is not conducive to the removal of phosphate so the separation efficiency decreases in practical applications different from traditional filter membrane materials 35 the phosphate separation process can be effectively and conveniently controlled by directly adjusting the thickness of the filter layer wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle dosage the thickness of the filtration layer will directly affect the permeate flux in the separation process and the phosphate separation efficiency will also be affected to some extent therefore it is necessary to investigate the effects of different thickness of filtration layer on permeation flux and separation efficiency fig 5b clearly shows that the permeate flux of the wastewater decreases rapidly as the thickness of the filter layer increases from 0 5 cm to 2 0 cm meanwhile the phosphate separation efficiency increased rapidly to 99 9 when the thickness of the filter layer increased from 0 5 cm to 1 0 cm the variation of permeate flux with the thickness of the filtration layer can be explained by classical fluid dynamics theory hagen poiseuille formula 36 37 detail equation was shown in supplementary information when the filtration layer is determined ε and rp are fixed and the ground viscosity μ of the same wastewater is the same it is obvious that the permeation flux is inversely proportional to the effective permeation distance l that is the thicker the filtration layer the smaller the permeate flux as the separation efficiency has reached 99 9 when the filter layer thickness reaches 1 0 cm the separation efficiency reaches saturation with the increase of the filter layer thickness therefore the filter layer with a thickness of 1 0 cm permeation flux of 394 6 l m2 h was fixed as optimum thickness for the rest of the batch phosphate separation in the process of separation the concentration of phosphate may affect the efficiency of the separation process therefore the separation efficiency under different initial concentration of phosphate was studied fig 6a shows the effect of initial concentration on phosphate separation and it can be seen that initial phosphate concentrations had slight effect on the separation efficiency the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles exhibit high phosphate separation efficiency 85 as initial phosphate concentration increases from 20 to 100 mg l in addition the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles exhibit enhanced phosphorus removal properties with separation efficiency of 91 65 at initial concentration of 40 mg l which were significantly higher than that of wb and wb fe2o3 particles the enhanced phosphorus removal properties may be attributed to the high bet specific surface area and strong binding ability of la oh 3 and po4 3 under the same separation conditions wb and wb fe2o3 particles have poor phosphate removal ability with an average separation efficiency of about 5 and 9 respectively by contrast the phosphate removal efficiency of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles is 10 times higher than that of the bare wb and wb fe2o3 particles with an average removal efficiency of 90 the competitive ions of phosphoric acid ions in water will affect the efficiency of phosphate removal in practical application therefore the influence of co3 2 so4 2 no3 cl and f on the separation efficiency was also studied as can be seen from fig 6b most anions have no significant influence on the phosphate removal efficiency indicating the high phosphate selectivity for wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles the presence of so4 2 and f affected the phosphate removal efficiency to some extent but the separation efficiency was still above 70 it is also noticed from the fig 6b that phosphate removal efficiency decreases with increasing ionic strength mainly due to the adsorption sites of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles being occupied by co anions at high concentrations in conclusion wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle has high phosphate selectivity and shows superior anti interference ability due to the complexity of the actual separation environment the durability and cyclicity of the filter material are important evaluation criteria in practical application in order to explore the recyclability of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle filter layer the phosphate separation process of wastewater was carried out once 30 ml and then it was left to dry for 40 h before the phosphate separation process resumes the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle filtration layer was cycled for 7 times and the phosphate separation efficiency and permeate flux are shown in fig 7 it is indicated that the separation efficiency of the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles is still close to that of the first time 99 when the second phosphate separation is carried out the separation efficiency drops to 91 7 when the third cycle is carried out the separation efficiency is still 50 when the seventh cycle is carried out the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles exhibit a stable permeate flux after 5 cycles the reason for the gradual decrease of separation efficiency and permeate flux is that lapo4 precipitates are deposited on the surface of the filter layer after each separation which leads to the consumption of active components in the filter layer and the decrease of surface porosity of continuous phase the results suggests the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle is a promising material for phosphate removal from wastewater 4 conclusions in conclusion wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles as column packing materials were prepared by resource modification of waste brick slag with fe2o3 and la oh 3 as active components and the surface properties of the particles and column separation for phosphorus were studied the results demonstrate that wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles have rough surface and rich porous structure and the active components of la oh 3 plays a major role in phosphate separation process the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles have excellent phosphate removal efficiency with the highest phosphate separation efficiency up to 99 9 and excellent phosphate removal efficiency in a wide ph range 3 0 8 0 in addition wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles also showed strong anti interference ability and certain cycling performance the results show that when the infiltration flow rate is about 400 l m2 h it is more economical to remove phosphate by column separation the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles successful preparation and application in the removal of phosphate in wastewater indicate that it has significant application prospects in the field of water remediation and provides an alternative method for the recovery and utilization of construction waste declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

use the pretreatment process of wb is shown in scheme 1a 2 3 preparation of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles were prepared by sequential deposition of fe2o3 and la oh 3 nanoparticles on the surface of brick slag particles according to the reported methods with a modification 34 typically 5 406 g of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved into 50 ml ethanol to form a homogeneous solution then 10 g of wb was immersed into above mixture solution and the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 0 with dilute hydrochloric acid after that the mixture was placed in a 0 5 l of flask and maintained at a temperature of 80 c with continual mechanical stirring for 20 h the resulting solid was filtered washed with deionized water and dried at 80 c in an air oven finally the dried products were calcined in the muffle furnace at 400 c for 4 h to obtain the iron oxide loaded waste brick particles wb fe2o3 the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles were fabricated by deposition of la oh 3 using wb fe2o3 as supports in a typical procedure 10 g of wb fe2o3 particles were immersed into 200 ml of mixture solution containing 12 98 g of la no3 3 6h2o with the ph value adjusted to 8 with ammonium hydroxide followed by stirring of the mixture for 2 h after that the resulting precipitate was left 20 h at 80 c for aging after which the slurry was filtered and washed three times with distilled water to obtain wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles the preparation process of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 is shown in scheme 1b 2 4 characterization the morphology and surface structure of wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta 200 usa and the composition of samples was measured by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds jem 2100 the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and pore structure of wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 were investigated by a micromeritics asap 3020 volumetric adsorption analyzer the crystal structures of these particles were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd jeol jdx 3530 tokyo japan with cu kα radiation with a scanning speed of 4 min in the 2θ range from 10 to 80 the surface groups of the samples were analyzed by fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrophotometer thermo nicolet nexus tm in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 the surface element composition and chemical valences of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 before and after phosphate adsorption were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps on thermo escalab 250 xi 2 5 batch phosphate separation experiment the phosphate separation was carried out by batch penetration experiments and conducted by the separation column the inner diameter is 1 1 cm whose packing was wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles with different concentrations of phosphate solution the column separation process was completely driven by gravity without an external force in a typical phosphate separation process the as prepared wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles was tightly packed in a separation column and then the liquid passes through the packing layer under the drive of gravity the phosphate separation experiment process was described in scheme 2 the properties of the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles in terms of the separation efficiency for the treatment of phosphate solution under different influencing factors such as solution ph initial phosphate concentration packing layer thickness presence of interfering ions after phosphate separation the separated filtrate is collected into a clean centrifuge tube at a constant flow rate and the phosphate content in the separated filtrate was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkin elmer optima 2100dv all phosphate separation experiments were replicated twice 2 6 performance testing in the process of phosphate removal the separation efficiency and permeation flux were studied and the separation properties of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles under different operating conditions were analyzed the calculation method of permeation flux j is as follows 1 j v a δt where v l is the volume of permeable liquid a m2 is the effective separation area and δt h is the permeable time the separation efficiency r can be calculated by the following formula 2 r 1 c f c 0 100 where c0 mg l and cf mg l are respectively the phosphate concentration in the wastewater before separation and the phosphate concentration in the filtrate after separation 3 results and discussion the surface properties of surface functionalized particles such as microstructure and chemical composition play an important role in phosphate separation the microstructure and surface morphology of wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 were characterized by sem fig 1 shows the sem images of wb particles and surface functionalized particles with different magnifications as can be seen from fig 1a after mechanical grinding the surface of the wb presents uneven particles most of which are distributed in the diameter of 10 30 μm this micrometer sized wb is a suitable column packing material allowing the separation column to maintain a high permeation flux but the lack of corresponding active adsorption sites on the surface is a limitation fig 1b shows that the single granular surface is relatively smooth and the surface structure of the wb provides a large area for the deposition of metal hydroxides and oxides fig 1c and d show the morphology of wb fe2o3 indicating that the curved gullies in the pre treated brick slag are partially buried by amorphous iron oxide meanwhile compared with the bare brick slag the pore structure is more obvious the diameter of the pore is about 2 μm which is easy to precipitate la oh 3 on the surface as shown in fig 1e the morphology of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 is similar to that of the original brick slag but the original surface is covered by cluster la oh 3 precipitates the diameter of uneven particles is about 1 5 times larger than that of the bare wb particles and the zigzag gullies between particles are narrowed as shown in the enlarged fig 1f the surface roughness of the material increases significantly and enriched a large number of micro nano particles which provides abundant active sites and is conducive to the removal of phosphate in the wastewater in conclusion the micron structure of particles make it maintain high mechanical strength and high permeation flux while weakening the dissolution effect of nano particles combined with abundant active sites on the particles the feasibility of column separation and phosphorus removal was ensured meanwhile x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds analysis was performed the fig s1 showed more peaks of la and fe indicating that the corresponding compounds of la and fe were successfully loaded on the slag surface ft ir spectra and xrd patterns can reveal the loading process and structural evolution of metal oxides and hydroxides on the waste brick slag the wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 composition were investigated by ft ir and the results are shown in fig 2a as shown in fig 2a wb fe2o3 la oh 3 shows two peaks at about 3500 cm 1 and 1500 cm 1 which is caused by the stretching vibration of ho bond on the material surface 4 since there are fewer ho bonds on the surface of discarded brick slag when metal hydroxide and oxide are not loaded there is no obvious peak of wb curve by observing the ft ir fingerprint region fig 2a it was found that compared with the wb curve the characteristic peak of feo bond appeared in the wb fe2o3 curve at about 441 cm 1 similarly the characteristic peaks of feo bond and lao bond appear at 441 cm 1 and 428 cm 1 respectively in wb fe2o3 la oh 3 curve 27 it can be preliminarily determined that fe oxide and la hydroxide were loaded on the surface of waste brick slag successively to investigate the composition and crystallinity transformations of the samples the wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 were analyzed by xrd and the results are shown in fig 2b the typical characteristic peaks of the wb appear at 2θ 20 7 26 6 36 3 39 4 42 5 50 0 59 8 and 68 0 corresponding to the crystal planes of 100 011 100 102 200 112 121 and 203 of sio2 jcpds card no 74 1811 apart from the characteristic reflections of the sio2 four new characteristic peaks of at 2θ 24 3 29 8 55 0 64 3 and 76 5 were observed in wb fe2o3 samples and indexed to the 012 220 116 300 and 553 planes of fe2o3 jcpds card no 33 0664 compared with the wb the characteristic reflections of sio2 are slightly decreased implying that fe2o3 particles are successfully deposited on the surfaces of wb particles the xrd pattern of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 shows that the sio2 characteristic peak in the waste brick slag originally located at 2θ 20 7 26 6 50 0 and 68 0 is obviously weakened while the characteristic peak of fe2o3 appears the characteristic peaks of la oh 3 appear at 2θ 27 3 27 9 39 5 48 2 48 5 and 55 2 110 101 201 300 211 and 112 planes correspond to la oh 3 jcpds card no 83 2034 respectively the above results indicate that wb fe2o3 la oh 3 has been successfully prepared in order to determine the surface properties and pore structure changes of the as fabricated materials the bjh pore size distribution and specific surface area of wb wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 were determined by nitrogen adsorption and desorption n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of wb is shown in fig s2 fig 3a and b shows that the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 are of type iv and the adsorption hysteresis ring appears in the middle and back section which is usually related to the capillary condensation effect in mesoporous materials the results show that wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles have mesoporous structure the adsorption hysteresis ring shows that it has no obvious saturated adsorption platform and is a type of h3 or h4 mesoporous hysteresis ring in addition the pore size distribution of bjh indicates that the mesopore diameter of wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles is widely distributed ranging from 1 nm to 15 nm the pore size distribution of bjh in both of them retains the characteristics of the porous structure of the original brick slag and is conducive to the removal of phosphate in water this mesoporous nanostructure enables the particles to possess strong adsorption capacity and at the same time combined with micron particles ensures high permeation flux and phosphate separation efficiency during column separation process the results show that the specific surface area of the original waste brick slag particles is 4 50 m2 g and the specific surface area of wb fe2o3 and wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles is 51 82 m2 g and 56 11 m2 g respectively compared with the bare wb particles the specific surface area of the brick slag is increased by 12 times after loading fe2o3 and la oh 3 which greatly increases the specific surface area of the material the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles have good porous structure and larger specific surface area than the original brick slag which provides convenience for the removal of phosphate in wastewater in order to study the changes of surface chemical composition during phosphate separation xps analysis were performed on the sample materials the composition changes of particles before and after phosphate removal were investigated by xps and the results are shown in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4a the absorption peaks of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles appear at binding energies of 284 37 ev 531 19 ev and 102 51 ev which are characteristic peaks of c o and si respectively consistent with the main composition of the original brick slag the absorption peaks at 835 01 ev and 710 41 ev represent the existence of lao and feo bonds respectively the results show that wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles are successfully synthesized which is consistent with the ft ir and xrd patterns after the phosphate separation experiment a new absorption peak appeared on wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle as shown in in fig 4a and d which corresponded to p2p in phosphate in wastewater in fig 4b the la3d spectrum at 835 855 ev binding energy corresponds to the la3d in la oh 3 on wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle after the phosphate separation test it can be seen that the peak strength decreased significantly in fig 4c the fe2p spectrum at the binding energy of 705 730 ev corresponds to the fe2p spectrum in fe2o3 on wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle after the phosphate separation experiment the peak strength does not change significantly this is because in the process of phosphate separation la oh 3 in wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle plays a major chemical role the separation mechanism process is shown in scheme 3 and the mechanism of action is as follows 21 3 la oh h 2 po 4 la h 2 p o 4 oh 4 la oh hpo 4 la hp o 4 oh 5 la oh po 4 3 la p o 4 oh based on the above xps results ft ir spectra shown in fig s3 and the mechanism equation the basic process of phosphate removal with wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles was expounded when the wastewater passes through wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle layer by self weight infiltration the chemical reaction of kh2po4 in the wastewater occurs as above to generate lapo4 precipitate due to the super binding ability of la and phosphate the phosphate in the wastewater is fixed in the form of precipitation which achieves the purpose of phosphate removal from the wastewater the actual environment is a complex system of many factors to evaluate the application potential of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles the separation performance of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles under different conditions including ph separation flux initial phosphate concentration and coexisting ions was investigated it is very important to study the effect of ph on the separation process because the surface active components of materials are affected by the acid base environment the effect of ph value on the phosphate separation efficiency of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles was studied in the range of ph 3 0 11 0 by using an initial phosphate concentration of 100 mg l the results are shown in fig 5a which proves that ph has a certain influence on the separation process it can be clearly observed from fig 5a that wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle has a relatively high separation efficiency 85 in a wide ph range 3 0 8 0 and the maximum phosphate separation efficiency reaches 93 47 when the ph is 3 0 4 0 when the ph value was 9 0 the separation efficiency decreases gradually in alkaline environment from 77 7 to 53 6 this is because the protonation of the sample material is expected to make the surface of la oh 3 positively charged in the acid environment and promote the formation of lapo4 with the anion group h2po4 or hpo4 2 through electrostatic attraction so that the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle has a higher separation efficiency the alkaline deprotonated surface is dominated by negative charge and the electrostatic repulsion increases which is not conducive to the removal of phosphate so the separation efficiency decreases in practical applications different from traditional filter membrane materials 35 the phosphate separation process can be effectively and conveniently controlled by directly adjusting the thickness of the filter layer wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle dosage the thickness of the filtration layer will directly affect the permeate flux in the separation process and the phosphate separation efficiency will also be affected to some extent therefore it is necessary to investigate the effects of different thickness of filtration layer on permeation flux and separation efficiency fig 5b clearly shows that the permeate flux of the wastewater decreases rapidly as the thickness of the filter layer increases from 0 5 cm to 2 0 cm meanwhile the phosphate separation efficiency increased rapidly to 99 9 when the thickness of the filter layer increased from 0 5 cm to 1 0 cm the variation of permeate flux with the thickness of the filtration layer can be explained by classical fluid dynamics theory hagen poiseuille formula 36 37 detail equation was shown in supplementary information when the filtration layer is determined ε and rp are fixed and the ground viscosity μ of the same wastewater is the same it is obvious that the permeation flux is inversely proportional to the effective permeation distance l that is the thicker the filtration layer the smaller the permeate flux as the separation efficiency has reached 99 9 when the filter layer thickness reaches 1 0 cm the separation efficiency reaches saturation with the increase of the filter layer thickness therefore the filter layer with a thickness of 1 0 cm permeation flux of 394 6 l m2 h was fixed as optimum thickness for the rest of the batch phosphate separation in the process of separation the concentration of phosphate may affect the efficiency of the separation process therefore the separation efficiency under different initial concentration of phosphate was studied fig 6a shows the effect of initial concentration on phosphate separation and it can be seen that initial phosphate concentrations had slight effect on the separation efficiency the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles exhibit high phosphate separation efficiency 85 as initial phosphate concentration increases from 20 to 100 mg l in addition the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles exhibit enhanced phosphorus removal properties with separation efficiency of 91 65 at initial concentration of 40 mg l which were significantly higher than that of wb and wb fe2o3 particles the enhanced phosphorus removal properties may be attributed to the high bet specific surface area and strong binding ability of la oh 3 and po4 3 under the same separation conditions wb and wb fe2o3 particles have poor phosphate removal ability with an average separation efficiency of about 5 and 9 respectively by contrast the phosphate removal efficiency of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles is 10 times higher than that of the bare wb and wb fe2o3 particles with an average removal efficiency of 90 the competitive ions of phosphoric acid ions in water will affect the efficiency of phosphate removal in practical application therefore the influence of co3 2 so4 2 no3 cl and f on the separation efficiency was also studied as can be seen from fig 6b most anions have no significant influence on the phosphate removal efficiency indicating the high phosphate selectivity for wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles the presence of so4 2 and f affected the phosphate removal efficiency to some extent but the separation efficiency was still above 70 it is also noticed from the fig 6b that phosphate removal efficiency decreases with increasing ionic strength mainly due to the adsorption sites of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles being occupied by co anions at high concentrations in conclusion wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle has high phosphate selectivity and shows superior anti interference ability due to the complexity of the actual separation environment the durability and cyclicity of the filter material are important evaluation criteria in practical application in order to explore the recyclability of wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle filter layer the phosphate separation process of wastewater was carried out once 30 ml and then it was left to dry for 40 h before the phosphate separation process resumes the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle filtration layer was cycled for 7 times and the phosphate separation efficiency and permeate flux are shown in fig 7 it is indicated that the separation efficiency of the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles is still close to that of the first time 99 when the second phosphate separation is carried out the separation efficiency drops to 91 7 when the third cycle is carried out the separation efficiency is still 50 when the seventh cycle is carried out the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles exhibit a stable permeate flux after 5 cycles the reason for the gradual decrease of separation efficiency and permeate flux is that lapo4 precipitates are deposited on the surface of the filter layer after each separation which leads to the consumption of active components in the filter layer and the decrease of surface porosity of continuous phase the results suggests the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particle is a promising material for phosphate removal from wastewater 4 conclusions in conclusion wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles as column packing materials were prepared by resource modification of waste brick slag with fe2o3 and la oh 3 as active components and the surface properties of the particles and column separation for phosphorus were studied the results demonstrate that wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles have rough surface and rich porous structure and the active components of la oh 3 plays a major role in phosphate separation process the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles have excellent phosphate removal efficiency with the highest phosphate separation efficiency up to 99 9 and excellent phosphate removal efficiency in a wide ph range 3 0 8 0 in addition wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles also showed strong anti interference ability and certain cycling performance the results show that when the infiltration flow rate is about 400 l m2 h it is more economical to remove phosphate by column separation the wb fe2o3 la oh 3 particles successful preparation and application in the removal of phosphate in wastewater indicate that it has significant application prospects in the field of water remediation and provides an alternative method for

12621,the development of efficient sonocatalysts is of great significance to the treatment of antibiotic wastewater herein an s scheme sonocatalyst cu2o bifeo3 has been fabricated using a simple synthesis method in which cu2o nanoparticles grow on the surface of bifeo3 tetracycline tet was selected as a representative pharmaceutical model to systematically evaluate the sonocatalytic performance of the cu2o bifeo3 the experimental results showed that optimized cu2o bifeo3 cbf 3 has superior sonocatalytic performance to tet 98 0 0 02302 min 1 which is much higher than that of pure bifeo3 54 6 0 00515 min 1 combined with the experimental result and characterization analysis the sonodegradation mechanism was discussed the improved sonocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the s scheme charge transfer mechanism between cu2o and bifeo3 which can simultaneously inhibit sonoelectron hole recombination promote carrier transfer maintain high redox capacity and generate more active substance the possible intermediate products and degradation pathways of tet over cbf 3 were analyzed by ion chromatography and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry furthermore the results of the bacterial toxicity test indicated that the toxicity of the reaction solution decreased significantly after sonodegradation this study provides a simple way for the rational design and successful preparation of s scheme sonocatalyst with promising applications in the remediation of the water environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cu2o bifeo3 s scheme heterojunction sonocatalytic degradation tetracycline data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the treatment of environmental water pollution has received increasing attention with the rapid development of modern industrialization 1 many substances are found in different water environments antibiotic drugs herbicides dyes etc 2 5 it is worth noting that intemperate and inappropriate use of antibiotic drugs to pollute aquatic environments such as lakes and rivers can lead to the growth and ecotoxicity of drug resistant bacteria 6 8 therefore the treatment of antibiotic residues in environmental water is imperative due to the antibacterial properties of antibiotics traditional biological treatment processes in sewage treatment systems cannot effectively decompose them into low toxicity or nontoxic substances 9 10 recently ultrasonic us driven semiconductor sonocatalysis has garnered more attention in the remediation of water environmental due to its environmentally friendly effortless operation safety and high decomposition efficiency 11 12 the technique is one of the advanced oxidation processes aops that relies on the coexistence of appropriate sonocatalysts and us irradiation the sonocatalytic process is based mainly on sonoluminescence and hot spots derived from us cavitation defined as the formation growth and collapse of microbubbles within an aqueous solution 13 14 on the one hand the action of high temperature and high pressure generated by a local hot spots can cause the thermal excitation of electrons of the semiconductor sonocatalyst from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb on the other hand sonoluminescence irradiation induced by the collapse of bubbles in the cavitation effect can excite the sonocatalyst to produce electron hole pairs e h 14 additionally the effect of sonoluminescence and hot spots can also lead to the splitting of water molecules to form a small fraction of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals h and oh 15 hence it is essential and urgent to exploit efficient semiconductor sonocatalysts bismuth ferrite bifeo3 as an n type semiconductor is a multiferroic material with concurrent ferroelectric and magnetic properties at room temperature because of its ferroelectricity the material can induce spontaneous electrical polarization which acts as an internal electric field to promote charge separation and migration to the material s surface in addition as a result of its magnetic properties it can be convenient magnetically separate to reduce repair costs and avoid secondary contamination therefore bifeo3 is a favorable candidate for efficient semiconductor sonocatalysts with the privileges and mechanisms described above be that as it may bifeo3 like many semiconductors has the disadvantages of low charge separation and fast recombination of e and h which seriously affect its sonocatalytic process and are expected to be improved in recent years it has been an ideal strategy to prolong carrier lifetime and accelerate interfacial charge transfer for rational design construction of heterojunctions by coupling two semiconductors whose band edge sites are staggered 16 17 li et al demonstrated an improved photocatalytic degradation of sulfamerazine by using bi2o3 composited with tio2 18 tizhoosh et al enhanced the sonocatalytic degradation performance of tylosin by ws2 composited with ceo2 19 it is worth noting that the s scheme system e g s cl g c3n4 cdse d 20 snnb2o6 cdse det 21 w18o49 g c3n4 22 can enhance the spatial separation of carriers in the heterostructure and retain stronger redox ability compared to traditional type ii heterojunctions thus significantly improving the catalytic activity cu2o as an important semiconductor material has attracted more and more attention by virtue of its low cost and diverse morphologies however the factors that limit many catalysts such as low photostability and carrier separation efficiency 23 25 also limit the application of monomer cu2o in recent years cu2o as a p type semiconductor has a narrow band gap and an appropriate valence band position so it is widely used to broaden the spectral absorption region of substrates to inhibit carrier reorganization to improve its catalytic performance 26 27 cu2o with the above advantages can be coupled with bifeo3 to form a p n heterojunction which is easy to guide and redistribute carriers driven by fermi level equilibrium taking into account the appropriate staggered energy band structure and the predictable p n heterojunction cu2o may be an effective semiconductor material with bifeo3 to construct high performance s scheme sonocatalysts with strong redox ability to our knowledge the facile preparation and us driven sonocatalytic removal of antibiotics of the p n heterojunction cu2o bifeo3 have never been reported the underlying properties of cu2o bifeo3 sonocatalytic degradation route of antibiotics toxicological evaluation and relevant mechanism speculation in an s scheme model ought to be systematically and in depth investigated based on the analysis presented above cu2o bifeo3 heterojunctions were constructed by a simple synthesis method and subsequently characterized by various instruments tetracycline tet as an effective antibiotic compound is widely used to treat various infectious diseases since most of the tet consumed is excreted through urine and feces in an unmetabolized and undegraded form the presence of tet in wastewater is unavoidable 28 29 due to its broad applicability high water solubility and low biodegradation 30 tet was selected as a representative pharmaceutical model to systematically researched the sonocatalytic performance of cu2o bifeo3 the emphasis was given to the influence of the cu2o to bifeo3 ratio the primary operational parameters on the degradation efficiency of the tet as well as the reusability and stability of cu2o bifeo3 in addition the possible intermediate products and the degradation pathways of tet over cu2o bifeo3 were investigated by ion chromatography ic and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms measurement the sonocatalytic mechanism of cu2o bifeo3 was explored in detail finally the toxicity of the reaction solution after sonodegradation was studied through a bacterial toxicity test 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials tetracycline c22h24n2o8

adjust the corresponding factors in the single factor experiment after adding cu2o bifeo3 to the tet solution the above solution was stirred in darkness for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of

were characterized by sem in fig 2 the obtained bifeo3 exhibits an irregular spherical architecture with a diameter of 0 5 2 0 μm in fig 2a the magnified sem images in fig 2b show that the surface of bifeo3 is smooth and has some folds after being composited some small particles appear on the outer surface of cu2o bifeo3 without changing the irregular spherical structure fig 2c and d indicating that cu2o has been successfully modified on the surface of bifeo3 tem and hrtem were used to observe the microstructure of cu2o bifeo3 further to confirm the formation of the heterojunction fig 3a and b in the hrtem image the clear lattice spacing of 0 20 and 0 28 nm fig 3b are consistent with the crystal plane 211 of cu2o and 104 of bifeo3 in addition the tem element mapping images of fe o bi and cu in fig 3c indicate the intimate contact and homogenous distribution of cu2o 32 and bifeo3 33 in the heterojunction constructed which was conducive to facilitating charge transfer by reducing the resistance to interfacial contact to further define the crystal structures of the cu2o bifeo3 and series of cu2o bifeo3 composites xrd technology was used in fig 4a the diffraction peaks in the curve of pure cu2o prepared at 2θ 29 6 36 5 42 3 61 4 and 73 5 are well indexed to the crystal planes 110 111 200 220 and 311 of cu2o jcpds no 65 3288 34 for pure bifeo3 prepared the diffraction peaks at 2θ 22 4 31 8 32 1 37 64 39 5 39 6 45 8 51 3 51 8 56 4 57 1 and 57 1 are corresponded to the crystallographic planes 012 104 110 113 006 202 024 116 122 018 214 and 300 of bifeo3 jcpds no 86 1518 35 however the xrd pattern of the series of cu2o bifeo3 composites only reveals the characteristic peaks of bifeo3 without cu2o perhaps due to the low xrd strength of pure cu2o and its low content 36 37 xps analysis was employed to study the chemical composition and valence states of the as synthesized bifeo3 cu2o and cbf 3 38 39 clearly the xps survey spectra fig 4b of cbf 3 show the presence of elements bi o fe and cu which is consistent with the eds results from the high resolution xps spectrum of bi 4f fig 4c the binding energies of 164 05 and 158 70 ev are indexed to bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 of bi3 in pristine bifeo3 40 for the element fe fig 4d in pristine bifeo3 the two peaks at 710 10 and 723 50 ev are ascribed to fe2 and the other two peaks at 711 90 and 726 80 ev are attributed to fe3 implying the coexistence of fe2 and fe3 besides the presence of two satellite peaks 718 20 and 732 05 ev in the spectrum may be the result of fe3 reacting with hydroxyl introduced in the reaction process to produce a small amount of feooh 41 42 for the element o fig 4e the binding energies of 529 90 and 531 85 ev were corresponded to the lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancy in pristine bifeo3 43 for the element cu fig 4f in pristine cu2o the two main peaks at 934 62 and 954 48 ev were attributed to cu and the other two peaks at 933 12 and 952 98 ev were ascribed to cu2 32 it is noteworthy that the binding energies of bi 4f fe 2p and cu 2p of cbf 3 were shifted compared to those of pristine bifeo3 and cu2o fig 3b the change in binding energy may be due to the strong interaction between the cu2o and bifeo3 phases rather than physical contact suggesting the successful formation of the cu2o bifeo3 heterojunction 36 37 in addition perhaps due to the presence of low valance cu after cu2o decoration 44 cbf 3 has significantly more oxygen vacancy than pure bifeo3 which contributed to providing additional active sites 45 n2 adsorption analysis was applied to study the specific surface area and porosity of the prepared materials evidently both bifeo3 and cu2o bifeo3 exhibit type iv isotherms iupac classification indicating that all materials have pore structures in fig 5a the bet specific surface areas of bifeo3 and cu2o bifeo3 are 20 871 and 21 285 m2 g 1 respectively it is worth noting that cu2o bifeo3 verified a larger pore volume 0 129 cm3 g 1 as well as wider pore size distribution compared with pure bifeo3 in fig 5b which facilitates the removal of contaminants by exposing more active sites and providing convenient mass transfer pathways to study the intrinsic reasons behind the excellent sonodegradation performance of cu2o bifeo3 uv vis drs and mott schottky plots were used to measure the energy band structure the uv vis drs spectra of the materials are shown and compared in fig 6a compared to the original cu2o and bifeo3 cu2o bifeo3 displays elevated visible light absorption which is mainly due to the effective use of more visible light by the energy levels of the surface state formed between cu2o and bifeo3 in the heterojunction according to kubelka munk theory the band gaps eg of cu2o and bifeo3 were 1 95 ev and 2 12 ev respectively in fig 6b further mott schottky analysis was performed to study the flat band potential ef and semiconductor type of the photocatalyst the slopes of the mott schottky plots fig 6c and d indicate the n type semiconducting feature of bifeo3 and the p type semiconducting feature of cu2o the ef of bifeo3 and cu2o are assessed to be 0 44 v and 1 97 v vs sce 0 20 and 2 21 v vs nhe respectively as the ef of semiconductors is 0 1 0 3 v higher than the conduction band potential ecb in the n type semiconductors and 0 1 0 3 v lower than the valence band potential evb in the p type semiconductors 46 the corresponding ecb of bifeo3 and evb of cu2o were 0 40 v and 2 41 v vs nhe respectively according to eg evb ecb 47 the corresponding evb of bifeo3 and ecb of cu2o were 1 72 v and 0 46 v vs nhe respectively photoluminescence pl spectroscopy was utilized to assess the ability to suppress the recombination of electron hole pairs as shown in fig 7 pure bifeo3 exhibits the highest intensity of light emission after being compounded with cu2o the emission intensity of cbf 3 is significantly reduced which is attributed to the formation of heterojunctions between bifeo3 and cu2o which effectively inhibits the carrier recombination and improves the charge transfer efficiency 48 3 2 influence of cu2o content on the sonocatalytic performance of cu2o bifeo3 composites the adsorption and sonodegradation efficiencies of tet in the presence of cu2o bifeo3 and cu2o bifeo3 composites with the different mass ratios of cu2o were displayed in fig 8 pure bifeo3 showed a low adsorption ability to tet and the adsorption efficiency was only 15 03 3 17 compared to pure bifeo3 all prepared cu2o bifeo3 composites cbf 1 cbf 3 cbf 5 displayed a remarkable higher adsorption ability to tet which was benefited by the presence of cu2o in cu2o bifeo3 composites noticeably the removal efficiency of tet by the prepared cu2o bifeo3 composites is higher than that of pure bifeo3 the reason for the above results is not only that the improved adsorption performance increases the contact between cu2o bifeo3 and tet but also that the heterostructure formed by cu2o and bifeo3 effectively inhibits the recombination of heat and sonoluminescence induced e h pairs the inadequate content of cu2o limits the contact area between cu2o and bifeo3 making it impossible to effectively suppress the recombination of sonoluminescence and thermoluminescence e h pairs excess cu2o content may lead to cu2o agglomeration on the surface of bifeo3 which may reduce the dispersion and cover active sites thus reducing the sonocatalytic performance of cu2o bifeo3 composites finally cbf 3 was chosen for the following experiment because it showed the best removal efficiency for tet in the above experiments 3 3 influence of experimental parameters on the sonocatalytic degradation of tet 3 3 1 addition amount of cbf 3 the effect of the addition amount of cbf 3 on the adsorption and sonodegradation of tet was researched as can be seen from fig 9a the degradation efficiency of tet first increased and then decreased with the increase of the addition amount of cbf 3 the uppermost degradation efficiency of tet reached 97 98 0 43 when the addition amount of cbf 3 was 1 0 g l 1 it is worth noting that when the addition amount of cbf 3 was higher than 1 0 g l 1 the degradation efficiency of tet decreased which may be due to the aggregation of excessive catalysts in the solution leading to mutual cover up thus reducing the exposure of the active site and hindering the sonoluminescence therefore 1 0 g l 1 was selected as the addition amount of cbf 3 for the following experiments 3 3 2 initial concentration of tet the influence of tet concentration was assessed in the initial concentration from 10 to 80 mg l 1 as shown in fig 9b the removal efficiency gradually decreases with increasing tet concentration the reason for this phenomenon may be that the balance between the tet and the active site of the catalyst is destroyed with the gradual rise of the tet concentration thus reducing the degradation efficiency at the initial concentration of tet of 20 mg l 1 the removal efficiency of tet was about 98 0 therefore 20 mg l 1 was selected as the initial concentration of tet to research the sonocatalytic degradation performance of cbf 3 in this work 3 3 3 initial ph of the tet solution the ph value of the solution is a significant parameter in wastewater treatment the influence of ph on the sonocatalytic activity was investigated to determine the applicability of cbf 3 to remove tet wastewater as shown in fig 9c cbf 3 maintains a high sonocatalytic degradation efficiency for tet more than 97 2 within the initial ph range of the solution of 5 8 which indicates that cbf 3 has excellent environmental adaptability exhibiting good practical application potential 3 3 4 us irradiation power the us irradiation power is an important influencing factor in the process of sonocatalytic degradation as shown in fig 9d the degradation efficiency of the tet increased from 83 5 to 98 0 with the increase of us irradiation power from 100 to 500 w this experimental phenomenon can be clarified as follows first the rise of us irradiation power can promote the generation of cavitation bubbles and thus produce more reactive oxygen species 49 50 then the increase of the us irradiation power can enhance the deaggregating of the catalyst and the cleaning effect of sonolysis which is conducive to exposing more effective active sites on the catalyst surface 50 finally the turbulence in the solution becomes larger with the increase in us irradiation power increasing the mass transfer rates of tet free intermediates and radicals between cbf 3 and the solution 49 51 therefore 500 w was chosen as the us irradiation power for the following experiment 3 3 5 us irradiation time the sonocatalytic decomposition of tet in the presence of cbf 3 was researched with the change of the us irradiation time as can be seen from fig 10a the degradation efficiencies of tet showed an upward trend with the extension of the us irradiation time when the reaction reached 120 min the degradation efficiencies of tet in the us us bifeo3 and us cbf 3 systems were 14 6 54 6 and 98 0 respectively the study of the kinetic model of the sonocatalytic degradation rate is helpful for the design of the actual wastewater treatment process so the experimental data are processed by a pseudo first order model the kapp values of the sonocatalytic degradation of tet in the presence of us alone us bifeo3 and us cbf 3 were calculated to be 0 00129 0 00515 and 0 02302 min 1 respectively notably the kapp of cbf 3 is the highest which is approximately 4 5 and 17 9 times that of us bifeo3 and us alone indicating that cbf 3 as a sonocatalyst can significantly enhance the degradation efficiency of tet under us irradiation compared to some catalysts reported in literatures table s1 the cbf 3 has a simple preparation process convenient separation process magnetic separation as well as good sonocatalytic performance 3 4 sonocatalytic mechanism the radical trapping tests were used to explore the active species such as holes h superoxide radicals o2 hydroxyl radicals oh in ultrasound driven catalytic oxidation for tet 52 as exhibited in fig 11 the cbf 3 showed good degradation ability without adding a scavenger and the sonodegradation efficiency reaches 97 98 the degradation efficiency decreased significantly after adding tea h scavenger 53 when the addition amount reached 0 4 mol l 1 the degradation efficiency decreased to 26 3 thereby indicating that h may be the main active specie during the degradation process after adding d man oh scavenger 54 the degradation efficiency also decreased significantly cd man 1 0 mol l 1 degradation efficiency 67 6 implying that oh also played a crucial role during the sonodegradation process the degradation efficiency was slightly reduced after adding n2 o2 scavenger 55 manifesting that o2 also promoted the degradation of tet although it does not play the most important role according to the above results the order of importance is as follows h oh o2 generally the nhe potential of 0 v relative to the vacuum energy level evac is 4 6 ev the corresponding relationship between the solid state physical energy standard and the electrochemical energy standard is displayed in fig 12a combined with uv vis drs and mott schottky test results the obtained energy band diagrams of cu2o and bifeo3 are exhibited in fig 12b the ef of bifeo3 is more negative than cu2o so the work function wf wf evac ef of bifeo3 is lower than that of cu2o indicating that electrons generated from bifeo3 would be more likely to escape from the solid after composite the electrons tend to migrate from bifeo3 to cu2o at the contact interface until reaching the new fermi equilibrium level during the junction process the energy band edges in cu2o with low fermi levels gradually moved down and those in bifeo3 with high fermi levels moved up 56 subsequently the contact interface between bifeo3 and cu2o is charged thus forming an internal electric field pointing from the cb of bifeo3 to the vb of cu2o via an s scheme charge transfer pathway 57 xps spectra was applied to verify the electron migration path proposed above as can be seen from fig 4c the binding energy of bi3 in cbf 3 negatively shifted compared to bifeo3 which indicated that the sono generated electron was moved from bifeo3 to cu2o in accordance with a s scheme mechanism 58 what s more the results of radical trapping tests also indicated that the charge transfer mode of the degradation process of the tet based on cbf 3 is the s scheme charge transfer mode rather than the conventional type ii mode fig 12c because the conventional type ii charge transfer mode based on cbf 3 cannot produce reactive oxygen species oh o2 based on the above results a possible sonocatalytic mechanism of tet by cbf 3 was proposed fig 12d during the process of us irradiation the sonoluminescence phenomenon and the abundant local hot spots accompanied by extremely high temperature and pressure will be generated due to cavitation effect resulting in the decomposition of h2o molecules into oh and h 59 60 according to the results of the capture experiment the oh played an important role in the sonocatalytic degradation of tet however the degradation efficiency of tet is very low under the condition of us irradiation without catalyst manifesting that the generation rate and the yield of oh produced by the cavitation effect are limited when the sonocatalyst exists in the system cbf 3 as a heterogeneous catalyst can act as a supplementary core to increase the output oh by increasing the generation rate and the number of cavitation bubbles and ultimately enhancing the degradation of tet in addition according to the s scheme charge transfer mechanism e generated on the cb of bifeo3 can be rapidly transferred to the vb of cu2o and combined with h on vb of cu2o at the same time the accumulated h in the vb of bifeo3 and e in the cb of cu2o will react with h2o and o2 to form oh and o2 respectively finally the reactive species generated including h oh and o2 oxidize tet together to the smaller molecules or ions such as co2 h2o or no3 h 2 o us h oh cu 2 o us h e bifeo 3 us h e e o 2 o 2 h h 2 o h oh h tet degradation product oh tet degradation product o 2 tet degradation product 3 5 change of bacteriostatic effect the biotoxicity variations were studied by exploring the inhibition rate of tet solution to escherichia coli before and after degradation as exhibited in fig 13a and b the initial tet solution has high antibacterial activity by contrast the bacteriostatic effect of the degraded tet solution was significantly weakened in fig 13c manifesting a remarkable decrease of the biotoxicity in the solution the reason for this phenomenon may be that the molecule structure of tet is closely related to its antibacterial spectrum antibacterial potency and pharmacokinetics and the sonocatalytic degradation reaction destroys the molecule structure of tet thus reducing the biotoxicity of tet the results showed that cbf 3 based sonocatalytic degradation technology was an effective method of removing the biological toxicity of tet 3 6 mineralization degree studies the intermediates produced were researched by lc ms analysis and the possible degradation pathways were speculated the main m z peaks 497 477 461 459 416 400 393 343 318 305 274 242 171 158 149 117 116 can be surveyed and the presumed decomposition paths are shown in fig 14 furthermore the ic of tet before and after sonocatalytic degradation was determined to investigate furthe the degradation products as shown in fig 14 the concentration of no3 anions was 1 29 mg l 1 in the original tet solution after the sonocatalytic decomposition the concentrations of no3 anions increased to 4 10 mg l 1 respectively the above results indicated that tet was gradually sonodegraded and converted to small molecules co2 h2o and no3 through several main pathways decarbonylation deamination dehydroxylation hydroxylation ring opening etc 3 7 reusability and stability of cbf 3 the reusability and stability of the as synthesized sonocatalyst are highly vital indexes for their practical application after the sonodegradation experiment the original catalyst was separated by an external magnet washed with deionized water and dried which could be used in the next reaction under the same conditions and reused for four times to investigate the stability of cbf 3 no special regeneration steps are required before catalyst reuse which benefits from the self cleaning characteristics of the sonocatalyst as shown in fig 15a the degradation efficiencies of tet were 98 0 97 9 96 6 and 95 3 for the four cycles respectively the slight decrease in performance after 4 runs may be due to the loss of a small amount of the recycled cbf 3 and the ions leaching of the catalyst during the experiment it is worth noting that the degradation efficiencies of tet only decreased by 2 7 after four cycles which demonstrated that cbf 3 has excellent reusability xps xrd and leaching experiments were used to investigate the stability of cbf 3 xps spectra showed that the surface element information and chemical states of cbf 3 after four cycles were the same as those of the unused cbf 3 see fig 15b moreover the results of xrd after the adsorption desorption cycles test confirmed the structural stability during application in fig 15c d the stability of cbf 3 in the process of sonocatalytic degradation was further explored by measuring the leaching amount of cu and bi3 in the solution by icp ms the concentration of cu and bi3 in the solution after sonocatalytic degradation was 0 096 mg l 1 and 0 067 mg l 1 respectively according to the addition amount of cbf 3 the leaching rate of cu and bi3 in the experiment was calculated and was only 0 078 and 0 071 respectively which manifested that cbf 3 had outstanding stability during the sonocatalytic process see table s2 in conclusion cbf 3 is a stable and recyclable sonocatalyst with great potential for practical application 3 8 comparison of the sonocatalytic performance of different drug residues tet meloxicam mlx ofloxacin ofl and ciprofloxacin cip were used to measure the sonocatalytic performance of cbf 3 for drug residues under ultrasonic conditions the results in fig 16 showed that cbf 3 had a good degradation effect on tet and mlx under ultrasonic irradiation the removal efficiency were 98 0 and 78 1 respectively nevertheless the removal efficiency of ofl and cip was only 33 8 and 44 8 respectively the reason for this difference may be that tet and mlx are more easily decomposed than ofl and cip in the sonocatalyst process due to the presence of phenolic hydroxyl groups and so on in their own structures the results showed that when the chemical structure and composition of these drugs were different the prepared cbf 3 exhibited different sonocatalytic performance 4 conclusions in summary the efficient s scheme heterojunction sonocatalyst cbf 3 was reasonably designed and successfully fabricated by simple synthesis methods profiting from the proper composition and formation of the s scheme heterojunction cbf 3 exhibits superior sonocatalyst oxidation for tet the degradation efficiency of tet reached 98 0 under optimal conditions such as 1 g l 1 cbf 3 composite 20 mg l 1 tet solution us irradiation power of 500 w and us irradiation time of 120 min the biotoxicity of the products degraded by tet was significantly reduced furthermore the results of the recycling experiment and the metal leaching experiment show that cbf 3 has good reusability and stability considering the excellent sonocatalytic performance cbf 3 is identified as a promising candidate for the remediation of the water environment and this study offers a new sight to developing a high efficiency

12621,the development of efficient sonocatalysts is of great significance to the treatment of antibiotic wastewater herein an s scheme sonocatalyst cu2o bifeo3 has been fabricated using a simple synthesis method in which cu2o nanoparticles grow on the surface of bifeo3 tetracycline tet was selected as a representative pharmaceutical model to systematically evaluate the sonocatalytic performance of the cu2o bifeo3 the experimental results showed that optimized cu2o bifeo3 cbf 3 has superior sonocatalytic performance to tet 98 0 0 02302 min 1 which is much higher than that of pure bifeo3 54 6 0 00515 min 1 combined with the experimental result and characterization analysis the sonodegradation mechanism was discussed the improved sonocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the s scheme charge transfer mechanism between cu2o and bifeo3 which can simultaneously inhibit sonoelectron hole recombination promote carrier transfer maintain high redox capacity and generate more active substance the possible intermediate products and degradation pathways of tet over cbf 3 were analyzed by ion chromatography and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry furthermore the results of the bacterial toxicity test indicated that the toxicity of the reaction solution decreased significantly after sonodegradation this study provides a simple way for the rational design and successful preparation of s scheme sonocatalyst with promising applications in the remediation of the water environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cu2o bifeo3 s scheme heterojunction sonocatalytic degradation tetracycline data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the treatment of environmental water pollution has received increasing attention with the rapid development of modern industrialization 1 many substances are found in different water environments antibiotic drugs herbicides dyes etc 2 5 it is worth noting that intemperate and inappropriate use of antibiotic drugs to pollute aquatic environments such as lakes and rivers can lead to the growth and ecotoxicity of drug resistant bacteria 6 8 therefore the treatment of antibiotic residues in environmental water is imperative due to the antibacterial properties of antibiotics traditional biological treatment processes in sewage treatment systems cannot effectively decompose them into low toxicity or nontoxic substances 9 10 recently ultrasonic us driven semiconductor sonocatalysis has garnered more attention in the remediation of water environmental due to its environmentally friendly effortless operation safety and high decomposition efficiency 11 12 the technique is one of the advanced oxidation processes aops that relies on the coexistence of appropriate sonocatalysts and us irradiation the sonocatalytic process is based mainly on sonoluminescence and hot spots derived from us cavitation defined as the formation growth and collapse of microbubbles within an aqueous solution 13 14 on the one hand the action of high temperature and high pressure generated by a local hot spots can cause the thermal excitation of electrons of the semiconductor sonocatalyst from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb on the other hand sonoluminescence irradiation induced by the collapse of bubbles in the cavitation effect can excite the sonocatalyst to produce electron hole pairs e h 14 additionally the effect of sonoluminescence and hot spots can also lead to the splitting of water molecules to form a small fraction of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals h and oh 15 hence it is essential and urgent to exploit efficient semiconductor sonocatalysts bismuth ferrite bifeo3 as an n type semiconductor is a multiferroic material with concurrent ferroelectric and magnetic properties at room temperature because of its ferroelectricity the material can induce spontaneous electrical polarization which acts as an internal electric field to promote charge separation and migration to the material s surface in addition as a result of its magnetic properties it can be convenient magnetically separate to reduce repair costs and avoid secondary contamination therefore bifeo3 is a favorable candidate for efficient semiconductor sonocatalysts with the privileges and mechanisms described above be that as it may bifeo3 like many semiconductors has the disadvantages of low charge separation and fast recombination of e and h which seriously affect its sonocatalytic process and are expected to be improved in recent years it has been an ideal strategy to prolong carrier lifetime and accelerate interfacial charge transfer for rational design construction of heterojunctions by coupling two semiconductors whose band edge sites are staggered 16 17 li et al demonstrated an improved photocatalytic degradation of sulfamerazine by using bi2o3 composited with tio2 18 tizhoosh et al enhanced the sonocatalytic degradation performance of tylosin by ws2 composited with ceo2 19 it is worth noting that the s scheme system e g s cl g c3n4 cdse d 20 snnb2o6 cdse det 21 w18o49 g c3n4 22 can enhance the spatial separation of carriers in the heterostructure and retain stronger redox ability compared to traditional type ii heterojunctions thus significantly improving the catalytic activity cu2o as an important semiconductor material has attracted more and more attention by virtue of its low cost and diverse morphologies however the factors that limit many catalysts such as low photostability and carrier separation efficiency 23 25 also limit the application of monomer cu2o in recent years cu2o as a p type semiconductor has a narrow band gap and an appropriate valence band position so it is widely used to broaden the spectral absorption region of substrates to inhibit carrier reorganization to improve its catalytic performance 26 27 cu2o with the above advantages can be coupled with bifeo3 to form a p n heterojunction which is easy to guide and redistribute carriers driven by fermi level equilibrium taking into account the appropriate staggered energy band structure and the predictable p n heterojunction cu2o may be an effective semiconductor material with bifeo3 to construct high performance s scheme sonocatalysts with strong redox ability to our knowledge the facile preparation and us driven sonocatalytic removal of antibiotics of the p n heterojunction cu2o bifeo3 have never been reported the underlying properties of cu2o bifeo3 sonocatalytic degradation route of antibiotics toxicological evaluation and relevant mechanism speculation in an s scheme model ought to be systematically and in depth investigated based on the analysis presented above cu2o bifeo3 heterojunctions were constructed by a simple synthesis method and subsequently characterized by various instruments tetracycline tet as an effective antibiotic compound is widely used to treat various infectious diseases since most of the tet consumed is excreted through urine and feces in an unmetabolized and undegraded form the presence of tet in wastewater is unavoidable 28 29 due to its broad applicability high water solubility and low biodegradation 30 tet was selected as a representative pharmaceutical model to systematically researched the sonocatalytic performance of cu2o bifeo3 the emphasis was given to the influence of the cu2o to bifeo3 ratio the primary operational parameters on the degradation efficiency of the tet as well as the reusability and stability of cu2o bifeo3 in addition the possible intermediate products and the degradation pathways of tet over cu2o bifeo3 were investigated by ion chromatography ic and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms measurement the sonocatalytic mechanism of cu2o bifeo3 was explored in detail finally the toxicity of the reaction solution after sonodegradation was studied through a bacterial toxicity test 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials tetracycline c22h24n2o8

fabrication of materials 2 3 1 fabrication of bifeo3 bifeo3 was synthesized using a simple solvothermal method firstly 4 8 g fe no3 3 9h2o and 5 8 g bi no3 3 5h2o were added in 60 ml of koh 6 mol l 1 with vigorous stirring 30 min and ultrasonic treatment 30 min to form a homogenous mixture then the above solution was transferred to closed autoclaves and treated at 160 c for 6 h finally bifeo3 was obtained after separating washing deionized water and vacuum drying 105 c 2 h 2 3 2 fabrication of cu2o bifeo3 cu2o bifeo3 was synthesized via a simple co precipitation method the crystallization of cu2o on the surface of bifeo3 is as follows firstly the prepared bifeo3 0 5 g was dispersed in deionized water 100 ml with stirring for 10 min subsequently cuso4 5h2o glucose and naoh were dissolved in the above solution with stirring for 30 min finally the cu2o bifeo3 was separated washed deionized water and vacuum dried 60 c 6 h adjusting the dosage of cuso4 5h2o glucose and naoh different

adjust the corresponding factors in the single factor experiment after adding cu2o bifeo3 to the tet solution the above solution was stirred in darkness for 30 min to reach the equilibrium of adsorption desorption of tet on cu2o bifeo3 subsequently the above solution was subjected to ultrasonic irradiation under dark conditions the final experimental results were measured with a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550 japan and calculated according to the following formula 31 degradation efficiency a 0 a t a 0 100 a0 is the absorbance of the solution before ultrasound at is the absorbance of the solution after ultrasonic time t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of cu2o bifeo3 composites the morphology and microstructure of the bifeo3 and cu2o bifeo3 composites were characterized by sem in fig 2 the obtained bifeo3 exhibits an irregular spherical architecture with a diameter of 0 5 2 0 μm in fig 2a the magnified sem images in fig 2b show that the surface of bifeo3 is smooth and has some folds after being composited some small particles appear on the outer surface of cu2o bifeo3 without changing the irregular spherical structure fig 2c and d indicating that cu2o has been successfully modified on the surface of bifeo3 tem and hrtem were used to observe the microstructure of cu2o bifeo3 further to confirm the formation of the heterojunction fig 3a and b in the hrtem image the clear lattice spacing of 0 20 and 0 28 nm fig 3b are consistent with the crystal plane 211 of cu2o and 104 of bifeo3 in addition the tem element mapping images of fe o bi and cu in fig 3c indicate the intimate contact and homogenous distribution of cu2o 32 and bifeo3 33 in the heterojunction constructed which was conducive to facilitating charge transfer by reducing the resistance to interfacial contact to further define the crystal structures of the cu2o bifeo3 and series of cu2o bifeo3 composites xrd technology was used in fig 4a the diffraction peaks in the curve of pure cu2o prepared at 2θ 29 6 36 5 42 3 61 4 and 73 5 are well indexed to the crystal planes 110 111 200 220 and 311 of cu2o jcpds no 65 3288 34 for pure bifeo3 prepared the diffraction peaks at 2θ 22 4 31 8 32 1 37 64 39 5 39 6 45 8 51 3 51 8 56 4 57 1 and 57 1 are corresponded to the crystallographic planes 012 104 110 113 006 202 024 116 122 018 214 and 300 of bifeo3 jcpds no 86 1518 35 however the xrd pattern of the series of cu2o bifeo3 composites only reveals the characteristic peaks of bifeo3 without cu2o perhaps due to the low xrd strength of pure cu2o and its low content 36 37 xps analysis was employed to study the chemical composition and valence states of the as synthesized bifeo3 cu2o and cbf 3 38 39 clearly the xps survey spectra fig 4b of cbf 3 show the presence of elements bi o fe and cu which is consistent with the eds results from the high resolution xps spectrum of bi 4f fig 4c the binding energies of 164 05 and 158 70 ev are indexed to bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 of bi3 in pristine bifeo3 40 for the element fe fig 4d in pristine bifeo3 the two peaks at 710 10 and 723 50 ev are ascribed to fe2 and the other two peaks at 711 90 and 726 80 ev are attributed to fe3 implying the coexistence of fe2 and fe3 besides the presence of two satellite peaks 718 20 and 732 05 ev in the spectrum may be the result of fe3 reacting with hydroxyl introduced in the reaction process to produce a small amount of feooh 41 42 for the element o fig 4e the binding energies of 529 90 and 531 85 ev were corresponded to the lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancy in pristine bifeo3 43 for the element cu fig 4f in pristine cu2o the two main peaks at 934 62 and 954 48 ev were attributed to cu and the other two peaks at 933 12 and 952 98 ev were ascribed to cu2 32 it is noteworthy that the binding energies of bi 4f fe 2p and cu 2p of cbf 3 were shifted compared to those of pristine bifeo3 and cu2o fig 3b the change in binding energy may be due to the strong interaction between the cu2o and bifeo3 phases rather than physical contact suggesting the successful formation of the cu2o bifeo3 heterojunction 36 37 in addition perhaps due to the presence of low valance cu after cu2o decoration 44 cbf 3 has significantly more oxygen vacancy than pure bifeo3 which contributed to providing additional active sites 45 n2 adsorption analysis was applied to study the specific surface area and porosity of the prepared materials evidently both bifeo3 and cu2o bifeo3 exhibit type iv isotherms iupac classification indicating that all materials have pore structures in fig 5a the bet specific surface areas of bifeo3 and cu2o bifeo3 are 20 871 and 21 285 m2 g 1 respectively it is worth noting that cu2o bifeo3 verified a larger pore volume 0 129 cm3 g 1 as well as wider pore size distribution compared with pure bifeo3 in fig 5b which facilitates the removal of contaminants by exposing more active sites and providing convenient mass transfer pathways to study the intrinsic reasons behind the excellent sonodegradation performance of cu2o bifeo3 uv vis drs and mott schottky plots were used to measure the energy band structure the uv vis drs spectra of the materials are shown and compared in fig 6a compared to the original cu2o and bifeo3 cu2o bifeo3 displays elevated visible light absorption which is mainly due to the effective use of more visible light by the energy levels of the surface state formed between cu2o and bifeo3 in the heterojunction according to kubelka munk theory the band gaps eg of cu2o and bifeo3 were 1 95 ev and 2 12 ev respectively in fig 6b further mott schottky analysis was performed to study the flat band potential ef and semiconductor type of the photocatalyst the slopes of the mott schottky plots fig 6c and d indicate the n type semiconducting feature of bifeo3 and the p type semiconducting feature of cu2o the ef of bifeo3 and cu2o are assessed to be 0 44 v and 1 97 v vs sce 0 20 and 2 21 v vs nhe respectively as the ef of semiconductors is 0 1 0 3 v higher than the conduction band potential ecb in the n type semiconductors and 0 1 0 3 v lower than the valence band potential evb in the p type semiconductors 46 the corresponding ecb of bifeo3 and evb of cu2o were 0 40 v and 2 41 v vs nhe respectively according to eg evb ecb 47 the corresponding evb of bifeo3 and ecb of cu2o were 1 72 v and 0 46 v vs nhe respectively photoluminescence pl spectroscopy was utilized to assess the ability to suppress the recombination of electron hole pairs as shown in fig 7 pure bifeo3 exhibits the highest intensity of light emission after being compounded with cu2o the emission intensity of cbf 3 is significantly reduced which is attributed to the formation of heterojunctions between bifeo3 and cu2o which effectively inhibits the carrier recombination and improves the charge transfer efficiency 48 3 2 influence of cu2o content on the sonocatalytic performance of cu2o bifeo3 composites the adsorption and sonodegradation efficiencies of tet in the presence of cu2o bifeo3 and cu2o bifeo3 composites with the different mass ratios of cu2o were displayed in fig 8 pure bifeo3 showed a low adsorption ability to tet and the adsorption efficiency was only 15 03 3 17 compared to pure bifeo3 all prepared cu2o bifeo3 composites cbf 1 cbf 3 cbf 5 displayed a remarkable higher adsorption ability to tet which was benefited by the presence of cu2o in cu2o bifeo3 composites noticeably the removal efficiency of tet by the prepared cu2o bifeo3 composites is higher than that of pure bifeo3 the reason for the above results is not only that the improved adsorption performance increases the contact between cu2o bifeo3 and tet but also that the heterostructure formed by cu2o and bifeo3 effectively inhibits the recombination of heat and sonoluminescence induced e h pairs the inadequate content of cu2o limits the contact area between cu2o and bifeo3 making it impossible to effectively suppress the recombination of sonoluminescence and thermoluminescence e h pairs excess cu2o content may lead to cu2o agglomeration on the surface of bifeo3 which may reduce the dispersion and cover active sites thus reducing the sonocatalytic performance of cu2o bifeo3 composites finally cbf 3 was chosen for the following experiment because it showed the best removal efficiency for tet in the above experiments 3 3 influence of experimental parameters on the sonocatalytic degradation of tet 3 3 1 addition amount of cbf 3 the effect of the addition amount of cbf 3 on the adsorption and sonodegradation of tet was researched as can be seen from fig 9a the degradation efficiency of tet first increased and then decreased with the increase of the addition amount of cbf 3 the uppermost degradation efficiency of tet reached 97 98 0 43 when the addition amount of cbf 3 was 1 0 g l 1 it is worth noting that when the addition amount of cbf 3 was higher than 1 0 g l 1 the degradation efficiency of tet decreased which may be due to the aggregation of excessive catalysts in the solution leading to mutual cover up thus reducing the exposure of the active site and hindering the sonoluminescence therefore 1 0 g l 1 was selected as the addition amount of cbf 3 for the following experiments 3 3 2 initial concentration of tet the influence of tet concentration was assessed in the initial concentration from 10 to 80 mg l 1 as shown in fig 9b the removal efficiency gradually decreases with increasing tet concentration the reason for this phenomenon may be that the balance between the tet and the active site of the catalyst is destroyed with the gradual rise of the tet concentration thus reducing the degradation efficiency at the initial concentration of tet of 20 mg l 1 the removal efficiency of tet was about 98 0 therefore 20 mg l 1 was selected as the initial concentration of tet to research the sonocatalytic degradation performance of cbf 3 in this work 3 3 3 initial ph of the tet solution the ph value of the solution is a significant parameter in wastewater treatment the influence of ph on the sonocatalytic activity was investigated to determine the applicability of cbf 3 to remove tet wastewater as shown in fig 9c cbf 3 maintains a high sonocatalytic degradation efficiency for tet more than 97 2 within the initial ph range of the solution of 5 8 which indicates that cbf 3 has excellent environmental adaptability exhibiting good practical application potential 3 3 4 us irradiation power the us irradiation power is an important influencing factor in the process of sonocatalytic degradation as shown in fig 9d the degradation efficiency of the tet increased from 83 5 to 98 0 with the increase of us irradiation power from 100 to 500 w this experimental phenomenon can be clarified as follows first the rise of us irradiation power can promote the generation of cavitation bubbles and thus produce more reactive oxygen species 49 50 then the increase of the us irradiation power can enhance the deaggregating of the catalyst and the cleaning effect of sonolysis which is conducive to exposing more effective active sites on the catalyst surface 50 finally the turbulence in the solution becomes larger with the increase in us irradiation power increasing the mass transfer rates of tet free intermediates and radicals between cbf 3 and the solution 49 51 therefore 500 w was chosen as the us irradiation power for the following experiment 3 3 5 us irradiation time the sonocatalytic decomposition of tet in the presence of cbf 3 was researched with the change of the us irradiation time as can be seen from fig 10a the degradation efficiencies of tet showed an upward trend with the extension of the us irradiation time when the reaction reached 120 min the degradation efficiencies of tet in the us us bifeo3 and us cbf 3 systems were 14 6 54 6 and 98 0 respectively the study of the kinetic model of the sonocatalytic degradation rate is helpful for the design of the actual wastewater treatment process so the experimental data are processed by a pseudo first order model the kapp values of the sonocatalytic degradation of tet in the presence of us alone us bifeo3 and us cbf 3 were calculated to be 0 00129 0 00515 and 0 02302 min 1 respectively notably the kapp of cbf 3 is the highest which is approximately 4 5 and 17 9 times that of us bifeo3 and us alone indicating that cbf 3 as a sonocatalyst can significantly enhance the degradation efficiency of tet under us irradiation compared to some catalysts reported in literatures table s1 the cbf 3 has a simple preparation process convenient separation process magnetic separation as well as good sonocatalytic performance 3 4 sonocatalytic mechanism the radical trapping tests were used to explore the active species such as holes h superoxide radicals o2 hydroxyl radicals oh in ultrasound driven catalytic oxidation for tet 52 as exhibited in fig 11 the cbf 3 showed good degradation ability without adding a scavenger and the sonodegradation efficiency reaches 97 98 the degradation efficiency decreased significantly after adding tea h scavenger 53 when the addition amount reached 0 4 mol l 1 the degradation efficiency decreased to 26 3 thereby indicating that h may be the main active specie during the degradation process after adding d man oh scavenger 54 the degradation efficiency also decreased significantly cd man 1 0 mol l 1 degradation efficiency 67 6 implying that oh also played a crucial role during the sonodegradation process the degradation efficiency was slightly reduced after adding n2 o2 scavenger 55 manifesting that o2 also promoted the degradation of tet although it does not play the most important role according to the above results the order of importance is as follows h oh o2 generally the nhe potential of 0 v relative to the vacuum energy level evac is 4 6 ev the corresponding relationship between the solid state physical energy standard and the electrochemical energy standard is displayed in fig 12a combined with uv vis drs and mott schottky test results the obtained energy band diagrams of cu2o and bifeo3 are exhibited in fig 12b the ef of bifeo3 is more negative than cu2o so the work function wf wf evac ef of bifeo3 is lower than that of cu2o indicating that electrons generated from bifeo3 would be more likely to escape from the solid after composite the electrons tend to migrate from bifeo3 to cu2o at the contact interface until reaching the new fermi equilibrium level during the junction process the energy band edges in cu2o with low fermi levels gradually moved down and those in bifeo3 with high fermi levels moved up 56 subsequently the contact interface between bifeo3 and cu2o is charged thus forming an internal electric field pointing from the cb of bifeo3 to the vb of cu2o via an s scheme charge transfer pathway 57 xps spectra was applied to verify the electron migration path proposed above as can be seen from fig 4c the binding energy of bi3 in cbf 3 negatively shifted compared to bifeo3 which indicated that the sono generated electron was moved from bifeo3 to cu2o in accordance with a s scheme mechanism 58 what s more the results of radical trapping tests also indicated that the charge transfer mode of the degradation process of the tet based on cbf 3 is the s scheme charge transfer mode rather than the conventional type ii mode fig 12c because the conventional type ii charge transfer mode based on cbf 3 cannot produce reactive oxygen species oh o2 based on the above results a possible sonocatalytic mechanism of tet by cbf 3 was proposed fig 12d during the process of us irradiation the sonoluminescence phenomenon and the abundant local hot spots accompanied by extremely high temperature and pressure will be generated due to cavitation effect resulting in the decomposition of h2o molecules into oh and h 59 60 according to the results of the capture experiment the oh played an important role in the sonocatalytic degradation of tet however the degradation efficiency of tet is very low under the condition of us irradiation without catalyst manifesting that the generation rate and the yield of oh produced by the cavitation effect are limited when the sonocatalyst exists in the system cbf 3 as a heterogeneous catalyst can act as a supplementary core to increase the output oh by increasing the generation rate and the number of cavitation bubbles and ultimately enhancing the degradation of tet in addition according to the s scheme charge transfer mechanism e generated on the cb of bifeo3 can be rapidly transferred to the vb of cu2o and combined with h on vb of cu2o at the same time the accumulated h in the vb of bifeo3 and e in the cb of cu2o will react with h2o and o2 to form oh and o2 respectively finally the reactive species generated including h oh and o2 oxidize tet together to the smaller molecules or ions such as co2 h2o or no3 h 2 o us h oh cu 2 o us h e bifeo 3 us h e e o 2 o 2 h h 2 o h oh h tet degradation product oh tet degradation product o 2 tet degradation product 3 5 change of bacteriostatic effect the biotoxicity variations were studied by exploring the inhibition rate of tet solution to escherichia coli before and after degradation as exhibited in fig 13a and b the initial tet solution has high antibacterial activity by contrast the bacteriostatic effect of the degraded tet solution was significantly weakened in fig 13c manifesting a remarkable decrease of the biotoxicity in the solution the reason for this phenomenon may be that the molecule structure of tet is closely related to its antibacterial spectrum antibacterial potency and pharmacokinetics and the sonocatalytic degradation reaction destroys the molecule structure of tet thus reducing the biotoxicity of tet the results showed that cbf 3 based sonocatalytic degradation technology was an effective method of removing the biological toxicity of tet 3 6 mineralization degree studies the intermediates produced were researched by lc ms analysis and the possible degradation pathways were speculated the main m z peaks 497 477 461 459 416 400 393 343 318 305 274 242 171 158 149 117 116 can be surveyed and the presumed decomposition paths are shown in fig 14 furthermore the ic of tet before and after sonocatalytic degradation was determined to investigate furthe the degradation products as shown in fig 14 the concentration of no3 anions was 1 29 mg l 1 in the original tet solution after the sonocatalytic decomposition the concentrations of no3 anions increased to 4 10 mg l 1 respectively the above results indicated that tet was gradually sonodegraded and converted to small molecules co2 h2o and no3 through several main pathways decarbonylation deamination dehydroxylation hydroxylation ring opening etc 3 7 reusability and stability of cbf 3 the reusability and stability of the as synthesized sonocatalyst are highly vital indexes for their practical application after the sonodegradation experiment the original catalyst was separated by an external magnet washed with deionized water and dried which could be used in the next reaction under the same conditions and reused for four times to investigate the stability of cbf 3 no special regeneration steps are required before catalyst reuse which benefits from the self cleaning characteristics of the sonocatalyst as shown in fig 15a the degradation efficiencies of tet were 98 0 97 9 96 6 and 95 3 for the four cycles respectively the slight decrease in performance after 4 runs may be due to the loss of a small amount of the recycled cbf 3 and the ions leaching of the catalyst during the experiment it is worth noting that the degradation efficiencies of tet only decreased by 2 7 after four cycles which demonstrated that cbf 3 has excellent reusability xps xrd and leaching experiments were used to investigate the stability of cbf 3 xps spectra showed that the surface element information and chemical states of cbf 3 after four cycles were the same as those of the unused cbf 3 see fig 15b moreover the results of xrd after the adsorption desorption cycles test confirmed the structural stability during application in fig 15c d the stability of cbf 3 in the process of sonocatalytic degradation was further explored by measuring the leaching amount of cu and bi3 in the solution by icp ms the concentration of cu and bi3 in the solution after sonocatalytic degradation was 0 096 mg l 1 and 0 067 mg l 1 respectively according to the addition amount of cbf 3 the leaching rate of cu and bi3 in the experiment was calculated and was only 0 078 and 0 071 respectively which manifested that cbf 3 had outstanding stability during the sonocatalytic process see table s2 in conclusion cbf 3 is a stable and recyclable sonocatalyst with great potential for practical application 3 8 comparison of the sonocatalytic performance of different drug residues tet meloxicam mlx ofloxacin ofl and ciprofloxacin cip were used to measure the sonocatalytic performance of cbf 3 for drug residues under ultrasonic conditions the results in fig 16 showed that cbf 3 had a good degradation effect on tet and mlx under ultrasonic irradiation the removal efficiency were 98 0 and 78 1 respectively nevertheless the removal efficiency of ofl and cip was only 33 8 and 44 8 respectively the reason for this difference may be that tet and mlx are more easily decomposed than ofl and cip in the sonocatalyst process due to the presence of phenolic hydroxyl groups and so on in their own structures the results showed that when the chemical structure and composition of these drugs were different the prepared cbf 3 exhibited different sonocatalytic performance 4 conclusions in summary the efficient s scheme heterojunction sonocatalyst cbf 3 was reasonably designed and successfully fabricated by simple synthesis methods profiting from the proper composition and formation of the s scheme heterojunction cbf 3 exhibits superior sonocatalyst oxidation for tet the degradation efficiency of tet reached 98 0 under optimal conditions such as 1 g l 1 cbf 3 composite 20 mg l 1 tet solution us irradiation power of 500 w and us irradiation time of 120 min the biotoxicity of the products degraded by tet was significantly reduced furthermore the results of the recycling experiment and the metal leaching experiment show that cbf 3 has good reusability and stability considering the excellent sonocatalytic performance cbf 3 is identified as a promising candidate for the remediation of the water environment and this study offers a new sight to developing a high efficiency

12622,nitrogen loading directly affects plant metabolism morphogenesis and rhizosphere effect and then the pollutant removal performance of constructed wetlands however the nitrogen loading standards are significantly different in many design specifications around the world the physiological responses of plants canna indica and pollutant removal characteristics under different nitrogen stresses nss in subsurface flow constructed wetlands sfcws were investigated under appropriate ns of 120 mgn l the enhancement of stress resistance and the stabilization of cell structures of canna indica were sustainable however with excessive nss of 0 300 and 600 mgn l the cell structure was damaged permanently appropriate ns could significantly increase the radial oxygen loss and dissolved oxygen concentration in sfcws by 40 33 and 43 11 by persistently enhancing oxygen production photosynthesis and delivery capacity root aerenchyma development p 0 01 simultaneously the abundance and diversity of nitrogen transforming bacteria significantly increased p 0 01 the activities of ammonia monooxygenase periplasmic nitrate reductase and the removal rate of nh4 n and no3 n almost doubled controlling nitrogen loading is very important since ns would lead to the organic and irreversible difference in aerenchyma development in roots throughout the whole growth period of plants which could persistently affect the removal efficiency and stability of pollutants in sfcws graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords stress resistance aerenchyma rhizosphere effect rol rate rhizosphere microorganism pollutant removal mechanism data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws as an easy to maintain and low cost wastewater purification technology are widely used in the world 1 2 although pollutants in cws are mostly removed by microorganisms the growth state of plants in cws has an important effect on pollutant removal due to rhizosphere effects e g radial oxygen release rol affecting the life activities of rhizosphere microorganisms 3 nitrogen is not only a common pollutant in cws but also an essential nutrient for cws plants cws will receive landscape water below 2 mgn l to industrial wastewater higher than 1000 mgn l in practical operation 4 nitrogen loading i e nitrogen stress ns directly affects plant physiological responses and rhizosphere effects 5 7 and then the pollutant removal performance of cws however due to climate operation maintenance mode influent load and other reasons nitrogen loading standards are significantly different in many design specifications around the world 8 10 most of which are derived from project operation experience due to insufficient mechanism investigations furthermore the effect mechanisms of plant physiological responses under different nss on the rhizosphere microenvironment and microbial life activities as well as pollutant removal need to be further investigated the rhizosphere microenvironment is the main area for pollutant removal in cws and its redox environment has an important impact on pollutant removal the internal physiological responses of plants which are mainly reflected in the metabolism and morphogenesis under ns may directly affect the external rhizosphere microenvironment from the perspective of metabolism there are differences in plant stress resistance and lipid peroxidation level under different nss which could lead to a positive or negative development of photosynthetic efficiency 11 consequently ns may regulate oxygen production i e the oxygen source of rol and thus may affect the redox environment in cws from the perspective of morphogenesis root aerenchyma can effectively supply oxygen from the aboveground to the root ensuring normal life activities of the root and radially releasing excess oxygen to the rhizosphere 12 ns can increase or decrease plant root biomass and porosity to alter aerenchyma development 7 13 due to the irreversibility of the aerenchyma development ns may regulate oxygen delivery in rol by changing the aerenchyma development of roots thus persistently affecting the redox environment and pollutant removal throughout the whole growth period of plants therefore controlling the influent nitrogen loading of cws is critical and the effect mechanisms of plant physiological responses on rol under different nss are an important link to elucidate the intrinsic relationship between the internal physiological responses and the external rhizosphere microenvironments of plants however many studies have focused more on the differences in plant physiological responses under different nss in cws 5 14 but less on their effects on rol and redox environment 15 the microbial life activities e g microbial community structure and enzyme activities in cws are mainly affected by the direct effects of pollutant loading and the indirect effects of plants for direct effects of pollutant loading even if nh4 n loading in the influent is high the ph of wastewater is generally stable between 7 and 8 14 so the free ammonia fa concentration is low and will not directly affect the community structure and metabolism of microorganisms in addition for indirect effects of plants plants in cws release dissolved oxygen do through rol to form an aerobic anoxic interface 16 17 in the rhizosphere microenvironment and develop different functional niches for rhizosphere microorganisms 18 and then vary the rhizosphere microbial community structure metabolism and pollutant removal 19 20 similarly under different nss the variation of the do concentration in cws has an important effect on the rhizosphere microbial community structure and metabolism 21 however the effect mechanisms of plant oxygen secretion under ns on rhizosphere microbial community structure and metabolism in cws remain to be investigated moreover compared with the above two aspects rol is a key node connecting plants and rhizosphere microorganisms under different nss the variation of the redox environment in cws caused by different rols of plants may be a pivot leading to cws showing different characteristics of rhizosphere microorganisms and pollutant removal but this plant dominated factor and the effect mechanisms of influent nitrogen loading were often ignored in previous studies 22 accordingly it is necessary to elucidate the effect mechanisms of different internal physiological responses of plants under different nss on the external rhizosphere microenvironment rhizosphere microbial community structure and activities furthermore appropriate ns would be determined to maximize the performance of plants rhizosphere microenvironment and microorganisms finally theoretical support for improving the pollutant removal ability and stability of cws would be provided 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design the design parameters of fifteen n 3 lab scale subsurface constructed wetlands sfcws are summarized in table 1 the experiments were conducted in xi an where the local species canna indica was selected as wetland plants canna indica is a common plant specified in the cws specification with a large number of adventitious roots and developed aerenchyma 23 which is conducive to the investigation of microorganisms and rol before the formal experiment canna indica and cws were acclimatized with synthetic wastewater table s1 24 25 according to the results of yan 25 some appropriate adjustments were made the hydraulic time hrt was 5 days at around 9 a m on the first day of each cycle the effluent was discharged within 15 min after the bed remained unsaturated for 30 min the influent was supplied into the cws within 15 min and then maintained in the flooding period until the end of the cycle and the wastewater was discharged this period lasted for 3 months to help plants adapt to the cws environment and create a culture of biofilm gradually through the natural process the use of ceramic beads instead of soil for fillers is intended to eliminate the interference of nitrogen in the soil at the beginning of the formal experiment canna indica with consistent and healthy growth was selected and transplanted into cws with the same root biomass the operating scheme is consistent with the acclimation period the formal experiment lasted 60 days from may to june 2022 the ranges of environmental temperature during the experimental period ranged from 15 2 to 30 1 c sunlight irradiation is used to simulate the illumination intensity and time in the natural environment four nss were set to make significant differences in plant physiological responses according to wang et al 11 0 n 0 120 n 120 300 n 300 and 600 n 600 mgn l moreover these nitrogen loadings were in line with the most of cws specification 8 10 the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n were approximately half and all ph was controlled between 7 and 8 the concentrations of other pollutants were approximately kept consistent in each group the nitrogen concentration in synthetic wastewater 60 mg l n 60 was taken as the control the actual influent compositions are listed in table s2 2 2 determination of chlorophyll and chlorophyll fluorescence to characterize the photosynthesis of plants under ns the chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of plant leaves were determined chlorophyll the fresh leaves with a diameter of 1 2 cm were drilled from the same height of plants between 9 00 a m and 10 00 a m and weighed the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were determined according to lichtenthaler and wellburn 26 the chlorophyll content was expressed as mg g fresh weight g fw chlorophyll fluorescence the fresh leaves with a diameter of 1 2 cm were drilled from the same height of plants between 9 00 a m and 10 00 a m and dark treated for 30 min in a black sample bag parameters were adjusted according to schreiber et al 27 and canna indica leaves the actual quantum yield φpsii of leaves was detected by modulated chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system imaging pam walz germany detailed parameters are described in text s1 2 3 determination of t aoc content pod activity and mda content to characterize the effects of ns on plant stress resistance and lipid peroxidation level of the cell membrane the total antioxidant capacity t aoc content peroxidase pod activity and malondialdehyde mda in plant leaves were determined fresh leaves of 0 1 g were taken from the same height of three plants in the same wetland for ice bath homogenization and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm and 4 c for 10 min the supernatant was taken and placed on ice for testing according to the instructions of the corresponding kits beijing solarbio science technology co ltd t aoc content is expressed as μmol g fw pod activity is expressed as u g fw and mda content is expressed as nmol g fw 2 4 determination of root aerenchyma development to characterize the ability of plant roots to deliver oxygen the aerenchyma root porosity root biomass was determined the root porosity gas volume root volume was determined by kludze et al 28 and mei et al 29 about 0 6

statistical analysis anova and lsd post test spss 26 0 were used to determine the statistically significant differences among the results origin 2021 origin lab usa was used to perform linear fitting of the correlation between rol rate and plant physiological response microbial abundance and activities and pollutant removal performance in all tests when p 0 05 the difference was considered to be significant and when p 0 01 the difference was considered to be extremely significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ns on pollutant removal performance of sfcws 3 1 1 effect of ns on do concentration and ph of sfcws from fig 1a the ph of sfcws increases with the increase in nitrogen loading this is probably due to the increase of alkalinity in sfcws led by the enhancement of denitrification and the weakening of nitrification 34 the ph of influent and sfcws under different nss was between 7 and 8 and the fa concentration was low table s3 which was within the ph and fa range of normal growth of nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria therefore the subsequent experimental results could be considered to rule out the effects of different nss on microbial growth and metabolism from fig 1b the average concentration of do in n 120 is significantly higher than that of n 60 ck with an increase of 43 31 while the average concentration of do in n 300 and n 600 decreases and the average do concentrations in n 600 0 31 mg l and n 0 0 61 mg l are only 17 03 and 33 52 of that in n 120 respectively the sources of do in cws include influent do atmospheric reoxygenation and root rol 19 since the difference of do concentration in influent under different nss was not significant its influence could be excluded the concentration of dosat in water varies with temperature dissolved salt and biological activity among them the effect of temperature on dosat has been widely studied the american society of civil engineers has proposed the eq 3 to calculate the dosat concentration in water at 0 30 c 32 by our calculation the dosat of sfcws was 8 31 mg l based on the water temperature measured in sfcws 24 1 c table 1 the atmospheric reoxygenation rate of cws can only be estimated because there are few studies on the calculation of atmospheric reoxygenation in cws in this study we used the calculation method of stream reoxygenation eq 4 reported by sun and kadlec 18 33 with the atmospheric reoxygenation rate shown in fig s1 in this figure the daily mean atmospheric reoxygenation was smaller and the atmospheric reoxygenation in n 0 and n 600 was greater than that in n 120 but their do concentration was significantly lower than that in n 120 this indicated that the replenishment of do by atmospheric reoxygenation was very limited and its influence on do concentration could be ignored thus the different rol rates of plants may be a dominant factor leading to the significant difference in do concentration moreover the microbial oxygen consumption is the main destination of do in cws the difference in abundance and activity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria under different nss will greatly affect the do concentration in cws 35 therefore microbial oxygen consumption may also be one of the dominant factors leading to the difference in do concentration these two possible dominant factors will be discussed in subsequent sections 3 1 2 effect of ns on nitrogen and cod removal of sfcws the removal performance of pollutants in sfcws is shown in figs 2 and s2 the average tn removal efficiency of n 60 ck is 81 30 similar to the results of deng et al 36 from fig 2a the average concentrations of nh4 n in n 0 n 60 ck n 120 n 300 and n 600 decrease by 0 12 21 57 44 54 14 47 and 9 01 mg l respectively this indicates that when the nitrogen concentration is in the range of 0 to 120 mgn l the nh4 n removal increased with the increase in nitrogen loading but decreased when the nitrogen concentration increased to 120 mgn l compared with n 60 ck the removal rate of nh4 n in n 120 increased by 106 47 while the removal rate of nh4 n in n 600 decreased by 45 05 similarly the removal rate of tn in high nitrogen loadings also decreased from fig 2b the average concentrations of no3 n in n 0 n 60 ck n 120 n 300 and n 600 decreased by 0 22 31 34 63 98 76 68 and 69 44 mg l respectively indicating that the average no3 n removal amount increased although the removal rate of no3 n in n 600 decreased this decrease was not significant the above results indicate that the increase in nitrogen loading has no negative impact on the denitrification process when the influent nitrogen concentration increased from 60 mg l to 120 mg l the average no3 n removal rate increased from 156 71 mg m2 d to 319 90 mg m2 d while the do concentration increased from 1 27 mg l to 1 82 mg l the above results suggested that the variation of no3 n nh4 n and tn removal rates may be related to the variation of rol rate in plants under different nss the average concentrations of cod in n 0 n 60 n 120 n 300 and n 600 decreased by 251 29 260 74 285 19 272 01 and 250 80 mg l respectively the cod removal rate of n 120 was the highest which was 1 14 times of that of n 600 the removal amount of cod decreases slightly under high nitrogen loading indicating that the enhancement of ns will inhibit the removal of cod in sfcws the removal of cod is mainly undertaken by heterotrophic microorganisms most of which have a denitrification function so that the removal characteristics of cod and no3 n are similar in addition the aerobic transformation of cod will consume do in sfcws and its concentration is also an important factor affecting cod removal do plays an important role in the removal of nh4 n when the removal amount and removal rate of nh4 n are higher the remaining do concentration will be lower however as shown in figs 1b 2a and s2 it can be found that the do concentration is also higher when the removal amount and rate of nh4 n is higher which is probably because the appropriate ns of 120 mg l stimulates the rol ability and then strengthens the growth and metabolism of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob the amount and rate of removal of nh4 n and the do concentration decrease under high nitrogen loadings n 300 n 600 which may be because the excessive ns of 300 600 mg l inhabits the rol ability and decreases the do concentration thus inhibiting the growth and metabolism of aob in addition denitrification includes aerobic denitrification and anaerobic denitrification the variation of do concentration will affect the process of these two kinds of denitrification when the nitrogen concentration increases from 60 mg l to 120 mg l both of the no3 n removal rate and do concentration increase this indicates that there may be bacteria with aerobic denitrification functions therefore it is necessary to further explain the above phenomena by exploring the response mechanisms of plants rhizosphere microenvironment and microorganisms under different nss 3 2 physiological responses of plants under ns 3 2 1 effects of ns on plant stress resistance nitrogen is an essential nutrient element for plant growth unlike other salts such as nacl the damage of ns to plants refers to osmotic stress and the resulting accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros and physiological disorders thus leading to nutritional imbalance and oxidative stress in plants 37 plants have developed different mechanisms to resist the negative effects of ros accumulation to minimize functional and structural damage antioxidants including enzymatic antioxidants and non enzymatic antioxidants are very effective in removing ros and lipid peroxidation in plants 38 39 in plants t aoc can evaluate the function of plant antioxidant systems in general as ros h2o2 is degraded by pod and catalase but since pod exhibits a high affinity for h2o2 40 the variation of the antioxidant enzyme activities is characterized by investigating the pod activity from fig 3a and b the t aoc content and pod activity vary on the first day of ns indicating that the antioxidant system of canna indica is more sensitive to ns the pod activity and the t aoc content in n 60 ck decrease to the initial level after a brief adaptive increase the t aoc content in n 0 increased continuously indicating that canna indica actively enhances its stress resistance under nitrogen deficiency stress however the pod activity decreases in this case because nitrogen is an essential nutrient for enzyme synthesis and nitrogen deficiency limits the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes 41 therefore the increased content of other non enzymatic antioxidants can probably lead to an increase in t aoc content from fig 3a the pod activity and t aoc content in n 120 n 300 and n 600 present an upward trend in the early stage stress with the corresponding peak values of 1 97 times and 6 25 times 2 02 times and 4 76 times 2 02 times and 5 97 times of the initial value respectively this indicates that canna indica enhances its stress resistance by actively increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and total antioxidant capacity under ns however with the continuous stress pod activity and t aoc content in n 120 stably remain at a high level while those in n 300 and n 600 gradually decrease indicating that the active enhancement of the antioxidant capacity of canna indica under appropriate ns is sustainable and conducive to plant normal growth while the antioxidant capacity of canna indica under excessive ns could only resist the ns briefly eventually resulting in severe damage of the antioxidant system 42 excessive ros leads to the lipid peroxidation of cell membrane through degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids 43 with its derivative of mda which can reflect the difference in damage of cell membrane 44 with its content different in canna indica under different nss fig 3c on the first day of ns the mda content in each group increases thus stimulating the activity of the antioxidant system fig 3a and b with the continuous stress the content of mda in canna indica leaves of n 60 ck and n 120 decreases gradually and eventually returns to a normal level while the mda content in canna indica leaves of n 0 n 300 and n 600 increases gradually with the final value of 2 93 times 4 01 times and 4 41 times of that in n 60 ck respectively which indicates that the antioxidant capacity of plants can be stimulated and maintained at a high level under appropriate ns thus reducing the lipid peroxidation the antioxidant capacity of plants is inhibited under excessive ns resulting in the inability to remove accumulated ros in time and then significantly deepen the damage degree of plants cell membranes 39 45 3 2 2 effects of ns on plant photosynthesis in the photosynthetic system of plants i e the main site of metabolism chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are used to evaluate photosynthetic efficiency and monitor the toxic effects of external stress on plant growth 46 with their contents changing on the first day fig 3d and e indicating that photosynthetic system of canna indica is sensitive to ns the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in n 0 decrease by 32 80 and 69 23 respectively this is because both of them are nitrogen containing compounds and nitrogen deficiency will inhibit chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis 47 which may be an important reason for the low concentration of do in n 0 fig 1b the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in n 120 increase by 78 70 and 90 24 respectively indicating that the enhanced stress resistance of canna indica promotes the synthesis of chlorophyll under appropriate ns the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in n 300 and n 600 increase slightly and then decrease on the 15th and 10th days by combining with the result in section 3 2 1 it can be seen that the high ns reduces the function of the antioxidant system and increases the lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane which leads to physiological responses such as nutrient imbalance and decrease of chlorophyll content thus reducing the photosynthesis of plants 48 studies have found that photosystem ii psii is more sensitive to environmental stress than photosystem i 49 50 which proves that psii is the priority target of various stresses the actual quantum yield of psii φpsii can quickly reflect the internal characteristics of the photosynthetic system and the actual photosynthesis of plants under different conditions 51 φpsii varies on the first day of stress fig 3f indicating that the psii of canna indica is sensitive to ns compared with n 60 ck the increment of φpsii in n 120 is 95 56 the φpsii increases slightly in n 0 n 300 and n 600 and then decreases on the 3rd 15th and 10th days with the final values of 35 71 35 09 and 28 55 of the peak values by combining the above results with the various characteristics of chlorophyll content mda content and do concentration it can be seen that appropriate ns can stimulate the stress resistance of canna indica as well as the chlorophyll synthesis and the actual photosynthetic efficiency thus enhancing the oxygen production capacity while excessive ns can aggravate the lipid peroxidation of canna indica and inhibit the chlorophyll synthesis and the actual photosynthetic efficiency thus decreasing oxygen production capacity which may be the main reason for the increase of do concentration under appropriate ns and the decrease of do concentration under excessive ns 3 2 3 effects of ns on roots aerenchyma development roots of wetland plants are in a state of hypoxic flooding for a long time and the aerenchyma is formed irreversibly through programmed cell death to deliver oxygen and improve the survival ability of plants 52 53 besides nitrogen deficit can influence the aerenchyma formation in plant roots 54 aerenchyma development totality is characterized by root porosity and root biomass and is irreversible since canna indica are cultivated under the same conditions before transplanting and kept root biomass consistent when transplanting the differences in root biomass and root porosity under different nss are reflected in the new adventitious roots from fig 4a the increase of root biomass of n 120 is 35 90 compared with n 60 ck indicating that appropriate ns can induce the germination of a large number of adventitious roots of canna indica the root biomass of n 0 n 300 and n 600 decreases significantly p 0 01 i e 44 10 57 85 and 41 54 of n 60 ck respectively nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and the photosynthesis of plants is inhibited under nitrogen deficiency stress resulting in a decrease in root biomass which is consistent with abiko and obara 13 in addition under high ns lipid peroxidation severely inhibits plant growth leading to root growth retardation root porosity in n 0 is significantly higher than that in n 60 ck p 0 01 indicating that the nitrogen deficiency stress increases root porosity which is consistent with abiko and obara 13 compared with n 60 ck the root porosity in n 120 increases by 32 06 and the root porosities of n 300 and n 600 decrease by 21 34 and 30 51 respectively studies have shown that the delivery efficiency of gases in plants is positively correlated with root porosity 55 therefore appropriate ns could induce the development of adventitious root biomass and root porosity in canna indica thereby persistently enhancing aerenchyma development and oxygen delivery capacity in plants however the high ns can inhibit aerenchyma development and oxygen delivery capacity nitrogen deficiency increases root porosity but inhibits root biomass thus inhibiting aerenchyma development to a certain extent under different nss the difference in aerenchyma development in roots was organic and irreversible throughout the whole growth period of plants consequently controlling nitrogen loading is critical to persistently affect the removal efficiency and stability of pollutants in sfcws 3 2 4 effects of ns on plant rol rate and correlation of rol with physiological responses and do there is a significant difference in the rol rate of canna indica under different nss p 0 01 fig 4b compared with n 60 ck the average rol rate increases by 40 33 in n 120 and decreases by 44 81 60 38 and 82 31 in n 0 n 300 and n 600 respectively suggesting that appropriate ns can enhance root physiological activities such as rol while excessive ns can inhibit root physiological activities there is a significant positive correlation between do concentration and rol rate r 0 923 p 0 001 fig 5a c since limited atmospheric reoxygenation and insignificant difference in do concentration in influent the variation of rol rate of canna indica under different nss is a dominant factor leading to the significant difference in do concentration in sfcws root porosity and plant photosynthesis are two important factors affecting rol 56 so the rol rate is influenced not only by the oxygen production capacity of photosynthesis but also by the oxygen delivery capacity of aerenchyma fig 5a and c show the significant positive correlation among rol do concentration photosynthetic efficiency and aerenchyma development of canna indica under different nitrogen loadings respectively all p 0 05 indicating that the synergistic changes in plant physiological responses and the changes in ns intensity will not alter the correlation of rol with plant metabolism and morphogenesis and it can be inferred that the variation of rol under ns is an external manifestation of plant physiology to adapt to the cws habitat thus varying the do concentration in cws therefore it is concluded that in contrast to excessive ns appropriate ns could improve the oxygen production and delivery capacity of plants by stimulating the antioxidant capacity photosynthetic efficiency and the development of root aerenchyma thus strengthening the rol rate and increasing the do concentration of cws 3 3 responses of rhizosphere microbial community structure activities and pollutant removal mechanisms under ns 3 3 1 response of rhizosphere microbial community structure under ns α diversity reflects the diversity of species within an ecosystem as shown in table s4 all goods coverage is above 0 97 indicating that the diversity index is effectively comparable among samples the results of the richness index chao1 and diversity index shannon and simpson show that the richness and diversity of rhizosphere microorganisms are the highest under appropriate ns while the richness and diversity of rhizosphere microorganisms decrease under excessive ns these results are consistent with the variation of plant physiological responses and rol rate suggesting that ns may regulate rhizosphere microbial diversity by changing the rol rate β diversity indicates that microbial communities cluster in different groups under different nss and this aggregation may be caused by different environmental conditions i e do under ns fig s3 57 the relative abundance of major rhizosphere microorganisms is shown in fig 6a proteobacteria 78 4 88 8 bacteroidetes 3 2 12 3 actinobacteria 3 1 9 1 and firmicutes 4 1 4 6 dominate the rhizosphere microorganisms proteobacteria contains a large number of facultative anaerobic bacteria that can participate in the degradation of organic matters and use oxygen as an electron acceptor which is an important component of nitrogen fixing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria 58 proteobacteria with their rapid growth and metabolic diversity can survive in a variety of complex environments including nutrient poor and nutrient rich environments 59 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes increases with the increase in nitrogen loading indicating that bacteroidetes are more suitable to survive in a high nitrogen loading environment than proteobacteria although the abundance of bacteroidetes is low in general it can use the intracellular substances released by proteobacteria lysis to proliferate under anaerobic conditions 60 61 which confirmed the result that the do concentration was the lowest but the bacteroidetes abundance was the highest in n 600 nitrospirae is a type of nitrifying bacteria and their relative abundance first increases and then decreases with the increase in nitrogen loading which is consistent with the variation of do concentration and rol rate therefore the variation of proteobacteria abundance bacteroidetes and nitrospirae may be related to the rol rate the do concentration in the plant rhizosphere environment will have an impact on the rhizosphere microbial community structure therefore changes in the rate of oxygen secretion by plant roots under ns will further shape the rhizosphere microbial community structure most of the bacteria with high abundance in the rhizosphere are facultative anaerobes with denitrification functions among which thauera is the most widely distributed thauera shows strong denitrification ability in both anoxic aerobic experiments and denitrification can be carried out through an aerobic pathway outside the cell membrane and an anoxic pathway inside the membrane 62 fig 6a shows that the relative abundance of thauera in n 120 is the highest 54 60 while the relative abundance of thauera in n 0 and n 600 decreases to 21 24 and 34 70 respectively the abundance of thauera is significantly positively correlated with the rol rate p 0 01 fig 5b flavobacterium and chryseobacterium are widely served as denitrifying bacteria nitrospira and nitrosomonas are nitrifying bacteria and all four genera are strictly aerobic and there is a significant positive correlation between their abundance and rol rate p 0 01 previous studies had confirmed that thermomonas were related to organic degradation 63 thermomonas abundance was significantly negatively correlated with rol rate p 0 05 in line with its anaerobic denitrification characteristics in addition it was found that rhodobacter was more likely to proliferate in an alternating anoxic and aerobic environment 15 hence in this study the oxygen secreting activity of plant roots may promote the proliferation of rhodobacter in the rhizosphere which is consistent with the findings of zhu et al 64 from fig 5c all the above genera except thermomonas are significantly correlated with the rol rate and other plant physiological parameters instead of ns which indicates the intrinsic relationship between the changes of plant physiological responses and microbial community abundance under ns ns could regulate the relative abundance of microorganisms by changing the rol rate an external manifestation of plant physiological response to form microbial communities adapted to the rhizosphere microenvironment 18 65 rather than by the direct effect of ns microorganisms are the main consumers of do in cws when the abundance and activity of aerobic bacteria or facultative anaerobes are higher the remaining do concentration will be lower however as shown in figs 1 6a and b when the abundance and activity of aerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobic bacteria are higher in n 120 the do concentration is also higher considering the significant positive correlation between do concentration and rol it can be proved that the rol of plants is the dominant factor affecting do concentration in cws and the effect of microbial oxygen consumption on do concentration can be excluded which means that the rol under appropriate ns has enough surplus to compensate for the oxygen consumed by microorganisms simultaneously it can be further proved that rol under appropriate ns has sufficient ability to shape the microbial community by controlling do concentration 3 3 2 response of microbial key enzyme activities and pollutant removal mechanisms under ns the removal of pollutants in cws is mainly accomplished by microbial enzyme catalysis 66 fig 6b shows a large gap between the activity of amo a key enzyme in the nitrification process and the activities of nar and nap which is due to the low growth rate and abundance of nitrifying bacteria compared with n 60 ck the amo activity in n 120 increased by 90 66 and the amo activity in n 0 and n 600 decreased by 71 16 and 78 09 which could explain the results of nh4 n removal highly sensitive to environmental conditions nitrifying bacteria will be seriously inhibited by inappropriate do temperature ph fa concentration and alkalinity 67 68 in this study all the sfcws were at the same moderate temperature and section 3 1 shows that there are no influences of ph and fa on nitrifying bacteria therefore the variation of nitrogen loading in sfcws and environmental conditions will not inhibit nitrifying bacteria moreover the amo activity is positively correlated with the rol rate p 0 01 fig 5b indicating that the variation of rol rate under ns is a dominant factor leading to the difference in amo activity combined with the discussion in section 3 2 it can be seen that the difference between photosynthesis and aerenchyma development under ns was persistent appropriate ns can increase the rol rate and the do concentration by stimulating the photosynthetic efficiency and root aerenchyma development of plants thereby persistently promoting the proliferation and activities of nitrifying bacteria and improving the nh4 n removal the physiology of plants is inhibited under excessive ns which reduces the rol rate and do concentration thereby inhibiting the proliferation and activities of nitrifying bacteria as well as the nh4 n removal since the optimal stress response intensity was 120 mg l the nitrogen load recommended in the chinese design specifications can be increased appropriately the influencing mechanisms are shown in fig 7 nar and nap are key enzymes in anaerobic and aerobic denitrification respectively compared to n 60 ck the nap activity in n 120 increased by 78 27 while n 0 and n 600 only were 48 61 and 39 44 of that in n 120 respectively different from amo and nap the nar activity increased gradually with the increase of nitrogen loading especially when in n 600 nar activity was 1 40 times higher than that in n 60 ck as shown in fig 5b and c the rol rate was significantly positively correlated with the nap activity r 0 911 p 0 001 and negatively correlated with the nar activity r 0 691 p 0 01 napa is a gene controlling nap synthesis and can be expressed in complete aerobic conditions 69 and narg a gene controlling nar synthesis is more sensitive to do concentration which explains the variation of nar and nap activity it is also shown that the response of the rol rate to ns is a dominant factor leading to the differences in nar and nap activities the classic theory of aerobic denitrification believes that oxygen will not affect the electron transfer between no3 n and organic matter and when both no3 n and oxygen are present the denitrification ability is better than that in the situation where only no3 n exists 70 this confirms that the abundance of aerobic denitrifying bacteria such as thauera and the removal rate of no3 n also increase with the increase in do concentration under appropriate ns as shown in fig 5b the no3 n removal is significantly positively correlated with nar activity r 0 697 p 0 05 and negatively correlated with nap activity r 0 234 p 0 05 this was because although the inhibition of plant rol under excessive ns could result in a significant decrease in nap activity the performance of facultative anaerobic denitrifiers and the removal of no3 n were not significantly different within the nitrogen loading range of the design specification due to enhanced nar activity the influencing mechanisms are shown in fig 7 4 conclusion 1 under the appropriate ns the enhancement of stress resistance and the stabilization of cell structures of canna indica were sustainable under excessive ns unsustainable stress resistance resulted in permanent damage in cell structure 2 appropriate ns could increase the rol rate and wetland do concentration by 40 33 and 43 11 by persistently and significantly increasing oxygen production capacity and oxygen transport capacity of plants thus nearly doubling the abundance and activity of nitrogen transforming microorganisms and nitrogen removal in actual operation nitrogen loading recommended in wetland specifications could be appropriately increased 3 changes by ns in rol rate significantly affected ammonia oxidizing bacteria performance however the performance of facultative anaerobic denitrifiers and the removal of no3 n were not significantly different due to enhanced nitrate reductase activity 4 different nss would lead to the organic and irreversible difference in aerenchyma development in roots throughout the whole growth period of plants consequently controlling nitrogen loading is critical to persistently affect the removal efficiency and stability of pollutants in sfcws declaration of competing interest the authors declare

are significantly different in many design specifications around the world the physiological responses of plants canna indica and pollutant removal characteristics under different nitrogen stresses

sustainable however with excessive nss of 0 300 and 600 mgn l the cell structure was damaged permanently appropriate ns could significantly increase the radial oxygen loss and dissolved oxygen

of nitrogen transforming bacteria significantly increased p 0 01 the activities of ammonia monooxygenase periplasmic nitrate reductase and the removal rate of nh4 n and no3 n almost doubled

furthermore the effect mechanisms of plant physiological responses under different nss on the rhizosphere microenvironment and microbial life activities as well as pollutant removal need to be further investigated the rhizosphere microenvironment is the main area for pollutant removal in cws and its redox environment has an important impact on pollutant removal the internal physiological responses of plants which are mainly reflected in the metabolism and morphogenesis under ns may directly affect the external rhizosphere microenvironment from the perspective of metabolism there are differences in plant stress resistance and lipid peroxidation level under different nss which could lead to a positive or negative development of photosynthetic efficiency 11 consequently ns may regulate oxygen production i e the oxygen source of rol and thus may affect the redox environment in cws from the perspective of morphogenesis root aerenchyma can effectively supply oxygen from the aboveground to the root ensuring normal life activities of the root and radially releasing excess oxygen to the rhizosphere 12 ns can increase or decrease plant root biomass and porosity to alter aerenchyma development 7 13 due to the irreversibility of the aerenchyma development ns may regulate oxygen delivery in rol by changing the aerenchyma development of roots thus persistently affecting the redox environment and pollutant removal throughout the whole growth period of plants therefore controlling the influent nitrogen loading of cws is critical and the effect mechanisms of plant physiological responses on rol under different nss are an important link to elucidate the intrinsic relationship between the internal physiological responses and the external rhizosphere microenvironments of plants however many studies have focused more on the differences in plant physiological responses under different nss in cws 5 14 but less on their effects on rol and redox environment 15 the microbial life activities e g microbial community structure and enzyme activities in cws are mainly affected by the direct effects of pollutant loading and the indirect effects of plants for direct effects of pollutant loading even if nh4 n loading in the influent is high the ph of wastewater is generally stable between 7 and 8 14 so the free ammonia fa concentration is low and will not directly affect the community structure and metabolism of microorganisms in addition for indirect effects of plants plants in cws release dissolved oxygen do through rol to form an aerobic anoxic interface 16 17 in the rhizosphere microenvironment and develop different functional niches for rhizosphere microorganisms 18 and then vary the rhizosphere microbial community structure metabolism and pollutant removal 19 20 similarly under different nss the variation of the do concentration in cws has an important effect on the rhizosphere microbial community structure and metabolism 21 however the effect mechanisms of plant oxygen secretion under ns on rhizosphere microbial community structure and metabolism in cws remain to be investigated moreover compared with the above two aspects rol is a key node connecting plants and rhizosphere microorganisms under different nss the variation of the redox environment in cws caused by different rols of plants may be a pivot leading to cws showing different characteristics of rhizosphere microorganisms and pollutant removal but this plant dominated factor and the effect mechanisms of influent nitrogen loading were often ignored in previous studies 22 accordingly it is necessary to elucidate the effect mechanisms of different internal physiological responses of plants under different nss on the external rhizosphere microenvironment rhizosphere microbial community structure and activities furthermore appropriate ns would be determined to maximize the performance of plants rhizosphere microenvironment and microorganisms finally theoretical support for improving the pollutant removal ability and stability of cws would be provided 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design the design parameters of fifteen n 3 lab scale subsurface constructed wetlands sfcws are summarized in table 1 the experiments were conducted in xi an where the local species canna indica was selected as wetland plants canna indica is a common plant specified in the cws specification with a large number of adventitious roots and developed aerenchyma 23 which is conducive to the investigation of microorganisms and rol before the formal experiment canna indica and cws were acclimatized with synthetic wastewater table s1 24 25 according to the results of yan 25 some appropriate adjustments were made the hydraulic time hrt was 5 days at around 9 a m on the first day of each cycle the effluent was discharged within 15 min after the bed remained unsaturated for 30 min the influent was supplied into the cws within 15 min and then maintained in the flooding period until the end of the cycle and the wastewater was discharged this period lasted for 3 months to help plants adapt to the cws environment and create a culture of biofilm gradually through the natural process the use of ceramic beads instead of soil for fillers is intended to eliminate the interference of nitrogen in the soil at the beginning of the formal experiment canna indica with consistent and healthy growth was selected and transplanted into cws with the same root biomass the operating scheme is consistent with the acclimation period the formal experiment lasted 60 days from may to june 2022 the ranges of environmental temperature during the experimental period ranged from 15 2 to 30 1 c sunlight irradiation is used to simulate the illumination intensity and time in the natural environment four nss were set to make significant differences in plant physiological responses according to wang et al 11 0 n 0 120 n 120 300 n 300 and 600 n 600 mgn l moreover these nitrogen loadings were in line with the most of cws specification 8 10 the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n were approximately half and all ph was controlled between 7 and 8 the concentrations of other pollutants were approximately kept consistent in each group the nitrogen concentration in synthetic wastewater 60 mg l n 60 was taken as the control the actual influent compositions are listed in table s2 2 2 determination of chlorophyll and chlorophyll fluorescence to characterize the photosynthesis of plants under ns the chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of plant leaves were

ability of plant roots to deliver oxygen the aerenchyma root porosity root biomass was determined the root porosity gas volume root volume was determined by kludze et al 28 and mei et al 29 about 0 6

determined according to the method of vymazal 30 2 5 determination of root rol rate the rol rate of adventitious roots was determined by referring to titanium ti3 citrate method of kludze et al 28 and

ml of ti3 citrate solution into the nutrient solution before mixing well the plants were carefully removed from the cw and the roots were rinsed with clean water to remove any residues and then inserted into the nutrient solution and then 2 cm thick liquid paraffin was immediately poured to seal to prevent the infiltration of outside oxygen and the control group without plants was set simultaneously the test bottle was sealed with tin foil to protect it from light and all operations were carried out in an inert gas operation box the ambient temperature and illumination simulate

rhizosphere microorganisms to characterize the nitrogen removal ability of rhizosphere microorganisms the activities of ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrate reductase nar and periplasmic nitrate reductase nap were determined according to the instructions of the corresponding kits nanjing herb source bio technology co ltd enzyme activities were expressed as u l pretreatment is required before

statistical analysis anova and lsd post test spss 26 0 were used to determine the statistically significant differences among the results origin 2021 origin lab usa was used to perform linear fitting of the correlation between rol rate and plant physiological response microbial abundance and activities and pollutant removal performance in all tests when p 0 05 the difference was considered to be significant and when p 0 01 the difference was considered to be extremely significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ns on pollutant removal performance of sfcws 3 1 1 effect of ns on do concentration and ph of sfcws from fig 1a the ph of sfcws increases with the increase in nitrogen loading this is probably due to the increase of alkalinity in sfcws led by the enhancement of denitrification and the weakening of nitrification 34 the ph of influent and sfcws under different nss was between 7 and 8 and the fa concentration was low table s3 which was within the ph and fa range of normal growth of nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria therefore the subsequent experimental results could be considered to rule out the effects of different nss on microbial growth and metabolism from fig 1b the average concentration of do in n 120 is significantly higher than that of n 60 ck with an increase of 43 31 while the average concentration of do in n 300 and n 600 decreases and the average do concentrations in n 600 0 31 mg l and n 0 0 61 mg l are only 17 03 and 33 52 of that in n 120 respectively the sources of do in cws include influent do atmospheric reoxygenation and root rol 19 since the difference of do concentration in influent under different nss was not significant its influence could be excluded the concentration of dosat in water varies with temperature dissolved salt and biological activity among them the effect of temperature on dosat has been widely studied the american society of civil engineers has proposed the eq 3 to calculate the dosat concentration in water at 0 30 c 32 by our calculation the dosat of sfcws was 8 31 mg l based on the water temperature measured in sfcws 24 1 c table 1 the atmospheric reoxygenation rate of cws can only be estimated because there are few studies on the calculation of atmospheric reoxygenation in cws in this study we used the calculation method of stream reoxygenation eq 4 reported by sun and kadlec 18 33 with the atmospheric reoxygenation rate shown in fig s1 in this figure the daily mean atmospheric reoxygenation was smaller and the atmospheric reoxygenation in n 0 and n 600 was greater than that in n 120 but their do concentration was significantly lower than that in n 120 this indicated that the replenishment of do by atmospheric reoxygenation was very limited and its influence on do concentration could be ignored thus the different rol rates of plants may be a dominant factor leading to the significant difference in do concentration moreover the microbial oxygen consumption is the main destination of do in cws the difference in abundance and activity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria under different nss will greatly affect the do concentration in cws 35 therefore microbial oxygen consumption may also be one of the dominant factors leading to the difference in do concentration these two possible dominant factors will be discussed in subsequent sections 3 1 2 effect of ns on nitrogen and cod removal of sfcws the removal performance of pollutants in sfcws is shown in figs 2 and s2 the average tn removal efficiency of n 60 ck is 81 30 similar to the results of deng et al 36 from fig 2a the average concentrations of nh4 n in n 0 n 60 ck n 120 n 300 and n 600 decrease by 0 12 21 57 44 54 14 47 and 9 01 mg l respectively this indicates that when the nitrogen concentration is in the range of 0 to 120 mgn l the nh4 n removal increased with the increase in nitrogen loading but decreased when the nitrogen concentration increased to 120 mgn l compared with n 60 ck the removal rate of nh4 n in n 120 increased by 106 47 while the removal rate of nh4 n in n 600 decreased by 45 05 similarly the removal rate of tn in high nitrogen loadings also decreased from fig 2b the average concentrations of no3 n in n 0 n 60 ck n 120 n 300 and n 600 decreased by 0 22 31 34 63 98 76 68 and 69 44 mg l respectively indicating that the average no3 n removal amount increased although the removal rate of no3 n in n 600 decreased this decrease was not significant the above results indicate that the increase in nitrogen loading has no negative impact on the denitrification process when the influent nitrogen concentration increased from 60 mg l to 120 mg l the average no3 n removal rate increased from 156 71 mg m2 d to 319 90 mg m2 d while the do concentration increased from 1 27 mg l to 1 82 mg l the above results suggested that the variation of no3 n nh4 n and tn removal rates may be related to the variation of rol rate in plants under different nss the average concentrations of cod in n 0 n 60 n 120 n 300 and n 600 decreased by 251 29 260 74 285 19 272 01 and 250 80 mg l respectively the cod removal rate of n 120 was the highest which was 1 14 times of that of n 600 the removal amount of cod decreases slightly under high nitrogen loading indicating that the enhancement of ns will inhibit the removal of cod in sfcws the removal of cod is mainly undertaken by heterotrophic microorganisms most of which have a denitrification function so that the removal characteristics of cod and no3 n are similar in addition the aerobic transformation of cod will consume do in sfcws and its concentration is also an important factor affecting cod removal do plays an important role in the removal of nh4 n when the removal amount and removal rate of nh4 n are higher the remaining do concentration will be lower however as shown in figs 1b 2a and s2 it can be found that the do concentration is also higher when the removal amount and rate of nh4 n is higher which is probably because the appropriate ns of 120 mg l stimulates the rol ability and then strengthens the growth and metabolism of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob the amount and rate of removal of nh4 n and the do concentration decrease under high nitrogen loadings n 300 n 600 which may be because the excessive ns of 300 600 mg l inhabits the rol ability and decreases the do concentration thus inhibiting the growth and metabolism of aob in addition denitrification includes aerobic denitrification and anaerobic denitrification the variation of do concentration will affect the process of these two kinds of denitrification when the nitrogen concentration increases from 60 mg l to 120 mg l both of the no3 n removal rate and do concentration increase this indicates that there may be bacteria with aerobic denitrification functions therefore it is necessary to further explain the above phenomena by exploring the response mechanisms of plants rhizosphere microenvironment and microorganisms under different nss 3 2 physiological responses of plants under ns 3 2 1 effects of ns on plant stress resistance nitrogen is an essential nutrient element for plant growth unlike other salts such as nacl the damage of ns to plants refers to osmotic stress and the resulting accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros and physiological disorders thus leading to nutritional imbalance and oxidative stress in plants 37 plants have developed different mechanisms to resist the negative effects of ros accumulation to minimize functional and structural damage antioxidants including enzymatic antioxidants and non enzymatic antioxidants are very effective in removing ros and lipid peroxidation in plants 38 39 in plants t aoc can evaluate the function of plant antioxidant systems in general as ros h2o2 is degraded by pod and catalase but since pod exhibits a high affinity for h2o2 40 the variation of the antioxidant enzyme activities is characterized by investigating the pod activity from fig 3a and b the t aoc content and pod activity vary on the first day of ns indicating that the antioxidant system of canna indica is more sensitive to ns the pod activity and the t aoc content in n 60 ck decrease to the initial level after a brief adaptive increase the t aoc content in n 0 increased continuously indicating that canna indica actively enhances its stress resistance under nitrogen deficiency stress however the pod activity decreases in this case because nitrogen is an essential nutrient for enzyme synthesis and nitrogen deficiency limits the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes 41 therefore the increased content of other non enzymatic antioxidants can probably lead to an increase in t aoc content from fig 3a the pod activity and t aoc content in n 120 n 300 and n 600 present an upward trend in the early stage stress with the corresponding peak values of 1 97 times and 6 25 times 2 02 times and 4 76 times 2 02 times and 5 97 times of the initial value respectively this indicates that canna indica enhances its stress resistance by actively increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and total antioxidant capacity under ns however with the continuous stress pod activity and t aoc content in n 120 stably remain at a high level while those in n 300 and n 600 gradually decrease indicating that the active enhancement of the antioxidant capacity of canna indica under appropriate ns is sustainable and conducive to plant normal growth while the antioxidant capacity of canna indica under excessive ns could only resist the ns briefly eventually resulting in severe damage of the antioxidant system 42 excessive ros leads to the lipid peroxidation of cell membrane through degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids 43 with its derivative of mda which can reflect the difference in damage of cell membrane 44 with its content different in canna indica under different nss fig 3c on the first day of ns the mda content in each group increases thus stimulating the activity of the antioxidant system fig 3a and b with the continuous stress the content of mda in canna indica leaves of n 60 ck and n 120 decreases gradually and eventually returns to a normal level while the mda content in canna indica leaves of n 0 n 300 and n 600 increases gradually with the final value of 2 93 times 4 01 times and 4 41 times of that in n 60 ck respectively which indicates that the antioxidant capacity of plants can be stimulated and maintained at a high level under appropriate ns thus reducing the lipid peroxidation the antioxidant capacity of plants is inhibited under excessive ns resulting in the inability to remove accumulated ros in time and then significantly deepen the damage degree of plants cell membranes 39 45 3 2 2 effects of ns on plant photosynthesis in the photosynthetic system of plants i e the main site of metabolism chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are used to evaluate photosynthetic efficiency and monitor the toxic effects of external stress on plant growth 46 with their contents changing on the first day fig 3d and e indicating that photosynthetic system of canna indica is sensitive to ns the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in n 0 decrease by 32 80 and 69 23 respectively this is because both of them are nitrogen containing compounds and nitrogen deficiency will inhibit chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis 47 which may be an important reason for the low concentration of do in n 0 fig 1b the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in n 120 increase by 78 70 and 90 24 respectively indicating that the enhanced stress resistance of canna indica promotes the synthesis of chlorophyll under appropriate ns the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in n 300 and n 600 increase slightly and then decrease on the 15th and 10th days by combining with the result in section 3 2 1 it can be seen that the high ns reduces the function of the antioxidant system and increases the lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane which leads to physiological responses such as nutrient imbalance and decrease of chlorophyll content thus reducing the photosynthesis of plants 48 studies have found that photosystem ii psii is more sensitive to environmental stress than photosystem i 49 50 which proves that psii is the priority target of various stresses the actual quantum yield of psii φpsii can quickly reflect the internal characteristics of the photosynthetic system and the actual photosynthesis of plants under different conditions 51 φpsii varies on the first day of stress fig 3f indicating that the psii of canna indica is sensitive to ns compared with n 60 ck the increment of φpsii in n 120 is 95 56 the φpsii increases slightly in n 0 n 300 and n 600 and then decreases on the 3rd 15th and 10th days with the final values of 35 71 35 09 and 28 55 of the peak values by combining the above results with the various characteristics of chlorophyll content mda content and do concentration it can be seen that appropriate ns can stimulate the stress resistance of canna indica as well as the chlorophyll synthesis and the actual photosynthetic efficiency thus enhancing the oxygen production capacity while excessive ns can aggravate the lipid peroxidation of canna indica and inhibit the chlorophyll synthesis and the actual photosynthetic efficiency thus decreasing oxygen production capacity which may be the main reason for the increase of do concentration under appropriate ns and the decrease of do concentration under excessive ns 3 2 3 effects of ns on roots aerenchyma development roots of wetland plants are in a state of hypoxic flooding for a long time and the aerenchyma is formed irreversibly through programmed cell death to deliver oxygen and improve the survival ability of plants 52 53 besides nitrogen deficit can influence the aerenchyma formation in plant roots 54 aerenchyma development totality is characterized by root porosity and root biomass and is irreversible since canna indica are cultivated under the same conditions before transplanting and kept root biomass consistent when transplanting the differences in root biomass and root porosity under different nss are reflected in the new adventitious roots from fig 4a the increase of root biomass of n 120 is 35 90 compared with n 60 ck indicating that appropriate ns can induce the germination of a large number of adventitious roots of canna indica the root biomass of n 0 n 300 and n 600 decreases significantly p 0 01 i e 44 10 57 85 and 41 54 of n 60 ck respectively nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and the photosynthesis of plants is inhibited under nitrogen deficiency stress resulting in a decrease in root biomass which is consistent with abiko and obara 13 in addition under high ns lipid peroxidation severely inhibits plant growth leading to root growth retardation root porosity in n 0 is significantly higher than that in n 60 ck p 0 01 indicating that the nitrogen deficiency stress increases root porosity which is consistent with abiko and obara 13 compared with n 60 ck the root porosity in n 120 increases by 32 06 and the root porosities of n 300 and n 600 decrease by 21 34 and 30 51 respectively studies have shown that the delivery efficiency of gases in plants is positively correlated with root porosity 55 therefore appropriate ns could induce the development of adventitious root biomass and root porosity in canna indica thereby persistently enhancing aerenchyma development and oxygen delivery capacity in plants however the high ns can inhibit aerenchyma development and oxygen delivery capacity nitrogen deficiency increases root porosity but inhibits root biomass thus inhibiting aerenchyma development to a certain extent under different nss the difference in aerenchyma development in roots was organic and irreversible throughout the whole growth period of plants consequently controlling nitrogen loading is critical to persistently affect the removal efficiency and stability of pollutants in sfcws 3 2 4 effects of ns on plant rol rate and correlation of rol with physiological responses and do there is a significant difference in the rol rate of canna indica under different nss p 0 01 fig 4b compared with n 60 ck the average rol rate increases by 40 33 in n 120 and decreases by 44 81 60 38 and 82 31 in n 0 n 300 and n 600 respectively suggesting that appropriate ns can enhance root physiological activities such as rol while excessive ns can inhibit root physiological activities there is a significant positive correlation between do concentration and rol rate r 0 923 p 0 001 fig 5a c since limited atmospheric reoxygenation and insignificant difference in do concentration in influent the variation of rol rate of canna indica under different nss is a dominant factor leading to the significant difference in do concentration in sfcws root porosity and plant photosynthesis are two important factors affecting rol 56 so the rol rate is influenced not only by the oxygen production capacity of photosynthesis but also by the oxygen delivery capacity of aerenchyma fig 5a and c show the significant positive correlation among rol do concentration photosynthetic efficiency and aerenchyma development of canna indica under different nitrogen loadings respectively all p 0 05 indicating that the synergistic changes in plant physiological responses and the changes in ns intensity will not alter the correlation of rol with plant metabolism and morphogenesis and it can be inferred that the variation of rol under ns is an external manifestation of plant physiology to adapt to the cws habitat thus varying the do concentration in cws therefore it is concluded that in contrast to excessive ns appropriate ns could improve the oxygen production and delivery capacity of plants by stimulating the antioxidant capacity photosynthetic efficiency and the development of root aerenchyma thus strengthening the rol rate and increasing the do concentration of cws 3 3 responses of rhizosphere microbial community structure activities and pollutant removal mechanisms under ns 3 3 1 response of rhizosphere microbial community structure under ns α diversity reflects the diversity of species within an ecosystem as shown in table s4 all goods coverage is above 0 97 indicating that the diversity index is effectively comparable among samples the results of the richness index chao1 and diversity index shannon and simpson show that the richness and diversity of rhizosphere microorganisms are the highest under appropriate ns while the richness and diversity of rhizosphere microorganisms decrease under excessive ns these results are consistent with the variation of plant physiological responses and rol rate suggesting that ns may regulate rhizosphere microbial diversity by changing the rol rate β diversity indicates that microbial communities cluster in different groups under different nss and this aggregation may be caused by different environmental conditions i e do under ns fig s3 57 the relative abundance of major rhizosphere microorganisms is shown in fig 6a proteobacteria 78 4 88 8 bacteroidetes 3 2 12 3 actinobacteria 3 1 9 1 and firmicutes 4 1 4 6 dominate the rhizosphere microorganisms proteobacteria contains a large number of facultative anaerobic bacteria that can participate in the degradation of organic matters and use oxygen as an electron acceptor which is an important component of nitrogen fixing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria 58 proteobacteria with their rapid growth and metabolic diversity can survive in a variety of complex environments including nutrient poor and nutrient rich environments 59 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes increases with the increase in nitrogen loading indicating that bacteroidetes are more suitable to survive in a high nitrogen loading environment than proteobacteria although the abundance of bacteroidetes is low in general it can use the intracellular substances released by proteobacteria lysis to proliferate under anaerobic conditions 60 61 which confirmed the result that the do concentration was the lowest but the bacteroidetes abundance was the highest in n 600 nitrospirae is a type of nitrifying bacteria and their relative abundance first increases and then decreases with the increase in nitrogen loading which is consistent with the variation of do concentration and rol rate therefore the variation of proteobacteria abundance bacteroidetes and nitrospirae may be related to the rol rate the do concentration in the plant rhizosphere environment will have an impact on the rhizosphere microbial community structure therefore changes in the rate of oxygen secretion by plant roots under ns will further shape the rhizosphere microbial community structure most of the bacteria with high abundance in the rhizosphere are facultative anaerobes with denitrification functions among which thauera is the most widely distributed thauera shows strong denitrification ability in both anoxic aerobic experiments and denitrification can be carried out through an aerobic pathway outside the cell membrane and an anoxic pathway inside the membrane 62 fig 6a shows that the relative abundance of thauera in n 120 is the highest 54 60 while the relative abundance of thauera in n 0 and n 600 decreases to 21 24 and 34 70 respectively the abundance of thauera is significantly positively correlated with the rol rate p 0 01 fig 5b flavobacterium and chryseobacterium are widely served as denitrifying bacteria nitrospira and nitrosomonas are nitrifying bacteria and all four genera are strictly aerobic and there is a significant positive correlation between their abundance and rol rate p 0 01 previous studies had confirmed that thermomonas were related to organic degradation 63 thermomonas abundance was significantly negatively correlated with rol rate p 0 05 in line with its anaerobic denitrification characteristics in addition it was found that rhodobacter was more likely to proliferate in an alternating anoxic and aerobic environment 15 hence in this study the oxygen secreting activity of plant roots may promote the proliferation of rhodobacter in the rhizosphere which is consistent with the findings of zhu et al 64 from fig 5c all the above genera except thermomonas are significantly correlated with the rol rate and other plant physiological parameters instead of ns which indicates the intrinsic relationship between the changes of plant physiological responses and microbial community abundance under ns ns could regulate the relative abundance of microorganisms by changing the rol rate an external manifestation of plant physiological response to form microbial communities adapted to the rhizosphere microenvironment 18 65 rather than by the direct effect of ns microorganisms are the main consumers of do in cws when the abundance and activity of aerobic bacteria or facultative anaerobes are higher the remaining do concentration will be lower however as shown in figs 1 6a and b when the abundance and activity of aerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobic bacteria are higher in n 120 the do concentration is also higher considering the significant positive correlation between do concentration and rol it can be proved that the rol of plants is the dominant factor affecting do concentration in cws and the effect of microbial oxygen consumption on do concentration can be excluded which means that the rol under appropriate ns has enough surplus to compensate for the oxygen consumed by microorganisms simultaneously it can be further proved that rol under appropriate ns has sufficient ability to shape the microbial community by controlling do concentration 3 3 2 response of microbial key enzyme activities and pollutant removal mechanisms under ns the removal of pollutants in cws is mainly accomplished by microbial enzyme catalysis 66 fig 6b shows a large gap between the activity of amo a key enzyme in the nitrification process and the activities of nar and nap which is due to the low growth rate and abundance of nitrifying bacteria compared with n 60 ck the amo activity in n 120 increased by 90 66 and the amo activity in n 0 and n 600 decreased by 71 16 and 78 09 which could explain the results of nh4 n removal highly sensitive to environmental conditions nitrifying bacteria will be seriously inhibited by inappropriate do temperature ph fa concentration and alkalinity 67 68 in this study all the sfcws were at the same moderate temperature and section 3 1 shows that there are no influences of ph and fa on nitrifying bacteria therefore the variation of nitrogen loading in sfcws and environmental conditions will not inhibit nitrifying bacteria moreover the amo activity is positively correlated with the rol rate p 0 01 fig 5b indicating that the variation of rol rate under ns is a dominant factor leading to the difference in amo activity combined with the discussion in section 3 2 it can be seen that the difference between photosynthesis and aerenchyma development under ns was persistent appropriate ns can increase the rol rate and the do concentration by stimulating the photosynthetic efficiency and root aerenchyma development of plants thereby persistently promoting the proliferation and activities of nitrifying bacteria and improving the nh4 n removal the physiology of plants is inhibited under excessive ns which reduces the rol rate and do concentration thereby inhibiting the proliferation and activities of nitrifying bacteria as well as the nh4 n removal since the optimal stress response intensity was 120 mg l the nitrogen load recommended in the chinese design specifications can be increased appropriately the influencing mechanisms are shown in fig 7 nar and nap are key enzymes in anaerobic and aerobic denitrification respectively compared to n 60 ck the nap activity in n 120 increased by 78 27 while n 0 and n 600 only were 48 61 and 39 44 of that in n 120 respectively different from amo and nap the nar activity increased gradually with the increase of nitrogen loading especially when in n 600 nar activity was 1 40 times higher than that in n 60 ck as shown in fig 5b and c the rol rate was significantly positively correlated with the nap activity r 0 911 p 0 001 and negatively correlated with the nar activity r 0 691 p 0 01 napa is a gene controlling nap synthesis and can be expressed in complete aerobic conditions 69 and narg a gene controlling nar synthesis is more sensitive to do concentration which explains the variation of nar and nap activity it is also shown that the response of the rol rate to ns is a dominant factor leading to the differences in nar and nap activities the classic theory of aerobic denitrification believes that oxygen will not affect the electron transfer between no3 n and organic matter and when both no3 n and oxygen are present the denitrification ability is better than that in the situation where only no3 n exists 70 this confirms that the abundance of aerobic denitrifying bacteria such as thauera and the removal rate of no3 n also increase with the increase in do concentration under appropriate ns as shown in fig 5b the no3 n removal is significantly positively correlated with nar activity r 0 697 p 0 05 and negatively correlated with nap activity r 0 234 p 0 05 this was because although the inhibition of plant rol under excessive ns could result in a significant decrease in nap activity the performance of facultative anaerobic denitrifiers and the removal of no3 n were not significantly different within the nitrogen loading range of the design specification due to enhanced nar activity the influencing mechanisms are shown in fig 7 4 conclusion 1 under the appropriate ns the enhancement of stress resistance and the stabilization of cell structures of canna indica were sustainable under excessive ns unsustainable stress resistance resulted in permanent damage in cell structure 2 appropriate ns could increase the rol rate and wetland do concentration by 40 33 and 43 11 by persistently and significantly increasing oxygen production capacity and oxygen transport capacity of plants thus nearly doubling the abundance and activity of nitrogen transforming microorganisms and nitrogen removal in actual operation nitrogen loading recommended in wetland specifications could be appropriately increased 3 changes by ns in rol rate significantly affected ammonia oxidizing bacteria performance however the performance of facultative anaerobic denitrifiers and the removal of no3 n were not significantly different due to enhanced nitrate reductase activity 4 different nss would lead to the organic and irreversible difference in aerenchyma development in roots throughout the whole growth period of plants consequently controlling nitrogen loading is critical to persistently affect the removal efficiency and stability of pollutants in sfcws declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12623,the removal of toxic radioactive pollutants from water sources for further disposal and treatment is a critical issue development of an effective adsorbent with high adsorption capacity and stability for the adsorption of hexavalent uranium u vi ions is interesting research task in this study orange waste biochar magnesium silicate obms composite was prepared by simple hydrothermal method and utilized for u vi ions adsorption removal from aqueous solution the successfully synthesized obms composite consists of graphitic carbon biochar and interconnected magnesium silicate nanosheets exhibiting 73 9 m2 g surface area with h3 type hysterias loop suggests mesoporous texture having stacked and agglomerated magnesium silicate layers covered by biochar the prepared composite was used to study the influence of ph u vi ion concentration mass of adsorbent presence of other cations and determination of thermodynamic functions it was observed that obms composite showed high adsorption capacity langmuir adsorption capacity of 352 6 mg g at 298 k ph 4 irrespective of presence of other cations a series of batch experiments and characterization results revealed that the superior adsorption performance of the composite is due to interaction between u vi ions and functional groups presented on the obms composite surface the observed results suggesting the interaction between u vi ions obms surface functional groups such as cc coh co mgosi and mg oh 2 is playing a key role in removal of u vi ions from aqueous solution this low cost and easily synthesized absorbent has a great potential for use in the remediation of radioactive u vi ions in aquatic environments graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations obms orange waste biochar magnesium silicate ms magnesium silicate ob orange waste biochar keywords orange waste biochar magnesium silicate u vi ions water remediation mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nuclear power delivers a convenient energy however it comes with various concerns such as nuclear waste disposal and serious consequences due to unanticipated disasters 1 nuclear pollution is responsible for short and long term health and safety issues 2 the fukushima nuclear disaster is still inflicting significant damage to the surrounding communities and even neighbouring marine areas 1 uranium u is the principal source of nuclear energy and one of the major components in the nuclear waste produced in the nuclear power plants 3 it is also considered as a viable replacement for fossil fuels because of its economic and environmental benefits 3 4 however nuclear waste disposal is a complicated process since uranium is a radioactive and carcinogenic material and even tiny amounts can cause a considerable harm to human health if the uranium containing pollutants discharge exposed to the environment the radioactive species could enter into the food chain and end up in the human body causing kidney damage and altering liver function 2 5 in the aqueous media the primary states of uranium are u vi and u iv the toxicity and carcinogenicity of u vi species were much greater than u iv species 6 therefore eliminating this hazardous u vi ions from polluted wastewater is crucial for environment preservation and water treatment to date numerous methods have been utilized to remove the radionuclides from the aquatic environment including adsorption 6 7 photocatalyst 4 8 co precipitation 9 ion exchange 10 and oxidation reduction 11 however the adsorption process has been widely considered as an efficient method due to its simple design wide applicability and convenient to use in recent years research is focused on the development of efficient adsorbents to extract u vi ions from aqueous solutions several adsorbents including clay minerals 1 carbon based materials 3 12 13 biochar 14 biomasses 15 polymers 16 17 metal organic frameworks and metal oxides 18 were utilized for adsorption of u vi ions from polluted groundwater unfortunately some of them are restricted for practical use due to low adsorption capacity and poor selectivity while others are limited because of expensive nature 19 carbon based adsorbents on the other hand are popular due to their enviro friendly widespread availability and high adsorption capability carbonaceous materials such as activated carbon carbon nanotube based composites and graphene oxides have all been studied for removal of u vi ions 18 20 it was reported that carbonaceous materials have the potential to be effective adsorbents in the treatment of radioactive wastewater 19 although the academic research has made substantial progress in recent years the practical use of these materials remains hindered because of aggressive synthetic processes have impeded the synthesis of carbon nanotube based materials and graphene oxides are relatively expensive 19 as a result minimization of the cost of the system without sacrificing the sorption efficiency is an important research aspect which merits further investigation biomass raw materials have received much attention in recent times because of low cost environmental friendliness and their abundance in nature many researchers have developed carbon based adsorbent materials from biomass for water purification 19 21 22 even though biomass derived carbon can be supplied at a cheap cost from a variety of resources its adsorption capability is restricted designing and synthesizing a composite adsorbent which could offer stable adsorption capacity for u vi ions is crucial inorganic metal oxides have gained much popularity due to their appealing features which can greatly modify the physicochemical properties of carbon based materials and enhance the adsorption performance for wastewater treatment 23 24 for instance han et al studied the effect of h2o2 and naoh treatment on the structure and composition of animal manure biochar which exhibited high u vi ion adsorption capacity of 221 4 mg g 25 chen et al successfully synthesized layered double hydroxide modified lignin derived carbon for the efficient adsorption of u vi ions and these authors observed adsorption capacity of 265 6 mg g 26 liao et al used mno2 loaded microorganism derived carbon and removed u vi ions with the adsorption capacity of 207 mg g 27 chen et al was prepared mgo biochar composite from pine sawdust and utilized it for u vi removal from water and achieved maximum adsorption capacity of 514 7 mg g 19 metal silicate nanomaterials are widely used due to their easy availability eco friendliness and stable physicochemical features particularly magnesium silicate exhibited superior adsorption ability and it is regarded as a promising adsorbent owing to its greater surface area high porosity and enviro friendly nature 28 30 it was previously reported that the magnesium silicates had excellent adsorption ability toward different organic and inorganic pollutants in wastewater 28 however the silicate material synthesis process is complex and silicate material is susceptible to aggregation which significantly limits its adsorption ability 31 32 these drawbacks limit the use of metal silicate material as an effective adsorbent the global orange production is estimated to be 47 5 million tons 33 the use of waste orange peel is thus significant and it is possible due to the abundance of cellulose and lignin in orange peel the pyrolytic reprocessing of waste orange peel to make biochar is also economically feasible as it is important for environmental protection and waste biomass recycling the recycle treatment enhances the surface area and the size of the pore channels significantly 24 to best of our knowledge only few references are existed in the literature pertaining to the use of biochar derived from orange peel to capture u vi ions from aqueous solutions in this work we synthesized economically viable composite using orange waste biochar ob and magnesium silicate ms materials the synthesized materials were employed as an effective adsorbent to remove u vi ions from polluted water the major goals of this research are to i prepare the obms composites ii investigate their unique features by employing various characterization techniques and predict the sorption mechanism iii evaluate their efficacy for u vi ions removal under various experimental conditions such as mass of adsorbent solution ph adsorption time temperature and initial u vi ions concentration in batch experiments 2 experimental 2 1 materials the sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were purchased from samchun chemicals co ltd south korea the analytical reagents of sodium meta silicate na2sio3 and magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o were supplied by daejung reagents and chemicals south korea the purchased chemicals were used as received 2 2 synthesis of obms composite

then ground into fine powder and allowed to pass through a 100 mesh sieve the powder sample was then pyrolyzed for 2 h at 650 c and the obtained product was grounded using an agate mortar and sieved through a 100 mesh sieve to obtain uniform sized particles finally the biochar was washed with 0 1 mol l hcl solution to remove the ashes before drying it at 80 c then 1 0 g of obtained orange waste biochar ob was mixed with 25 ml of 3 32 g of na2sio3 to this 25 ml solution which contained 3 0 g of mgcl2 6h2o was slowly added to obtain a suspension the obtained suspension was hydrothermally treated at 180 c for 12 h in a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave the resulting material was washed with distilled water and dried at 60 c for overnight the pristine magnesium silicate ms

inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkinelmer usa 2 4 adsorption experiments the u vi concentration was determined using icp oes instrumental analysis the u vi adsorption experiment was carried out in a 50 ml flacon tube in general the 0 2 g l adsorbent was mixed 25 mg l of u vi solution with a speed of 180 rpm the ph and the temperature of the contents were maintained at 4 and 298 k respectively the u vi solution samples are withdrawn periodically from the solution for analysis after being filtered through a 0 45 um membrane filter different u vi solutions with varying initial concentrations 5 200 mg l were used to determine the adsorption isotherms for the adsorption kinetics experiments the u vi concentration was measured at different time intervals the ph effect on u vi sorption was experimentally studied by adjusting the ph in the range of 2 6 by using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hno3 solutions the ion effect on u vi sorption was conducted by adding the ca2 na mg2 and k ions with typical concentrations 1 100 mg l in wastewater to study the regeneration performance of obms composite the material was filtered after the adsorption and washed with a solution containing 0 1 m na2co3 in 2 h2o2 to remove the adsorbed u vi ions then the recovered adsorbents were washed with ethanol and deionized water until the solution ph is neutral the adsorption desorption experiments were repeated for 5 times 2 5 calculations from u vi adsorption experiments results the percentage adsorption removal and adsorption capacity at the equilibrium qe in mg g of obms were

3 1 characterization of obms composite the synthesized obms composite was characterized by using fe sem edx tga xrd ft ir n2 physisorption and xps spectroscopy techniques the surface morphology of the synthetic obms composite is presented in fig 2 a b the sem images of obms composite show presence of stacked and agglomerated magnesium silicate layers covered by biochar the sample is slightly conductive and the surface become rough the existence of agglomerated layers in the obms composite is because of the hydroxylated edge edge interaction of the magnesium silicate layers and the hydroxyl functional groups in biochar the edx analysis was utilized to determine the bulk elemental compositions of obms composite samples the edx images show that c o si and mg elements are presented uniformly on the surface of the obms composite fig 2 c d the tem images of obms composite are shown in fig 2 e f were further confirm the morphology of magnesium silicate nanosheets the tem images clearly showing nanosheets interconnect with each other to assemble a network structure and the lamella of products are growing into lumps weak van der waals forces held the layers of magnesium silicate sheets together between the surface oxygen atoms 40 on the edge face of the layers functional hydroxyl groups such as sioh and mgoh were abundant making them hydrophilic that leads to well dispersion of obms in water 41 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of obms fig s1 exhibit type iv isotherm with narrow hysteresis loop h3 type as per iupac classification indicating the mesoporous structure of obms composite 42 43 the pore size distribution pattern confirms that the sample possess mesopores not shown in the figure with the pore diameter mainly centred at 20 40 nm the presence of large size mesopore structure is due to irregularly stacked magnesium silicate layers sem analysis in addition obms composite have specific surface area of 73 9 m2 g which is much larger than that of the bulk ob 12 1 m2 g and ms 64 5 m2 g these observations suggest that the obms composite possess pore structure and surface area that are beneficial for adsorption process the tga analysis was performed to study the thermal behaviour and stability of the obms composite in the nitrogen atmosphere the fig 3a showed tga pattern for obms sample a weight loss 5 wt occurred less than 200 c which is due to the loss of physically adsorbed h2o in the first stage 44 the second stage weight loss about 6 wt was occurred in between 200 and 550 c which could be associated to decomposition of functional groups presented in ob and ms in the final stage a minor weight loss around 3 wt was occurred in between 550 and 1000 c which indicates that obms composite is stable at high temperatures the xrd patterns for ob and obms samples are shown in fig 3b the results showed that the strong reflection at 2θ 23 corresponded to graphite structure of ob 45 the xrd pattern of obms sample showed additional reflections at 27 36 40 47 and 56 44 corresponding to mgsio3 phase jcpcd 11 273 and this observation indicating that the mgsio3 and ob were composited in obms sample 46 the ft ir spectra for bulk ob fresh and used obms composite are presented in fig 4 a the most intense vibrations are associated with different functional groups presented on the obms composite the obms sample exhibited a broad ir absorption peak centred at 3355 cm 1 which id because of oh stretching of h2o and or surface adsorbed oh groups the other peak observed at 1637 cm 1 is due to hoh bending and rotation of h2o molecules the peaks at 989 cm 1 and 437 cm 1 could be attributed to sio and mgo stretching vibrations 47 after u vi adsorption on obms composite the peak due to oh groups slightly shifted to 3318 cm 1 corresponds to the vibrations of sioh 48 similarly the peaks due to sio and mgo groups also shifted to 985 cm 1 and 433 cm 1 the peak shift could be due to the oh sio and mgo functional groups of obms composite were involved in u vi adsorption process it was caused due to the binding of abundant oxygen containing functional groups with uranyl ions present on the surface of magnesium silicate which facilitates uranyl ion complexation with the adsorbent 49 the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was utilized to obtain the surface chemical composition and electronic state of elements for the bare ob obms composite and used obms u vi samples the full xps survey spectrum show that c o mg and si elements presented on the obms sample surface fig 4b the presence of mg 1s and si 2p peaks in the spectrum indicates that the mg and si elements have been successfully incorporated in the composite sample the presence of a u 4f peak in the spectrum of used obms u vi sample fig 4 b confirms that the u vi ions were adsorbed on the surface of obms sample 24 fig 5 depicts deconvoluted xps spectra of o 1s c 1s mg 1s and si 1s for fresh and used obms composite samples the o 1s peak of the fresh obms composite can be fitted into two peaks at 534 8 ev and 532 9 ev which could be assigned to coh and mgosi species 50 fig 5a however the binding energy of these peaks is slightly shifted to 534 0 ev and 532 8 ev in case of spent obms composite sample the de convoluted c 1s spectra for fresh and spent obms composite are shown in fig 5 b and c 1s can be de convoluted into three peaks with binding energies at 284 7 ev 285 5 ev and 287 3 ev which could be assigned to cc cc coh and co groups respectively the peak areas corresponding to cc cc coh and co functional groups 284 6 ev 285 4 ev and 287 7 ev decreased in case of spent obms catalyst after u vi adsorption similar result was observed in mg 1s spectra of the samples as shown in fig 5 c the contributions of peaks due to mgosi and mg oh 2 groups at 1304 6 ev and 1308 8 ev are decreased after u vi ions adsorption the two de convoluted si 2p peaks fig 5d for the obms composite were appeared at 103 9 ev sioh and 105 0 ev siosi 51 and these two peaks were also shifted to lower binding energies 103 7 ev and 105 0 ev in case of spent obms composite the xps results suggesting that u vi adsorption was chemical adsorption on the surface of obms composite 3 2 u vi adsorption over obms composite the fig 6 a depicts the influence of time on the u vi ions adsorption ability of obms for kinetic studies two different solutions with u vi concentrations of 25 mg l 50 mg l were used a rapid u vi ions adsorption was observed within the 120 min reaching the highest adsorption amount on the surface of obms composite with increase of time the adsorption rate was increased gradually until the adsorption equilibrium was reached after reaching equilibrium 120 min the adsorption capacity remain constant with increasing operation time to evaluate the adsorption kinetics the adsorption data were fitted to pseudo first order pseudo second order and elvoch adsorption kinetic models the nonlinear fitting of the obtained data resulted the pseudo second order kinetic model as it is found to be more suitable than the other models based on the fitted curves and correlation coefficients table 1 the adsorption amount of u vi ions on the surface of obms composite for 25 mg l and 50 mg l solutions was observed as 124 1 mg g and 226 2 mg g respectively the results indicating that the u vi ions were adsorbed on the surface of obms composite by rate limiting kinetics via chemical interactions such as ionic covalent bonds complexation 52 the entire adsorption process could have occurred in three different stages in the beginning of the adsorption process more active sites are available for u vi adsorption on the surface of obms composite which are responsible for rapid u vi adsorption second the limited diffusion rate of u vi ions inside of the pores of composite causes slow adsorption rate and third the u vi ions uptake process reaches to equilibrium and remains constant it is well reported that ph of the solution has a significant influence on the adsorption efficiency of adsorbent 53 as the surface properties of obms composite in solution could vary with change of ph of the solution to study the role of ph on u vi adsorption capacity of obms composite the adsorption measurements were carried out in the ph range of 2 6 and 298 k fig 6 b it is well reported that ph of the solution has a significant influence on the adsorption efficiency of adsorbent 53 as the surface properties of obms composite in solution could vary with ph change to study the role of ph on u vi adsorption capacity of obms composite the adsorption measurements were carried out in the ph range of 2 6 at 298 k fig 2 b at low ph relatively low adsorption rate for obms composite was observed because of the competition between h and u vi ions prevented the u vi ions from occupying the adsorption sites 54 55 the u vi adsorption capacity of obms increased from 70 to 95 in the ph range of 3 0 6 0 which is probably due to decrease of competition from h ions the slight increase of ph around 4 enables the adsorbent to adsorb different uranium species including uo2 2 uo2 oh uo2 2 oh 2 2 uo2 3 oh 5 and uo2 4 oh 7 as predicted by visual minteq 3 0 program 42 however above ph 4 0 there is a clear possibility for hydrolysis of u vi species to form uo2 2 oh 2 2 uo2 3 oh 5 and uo2 4 oh 7 species which could influence the adsorption process for this reason the adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 4 0 where the concentrations of uo2 2 oh 2 2 uo2 3 oh 5 and uo2 4 oh 7 are low compared to the major species u vi uo2 2 uo2 oh to avoid severe hydrolysis above ph 4 0 54 the observed high u vi adsorption in solution with ph less than phpzc of obms phpzc 7 24 measured by acid base titration method suggested that the adsorption process is not influenced by the electrostatic interactions but it is occurring via surface complexation through chemical interactions the adsorption of u vi ions over bare hydrolytic magnesium silicate in aqueous with ph 4 was also investigated for comparison purpose the influence of the mass of the adsorbent on the u vi adsorption ability of obms was studied by changing the mass of the adsorbent from 0 1 g l to 1 0 g l fig 6 c the adsorption removal is increased to 95 99 as the obms amount increased from 0 1 g l to 0 2 g l owing to the increased number of active sites responsible for the removal of u vi from aqueous solution with further increase of obms mass from 0 2 g l to 1 0 g l no considerable change in the u vi adsorption amount was observed this result is due to the decreased number active site per unit area of obms surface by the intra molecular attraction of obms molecules 56 therefore the optimum amount of obms composite for the further studies is 0 2 g l at optimum conditions the adsorption isotherm models were obtained to calculate the distribution of u vi ions in aqueous and solid phases the obtained langmuir freundlich and temkin adsorption isotherms are presented in fig 6 d and the corresponding values are tabulated in table 2 the langmuir model had a higher coefficient of correlation r2 than the other two isotherm models as a result the langmuir model is a suitable one for defining u vi adsorption over obms composite implying that as prepared obms sample had a homogeneous adsorption surface 57 therefore adsorption of u vi ions on the obms composite surface is a monolayer adsorption process the maximum amount of u vi ions adsorbed by the obms composite in this study is 352 6 mg g at 298 k which is greater than amount adsorbed by the bulk ms 144 7 mg g and other reported absorbent materials table 3 existence of more number of functional groups on the surface of hydrothermally synthesized obms composite could be the reason for enhanced u vi ion adsorption capacity the thermodynamic functions such as δg δh and δs are obtained using van t hoff s models fig 7 a table 4 lists the obtained thermodynamic parameters for u vi adsorption process over obms composite the negative δg and positive δh values indicated that u vi adsorption on the obms surface is an endothermic and spontaneous process whereas the positive δs values indicating that the degrees of freedom increased at the solid liquid interface 58 coexisting ions could easily influence the u vi adsorption in the aquatic system therefore it is practical to investigate the interference of coexisting ions on u vi adsorption the influence of coexistence of ca2 na k and mg2 ions on the u vi adsorption ability of obms composite is shown in fig s2 the observed results indicated that there s no significant effect on u vi adsorption removal probably due to inner sphere complexation is mainly accountable for u vi adsorption on obms 59 3 3 obms composite regeneration stability for practical application the adsorbents should have stable regenerability as well as higher adsorption capacity and fast adsorption kinetics thus the regenerability of obms composite was studied the obms adsorbent was collected by centrifugation after adsorption of u vi ions then the composite was washed with 0 1 m na2co3 in 2 h2o2 60 which shows 99 5 desorption u vi solution repeatedly to remove any absorbed u vi on the surface and reused for new cycle of adsorption the regeneration study was performed for four consecutive cycles as shown in fig 7b after two cycles the removal of capacity of the obms composite is around 90 and it was slightly decreased to 80 at fourth cycle however it is higher than the adsorption capacities of bare ob and ms the decrease of adsorption capacity of obms composite with increase of recycle number is mainly due to loss of adsorbent mass in powder form during separation and regeneration steps to avoid the loss of adsorbent mass utilization of obms granules is recommended to keep the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent 3 4 adsorption mechanism to predict the adsorption mechanism over obms composite several reaction parameters such ph ionic strength kinetics isotherm and thermodynamics studies were performed it was clearly observed that the u vi adsorption was not influenced with phpzc of obms adsorbent and also the ionic strength has no significant influence fig s2 which indicates the adsorption process was inner sphere surface complexion through chemical interactions by obms surface functional groups further the chemical surface complexion of adsorption process was confirmed from the kinetics fig 6 a and isotherms fig 6 d studies where the u vi adsorption process was well explained by monolayer rate limiting kinetics on homogeneous surface of obms it was clearly explained from thermodynamic studies where the u vi adsorption on obms was endothermic with spontaneous with δh 16 8 kj mol suggesting the chemisorption fig 7a further the adsorption mechanism was evaluated by using xps fig 4 and ft ir fig 5 results this results suggesting the adsorptive removal of u vi with obms was through the surface complexation via the interaction of u vi with obms surface functional groups such as cc coh co mgosi and mg oh 2 at present experimental conditions 4 conclusions a simple hydrothermal method was used to synthesize the orange biochar magnesium silicate obms composite the specific surface area of the obms was 73 9 m2 g the u vi ions adsorption experiments results revealed that obms composite had a homogeneous surface with saturated adsorption sites and the adsorption was monolayer adsorption the synthesized obms composite have a potential to remove the u vi ions from wastewater with high adsorption capacity 352 6 mg g and fast adsorption rate 99 u vi ions adsorption amount within 120 min the adsorption measurements indicated that the adsorption behaviour of obms composite for u vi is independent of presence of various coexisting cations the calculated thermodynamic functions for the u vi adsorption over obms are endothermic in nature with

12623,the removal of toxic radioactive pollutants from water sources for further disposal and treatment is a critical issue development of an effective adsorbent with high adsorption capacity and stability for the adsorption of hexavalent uranium u vi ions is interesting research task in this study orange waste biochar magnesium silicate obms composite was prepared by simple hydrothermal method and utilized for u vi ions adsorption removal from aqueous solution the successfully synthesized obms composite consists of graphitic carbon biochar and interconnected magnesium silicate nanosheets exhibiting 73 9 m2 g surface area with h3 type hysterias loop suggests mesoporous texture having stacked and agglomerated magnesium silicate layers covered by biochar the prepared composite was used to study the influence of ph u vi ion concentration mass of adsorbent presence of other cations and determination of thermodynamic functions it was observed that obms composite showed high adsorption capacity langmuir adsorption capacity of 352 6 mg g at 298 k ph 4 irrespective of presence of other cations a series of batch experiments and characterization results revealed that the superior adsorption performance of the composite is due to interaction between u vi ions and functional groups presented on the obms composite surface the observed results suggesting the interaction between u vi ions obms surface functional groups such as cc coh co mgosi and mg oh 2 is playing a key role in removal of u vi ions from aqueous solution this low cost and easily synthesized absorbent has a great potential for use in the remediation of radioactive u vi ions in aquatic environments graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations obms orange waste biochar magnesium silicate ms magnesium silicate ob orange waste biochar keywords orange waste biochar magnesium silicate u vi ions water remediation mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nuclear power delivers a convenient energy however it comes with various concerns such as nuclear waste disposal and serious consequences due to unanticipated disasters 1 nuclear pollution is responsible for short and long term health and safety issues 2 the fukushima nuclear disaster is still inflicting significant damage to the surrounding communities and even neighbouring marine areas 1 uranium u is the principal source of nuclear energy and one of the major components in the nuclear waste produced in the nuclear power plants 3 it is also considered as a viable replacement for fossil fuels because of its economic and environmental benefits 3 4 however nuclear waste disposal is a complicated process since uranium is a radioactive and carcinogenic material and even tiny amounts can cause a considerable harm to human health if the uranium containing pollutants discharge exposed to the environment the radioactive species could enter into the food chain and end up in the human body causing kidney damage and altering liver function 2 5 in the aqueous media the primary states of uranium are u vi and u iv the toxicity and carcinogenicity of u vi species were much greater than u iv species 6 therefore eliminating this hazardous u vi ions from polluted wastewater is crucial for environment preservation and water treatment to date numerous methods have been utilized to remove the radionuclides from the aquatic environment including adsorption 6 7 photocatalyst 4 8 co precipitation 9 ion exchange 10 and oxidation reduction 11 however the adsorption process has been widely considered as an efficient method due to its simple design wide applicability and convenient to use in recent years research is focused on the development of efficient adsorbents to extract u vi ions from aqueous solutions several adsorbents including clay minerals 1 carbon based materials 3 12 13 biochar 14 biomasses 15 polymers 16 17 metal organic frameworks and metal oxides 18 were utilized for adsorption of u vi ions from polluted groundwater unfortunately some of them are restricted for practical use due to low adsorption capacity and poor selectivity while others are limited because of expensive nature 19 carbon based adsorbents on the other hand are popular due to their enviro friendly widespread availability and high adsorption capability carbonaceous materials such as activated carbon carbon nanotube based composites and graphene oxides have all been studied for removal of u vi ions 18 20 it was reported that carbonaceous materials have the potential to be effective adsorbents in the treatment of radioactive wastewater 19 although the academic research has made substantial progress in recent years the practical use of these materials remains hindered because of aggressive synthetic processes have impeded the synthesis of carbon nanotube based materials and graphene oxides are relatively expensive 19 as a result minimization of the cost of the system without sacrificing the sorption efficiency is an important research aspect which merits further investigation biomass raw materials have received much attention in recent times because of low cost environmental friendliness and their abundance in nature many researchers have developed carbon based adsorbent materials from biomass for water purification 19 21 22 even though biomass derived carbon can be supplied at a cheap cost from a variety of resources its adsorption capability is restricted designing and synthesizing a composite adsorbent which could offer stable adsorption capacity for u vi ions is crucial inorganic metal oxides have gained much popularity due to their appealing features which can greatly modify the physicochemical properties of carbon based materials and enhance the adsorption performance for wastewater treatment 23 24 for instance han et al studied the effect of h2o2 and naoh treatment on the structure and composition of animal manure biochar which exhibited high u vi ion adsorption capacity of 221 4 mg g 25 chen et al successfully synthesized layered double hydroxide modified lignin derived carbon for the efficient adsorption of u vi ions and these authors observed adsorption capacity of 265 6 mg g 26 liao et al used mno2 loaded microorganism derived carbon and removed u vi ions with the adsorption capacity of 207 mg g 27 chen et al was prepared mgo biochar composite from pine sawdust and utilized it for u vi removal from water and achieved maximum adsorption capacity of 514 7 mg g 19 metal silicate nanomaterials are widely used due to their easy availability eco friendliness and stable physicochemical features particularly magnesium silicate exhibited superior adsorption ability and it is regarded as a promising adsorbent owing to its greater surface area high porosity and enviro friendly nature 28 30 it was previously reported that the magnesium silicates had excellent adsorption ability toward different organic and inorganic pollutants in wastewater 28 however the silicate material synthesis process is complex and silicate material is susceptible to aggregation which significantly limits its adsorption ability 31 32 these drawbacks limit the use of metal silicate material as an effective adsorbent the global orange production is estimated to be 47 5 million tons 33 the use of waste orange peel is thus significant and it is possible due to the abundance of cellulose and lignin in orange peel the pyrolytic reprocessing of waste orange peel to make biochar is also economically feasible as it is important for environmental protection and waste biomass recycling the recycle treatment enhances the surface area and the size of the pore channels significantly 24 to best of our knowledge only few references are existed in the literature pertaining to the use of biochar derived from orange peel to capture u vi ions from aqueous solutions in this work we synthesized economically viable composite using orange waste biochar ob and magnesium silicate ms materials the synthesized materials were employed as an effective adsorbent to remove u vi ions from polluted water the major goals of this research are to i prepare the obms composites ii investigate their unique features by employing various characterization techniques and predict the sorption mechanism iii evaluate their efficacy for u vi ions removal under various experimental conditions such as mass of adsorbent solution ph adsorption time temperature and initial u vi ions concentration

silicate na2sio3 and magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o were supplied by daejung reagents and chemicals south korea the purchased chemicals were used as received 2 2 synthesis of obms composite

then ground into fine powder and allowed to pass through a 100 mesh sieve the powder sample was then pyrolyzed for 2 h at 650 c and the obtained product was grounded using an agate mortar and sieved through a 100 mesh sieve to obtain uniform sized particles finally the biochar was washed with 0 1 mol l hcl solution to remove the ashes before drying it at 80 c then 1 0 g of obtained orange waste biochar ob was mixed with 25 ml of 3 32 g of na2sio3 to this 25 ml solution which contained 3 0 g of mgcl2 6h2o was slowly added to obtain a suspension the obtained suspension was hydrothermally treated at 180 c for 12 h in a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave the resulting material was washed with distilled water and dried at 60 c for overnight the pristine magnesium silicate ms

inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkinelmer usa 2 4 adsorption experiments the u vi concentration was determined using icp oes instrumental analysis the u vi adsorption experiment was carried out in a 50 ml flacon tube in general the 0 2 g l adsorbent was mixed 25 mg l of u vi solution with a speed of 180 rpm the ph and the temperature of the contents were maintained at 4 and 298 k respectively the u vi solution samples are withdrawn periodically from the solution for analysis after being filtered through a 0 45 um membrane filter different u vi solutions with varying initial concentrations 5 200 mg l were used to determine the adsorption isotherms for the adsorption kinetics experiments the u vi concentration was measured at different time intervals the ph effect on u vi sorption was experimentally studied by adjusting the ph in the range of 2 6 by using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hno3 solutions the ion effect on u vi sorption was conducted by adding the ca2 na mg2 and k ions with typical concentrations 1 100 mg l in wastewater to study the regeneration performance of obms composite the material was filtered after the adsorption and washed with a solution containing 0 1 m na2co3 in 2 h2o2 to remove the adsorbed u vi ions then the recovered adsorbents were washed with ethanol and deionized water until the solution ph is neutral the adsorption desorption experiments were repeated for 5 times 2 5 calculations from u vi adsorption experiments results the percentage adsorption removal and adsorption capacity at the equilibrium qe in mg g of obms were

3 1 characterization of obms composite the synthesized obms composite was characterized by using fe sem edx tga xrd ft ir n2 physisorption and xps spectroscopy techniques the surface morphology of the synthetic obms composite is presented in fig 2 a b the sem images of obms composite show presence of stacked and agglomerated magnesium silicate layers covered by biochar the sample is slightly conductive and the surface become rough the existence of agglomerated layers in the obms composite is because of the hydroxylated edge edge interaction of the magnesium silicate layers and the hydroxyl functional groups in biochar the edx analysis was utilized to determine the bulk elemental compositions of obms composite samples the edx images show that c o si and mg elements are presented uniformly on the surface of the obms composite fig 2 c d the tem images of obms composite are shown in fig 2 e f were further confirm the morphology of magnesium silicate nanosheets the tem images clearly showing nanosheets interconnect with each other to assemble a network structure and the lamella of products are growing into lumps weak van der waals forces held the layers of magnesium silicate sheets together between the surface oxygen atoms 40 on the edge face of the layers functional hydroxyl groups such as sioh and mgoh were abundant making them hydrophilic that leads to well dispersion of obms in water 41 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of obms fig s1 exhibit type iv isotherm with narrow hysteresis loop h3 type as per iupac classification indicating the mesoporous structure of obms composite 42 43 the pore size distribution pattern confirms that the sample possess mesopores not shown in the figure with the pore diameter mainly centred at 20 40 nm the presence of large size mesopore structure is due to irregularly stacked magnesium silicate layers sem analysis in addition obms composite have specific surface area of 73 9 m2 g which is much larger than that of the bulk ob 12 1 m2 g and ms 64 5 m2 g these observations suggest that the obms composite possess pore structure and surface area that are beneficial for adsorption process the tga analysis was performed to study the thermal behaviour and stability of the obms composite in the nitrogen atmosphere the fig 3a showed tga pattern for obms sample a weight loss 5 wt occurred less than 200 c which is due to the loss of physically adsorbed h2o in the first stage 44 the second stage weight loss about 6 wt was occurred in between 200 and 550 c which could be associated to decomposition of functional groups presented in ob and ms in the final stage a minor weight loss around 3 wt was occurred in between 550 and 1000 c which indicates that obms composite is stable at high temperatures the xrd patterns for ob and obms samples are shown in fig 3b the results showed that the strong reflection at 2θ 23 corresponded to graphite structure of ob 45 the xrd pattern of obms sample showed additional reflections at 27 36 40 47 and 56 44 corresponding to mgsio3 phase jcpcd 11 273 and this observation indicating that the mgsio3 and ob were composited in obms sample 46 the ft ir spectra for bulk ob fresh and used obms composite are presented in fig 4 a the most intense vibrations are associated with different functional groups presented on the obms composite the obms sample exhibited a broad ir absorption peak centred at 3355 cm 1 which id because of oh stretching of h2o and or surface adsorbed oh groups the other peak observed at 1637 cm 1 is due to hoh bending and rotation of h2o molecules the peaks at 989 cm 1 and 437 cm 1 could be attributed to sio and mgo stretching vibrations 47 after u vi adsorption on obms composite the peak due to oh groups slightly shifted to 3318 cm 1 corresponds to the vibrations of sioh 48 similarly the peaks due to sio and mgo groups also shifted to 985 cm 1 and 433 cm 1 the peak shift could be due to the oh sio and mgo functional groups of obms composite were involved in u vi adsorption process it was caused due to the binding of abundant oxygen containing functional groups with uranyl ions present on the surface of magnesium silicate which facilitates uranyl ion complexation with the adsorbent 49 the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was utilized to obtain the surface chemical composition and electronic state of elements for the bare ob obms composite and used obms u vi samples the full xps survey spectrum show that c o mg and si elements presented on the obms sample surface fig 4b the presence of mg 1s and si 2p peaks in the spectrum indicates that the mg and si elements have been successfully incorporated in the composite sample the presence of a u 4f peak in the spectrum of used obms u vi sample fig 4 b confirms that the u vi ions were adsorbed on the surface of obms sample 24 fig 5 depicts deconvoluted xps spectra of o 1s c 1s mg 1s and si 1s for fresh and used obms composite samples the o 1s peak of the fresh obms composite can be fitted into two peaks at 534 8 ev and 532 9 ev which could be assigned to coh and mgosi species 50 fig 5a however the binding energy of these peaks is slightly shifted to 534 0 ev and 532 8 ev in case of spent obms composite sample the de convoluted c 1s spectra for fresh and spent obms composite are shown in fig 5 b and c 1s can be de convoluted into three peaks with binding energies at 284 7 ev 285 5 ev and 287 3 ev which could be assigned to cc cc coh and co groups respectively the peak areas corresponding to cc cc coh and co functional groups 284 6 ev 285 4 ev and 287 7 ev decreased in case of spent obms catalyst after u vi adsorption similar result was observed in mg 1s spectra of the samples as shown in fig 5 c the contributions of peaks due to mgosi and mg oh 2 groups at 1304 6 ev and 1308 8 ev are decreased after u vi ions adsorption the two de convoluted si 2p peaks fig 5d for the obms composite were appeared at 103 9 ev sioh and 105 0 ev siosi 51 and these two peaks were also shifted to lower binding energies 103 7 ev and 105 0 ev in case of spent obms composite the xps results suggesting that u vi adsorption was chemical adsorption on the surface of obms composite 3 2 u vi adsorption over obms composite the fig 6 a depicts the influence of time on the u vi ions adsorption ability of obms for kinetic studies two different solutions with u vi concentrations of 25 mg l 50 mg l were used a rapid u vi ions adsorption was observed within the 120 min reaching the highest adsorption amount on the surface of obms composite with increase of time the adsorption rate was increased gradually until the adsorption equilibrium was reached after reaching equilibrium 120 min the adsorption capacity remain constant with increasing operation time to evaluate the adsorption kinetics the adsorption data were fitted to pseudo first order pseudo second order and elvoch adsorption kinetic models the nonlinear fitting of the obtained data resulted the pseudo second order kinetic model as it is found to be more suitable than the other models based on the fitted curves and correlation coefficients table 1 the adsorption amount of u vi ions on the surface of obms composite for 25 mg l and 50 mg l solutions was observed as 124 1 mg g and 226 2 mg g respectively the results indicating that the u vi ions were adsorbed on the surface of obms composite by rate limiting kinetics via chemical interactions such as ionic covalent bonds complexation 52 the entire adsorption process could have occurred in three different stages in the beginning of the adsorption process more active sites are available for u vi adsorption on the surface of obms composite which are responsible for rapid u vi adsorption second the limited diffusion rate of u vi ions inside of the pores of composite causes slow adsorption rate and third the u vi ions uptake process reaches to equilibrium and remains constant it is well reported that ph of the solution has a significant influence on the adsorption efficiency of adsorbent 53 as the surface properties of obms composite in solution could vary with change of ph of the solution to study the role of ph on u vi adsorption capacity of obms composite the adsorption measurements were carried out in the ph range of 2 6 and 298 k fig 6 b it is well reported that ph of the solution has a significant influence on the adsorption efficiency of adsorbent 53 as the surface properties of obms composite in solution could vary with ph change to study the role of ph on u vi adsorption capacity of obms composite the adsorption measurements were carried out in the ph range of 2 6 at 298 k fig 2 b at low ph relatively low adsorption rate for obms composite was observed because of the competition between h and u vi ions prevented the u vi ions from occupying the adsorption sites 54 55 the u vi adsorption capacity of obms increased from 70 to 95 in the ph range of 3 0 6 0 which is probably due to decrease of competition from h ions the slight increase of ph around 4 enables the adsorbent to adsorb different uranium species including uo2 2 uo2 oh uo2 2 oh 2 2 uo2 3 oh 5 and uo2 4 oh 7 as predicted by visual minteq 3 0 program 42 however above ph 4 0 there is a clear possibility for hydrolysis of u vi species to form uo2 2 oh 2 2 uo2 3 oh 5 and uo2 4 oh 7 species which could influence the adsorption process for this reason the adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 4 0 where the concentrations of uo2 2 oh 2 2 uo2 3 oh 5 and uo2 4 oh 7 are low compared to the major species u vi uo2 2 uo2 oh to avoid severe hydrolysis above ph 4 0 54 the observed high u vi adsorption in solution with ph less than phpzc of obms phpzc 7 24 measured by acid base titration method suggested that the adsorption process is not influenced by the electrostatic interactions but it is occurring via surface complexation through chemical interactions the adsorption of u vi ions over bare hydrolytic magnesium silicate in aqueous with ph 4 was also investigated for comparison purpose the influence of the mass of the adsorbent on the u vi adsorption ability of obms was studied by changing the mass of the adsorbent from 0 1 g l to 1 0 g l fig 6 c the adsorption removal is increased to 95 99 as the obms amount increased from 0 1 g l to 0 2 g l owing to the increased number of active sites responsible for the removal of u vi from aqueous solution with further increase of obms mass from 0 2 g l to 1 0 g l no considerable change in the u vi adsorption amount was observed this result is due to the decreased number active site per unit area of obms surface by the intra molecular attraction of obms molecules 56 therefore the optimum amount of obms composite for the further studies is 0 2 g l at optimum conditions the adsorption isotherm models were obtained to calculate the distribution of u vi ions in aqueous and solid phases the obtained langmuir freundlich and temkin adsorption isotherms are presented in fig 6 d and the corresponding values are tabulated in table 2 the langmuir model had a higher coefficient of correlation r2 than the other two isotherm models as a result the langmuir model is a suitable one for defining u vi adsorption over obms composite implying that as prepared obms sample had a homogeneous adsorption surface 57 therefore adsorption of u vi ions on the obms composite surface is a monolayer adsorption process the maximum amount of u vi ions adsorbed by the obms composite in this study is 352 6 mg g at 298 k which is greater than amount adsorbed by the bulk ms 144 7 mg g and other reported absorbent materials table 3 existence of more number of functional groups on the surface of hydrothermally synthesized obms composite could be the reason for enhanced u vi ion adsorption capacity the thermodynamic functions such as δg δh and δs are obtained using van t hoff s models fig 7 a table 4 lists the obtained thermodynamic parameters for u vi adsorption process over obms composite the negative δg and positive δh values indicated that u vi adsorption on the obms surface is an endothermic and spontaneous process whereas the positive δs values indicating that the degrees of freedom increased at the solid liquid interface 58 coexisting ions could easily influence the u vi adsorption in the aquatic system therefore it is practical to investigate the interference of coexisting ions on u vi adsorption the influence of coexistence of ca2 na k and mg2 ions on the u vi adsorption ability of obms composite is shown in fig s2 the observed results indicated that there s no significant effect on u vi adsorption removal probably due to inner sphere complexation is mainly accountable for u vi adsorption on obms 59 3 3 obms composite regeneration stability for practical application the adsorbents should have stable regenerability as well as higher adsorption capacity and fast adsorption kinetics thus the regenerability of obms composite was studied the obms adsorbent was collected by centrifugation after adsorption of u vi ions then the composite was washed with 0 1 m na2co3 in 2 h2o2 60 which shows 99 5 desorption u vi solution repeatedly to remove any absorbed u vi on the surface and reused for new cycle of adsorption the regeneration study was performed for four consecutive cycles as shown in fig 7b after two cycles the removal of capacity of the obms composite is around 90 and it was slightly decreased to 80 at fourth cycle however it is higher than the adsorption capacities of bare ob and ms the decrease of adsorption capacity of obms composite with increase of recycle number is mainly due to loss of adsorbent mass in powder form during separation and regeneration steps to avoid the loss of adsorbent mass utilization of obms granules is recommended to keep the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent 3 4 adsorption mechanism to predict the adsorption mechanism over obms composite several reaction parameters such ph ionic strength kinetics isotherm and thermodynamics studies were performed it was clearly observed that the u vi adsorption was not influenced with phpzc of obms adsorbent and also the ionic strength has no significant influence fig s2 which indicates the adsorption process was inner sphere surface complexion through chemical interactions by obms surface functional groups further the chemical surface complexion of adsorption process was confirmed from the kinetics fig 6 a and isotherms fig 6 d studies where the u vi adsorption process was well explained by monolayer rate limiting kinetics on homogeneous surface of obms it was clearly explained from thermodynamic studies where the u vi adsorption on obms was endothermic with spontaneous with δh 16 8 kj mol suggesting the chemisorption fig 7a further the adsorption mechanism was evaluated by using xps fig 4 and ft ir fig 5 results this results suggesting the adsorptive removal of u vi with obms was through the surface complexation via the interaction of u vi with obms surface functional groups such as cc coh co mgosi and mg oh 2 at present experimental conditions 4 conclusions a simple hydrothermal method was used to synthesize the orange biochar magnesium silicate obms composite the specific surface area of the obms was 73 9 m2 g the u vi ions adsorption experiments results revealed that obms composite had a homogeneous surface with saturated adsorption sites and the adsorption was monolayer adsorption the synthesized obms composite have a potential to remove the u vi ions from wastewater with high adsorption capacity 352 6 mg g and fast adsorption rate 99 u vi ions adsorption amount within 120 min the adsorption measurements indicated that the adsorption behaviour of obms composite for u vi is independent of presence of various coexisting cations the calculated thermodynamic functions for the u vi adsorption over obms are endothermic in nature with chemisorption dominating factor the xps studies concluded that the adsorption of u vi ions occurred through the chemical interaction of functional groups cc coh co mgosi and mg oh 2 of obms composite the obms composite could be an efficient adsorbent to remove u vi species from wastewater because of its easy synthesis and promising removal capacity for u vi which was beneficial to environmental protection and public health credit authorship contribution statement investigation data curation validation original draft k n s a t investigation methodology formal analysis g k r a m m a a s formal

chemicals edcs personal care products pharmaceuticals polychlorinated biphenyl pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and dyes are the class of emerging water pollutants and shown global attention in recent time they are widely dispersed in industrial and municipal wastewater effluents and finally to the water bodies 1 these micropollutants in water bodies pose a severe risk to the ecological system thus it must be treated efficiently to prevent aquatic environment contamination 2 3 excessive and uncontrolled release of these micropollutants from municipal waste and industries and improper treatments result in an additional load of these contaminants to the water bodies 4 among micropollutants the pharmaceuticals are extensively used for humans and livestock in curing various diseases moreover antibiotics are the most common micropollutants since they are widely used in modern medication these are employed for therapeutic development and inhibit microbes while leaving intact cells 5 these compounds are extensively used to prevent many common diseases and to control parasites 6 global antibiotic consumption exceeds billions of tablets annually 7 and around 70 billion were produced in 2010 8 a significant amount of antibiotics is excreted through urine and feces and they are thus finally entered into the aquatic environment the animals or humans readily consume the

sewage or municipal wastewater 13 14 these compounds are stable and persistent for more prolonged periods 15 on the other hand pesticides and herbicides are seemingly hazardous to humans and the environment 16 the regular intake of herbicides like atrazine causes cancer muscle degeneration retinal degeneration and cardiovascular issues in humans some herbicides like oxyfluorfen inhibit the protoporphyrinogen oxidase causing irreversible cell membrane damage pesticide exposure also causes an imbalance in blood counts and liver abnormalities 17 similarly industrial effluents mainly from the textile industries carry a high load of dyes contaminating the aquatic environment 18 various dyes and several dye precursors appear carcinogenic or mutagenic 19 synthetic dyes are not readily biodegradable and are stable toward the oxidizing chemicals 20 as a result these compounds often escape from modern wastewater treatment plants and end up in water bodies causing considerable harmful effects on the aquatic ecosystem 21 23 compounds of azo dyes are exceedingly hazardous causing allergies skin illnesses defects in embryo development and cancer 24 26 according to lee et al 2006 and riera torres et al 2010 27 28 annual dye production exceeds 7 105 tons with ca 10 15 of total dyes enter the waterbodies through industrial effluents 29 31 other reports indicated that annually ca 2 8 105 tons of textile dyes are discharged into aquatic bodies via industrial effluents 32 33 therefore efficient and effective removal of dyes including other harmful contaminants from polluted water is a demand of the hour 34 physical chemical and biological methods are often applied to treat wastewater contaminated with various micropollutants physical methods like filtration sedimentation and adsorption are widely used especially in textile industries 35 nevertheless these methods are not efficient in eliminating these micropollutants at low levels moreover synthesizing suitable and efficient adsorbents is sometimes expensive or challenging 35 36 chemical methods involved flocculation or coagulation with alum and ferrous these are widely used to eliminate micropollutants from wastewater however a large amount of the by products are generated in the form of sludge which poses additional challenges for its possible disposal 37 38 chlorine ozone and hypochlorite are widely used for wastewater treatment because of their cost effectiveness easy availability and relatively high efficiency however the by products formed are highly toxic and pose several health issues 39 several by products is carcinogenic that are even more toxic than the intended micropollutant additionally the process produces extra sludge containing a variety of decomposed by products 40 among these treatment methods biological treatment is widely employed and greener treatment however the recalcitrant pollutants azo containing molecules and micropollutants are only partially degraded and escaped through treated water 41 42 the researchers have given greater heed to developing easy efficient and cost effective methods for the efficient degradation or removal of micropollutants in the aquatic environment in a line the advanced oxidation process aop involving heterogeneous photocatalysis has drawn much attention in effectively eliminating of micropollutants such as pesticides edcs pharmaceuticals pcbs and dyes the principle of aops is based on the in situ formation of highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals that readily oxidize many recalcitrant pollutants including the micropollutants non selectively 43 44 heterogeneous photocatalysis is a photochemical process in which light activates heterogeneous photocatalysts semiconductors and forms charge carriers by the excitation of the electron the charge carriers can potentially speed up chemical reactions or modify selectivity 45 the photon energy having adequate energy frequency enables to excite of the electrons from the ground state to the excited state i e from the valence band to the conduction band thus photonic excitation creates an electron hole pair by leaving behind empty unfilled holes in the valence band titanium dioxide is a widely explored semiconductor heterogeneous photocatalyst however the material has its advantages and limitations in practical implications 1 1 tio2 and its limitation since the discovery of photoelectrocatalytic water splitting using titanium dioxide tio2 electrodes under uv light 45 considerable progress has been achieved in environmental catalysis and solar to fuel conversion titanium dioxide is biocompatible has chemical and thermal stability low cost low toxicity and accessible synthesis enabled for widespread applications in diverse areas moreover tio2 is widely used in cosmetics building materials electric devices semiconductors and pigment titanium dioxide is introduced as a prototype photocatalyst because of its high photooxidation potential it has been extensively studied as a photocatalyst during the last couple of decades for initiating a sequence of reductive and oxidative processes in a different chemical reaction 46 49 the use of titanium dioxide in the photocatalytic processes is environmentally benign with zero waste compliance titanium dioxide usually has three crystalline phases brookite anatase and rutile anatase and rutile phases are the most common mineral phases 50 under extreme pressures and temperatures rutile is known to have high stability nevertheless under ambient conditions anatase is found to have high stability this is because the phase conversion into the rutile phase at ambient temperature is too slow 51 furthermore the anatase phase of tio2 showed greater applicability over the other phases because of its high stability under light radiation cost effectiveness efficient photoactivity activity chemical and biological inertness and non toxicity 51 the lone pair electron in its outer orbital is greatly responsible for the photocatalytic processes the interplay of parameters such as adsorption desorption properties defects number phpzc point of zero charges of the surface catalyst surface area and crystalline structure determines the overall activity of tio2 in photocatalysis furthermore the efficiency of the photocatalyst is affected by the method in which the catalyst is used whether in a slurry or placed on a supporting medium the way light is harvested and the geometrical arrangement of the reactor the optimum photocatalyst for use in an aqueous solution has always been determined to be anatase in specific applications however the rutile phase is useful in oxidative and reductive reactions in general two methods of using tio2 in photocatalysis have emerged one as finely distributed particles supported on porous substances and fluids suspended in a liquid medium and the other as supported thin films 52 53 the tio2 in a suspended form always has to be separated after each photo degradation reaction by using tio2 films on various substrates such difficulties could be avoided according to structural dimensionality various tio2 nanostructures such as nanorod nanowire nanofiber nanoplates and nanosheets are summarised in fig 1 54 tio2 possesses a wide band gap of 3 2 ev and 3 0 ev respectively for anatase and rutile and has been extensively studied for several applications 51 as a result of the wide band gap it absorbs the electromagnetic spectrum exclusively in the uv region fig s1 55 thus the photocatalytic technology using the tio2 catalyst has two key limitations rapid electron hole recombination and absorption of light limited to the uv region further uv radiation contributes only 4 5 of the total solar energy spectrum in contrast visible light accounts for about half 45 56 the rapid electron hole recombination is due to the inhibition of the transfer of electron and hole pairs on the tio2 surface which result in less availability of the electrons and holes for further reactions 57 moreover some micropollutants have less affinity toward the tio2 photocatalyst and thus results in less adsorption of micropollutants in the vicinity of the tio2 photocatalyst this leads to a reduction in photocatalytic efficiency immobilization of photocatalysts on suitable substrate surfaces enhances the selective affinity of catalysts for micropollutant molecules 58 apart from this during the photocatalytic treatment the tio2 undergoes accumulation due to the low stability of the catalyst this hinders the active centres from receiving the radiant light from the light source which reduces the photocatalyst s performance 59 60 tio2 photocatalysts in their fine powder form are dispersed well in the wastewater thus possessing high photocatalytic activity however recovering the powder tio2 from the treated wastewater after the treatment process is a daunting task which limits the photocatalyst for wider practical applications 61 1 2 plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 doping of tio2 with plasmonic noble metals overcomes various limitations confronting the use of bare tio2 it lowers of band gap energy and allows absorption of photons at lower energy i e toward the visible region in the electromagnetic spectrum primarily due to the localized surface plasmon effect lspr 62 it involves the attachment of the dopant atoms within the tio2 structure among all the dopant metals noble metals au ag pd and pt have unusually high schottky barriers which help noble metals to trap electrons and facilitate the separation of electron hole pairs the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect of noble metals facilitates tio2 photocatalysts to enhance the excitation of electrons at the catalyst surface 63 64 it also increases the lifetime of electron and hole pairs which increases the photocatalytic efficiency of noble metal doped tio2 65 among all the noble metals silver ag nanoparticles show extremely intense surface plasmon resonance spr within the wavelength region of 320 450 nm which is close to the corresponding tio2 band gap absorption energy 3 2 ev 388 nm in ag tio2 photocatalyst the excitation of electrons from the conduction band of tio2 to ag nanoparticles is thermodynamically favored this is due to the reason that the fermi level of ag metal is lower as compared to the tio2 64 as a result the schottky barrier is formed easily in metal semiconductor 66 67 thus ag tio2 is a promising photocatalyst for photocatalytic reactions and is shown to have high efficiency in the photocatalytic removal of different micropollutants compared to the bare tio2 nanomaterial 68 69 these materials showed absorption wavelength in the visible region 70 on the other hand the spr band of metallic au is relatively less intense than metallic ag s however au nanoparticles showed relatively higher stability and intense broad visible light absorption band which makes it more promising for industrial applications 71 72 moreover some studies also suggest that the combination of au and tio2 results in dual perimeter sites where molecular oxygen activation occurs 73 as a result au doped tio2 is a promising photocatalyst for photocatalytic reactions heterogeneous photocatalysis using solar radiations has received greater interest because the process is environment and energy efficient 74 75 the literature reveals that significant development has occurred in the areas such as materials synthesis physico chemical properties of materials and applications of these materials in molecular transformations artificial photosynthesis environmental waste management energy generation etc 76 77 the potent combination of heterogeneous photocatalysis and solar energy helped achieve sustainable global developments ultimate objectives such as efficient photocatalytic degradation of micropollutants and hydrogen production through the splitting of water molecules 47 48 this review focuses primarily on the recent developments in the plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles with tio2 and its efficient applications in the photocatalytic degradation of micropollutants as well as an in depth study of the mechanism involved during the photocatalytic processes moreover the practical aspects of these materials are extensively studied for their stability reusability in prolonged operations selectivity for real implications and large scale or pilot scale implications insights into the catalytic processes particularly the radical identification by products formed and reaction pathways provide a more profound and molecular level understanding of the processes these input results pave the way for implementing the laboratory trials toward possible technology developments an important guideline for future development is provided by this review which exhaustively analyses the significant accomplishments and crucial features 2 principle of plasmonic photocatalysis plasmonic and conventional photocatalysis are almost similar especially regarding the mechanism involved during the reaction 78 79 nevertheless the presence of noble metals shows a plasmonic effect enhancing the photocatalysts overall performance it creates a schottky junction between the semiconductor and the metals 80 it is a space charge layer through which the excited electrons are excited from the conduction band of tio2 to metal nanoparticles it occurs from the variance in energy level between the fermi level of the metal and the valence or conduction band edge of the semiconductor cb commonly named the schottky barrier energy 81 noble metal nanoparticles store and shuttle photo generated electrons from the vicinity of the tio2 surface to the acceptor 82 decorating noble metals on tio2 photocatalyst modifies the surface properties of the photocatalyst which further facilitates generating hydroxyl radicals by the interaction of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen 83 plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance lspr due to their interaction with electromagnetic light radiation it is an effect that developed due to electron oscillating in the conduction band at the interface of plasmonic metal dielectric 84 when light radiation falls on the plasmonic metals electrons get excited from their ground state to the possible excited states rapid collective oscillations of electron density occur on the noble metals resulting in localized surface plasmon resonance 85 this generates an electromagnetic field near the metal nanoparticles 86 thus absorption and scattering of the incoming electromagnetic wave at frequencies close to the lspr cause the generation of strong electric fields near the surface of the nanoparticles 87 due to the excitation of lspr metal nanoparticles behave as nano antennas gathering energy from light and converting it into an intense localized electric field fig 2 88 metal nanoparticles that induce lspr excitation in the visible or near ir regions are usually termed plasmonic nanoparticles the excitation of lspr takes place at a specific frequency that is affected by the environment s dielectric constant structure shape composition ensemble geometry and distance between nearby nanoparticles 74 89 as a result the optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles are modified by carefully tuning the parameters allowing the production of plasmonic nanoparticles with better optical properties for improved photocatalytic performance the broadening of the lspr bands lspr positions the number of lspr modes and the relative ratio between scattering and absorption radiations are all influenced by the size of the plasmonic nanoparticles 90 with increasing size lspr tends to move toward longer wavelengths as metal nanoparticles of larger size necessitate a low frequency for electromagnetic retardation furthermore as the size of nanoparticles grows the relative ratios of scattering to absorption increase contributing to the lspr band broadening 87 91 another crucial feature that significantly impacts the lspr is the shape the shape of nanoparticles affects the plasmon mode and frequency resulting in the change in the absorption to scattering ratios of radiations hence the change in the frequency of lspr and the magnitude of the electric field generated near the surface is altered this is because charges incline to cluster at the corners and points of anisotropic nanoparticles which are similar to prisms and cubes 87 the size significantly impacts the lspr effect of metal nanoparticles hence it must be considered before the lspr effect is applied to a chemical reaction finally because these parameters depend on the metal s dielectric constant the composition impacts absorption scattering intensities and lspr location furthermore utilizing compositions lspr is fine tuned in bimetallic nanoparticles such as core shell systems and alloys resulting in variations in the plasmonic component s shape and alteration in the dielectric constant 91 3 synthesis of plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts the plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts are synthesized using sol gel reduction hydrothermal solvothermal deposition precipitation photoreduction impregnation ion exchange physical vapor deposition chemical reduction encapsulation sputtering and photo deposition methods however the most often utilized methods are sol gel hydrothermal solvothermal deposition precipitation photoreduction and ion exchange further the advantages and disadvantages of different synthetic methods are summarised in table 1 3 1 sol gel reduction process the sol gel process generally entails converting a system from a liquid sol phase largely colloidal to a solid gel phase this method enables fabricating ultra fine powders or thin film coatings 92 sol gel synthesis of tio2 based plasmonic material is divided into two types based on the titania metal precursor i an alcohol based method with metal alkoxide as the starting precursor and ii an aqueous based approach with an inorganic metal salt as the starting precursor in the alcohol based process ti oc4h9 4 ti oc3h7 4 and ti oc2h5 are the most often used metal alkoxides precursors of tio2 there is a metal oxygen bonding in these alkoxides the bond develops high polarity and is exceedingly reactive due to the significant variance in electro negativity between o and ti as a result adding water causes simultaneous hydrolysis and condensation reactions to occur simultaneously eventually the formation of gel 93 in the aqueous based process tioso4 94 and ticl4 95 are essential precursors for the aqueous based method hydrolysis and condensation reactions occurred for aqueous based sol gels preparations gaining crystals at optimum temperature and slow controlled nucleation is proceeded in the process 96 precipitation and peptization are two steps that occur in the aqueous based sol gel processes in precipitation inorganic metal salts are hydrolyzed and form a gel precipitate after adding the base and repeated washings then remove the excess electrolytes the peptization process is known as the method of re dispersing the colloid particles to prevent coagulation 93 peptization disintegrates a substance into colloid sized particles by adding a suitable peptizing agent 97 sol gel reduction process has various advantages such as i chemical homogeneity is increased in doped and multi component systems ii generation of high surface area powder materials iii due to the lack of grinding and pressing stages the purity of the chemicals is not lost iv requires only essential apparatus and a low preparation temperature v various products such as powders fibers and coatings are obtained in relatively less time and vi controlling the features which allows the creation of custom made products however the sol gel approach has some drawbacks including a comparatively high precursor cost a time consuming process significant shrinkage during the process and the potential for complex agglomeration 96 the alkoxide and non alkoxide precursors enable the tio2 in its membrane thin film and powdery forms 98 99 this approach offers several advantages including purity ease in synthesis stoichiometry composition control and the ability to introduce dopants in high quantities 100 for the mesoporous tio2 liu et al used a sol gel method in which the solution was made by dissolving ti obu 4 in ethanol 98 the gel was then left for 24 h for aging before being calcined for 4 h at 350 c utilizing a sol gel technique at ambient temperature a simple and environment friendly production of amorphous nanosheets tio2 is obtained 101 102 here the precursor of tio2 ammonia and bis acetylacetonate titanium di isopropoxide are added to alcohol and shaked for 20 h at room temperature and pressure the formation of turbid solution implies that tio2 nanosheets are formed furthermore a modified sol gel method was used to synthesize the tio2 nanocomposite using titanium isopropoxide hydrolysis in the occurrence of polyethylene glycol peg 103 the approach applies the generation of glycolates or mixed glycolate alkoxide allows for a slower rate of hydrolysis and hence better separation control of nucleation of titania particles as a result monodispersity and sizes are better controlled 104 fodor et al reported the fabrication of temperature dependent shape tailored controlled pd nanoparticles deposited onto the tio2 utilizing the sol gel reduction process tem images inferred that the pd nanocubes are formed at various temperatures cf fig 3 105 the chemical process is the most popular strategy for obtaining the plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles doped tio2 the approach entails adsorption and reduction of a precursor of metal on the tio2 surface sodium borohydride and citrate reduction methods turkevich method 106 brust method 107 are often used to obtain the reduced nanoparticles 108 for instance a simple method for depositing au nanoparticles with controlled and monodisperse diameters along with even dispersion over the tio2 surface was reported elsewhere fig 4 104 this method relied on tio2 as a template for depositing au and did not require surface functionalization or pre treatments in this approach water serves as the solvent polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp as the stabilizer ascorbic acid as the reducing agent and aucl4 aq as the au precursor by completing sequential reduction steps with aucl4 aq the au nanoparticles size was optimally regulated decorating pre synthesized metal nanoparticles on the surface of tio2 is another method of producing plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles doped tio2 based photocatalysts 49 in this approach a colloidal solution containing metal nanoparticles is mixed with the tio2 dispersion however aggregation of metal nanoparticles onto the surface of tio2 is the disadvantage of this method causing a decreased efficacy of the photocatalyst for the targeted application linker molecules are employed to alter the surface of metal nanoparticles to prevent aggregation 109 applying the reduction process various au nanostructures nanostars nanohexagons nanorods and nanospheres are synthesized then coated with hydroxypropyl cellulose to bind them uniformly across the surface of tio2 without accumulation 90 the coated au nanoparticles are then combined with tio2 precursor in an isopropyl alcohol medium and the au tio2 nanocomposite is formed after 20 h of shaking at room temperature tio2 nanoparticles deposited onto the au sio2 nanorods au sio2 nanostars and au sio2 nanospheres were synthesized using thermodynamic and kinetic controlled reduction methods 110 heterogeneous ag or au nanoparticles doped tio2 thin films were successfully synthesized using the sol gel template synthesis method here fine grains of tio2 were dispersed over the borosilicate glass surface forming a uniform ag0 np or au0 np tio2 thin film and the size of the nanoparticles was from 5 to 15 nm further polyethylene glycol peg was used as a template in photocatalyst synthesis 111 113 3 2 hydrothermal solvothermal synthesis the chemical processes that take place in an organic and aqueous medium respectively are referred to as solvothermal and hydrothermal techniques the treated precursor of titania solution in an aqueous solution is transported to an autoclave teflon lined during the hydrothermal process furthermore precipitation of tio2 occurs when the hydrothermal system is heated to a high temperature for a specific reaction time finally the samples are washed and dried resulting in the generation of tio2 114 115 organic solvents like toluene ethanol and methanol are utilized in the solvothermal approach since they do not need high pressure or temperatures thermal treatment on the other hand is essential for crystallizing the final product the thermal process is generally used to generate tio2 in crystalline form although these approaches are convenient and simple in the case of plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles doped tio2 photocatalysts however the method has the disadvantage of metal np aggregation 116 core yolk and core shell morphologies are the simplest way to avoid agglomeration of nanoparticles and enhance the encapsulation stability inside the tio2 another benefit of this approach is that it produces a uniform distribution of metal nanoparticles within the titania network it is worth noting that various studies have indicated that metal oxide shells or layers do not affect the properties of plasmonic characteristics he et al used a one pot hydrothermal process to synthesize a yolk shell au tio2 structure 117 similarly a hydrothermal method was used to synthesize the nanocomposite ag tio2 core shell which enhanced photocatalytic activity and separation of charge carriers for non enzymatic glucose sensors cf fig 5 118 ye et al synthesized the au tio2 composite material with prominent 101 and 100 facets designated as au t101 and au t100 respectively using a straightforward hydrothermal synthetic route 118 they are changing the reaction time solvents additives pressure and temperature control in synthesizing the tio2 particles with ideal phases morphology and regulated grain sizes thermal evaporation is the other way to prepare plasmonic photocatalysts based on tio2 this method evaporates the pure metal at high temperatures which is then deposited on the surface of a semiconductor 119 the in situ immobilization of metal nanoparticles on tio2 nanosheets surfaces prevents the aggregation of nanoparticles 120 further the compactness and thickness of the nanosheets of tio2 were adjusted to produce au nanoparticles of various densities and sizes after calcination the fine tuned structure possesses interfacial contact resulting in minimal charge recombination and better solar energy consumption 3 3 deposition precipitation deposition precipitation accompanied by washing and subsequent reduction is the widely used synthetic process for synthesizing plasmonic ag au pd pt and ag agx x i br cl doped tio2 materials 121 122 deposition precipitation deposits the noble metal nanoparticles of small size and a narrow size array onto supporting materials an aqueous solution containing au3 is the au precursor variations in calcination temperature and solution ph alter the particle size and corresponding amount of loading of noble metals 123 furthermore the speciation of au3 is determined by temperature the concentration of haucl4 and ph 124 when the ph is 4 hydrolysis of aucl4 occurs resulting in the formation of gold complex au oh xcl4 x the hydrolysis of the au complex is enhanced at increased solution ph the change in ph attains the isoelectric point of the supporting materials the ph alteration is usually carried out by adding urea na2co3 nh3 h2o and naoh solutions almost all the hydroxyl groups and noble nanoparticles are deposited on the supporting material surface once the ph of the solution reaches the isoelectric point of the support material the gold species deposited on diverse supporting material varies and ph plays a crucial role in the process 87 however supporting materials at the low isoelectric point such as activated carbon tungstate and sio2 are not optimal for the deposition precipitation loading of noble metal nanoparticles usually in supporting materials with a high specific surface area the precipitants are submerged in aqueous solutions e g hydrogen tetrachloroaurate iii trihydrate haucl4 3h2o the product was carefully cleaned with hot deionized water to remove cl ions these compounds are then finally treated under high temperature between 200 and 400 c in a hydrogen environment or air to convert au3 to metallic au0 87 the hybrid materials such as ag agbr al2o3 125 ag agi al2o3 126 and ag agbr tio2 127 are obtained using the silver halides as the precursor and the deposition precipitation method was employed the agbr is produced on the surface of tio2 with the interaction of anionic br and cationic ag using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and silver nitrate agno3 respectively fig s2 uv irradiation of agbr converted the ag to metallic ag hence the formation of ag agbr tio2 127 3 4 photoreduction semiconductors bi2wo4 cds wo3 α fe2o3 zno and tio2 possess a unique electronic structure consisting of fully occupied vb and unoccupied cb when a photon of light having energy more than the band gap energy of the semiconductor is irradiated to the semiconductor the electrons from vb jump to the cb hence the holes are produced in the vb the excited electrons are then reacted with particular precursors having ionic noble metal species to form noble metal nanoparticles onto the support materials on the other hand the holes interact with the sacrificial scavengers 87 photoreduction also known as photo deposition is frequently used with other synthesis techniques such as ion exchange 128 impregnation 129 and deposition precipitation 126 photoreduction is commonly used to prepare noble metal nanoparticles such as au and ag that are supported on different substrates a comparatively high deposition ratio of noble metals is one of the main benefits of photoreduction for example kominami et al synthesized au ceo2 under light l 300 nm with a deposition ratio of 99 9 130 furthermore no further calcination is required to prevent particle aggregation and various metals are deposited onto the support media by successive or simultaneous reduction reactions the reproducibility of the photoreduction approach is a significant drawback pipelzadeh et al reported photoreduction of ag onto tio2 and the detailed mechanism is shown in fig 6 131 3 5 ion exchange ion exchange is frequently used to produce photocatalysts provided the product solubility is lower than the reactant 132 in order to generate metallic species this method is usually combined with a reduction method that includes in situ photoreductions followed by calcination the ag agcl tio2 nanocomposite was synthesized using the ion exchange method combing the sol gel and hydrothermal methods 133 the morphological studies of ag agcl tio2 showed a fine interconnected mixed phase heterojunction further the sem micrographs and edx analyses of ag agcl tio2 are shown in fig 7 the photocatalytic activity of ag agcl tio2 was utilized in degrading rhodamine b under a xenon lamp the significant photocatalytic activity was obtained compared to the tio2 and ag tio2 further the band gap of ag agcl tio2 was found at 2 53 ev compared to the 3 22 ev of the tio2 other methods include impregnation through the vapor deposition method the impregnation method is facile and commonly synthesizes the supported catalysts there are three fundamental steps involved in the impregnation methods a high surface area of support material is first impregnated with a metal precursor solution which is then evaporated at a high temperature and finally the metal precursor is reduced in a suitable environment and to obtain the impregnated catalysts 134 the impregnation approach is carried out in dry 135 and wet conditions 136 the process is facile affordable and straightforward 137 impregnation primarily occurs when a liquid containing dissolved metal species moves inside the substrate s pores the diffused metal ions are adsorbed within the pores the drying process involves evaporation of the liquid from the pores the ph of the solution and metal particle size during preparation are investigated in the impregnation process 138 the synthesis of supported pt and pd based metal oxides are obtained using the wet impregnation method 139 140 the impregnation reduction process is used to create binary and ternary pt based catalysts 141 142 ag doped tio2 powder coated surface was successfully synthesized using impregnation method and the catalyst showed high photocatalytic activity to inactivate the pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus subtilis 143 chemical vapor deposition cvd synthesizes relatively pure long lasting and uniform nanoparticles 144 tio2 thin films are commonly prepared using the cvd technique 145 the cvd method allows the fabrication of coated catalyst beads which showed higher catalytic activity than the bare catalyst this approach combines the synthesis of the catalyst and coating of the catalyst with suitable nanoparticles in a facile and one pot synthetic process 146 the cvd method successfully utilizes titanium isopropoxide to obtain the tio2 thin films the influence of the substrate temperatures and resulting film properties are extensively studied 147 recently plasma assisted cvd processes using metal organic precursors have gained attention due to their potential to decrease deposition temperatures thus offering the possibilities to coat temperature sensitive substrates 148 ag tio2 and pt tio2 photocatalysts were synthesized using the cvd method the catalyst was then successfully utilized in the photocatalytic degradation of salicylic acid 149 the ag and pt were successfully deposited on the surface of anatase tio2 physical vapor deposition describes a variety of vacuum deposition methods that are utilized to synthesize thin film coatings the physical vapor deposition method involves transitions from a condensed phase to a vapor phase and back to a thin film condensed phase sputtering and evaporation are the two most common physical vapor deposition methods 150 physical vapor deposition involves the following steps i sputtering evaporation of various components to create a vapor phase ii supersaturation of the vapor phase in an inert atmosphere to increase the condensation of metal nanoparticles and iii thermal treatment in an inert atmosphere to consolidate the nanocomposite 151 ag tio2 heterojunction was obtained by combining physical vapor deposition and bifunctional surface modifiers the photocatalytic activity of tio2 combined with the spherical ag nanoparticles showed excellent electron acceptor abilities the material is efficient in the photoinduced degradation of a cationic organic micropollutant methylene blue under uv vis light 152 table 1 summarises the advantages and disadvantages of various synthetic methods of the materials 4 plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts for efficient degradation of micropollutants when a photon having energy hυ greater than or equal to the tio2 band gap energy is illuminated onto the photocatalyst s surface an electron jumps from the ground state to the excited state i e from vb to the cb thus photonic excitation generates an electron hole pair by leaving empty unfilled holes in the vb the noble metal nanoparticles generate the said spr effect on the absorption of light radiation the nanoparticles then stimulate the localization of the electric field nearby tio2 which facilitates the generation of electron hole pairs in the vicinity of the tio2 surface 179 noble metals trap the newly generated electrons and allow them for further reactions to generate peroxide radical followed by hydroxyl radical peroxide radicals are formed at the cb through the reaction of free electrons and oxygen in the presence of water in contrast oh radicals are formed at the vb through the reaction of the h2o and oxygen both the radicals then interact with the micropollutant molecules which results in the degradation of the micropollutant molecules 113 180 181 fig 8 depicts the photocatalytic removal of micropollutants utilizing a plasmonic assisted tio2 photocatalyst photocatalytic degradation of micropollutant molecules is a highly efficient advanced oxidation process which enables perhaps complete mineralization of micropollutant molecules to its end products i e co2 and h2o further the presence of water produces active species in response to light illumination and electron hole pair recombination hinders attaining high photocatalytic efficiency the attack of the produced active species on the micropollutant molecules breaks down the pollutant molecules into smaller fragments eventually leading to total mineralization one of the important characteristics of heterogeneous photocatalysts is their photon energy adsorbing nature which increases the degradation efficiency the adsorbed micropollutant molecules at the photocatalyst s surface are readily attacked by the active radical species and cause for mineralization of micropollutants the repeated cycles of operations provide enhanced efficiency of the catalyst several techniques enable the identification of the by products and reaction pathways to understand the photocatalytic process at molecular levels the absorption spectra are commonly employed to monitor the degradation process the complete mineralization of the contaminants is assessed using the total organic carbon toc data or partly with the total chemical oxygen demand cod 182 several micropollutants such as phenol polychlorinated bisphenols organophosphorus and organochlorine compounds are efficiently degraded using the plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts in the photocatalytic processes 183 184 the dyes are widely used in pharmaceutical and industrial enterprises and effluent of these industries contains high concentrations of dyes which ultimately reach the water bodies 46 185 numerous approaches are demonstrated to improve light absorption capabilities in tio2 in both the uv and visible regions 101 186 plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts permit a more efficient harnessing of visible light reducing electron hole pair recombination in the semiconductor ag and au nanoparticles exhibit excellent light absorption capacity and produce a strong electromagnetic field due to the lspr effect hot electrons are highly energetic and not in thermal equilibrium 187 as illustrated in fig 9 a and b the schottky junction is formed by the close contact between plasmonic nanoparticles and tio2 from which hot electrons are transferred once after crossing the energy barrier 188 4 1 use of au doped tio2 in the photocatalytic elimination of various micropollutants the photocatalytic performance of tio2 with au sio2 nanorods au sio2 nanostars and au sio2 nanospheres was compared in the breakdown of rhodamine b the composite materials showed substantial improvement in the photocatalytic performance in removing rhodamine b the electromagnetic field was created near the au nanostars spikes which led to a high density of hot electrons near the metal semiconductor interface and synergized the photocatalytic activity in addition theoretical studies revealed that the au nanostars possess enhanced photochemical response primarily due to additional hot spots as a result the anisotropic au nanostars produce chemical energy from the solar light source more efficiently 110 the semiconductor superstructures facilitating the electron migration injected from noble metal nanoparticles for improved photocatalytic efficiency were long debated bian et al synthesized a plasmonic au mesoporous tio2 photocatalyst with au nanoparticles on the mesoporous tio2 base plane and assessed the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue using the photocatalyst 189 the photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalyst was compared with that of typical photocatalyst au mesotio2 pd au p25 and au nanotio2 the reaction kinetics of electrons transported from au nanoparticles to mesoporous tio2 were examined using time resolved drs diffuse reflectance spectroscopy the electrons moved to active sites from the base surface lying at the margins of plate like tio2 mesocrystals a large number of electrons are transported from au nanoparticles to mesoporous tio2 due to the lspr excitations and their life was extended due to the anisotropic electron flow from the centre to the edge which improves the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst the degradation reaction was carried out using monochromatic visible light irradiation 9 6 mw cm2 intensity it was determined that the lspr effect due to the presence of au np synergizes the micropollutant degradation the photocatalytic efficiency of au meso tio2 in visible light was obtained to be 10 times higher than that of au mesotio2 pd au p25 and au nanotio2 photocatalysts in addition the au meso tio2 system had a much shorter duration of electron accumulation 5 6 min than the au meso tio2 pd system separated electrons showed a longer lifetime i e 10 ns which is much longer compared to other photocatalytic processes this research showed that semiconductor superstructures greatly aid plasmonic electron migration 189 rgo au nps m tio2 hybrid shell nanocomposite was prepared using the sol gel method utilizing silica as a template 190 rhodamine b rhb degraded in the photocatalytic process under visible light and uv light irradiations the higher photocatalytic efficacy of the photocatalyst is responsible for the hybrid shells synergistic effects of adsorptive catalytic plasmonic and porous nature the electron hole pairs in m tio2 are separated by uv light irradiation the photoexcited charge carriers oxidize the dye molecules by highly reducing and oxidizing species graphene captures and transports electrons allowing the charge carriers to separate graphene also improves the dye molecules adsorption capability on the photocatalyst s surface under uv light irradiation au nanoparticles operate as co catalysts separating the charge carriers and enhancing photocatalytic efficiency the visible light irradiation causes the lspr effect with the au nanoparticles and excites the hot electrons to be injected into the tio2 conduction band due to their inherent electrical properties these electrons are transported to rgo simultaneously fig s3 depicts the apparent reaction rate constant under simulated daylight irradiation and visible light during the photocatalytic operations the au tio2 is prepared by the sol gel method and the catalyst is active under visible light irradiations the optical absorption and uv visible diffuse reflection spectra drs revealed that a new energy level lower than 3 2 ev was obtained in the au au3 tio2 nanostructure which promotes light absorption toward the lower energy region of the electromagnetic radiation thus energy corresponding to visible light is adequate to excite the photocatalyst as the band gap energy was reduced e 3 2 ev further methylene blue was taken as a model micropollutant and was treated under 110 w visible light the photocatalytic degradation allowed the removal of toc to 73 6 using 0 5 au3 tio2 78 the reactivity of the plasmonic au tio2 photocatalyst was tailored using bio based chitosan fibre fabricated by adopting an ionic gelation process 191 the au tio2 fibre is highly efficient for removing methylene blue metronidazole and carbofuran within 250 min of operation under 25 w visible light the xps analysis illustrates the concurrent occurrence of two valences ti4 and ti3 on the tio2 surface some ti4 exists on the surface of chitosan fibre after photocatalysis the remaining ti4 activates the h2o2 under light irradiation which leads to the formation of oh radical and is again reduced to ti3 thus the interconversion of ti4 and ti3 through the h2o2 or au nps enhances the surface charge immobilization the degradation curve and breakdown rate in the degradation of metronidazole and carbofuran are depicted in fig s4 the catalytic activity of plasmonic materials depends partly on the size and shape of noble metal particles in the bulk substrate fabricating of au nanoparticles tio2 hybrid films on ti wires using the electrochemical method was demonstrated the efficiency of the fabricated material was studied by treating methyl orange dye the percent degradation with tio2 nanotubes au tio2 au tio2 tio2 au tio2 and au tio2 were reported to be 39 2 68 1 39 2 and 17 0 respectively after 30 min of irradiation the increased catalytic activity of the hybrid material was due to the reduced size of the au particles as a result the surface area to volume ratio was increased enhancing the separation of electron and hole additionally the au nanoparticles exhibit electro catalysis oxidation properties for biological and organic species 192 sol gel dip coating method was adopted to fabricate the au tio2 thin films and the thin film was utilized under sunlight for photocatalytic phenol degradation 193 the au 1 2 doped with tio2 caused significantly increased the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst by 2 2 3 times greater than that of the bare tio2 under sunlight irradiation further adding 1 2 au with tio2 results in a shifting of absorption wavelength from 340 nm to 450 nm from uv to visible region moreover concerning the electron transfer process at the surface of tio2 and the interfacial contact between gold nanoparticles on tio2 the interaction is not an ohmic type but a schottky barrier type as a result the excited electron moves to the noble metal through the conduction band of tio2 induced by an electric field facilitating the surface charge separation this reduces the rate of electron hole recombination and further increases the photocatalytic efficacy of the nanocomposite catalyst the au nanopillars tio2 thin film was fabricated by the facile sol gel template synthetic method 181 the fine grains of tio2 were distributed smoothly over the borosilicate glass substrate forming uniform nanopillars of tio2 the doped au nanoparticles size ranged from 5 to 10 nm the nanocomposite material was highly efficient in the photocatalytic elimination of tetracycline 113 and alizarin yellow gg 181 further the study s insights showed that the oh singlet oxygen and photogenerated holes are mainly involved in the photocatalytic breakdown of these micropollutants mono cu ag and au and bi metallic aucu and auag doped tio2 nanocomposite showed an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency toward sulfamethoxazole degradation the optimum loading of metal nanoparticles was 1 0 wt for cu and 1 5 wt for ag and au under irradiation using simulated sunlight ag and au doped tio2 exhibited greater photocatalytic efficiency than cu doped tio2 the bi metallic nanocomposite synergizes the process as a co catalyst under uv light irradiations however the photocatalytic efficiency was reduced under sunlight irradiation mass spectra reveal that the reaction proceeds through three different pathways the first reaction path involves the breaking of the nh so2 bond sn bond dissociation energy 111 0 kcal mol to form 3 amino 5 methyl isoxazole m z 98 and sulfanilic acid m z 173 the second reaction pathway involves breaking the isoxazole ring induced by breaking the nc bond forming 5 methyl isoxazole m z 83 and sulfanilamide m z 172 the third reaction pathway involves hydroxylation of the sulfamethoxazole identifying the by products and toxicity study revealed that even though 100 mineralization was not attained under sunlight irradiation the residual by products are non toxic and showed restricted biocide activity 194 fig 10 depicts the pseudo first order rate kinetics in the breakdown of sulfamethoxazole using various metal au ag and cu loading in mono metallic materials au pd alloy was impregnated with the tio2 using a photo deposition method resulting in the au pd tio2 nanotube the impregnated au pd tio2 possesses an improved photooxidation efficiency in malathion degradation the improved photocatalytic efficiency was due to the efficient electron hole separation and enhanced rate of h2o2 formation 195 au loaded tio2 nanotube arrays synthesized by the electrochemical anodic oxidation method followed by a photo deposition showed efficient elimination of rhodamine b under photocatalytic operations utilizing sunlight irradiation using au 0 4 wt tio2 photocatalyst the degradation rate constant of rhodamine b was 0 3672 h 1 which is 1 4 times higher than the pure tio2 0 2634 h 1 it was found that both oh and holes are taking part in the oxidation of rhodamine b fluorescence study revealed that the hydroxyl radicals are generated under the illumination of a xenon lamp the fluorescence emission spectra confirmed the generation of the photoexcited electrons the study provides valuable insights and the reaction center s conformational and functional probe light activating the photocatalysts produces electrons and holes and some of the electrons and holes recombine and produce energy by undergoing fluorescence emission laser fluorescence emission intensity infers a decreased rate of recombination of electron hole pairs 196 chansa et al reported the fabrication of tio2 tio2 doped gold nanorods aunrs and tio2 doped gold nanospheres aunss using nucleation and growth method and the catalyst was used for photocatalytic degradation of orange16 dye 197 a comparative study in photocatalytic degradation of the dye showed that the removal efficiency followed the order tio2 tio2 doped aunss tio2 doped aunrs the higher degradation efficiency of the tio2 doped aunrs compared to the tio2 doped aunss is due to the involvement of both transverse and longitudinal peaks of the aunrs in the photon absorption process and a significant enhancement of the electromagnetic field interestingly bare tio2 tio2 doped with aunss and aunrs showed the percentage photodegradation of dye as 0 82 79 24 and 86 65 respectively within 120 min of irradiation a green synthesis was followed to obtain a visible light active nanocomposite au tio2 modified with reduced graphene oxide rgo biofilm and ag2cro4 198 the quaternary ag2cro4 tio2 au rgo nanocomposite biofilm was synthesized using a simple impregnation method which was then reduced in situ in the presence of acacia gum further the removal of methylene blue was examined under visible light irradiation to study the photocatalytic efficiency of the nanocomposite photocatalyst the ag2cro4 tio2 au rgo heterostructures degraded the dye at a rate of 97 in 52 min which was 3 1 6 5 and 10 8 times faster than ag2cro4 tio2 au biofilm ag2cro4 tio2 and ag2cro4 respectively moreover the photoelectrochemical tests revealed that the representative biofilm possesses higher photocatalytic activity fig 11 depicts methylene blue degradation s mechanistic insights with the band position of ag2cro4 tio2 au rgo hybrid biofilm a ternary plasmonic photocatalyst au tio2 g c3n4 enabled an improved photocatalytic efficiency in the elimination of bisphenol a bpa and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp under uv visible light irradiations 199 the quantity of g c3n4 and nanocrystalline tio2 was optimized for greater photocatalytic activity further enhanced by doping plasmonic au nanoparticles compared to the g c3n4 and tio2 the doping of au nanoparticles enhanced the photocatalytic activity by increasing the degradation rate by 3 1 and 5 11 times for bpa and 2 4 dcp respectively the lspr and catalytic effects of au nanoparticles in the nanocomposite are summarised in fig 12 using the solvothermal approach the au and ag nanoparticles were successfully doped within the pores of tio2 101 under visible light and solar irradiations the photocatalytic activity of the plasmonic tio2 was examined using the azo dyes eliminations remazol red acid orange 10 congo red and methyl orange the bare tio2 showed lower photocatalytic efficiency than tio2 doped with plasmonic nanoparticles when exposed to light au ag nanoparticles perform as co catalysts trapping electrons from the conduction band of tio2 the metal nanoparticles show fermi levels which are shifted to the negative potential and the resultant interfacial charge transfer process is greatly enhanced thus the number of holes in tio2 increases and the density of electrons in metal nanoparticles increases facilitating the breakdown of azo dyes moreover the au tio2 catalyst showed about two times higher photocatalytic efficiency than the ag tio2 catalyst this is because au 5 1 ev has a greater work function than ag 4 7 ev allowing for effective charge carrier separation similarly the bimetallic au ag nanoparticles were decorated onto a porous aerogel tio2 photocatalyst and employed in the photocatalytic elimination of salicylic acid sa under visible light irradiation a highly intense plasmonic effect was obtained resulting in an increase in photocatalytic efficiency compared to the monometallic decorated tio2 photocatalyst 200 the au tio2 nanohybrids prepared using the hydrothermal method showed ca 95 methylene blue dye degradation within 100 min under uv irradiation 30 w 201 choi et al reported the synthesis of fe3o4 tio2 au nanocomposite using a sol gel process 202 fe3o4 tio2 au has shown an improved electron hole pairs separation induced by the charge transfer of the inter particle or energy transfer between au and tio2 the material was used to remove 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and 97 7 was degraded within 40 min of irradiation under 150 w visible light xe lamp due to the magnetic property of core fe3o4 particles the fe3o4 tio2 au is easily separated by applying an external magnetic field table 2 summarises numerous photocatalysts used for the variety of micropollutants removal using the plasmonic au doped tio2 photocatalysts 4 2 use of ag doped tio2 in the photocatalytic elimination of various micropollutants the ag tio2 nanocomposite with plasmonic ag nanowires impregnated with tio2 nanoparticles was previously synthesized 231 because of the lspr effect the hot electrons are transported through the interface hence the nanocomposite exhibited high photocatalytic efficacy in degrading the methylene blue under solar light illumination under visible light irradiation the lspr effect is predominant in the oxidation of several organic dyes and micropollutants such as methyl orange 4 chlorophenol phenol and tetracycline with ag tio2 photocatalysts 232 233 ag decorated with s tio2 x nanorods was synthesized using in situ solid state chemical reduction and photo deposition the nanocomposite showed good crystallinity reduced band gap and was efficient with visible and near infrared light excitations the synergistic effect was obtained due to the s doping self doping of ti3 and the ag nanoparticles further the lspr effect is attributed to the high photocatalytic efficiency of nanocomposite in the elimination of phenol and the mechanism is illustrated in fig 13 234 to explore the photocatalytic efficiency of a ternary ag tio2 nanocomposite coated over three dimensional activated carbon nanotubes acnt degradation removal of organic micropollutants was carried out using the nanocomposite material the acnt possesses a large surface area which enables an enhanced exposure of light irradiations and adsorption of organic contaminants onto the catalyst surface further the photocatalytic process showed an almost complete breakdown of rhodamine 6g 235 the reusability stability of the plasmonic photocatalysts was improved by forming composites with highly magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 this photocatalyst with magneto plasmonic was utilized to eliminate rhodamine 6g rh6g in textile effluent 236 the activity of the ternary au ag tio2 fe3o4 photocatalyst showed ca four times better efficiency than that of the unmodified tio2 photocatalyst furthermore the photocatalyst was recycled up to five times without losing its photocatalytic efficiency yun et al synthesized the ag tio2 nanorods using the sol gel synthetic method photocatalytic degradation of acid red 44 using the ag tio2 nanorods was performed using eis electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cv cyclic voltammetry methods and the efficiency was compared with the tio2 nanorods and nanospheres ag tio2 nanorods showed enhanced electrochemical behavior including fast electron transfer to the electrode due to ag nps doped titania furthermore the electron hole recombination is suppressed significantly due to the delocalization of electrons at the nanorods which synergizes the catalytic process therefore the photocatalytic efficacy of ag tio2 was increased for the removal of acid red 44 90 of the dye was removed using 0 1 g of ag tio2 nanocomposite under uv light 300 w for 45 min 79 ag tio2 was synthesized using the green deposition method and the catalyst was efficiently utilized for the inactivation of bacteria and removing methylene blue the biogenic ag nps were deposited on the tio2 surface further ag nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed onto the tio2 surface as a result intense schottky junctions were formed between ag and tio2 further reducing the electron hole separation the photocatalytic process removed ca 90 of methylene blue in just 40 min of irradiation 237 the wet impregnation synthesized plasmonic ag tio2 photocatalyst was employed remove methyl red dye the average size of the particle for both tio2 and ag doped tio2 was determined to be 2 μm using 1 g l dosage of ag tio2 methyl red dye was degraded 99 under 16 w a uv light for 45 min further the breakdown process was analyzed in the absence or occurrence of atmospheric oxygen the degradation efficiency was significantly less in the absence of oxygen signifying that oxygen is involved in the mechanism of the photocatalytic breakdown process 238 highly efficient heterogeneous plasmonic ag doped tio2 was prepared using the ultrasonic assisted sol gel method to purify wastewater contaminated with different aromatic micropollutants especially chlorinated substances 2 4 6 trichlorophenol was taken as a model micropollutant and treated under an 8 w uv a light source the results specified that the photocatalytic efficiency of ag tio2 ag content below 1 0 wt was significantly higher than that of the bare tio2 ag deposits on the tio2 surface and perform as active sites where the accumulation of electrons takes place improved separation of holes and electrons on the doped tio2 surface permits greater effective channeling of the charge carriers for efficient oxidation and reduction reactions rather than recombination reactions 95 of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol was removed using ag tio2 catalyst within 120 min and ca 80 of the micropollutant was mineralized the degradation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol proceeds through chlorine release pathways i e dechlorination 64 a highly efficient ag tio2 composite exhibits 100 removal efficiency in the degradation of chloramphenicol sol gel method and photo deposition method were applied for synthesizing the nanocomposite material the tem image of the solid showed that 2 10 nm ag nanoparticles were dispersed on the tio2 surface it was observed that ag loading of 0 96 wt was the optimal doping amount to attain the highest efficiency of chloramphenicol degradation further using ag tio2 0 96 wt ag 88 of toc was removed after 120 mins of treatment 239 ag doped hollow tio2 nanospheres ag h tio2 were obtained using the sol gel method 240 the ag nanoparticles were doped with the host tio2 in its interstitial sites the tio2 in the ag h tio2 nanocomposite possesses the anatase phase and is highly crystalline compared to solid tio2 nanoparticles the surface area of hollow ag h tio2 nanoparticles was increased significantly to 103 2 m2 g the quantum yield with ag h tio2 nanoparticles was also improved by 18 7 compared to bare tio2 solid the elimination of nitrobenzene and metronidazole by the catalyst was investigated in an aqueous medium at the catalyst dosage of 0 5 g l under irradiation with 125 w visible light for 120 min the metronidazole degradation was achieved 96 55 and 94 77 with the metronidazole concentration of 15 and 30 mg l respectively further the percentage degradation of nitrobenzene was obtained as 95 5 89 61 and 58 46 using the ag h tio2 ag tio2 and tio2 nps respectively photocatalysts the ag h tio2 nanocomposite showed only a 10 47 decline in degradation efficacy even after 6 cycles of repeated use the probable pathway for the degradation of nitrobenzene

methyl orange under uv and solar light irradiations further ca 65 4 removal efficiency was achieved after 120 min of light irradiation using a 350 w uv light the improved photocatalytic activity of ag tio2 was attributed to the plasmonic absorption by the silver nanoparticles the degradation of methyl orange using ag tio2 nanocomposites followed langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order kinetic model 241 ag tio2 nanofibers fabricated using electrospinning method the material is effective in the removal of phenol under visible light irradiation the response surface method rsm designed the experiment doe to statistically optimize photocatalyst concentration initial phenol concentration and the solution ph analysis of variance anova indicates that ph phenol concentration the square of catalyst dosage the square of phenol concentration and the interaction of ph and phenol concentration substantially influence phenol degradation the degradation percentage was reported to be higher at higher ph ph 8 this is attributed to the higher concentrations of hydroxyl ions at higher ph values favoring the degradation percentage at an optimized photocatalyst 2 06 g l 92 9 of phenol was degraded under visible light irradiation 242 fabrication of ag doped tio2 nanowire arrays graphene oxide coated with carbon fibre composite ag tio2nas gocf using a simple self template method was reported elsewhere the composite material was highly effective for degrading tetracycline hydrochloride under visible and uv light the increased photocatalytic activity of the composite material was attributed to the presence of graphene oxide the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of tio2 are transferred to the graphene oxide these photogenerated electrons on the graphene oxide surface reacted with oxygen molecules in the presence of water and formed superoxide anion radical o2 ˉ this superoxide anion radical then interacted with h to form hydroxyl radical oh hydroxyl radical further oxidized the tetracycline molecules and led to the degradation of the micropollutant molecules 243 the plasmonic ag np tio2 thin film was fabricated using the synthetic sol gel template method tio2 fine grains were distributed finely over the borosilicate glass surface forming a uniform ag0 np tio2 thin film and the size of the particles ranged from 10 to 15 nm the nanocomposite material was highly efficient for the photocatalytic removal of mordant orange 1 111 alizarin yellow gg 180 tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole 112 under uv a and visible light irradiations cf fig 15 the nanocomposite photocatalyst was revealed to be highly stable as the degradation efficiency was almost constant even after 6 cycles of repeated use plasmonic ag tio2 nanowire was prepared using a one step hydrothermal process which showed 100 removal efficiency in the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b within 120 min of irradiation under uv light uv vis absorption spectra displayed that the deposition of ag onto tio2 showed a significant redshift compared to the pristine tio2 which results in increased photocatalytic efficiency for rhodamine b degradation 212 mustafa et al reported ag doped ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 ag d nzf as an alternative plasmonic photocatalyst having comparable efficiency as ag doped tio2 244 10 mg of ag d nzf degraded 99 of metronidazole antibiotic within 360 min at ph 3 further ag d nzf demonstrated bactericidal effects against bacterial strains after 65 min table 3 summarises the numerous photocatalysts used to eliminate several potential micropollutants in an aqueous medium using the plasmonic ag doped tio2 4 3 photocatalytic efficiency of plasmonic pd doped tio2 photocatalysts the atomic layer deposition method fabricated a plasmonic pd tio2 photocatalyst 291 the photocatalyst s active site densities were measured resulting in variations of the lspr effect the photocatalyst removed methylene blue and 2 4d a pesticide under visible and uv vis light the highest removal rate was obtained with 2 7 percentage weight of pd nanoparticles loading therefore the plasmonic effect is crucial in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency of noble metal doped tio2 photocatalyst in degrading organic contaminants due to their broad solar radiation absorption anisotropic nanoparticles of pd with tio2 showed greater attention in research fig 16 depicts the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and 2 4 d degradation using pd tio2 under uv vis and visible light the results pave the way for developing and designing low cost highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts that are excited with solar radiations to achieve optimum photocatalytic efficiency the impregnation method synthesized pd tio2 chitosan cs photocatalyst it was then successfully utilized for breaking down methylene blue under visible light irradiation xrd patterns of the pd tio2 cs tio2 cs pd tio2 tio2 and cs showed that in all the composite materials tio2 possessed the anatase phase which validates no apparent effect on the crystallizing process of tio2 upon adding cs cs facilitates the crystallization and further the xrd patterns reveal that characteristic diffraction peaks are widened and result in a decrease in diffraction peak intensity fig s5 the tio2 nanoparticles in the absence of cs exhibited very high agglomeration further pd tio2 without cs exhibited very high agglomeration on the other hand pd tio2 with cs exhibited an even distribution of pd within the tio2 pd tio2 cs showed very high photocatalytic degradation efficiency compared to other composite materials further 99 5 of methylene blue 75 mg l was degraded using pd tio2 cs photocatalyst within 30 min of irradiation 292 the influence of tio2 doped with shape tailored controlled pd nanoparticles in the breaking down of oxalic acid and phenol was studied by fodor et al 105 the pd tio2 catalyst s efficiency in the photocatalytic breakdown of phenol and oxalic acid was much higher than the bare tio2 p25 almost 100 removal efficiency was achieved for the micropollutants using the pd tio2 catalyst under 2 h of uv irradiation in contrast the removal efficiency was much reduced with the bare tio2 p25 the primary degradation by products of the phenol are benzene 1 3 diol resorcinol res benzene 1 2 diol pyrocatechol py and benzene 1 4 diol hydroquinone hq the quantity of the breakdown intermediates was maximum in the case of pd cubic comprising nanocomposites while the maximum ratio of toxic intermediates was given by the pd spherical composite table 4 summarises numerous photocatalysts for micropollutant degradation using the plasmonic pd doped tio2 photocatalysts 4 4 photocatalytic efficiency of plasmonic pt doped tio2 photocatalysts pt doped tio2 photocatalyst was fabricated using sol gel and photo reductive deposition methods the catalyst showed high photocatalytic efficiency in removing methyl orange 293 the optimum doping amount of pt was found to be 1 5 wt giving a higher degradation percentage of 86 2 under 500 w uv light irradiation for 30 min the decolorization rate was enhanced with an increase in the concentration of h2o2 from 0 4 to 2 mm l a maximum decolorization was attained at 1 2 mm l and then declined with increased h2o2 concentration h2o2 favored the formation of oh radicals and thus photocatalytic activity was increased however further increase in h2o2 scavenged the oh and thus the degradation reaction was hindered therefore only a moderate amount of h2o2 is useful to attain a higher degradation rate pt modified tio2 nanotube arrays ntas with controlled deposition and better visible light photocatalytic activity were synthesized using the uv light photoreduction method 294 the uv light induced photoreduction enabled uniform deposition of pt nanoparticles onto the tio2 nanotubes using h2ptcl6 as a precursor the photocatalytic action of the material was examined using methyl orange dye the visible light irradiation strikes the photocatalyst electron hole pairs are generated in pt nanoparticles because of the surface plasmon resonance and the presence of pt showed the schottky barrier at metal and semiconductor heterojunction which hindered the recombination of charge carriers significantly and allowed smooth interfacial charge transfer reactions as a result the pt tio2 ntas show enhanced visible light stimulated photocatalytic efficiency using pt tio2 ntas under irradiation with visible light 250 w for 2 h methyl orange s removal rate reached 84 27 solar light stimulated photocatalytic degradation of acetaminophen using pt doped tio2 and bare tio2 was studied elsewhere 295 the one pot photo deposition fabricated pt doped tio2 nanocomposite showed 80 photodegradation of acetaminophen within 90 min irradiation while only 63 was removed with bare tio2 under similar experimental conditions mass spectrometry study reveals that twenty one degradation by products were identified for acetaminophen using bare tio2 and noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts under irradiation with simulated solar light photocatalytic degradation of micropollutant proceeded through the oh radicals fig 17 depicts the photocatalytic mineralization of acetaminophen using pt tio2 au tio2 ag tio2 tio2 under a simulated solar light and b uv light table 5 summarises

bimetallic au ag doped tio2 nanomaterial fabricated by sol immobilization method showed a very high percentage removal of tetracycline with up to 80 under visible light irradiation within 120 min and the removal efficiency was further improved to 90 under the dynamic system 296 the electron spin resonance esr technique enabled the identification of active radical species utilizing dmpo as a spin trapping agent without visible light esr signals were not detected indicating that no photocatalytic activity occurred in the absence of light irradiation however strong signals for dmpo o2 and dmpo oh were observed which indicated the presence of oh and o2 active radicals in the degradation process various reactive oxygen species ros like oh oh2 and o2 were detected utilizing the fluorescence spectroscopic study using 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da the free radicals react with dcfh da and lead to dichlorofluorescein dcf generation the dcf is detected with a fluorescence spectrophotometer it is revealed that all the composite photocatalysts with dcfh da exhibited a notable peak at 525 nm after 15 min of treatment this inferred the generation of ros the fluorescence intensity for dcf was observed to be in the order of au0 1ag0 9 tio2 au1 tio2 ag1 tio2 tio2 which confirmed that the bimetallic au0 1ag0 9 tio2 nanocomposite efficiently enhance the generation of ros fabrication of aupd nanoparticles decorated tio2 nanobelts using potentiostatic anodization electrodeposition method was performed and the catalyst degraded the potential antibiotic levofloxacin efficiently using solar light the au pd tio2 removed ca 95 of antibiotic levofloxacin after 60 min irradiation under simulated solar light further it was concluded that oh o2 and h2o2 are the main active species degrading the levofloxacin in an aqueous medium 297 gołąbiewska et al synthesized the tio2 decorated with pt au bimetallic nanoparticles using the sol gel process 298 the nanocomposite showed high photocatalytic efficiency in removing the phenol moreover the bimetallic pt au loaded tio2 exhibited a significantly higher removal percentage of phenol than bare tio2 under 1000 w xenon lamp visible light however if the weight percentage of au is too high in the pt au bimetallic system the photocatalytic degradation efficiency decreases significantly further it was also concluded that only the pt played a crucial role in the photocatalytic breakdown process the proposed mechanism for transferring excited electrons from pt au nps to tio2 is represented in fig 18 table 6 summarises numerous photocatalysts for micropollutants degradation using the plasmonic bimetallic loaded tio2 photocatalysts further table 7 summarises the comparison of characterization of various

moreover antibiotics are the most common micropollutants since they are widely used in modern medication these are employed for therapeutic development and inhibit microbes while leaving intact cells 5 these compounds are extensively used to prevent many common diseases and to control parasites 6 global antibiotic consumption exceeds billions of tablets annually 7 and around 70 billion were produced in 2010 8 a significant amount of antibiotics is excreted through urine and feces and they are thus finally entered into the aquatic environment the animals or humans readily consume the polluted water increasing antibiotic resistant genes growth 9 similarly endocrine disrupting chemicals edc cause impairment in the reproductive organs of aquatic animals 10 11 the edcs interact with the body s regular secretory chemicals which results in a change in metabolism release synthesis and operation process edcs also inhibit the action of the endocrine system various malfunctions in the human body such as immune disorders reproductivity disorders and nervous system diseases are often induced by edcs 12 this class of chemicals is found in various natural settings including foods water soil and air in levels ranging from ppb parts per billion to ppm parts per million levels the edcs are introduced into the environment through wastewater from industries that produce or use edcs sewage or municipal wastewater 13 14 these compounds are stable and persistent for more prolonged periods 15 on the other hand pesticides and herbicides are seemingly hazardous to humans and the environment 16 the regular intake of herbicides like atrazine causes cancer muscle degeneration retinal degeneration and cardiovascular issues in humans some herbicides like oxyfluorfen inhibit the protoporphyrinogen oxidase causing irreversible cell membrane damage pesticide exposure also causes an imbalance in blood counts and liver abnormalities 17 similarly industrial effluents mainly from the textile industries carry a high load of dyes contaminating the aquatic environment 18 various dyes and several dye precursors appear carcinogenic or mutagenic 19 synthetic dyes are not readily biodegradable and are stable toward the oxidizing chemicals 20 as a result these compounds often escape from modern wastewater treatment plants and end up in water bodies causing considerable harmful effects on the aquatic ecosystem 21 23 compounds of azo dyes are exceedingly hazardous causing allergies skin illnesses defects in embryo development and cancer 24 26 according to lee et al 2006 and riera torres et al 2010 27 28 annual dye production exceeds 7 105 tons with ca 10 15 of total dyes enter the waterbodies through industrial effluents 29 31 other reports indicated that annually ca 2 8 105 tons of textile dyes are discharged into aquatic bodies via industrial effluents 32 33 therefore efficient and effective removal of dyes including other harmful contaminants from polluted water is a demand of the hour 34 physical chemical and biological methods are often applied to treat wastewater contaminated with various micropollutants physical methods like filtration sedimentation and adsorption are widely used especially in textile industries 35 nevertheless these methods are not efficient in eliminating these micropollutants at low levels moreover synthesizing suitable and efficient adsorbents is sometimes expensive or challenging 35 36 chemical methods involved flocculation or coagulation with alum and ferrous these are widely used to eliminate micropollutants from wastewater however a large amount of the by products are generated in the form of sludge which poses additional challenges for its possible disposal 37 38 chlorine ozone and hypochlorite are widely used for wastewater treatment because of their cost effectiveness easy availability and relatively high efficiency however the by products formed are highly toxic and pose several health issues 39 several by products is carcinogenic that are even more toxic than the intended micropollutant additionally the process produces extra sludge containing a variety of decomposed by products 40 among these treatment methods biological treatment is widely employed and greener treatment however the recalcitrant pollutants azo containing molecules and micropollutants are only partially degraded and escaped through treated water 41 42 the researchers have given greater heed to developing easy efficient and cost effective methods for the efficient degradation or removal of micropollutants in the aquatic environment in a line the advanced oxidation process aop involving heterogeneous photocatalysis has drawn much attention in effectively eliminating of micropollutants such as pesticides edcs pharmaceuticals pcbs and dyes the principle of aops is based on the in situ formation of highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals that readily oxidize many recalcitrant pollutants including the micropollutants non selectively 43 44 heterogeneous photocatalysis is a photochemical process in which light activates heterogeneous photocatalysts semiconductors and forms charge carriers by the excitation of the electron the charge carriers can potentially speed up chemical reactions or modify selectivity 45 the photon energy having adequate energy frequency enables to excite of the electrons from the ground state to the excited state i e from the valence band to the conduction band thus photonic excitation creates an electron hole pair by leaving behind empty unfilled holes in the valence band titanium dioxide is a widely explored semiconductor heterogeneous photocatalyst however the material has its advantages and limitations in practical implications 1 1 tio2 and its limitation since the discovery of photoelectrocatalytic water splitting using titanium dioxide tio2 electrodes under uv light 45 considerable progress has been achieved in environmental catalysis and solar to fuel conversion titanium dioxide is biocompatible has chemical and thermal stability low cost low toxicity and accessible synthesis enabled for widespread applications in diverse areas moreover tio2 is widely used in cosmetics building materials electric devices semiconductors and pigment titanium dioxide is introduced as a prototype photocatalyst because of its high photooxidation potential it has been extensively studied as a photocatalyst during the last couple of decades for initiating a sequence of reductive and oxidative processes in a different chemical reaction 46 49 the use of titanium dioxide in the photocatalytic processes is environmentally benign with zero waste compliance titanium dioxide usually has three crystalline phases brookite anatase and rutile anatase and rutile phases are the most common mineral phases 50 under extreme pressures and temperatures rutile is known to have high stability nevertheless under ambient conditions anatase is found to have high stability this is because the phase conversion into the rutile phase at ambient temperature is too slow 51 furthermore the anatase phase of tio2 showed greater applicability over the other phases because of its high stability under light radiation cost effectiveness efficient photoactivity activity chemical and biological inertness and non toxicity 51 the lone pair electron in its outer orbital is greatly responsible for the photocatalytic processes the interplay of parameters such as adsorption desorption properties defects number phpzc point of zero charges of the surface catalyst surface area and crystalline structure determines the overall activity of tio2 in photocatalysis furthermore the efficiency of the photocatalyst is affected by the method in which the catalyst is used whether in a slurry or placed on a supporting medium the way light is harvested and the geometrical arrangement of the reactor the optimum photocatalyst for use in an aqueous solution has always been determined to be anatase in specific applications however the rutile phase is useful in oxidative and reductive reactions in general two methods of using tio2 in photocatalysis have emerged one as finely distributed particles supported on porous substances and fluids suspended in a liquid medium and the other as supported thin films 52 53 the tio2 in a suspended form always has to be separated after each photo degradation reaction by using tio2 films on various substrates such difficulties could be avoided according to structural dimensionality various tio2 nanostructures such as nanorod nanowire nanofiber nanoplates and nanosheets are summarised in fig 1 54 tio2 possesses a wide band gap of 3 2 ev and 3 0 ev respectively for anatase and rutile and has been extensively studied for several applications 51 as a result of the wide band gap it absorbs the electromagnetic spectrum exclusively in the uv region fig s1 55 thus the photocatalytic technology using the tio2 catalyst has two key limitations rapid electron hole recombination and absorption of light limited to the uv region further uv radiation contributes only 4 5 of the total solar energy spectrum in contrast visible light accounts for about half 45 56 the rapid electron hole recombination is due to the inhibition of the transfer of electron and hole pairs on the tio2 surface which result in less availability of the electrons and holes for further reactions 57 moreover some micropollutants have less affinity toward the tio2 photocatalyst and thus results in less adsorption of micropollutants in the vicinity of the tio2 photocatalyst this leads to a reduction in photocatalytic efficiency immobilization of photocatalysts on suitable substrate surfaces enhances the selective affinity of catalysts for micropollutant molecules 58 apart from this during the photocatalytic treatment the tio2 undergoes accumulation due to the low stability of the catalyst this hinders the active centres from receiving the radiant light from the light source which reduces the photocatalyst s performance 59 60 tio2 photocatalysts in their fine powder form are dispersed well in the wastewater thus possessing high photocatalytic activity however recovering the powder tio2 from the treated wastewater after the treatment process is a daunting task which limits the photocatalyst for wider practical applications 61 1 2 plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 doping of tio2 with plasmonic noble metals overcomes various limitations confronting the use of bare tio2 it lowers of band gap energy and allows absorption of photons at lower energy i e toward the visible region in the electromagnetic spectrum primarily due to the localized surface plasmon effect lspr 62 it involves the attachment of the dopant atoms within the tio2 structure among all the dopant metals noble metals au ag pd and pt have unusually high schottky barriers which help noble metals to trap electrons and facilitate the separation of electron hole pairs the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect of noble metals facilitates tio2 photocatalysts to enhance the excitation of electrons at the catalyst surface 63 64 it also increases the lifetime of electron and hole pairs which increases the photocatalytic efficiency of noble metal doped tio2 65 among all the noble metals silver ag nanoparticles show extremely intense surface plasmon resonance spr within the wavelength region of 320 450 nm which is close to the corresponding tio2 band gap absorption energy 3 2 ev 388 nm in ag tio2 photocatalyst the excitation of electrons from the conduction band of tio2 to ag nanoparticles is thermodynamically favored this is due to the reason that the fermi level of ag metal is lower as compared to the tio2 64 as a result the schottky barrier is formed easily in metal semiconductor 66 67 thus ag tio2 is a promising photocatalyst for photocatalytic reactions and is shown to have high efficiency in the photocatalytic removal of different micropollutants compared to the bare tio2 nanomaterial 68 69 these materials showed absorption wavelength in the visible region 70 on the other hand the spr band of metallic au is relatively less intense than metallic ag s however au nanoparticles showed relatively higher stability and intense broad visible light absorption band which makes it more promising for industrial applications 71 72 moreover some studies also suggest that the combination of au and tio2 results in dual perimeter sites where molecular oxygen activation occurs 73 as a result au doped tio2 is a promising photocatalyst for photocatalytic reactions heterogeneous photocatalysis using solar radiations has received greater interest because the process is environment and energy efficient 74 75 the literature reveals that significant development has occurred in the areas such as materials synthesis physico chemical properties of materials and applications of these materials in molecular transformations artificial photosynthesis environmental waste management energy generation etc 76 77 the potent combination of heterogeneous photocatalysis and solar energy helped achieve sustainable global developments ultimate objectives such as efficient photocatalytic degradation of micropollutants and hydrogen production through the splitting of water molecules 47 48 this review focuses primarily on the recent developments in the plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles with tio2 and its efficient applications in the photocatalytic degradation of micropollutants as well as an in depth study of the mechanism involved during the photocatalytic processes moreover the practical aspects of these materials are extensively studied for their stability reusability in prolonged operations selectivity for real implications and large scale or pilot scale implications insights into the catalytic processes particularly the radical identification by products formed and reaction pathways provide a more profound and molecular level understanding of the processes these input results pave the way for implementing the laboratory trials toward possible technology developments an important guideline for future development is provided by this review which exhaustively analyses the significant accomplishments and crucial features 2 principle of plasmonic photocatalysis plasmonic and conventional photocatalysis are almost similar especially regarding the mechanism involved during the reaction 78 79 nevertheless the presence of noble metals shows a plasmonic effect enhancing the photocatalysts overall performance it creates a schottky junction between the semiconductor and the metals 80 it is a space charge layer through which the excited electrons are excited from the conduction band of tio2 to metal nanoparticles it occurs from the variance in energy level between the fermi level of the metal and the valence or conduction band edge of the semiconductor cb commonly named the schottky barrier energy 81 noble metal nanoparticles store and shuttle photo generated electrons from the vicinity of the tio2 surface to the acceptor 82 decorating noble metals on tio2 photocatalyst modifies the surface properties of the photocatalyst which further facilitates generating hydroxyl radicals by the interaction of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen 83 plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance lspr due to their interaction with electromagnetic light radiation it is an effect that developed due to electron oscillating in the conduction band at the interface of plasmonic metal dielectric 84 when light radiation falls on the plasmonic metals electrons get excited from their ground state to the possible excited states rapid collective oscillations of electron density occur on the noble metals resulting in localized surface plasmon resonance 85 this generates an electromagnetic field near the metal nanoparticles 86 thus absorption and scattering of the incoming electromagnetic wave at frequencies close to the lspr cause the generation of strong electric fields near the surface of the nanoparticles 87 due to the excitation of lspr metal nanoparticles behave as nano antennas gathering energy from light and converting it into an intense localized electric field fig 2 88 metal nanoparticles that induce lspr excitation in the visible or near ir regions are usually termed plasmonic nanoparticles the excitation of lspr takes place at a specific frequency that is affected by the environment s dielectric constant structure shape composition ensemble geometry and distance between nearby nanoparticles 74 89 as a result the optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles are modified by carefully tuning the parameters allowing the production of plasmonic nanoparticles with better optical properties for improved photocatalytic performance the broadening of the lspr bands lspr positions the number of lspr modes and the relative ratio between scattering and absorption radiations are all influenced by the size of the plasmonic nanoparticles 90 with increasing size lspr tends to move toward longer wavelengths as metal nanoparticles of larger size necessitate a low frequency for electromagnetic retardation furthermore as the size of nanoparticles grows the relative ratios of scattering to absorption increase contributing to the lspr band broadening 87 91 another crucial feature that significantly impacts the lspr is the shape the shape of nanoparticles affects the plasmon mode and frequency resulting in the change in the absorption to scattering ratios of radiations hence the change in the frequency of lspr and the magnitude of the electric field generated near the surface is altered this is because charges incline to cluster at the corners and points of anisotropic nanoparticles which are similar to prisms and cubes 87 the size significantly impacts the lspr effect of metal nanoparticles hence it must be considered before the lspr effect is applied to a chemical reaction finally because these parameters depend on the metal s dielectric constant the composition impacts absorption scattering intensities and lspr location furthermore utilizing compositions lspr is fine tuned in bimetallic nanoparticles such as core shell systems and alloys resulting in variations in the plasmonic component s shape and alteration in the dielectric constant 91 3 synthesis of plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts the plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts are synthesized using sol gel reduction hydrothermal solvothermal deposition precipitation photoreduction impregnation ion exchange physical vapor deposition chemical reduction encapsulation sputtering and photo deposition methods however the most often utilized methods are sol gel hydrothermal solvothermal deposition precipitation photoreduction and ion exchange further the advantages and disadvantages of different synthetic methods are summarised in table 1 3 1 sol gel reduction process the sol gel process generally entails converting a system from a liquid sol phase largely colloidal to a solid gel phase this method enables fabricating ultra fine powders or thin film coatings 92 sol gel synthesis of tio2 based plasmonic material is divided into two types based on the titania metal precursor i an alcohol based method with metal alkoxide as the starting precursor and ii an aqueous based approach with an inorganic metal salt as the starting precursor in the alcohol based process ti oc4h9 4 ti oc3h7 4 and ti oc2h5 are the most often used metal alkoxides precursors of tio2 there is a metal oxygen bonding in these alkoxides the bond develops high polarity and is exceedingly reactive due to the significant variance in electro negativity between o and ti as a result adding water causes simultaneous hydrolysis and condensation reactions to occur simultaneously eventually the formation of gel 93 in the aqueous based process tioso4 94 and ticl4 95 are essential precursors for the aqueous based method hydrolysis and condensation reactions occurred for aqueous based sol gels preparations gaining crystals at optimum temperature and slow controlled nucleation is proceeded in the process 96 precipitation and peptization are two steps that occur in the aqueous based sol gel processes in precipitation inorganic metal salts are hydrolyzed and form a gel precipitate after adding the base and repeated washings then remove the excess electrolytes the peptization process is known as the method of re dispersing the colloid particles to prevent coagulation 93 peptization disintegrates a substance into colloid sized particles by adding a suitable peptizing agent 97 sol gel reduction process has various advantages such as i chemical homogeneity is increased in doped and multi component systems ii generation of high surface area powder materials iii due to the lack of grinding and pressing stages the purity of the chemicals is not lost iv requires only essential apparatus and a low preparation temperature v various products such as powders fibers and coatings are obtained in relatively less time and vi controlling the features which allows the creation of custom made products however the sol gel approach has some drawbacks including a comparatively high precursor cost a time consuming process significant shrinkage during the process and the potential for complex agglomeration 96 the alkoxide and non alkoxide precursors enable the tio2 in its membrane thin film and powdery forms 98 99 this approach offers several advantages including purity ease in synthesis stoichiometry composition control and the ability to introduce dopants in high quantities 100 for the mesoporous tio2 liu et al used a sol gel method in which the solution was made by dissolving ti obu 4 in ethanol 98 the gel was then left for 24 h for aging before being calcined for 4 h at 350 c utilizing a sol gel technique at ambient temperature a simple and environment friendly production of amorphous nanosheets tio2 is obtained 101 102 here the precursor of tio2 ammonia and bis acetylacetonate titanium di isopropoxide are added to alcohol and shaked for 20 h at room temperature and pressure the formation of turbid solution implies that tio2 nanosheets are formed furthermore a modified sol gel method was used to synthesize the tio2 nanocomposite using titanium isopropoxide hydrolysis in the occurrence of polyethylene glycol peg 103 the approach applies the generation of glycolates or mixed glycolate alkoxide allows for a slower rate of hydrolysis and hence better separation control of nucleation of titania particles as a result monodispersity and sizes are better controlled 104 fodor et al reported the fabrication of temperature dependent shape tailored controlled pd nanoparticles deposited onto the tio2 utilizing the sol gel reduction process tem images inferred that the pd nanocubes are formed at various temperatures cf fig 3 105 the chemical process is the most popular strategy for obtaining the plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles doped tio2 the approach entails adsorption and reduction of a precursor of metal on the tio2 surface sodium borohydride and citrate reduction methods turkevich method 106 brust method 107 are often used to obtain the reduced nanoparticles 108 for instance a simple method for depositing au nanoparticles with controlled and monodisperse diameters along with even dispersion over the tio2 surface was reported elsewhere fig 4 104 this method relied on tio2 as a template for depositing au and did not require surface functionalization or pre treatments in this approach water serves as the solvent polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp as the stabilizer ascorbic acid as the reducing agent and aucl4 aq as the au precursor by completing sequential reduction steps with aucl4 aq the au nanoparticles size was optimally regulated decorating pre synthesized metal nanoparticles on the surface of tio2 is another method of producing plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles doped tio2 based photocatalysts 49 in this approach a colloidal solution containing metal nanoparticles is mixed with the tio2 dispersion however aggregation of metal nanoparticles onto the surface of tio2 is the disadvantage of this method causing a decreased efficacy of the photocatalyst for the targeted application linker molecules are employed to alter the surface of metal nanoparticles to prevent aggregation 109 applying the reduction process various au nanostructures nanostars nanohexagons nanorods and nanospheres are synthesized then coated with hydroxypropyl cellulose to bind them uniformly across the surface of tio2 without accumulation 90 the coated au nanoparticles are then combined with tio2 precursor in an isopropyl alcohol medium and the au tio2 nanocomposite is formed after 20 h of shaking at room temperature tio2 nanoparticles deposited onto the au sio2 nanorods au sio2 nanostars and au sio2 nanospheres were synthesized using thermodynamic and kinetic controlled reduction methods 110 heterogeneous ag or au nanoparticles doped tio2 thin films were successfully synthesized using the sol gel template synthesis method here fine grains of tio2 were dispersed over the borosilicate glass surface forming a uniform ag0 np or au0 np tio2 thin film and the size of the nanoparticles was from 5 to 15 nm further polyethylene glycol peg was used as a template in photocatalyst synthesis 111 113 3 2 hydrothermal solvothermal synthesis the chemical processes that take place in an organic and aqueous medium respectively are referred to as solvothermal and hydrothermal techniques the treated precursor of titania solution in an aqueous solution is transported to an autoclave teflon lined during the hydrothermal process furthermore precipitation of tio2 occurs when the hydrothermal system is heated to a high temperature for a specific reaction time finally the samples are washed and dried resulting in the generation of tio2 114 115 organic solvents like toluene ethanol and methanol are utilized in the solvothermal approach since they do not need high pressure or temperatures thermal treatment on the other hand is essential for crystallizing the final product the thermal process is generally used to generate tio2 in crystalline form although these approaches are convenient and simple in the case of plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles doped tio2 photocatalysts however the method has the disadvantage of metal np aggregation 116 core yolk and core shell morphologies are the simplest way to avoid agglomeration of nanoparticles and enhance the encapsulation stability inside the tio2 another benefit of this approach is that it produces a uniform distribution of metal nanoparticles within the titania network it is worth noting that various studies have indicated that metal oxide shells or layers do not affect the properties of plasmonic characteristics he et al used a one pot hydrothermal process to synthesize a yolk shell au tio2 structure 117 similarly a hydrothermal method was used to synthesize the nanocomposite ag tio2 core shell which enhanced photocatalytic activity and separation of charge carriers for non enzymatic glucose sensors cf fig 5 118 ye et al synthesized the au tio2 composite material with prominent 101 and 100 facets designated as au t101 and au t100 respectively using a straightforward hydrothermal synthetic route 118 they are changing the reaction time solvents additives pressure and temperature control in synthesizing the tio2 particles with ideal phases morphology and regulated grain sizes thermal evaporation is the other way to prepare plasmonic photocatalysts based on tio2 this method evaporates the pure metal at high temperatures which is then deposited on the surface of a semiconductor 119 the in situ immobilization of metal nanoparticles on tio2 nanosheets surfaces prevents the aggregation of nanoparticles 120 further the compactness and thickness of the nanosheets of tio2 were adjusted to produce au nanoparticles of various densities and sizes after calcination the fine tuned structure possesses interfacial contact resulting in minimal charge recombination and better solar energy consumption 3 3 deposition precipitation deposition precipitation accompanied by washing and subsequent reduction is the widely used synthetic process for synthesizing plasmonic ag au pd pt and ag agx x i br cl doped tio2 materials 121 122 deposition precipitation deposits the noble metal nanoparticles of small size and a narrow size array onto supporting materials an aqueous solution containing au3 is the au precursor variations in calcination temperature and solution ph alter the particle size and corresponding amount of loading of noble metals 123 furthermore the speciation of au3 is determined by temperature the concentration of haucl4 and ph 124 when the ph is 4 hydrolysis of aucl4 occurs resulting in the formation of gold complex au oh xcl4 x the hydrolysis of the au complex is enhanced at increased solution ph the change in ph attains the isoelectric point of the supporting materials the ph alteration is usually carried out by adding urea na2co3 nh3 h2o and naoh solutions almost all the hydroxyl groups and noble nanoparticles are deposited on the supporting material surface once the ph of the solution reaches the isoelectric point of the support material the gold species deposited on diverse supporting material varies and ph plays a crucial role in the process 87 however supporting materials at the low isoelectric point such as activated carbon tungstate and sio2 are not optimal for the deposition precipitation loading of noble metal nanoparticles usually in supporting materials with a high specific surface area the precipitants are submerged in aqueous solutions e g hydrogen tetrachloroaurate iii trihydrate haucl4 3h2o the product was carefully cleaned with hot deionized water to remove cl ions these compounds are then finally treated under high temperature between 200 and 400 c in a hydrogen environment or air to convert au3 to metallic au0 87 the hybrid materials such as ag agbr al2o3 125 ag agi al2o3 126 and ag agbr tio2 127 are obtained using the silver halides as the precursor and the deposition precipitation method was employed the agbr is produced on the surface of tio2 with the interaction of anionic br and cationic ag using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and silver nitrate agno3 respectively fig s2 uv irradiation of agbr converted the ag to metallic ag hence the formation of ag agbr tio2 127 3 4 photoreduction semiconductors bi2wo4 cds wo3 α fe2o3 zno and tio2 possess a unique electronic structure consisting of fully occupied vb and unoccupied cb when a photon of light having energy more than the band gap energy of the semiconductor is irradiated to the semiconductor the electrons from vb jump to the cb hence the holes are produced in the vb the excited electrons are then reacted with particular precursors having ionic noble metal species to form noble metal nanoparticles onto the support materials on the other hand the holes interact with the sacrificial scavengers 87 photoreduction also known as photo deposition is frequently used with other synthesis techniques such as ion exchange 128 impregnation 129 and deposition precipitation 126 photoreduction is commonly used to prepare noble metal nanoparticles such as au and ag that are supported on different substrates a comparatively high deposition ratio of noble metals is one of the main benefits of photoreduction for example kominami et al synthesized au ceo2 under light l 300 nm with a deposition ratio of 99 9 130 furthermore no further calcination is required to prevent particle aggregation and various metals are deposited onto the support media by successive or simultaneous reduction reactions the reproducibility of the photoreduction approach is a significant drawback pipelzadeh et al reported photoreduction of ag onto tio2 and the detailed mechanism is shown in fig 6 131 3 5 ion exchange ion exchange is frequently used to produce photocatalysts provided the product solubility is lower than the reactant 132 in order to generate metallic species this method is usually combined with a reduction method that includes in situ photoreductions followed by calcination the ag agcl tio2 nanocomposite was synthesized using the ion exchange method combing the sol gel and hydrothermal methods 133 the morphological studies of ag agcl tio2 showed a fine interconnected mixed phase heterojunction further the sem micrographs and edx analyses of ag agcl tio2 are shown in fig 7 the photocatalytic activity of ag agcl tio2 was utilized in degrading rhodamine b under a xenon lamp the significant photocatalytic activity was obtained compared to the tio2 and ag tio2 further the band gap of ag agcl tio2 was found at 2 53 ev compared to the 3 22 ev of the tio2 other methods include impregnation through the vapor deposition method the impregnation method is facile and commonly synthesizes the supported catalysts there are three fundamental steps involved in the impregnation methods a high surface area of support material is first impregnated with a metal precursor solution which is then evaporated at a high temperature and finally the metal precursor is reduced in a suitable environment and to obtain the impregnated catalysts 134 the impregnation approach is carried out in dry 135 and wet conditions 136 the process is facile affordable and straightforward 137 impregnation primarily occurs when a liquid containing dissolved metal species moves inside the substrate s pores the diffused metal ions are adsorbed within the pores the drying process involves evaporation of the liquid from the pores the ph of the solution and metal particle size during preparation are investigated in the impregnation process 138 the synthesis of supported pt and pd based metal oxides are obtained using the wet impregnation method 139 140 the impregnation reduction process is used to create binary and ternary pt based catalysts 141 142 ag doped tio2 powder coated surface was successfully synthesized using impregnation method and the catalyst showed high photocatalytic activity to inactivate the pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus subtilis 143 chemical vapor deposition cvd synthesizes relatively pure long lasting and uniform nanoparticles 144 tio2 thin films are commonly prepared using the cvd technique 145 the cvd method allows the fabrication of coated catalyst beads which showed higher catalytic activity than the bare catalyst this approach combines the synthesis of the catalyst and coating of the catalyst with suitable nanoparticles in a facile and one pot synthetic process 146 the cvd method successfully utilizes titanium isopropoxide to obtain the tio2 thin films the influence of the substrate temperatures and resulting film properties are extensively studied 147 recently plasma assisted cvd processes using metal organic precursors have gained attention due to their potential to decrease deposition temperatures thus offering the possibilities to coat temperature sensitive substrates 148 ag tio2 and pt tio2 photocatalysts were synthesized using the cvd method the catalyst was then successfully utilized in the photocatalytic degradation of salicylic acid 149 the ag and pt were successfully deposited on the surface of anatase tio2 physical vapor deposition describes a variety of vacuum deposition methods that are utilized to synthesize thin film coatings the physical vapor deposition method involves transitions from a condensed phase to a vapor phase and back to a thin film condensed phase sputtering and evaporation are the two most common physical vapor deposition methods 150 physical vapor deposition involves the following steps i sputtering evaporation of various components to create a vapor phase ii supersaturation of the vapor phase in an inert atmosphere to increase the condensation of metal nanoparticles and iii thermal treatment in an inert atmosphere to consolidate the nanocomposite 151 ag tio2 heterojunction was obtained by combining physical vapor deposition and bifunctional surface modifiers the photocatalytic activity of tio2 combined with the spherical ag nanoparticles showed excellent electron acceptor abilities the material is efficient in the photoinduced degradation of a cationic organic micropollutant methylene blue under uv vis light 152 table 1 summarises the advantages and disadvantages of various synthetic methods of the materials 4 plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts for efficient degradation of micropollutants when a photon having energy hυ greater than or equal to the tio2 band gap energy is illuminated onto the photocatalyst s surface an electron jumps from the ground state to the excited state i e from vb to the cb thus photonic excitation generates an electron hole pair by leaving empty unfilled holes in the vb the noble metal nanoparticles generate the said spr effect on the absorption of light radiation the nanoparticles then stimulate the localization of the electric field nearby tio2 which facilitates the generation of electron hole pairs in the vicinity of the tio2 surface 179 noble metals trap the newly generated electrons and allow them for further reactions to generate peroxide radical followed by hydroxyl radical peroxide radicals are formed at the cb through the reaction of free electrons and oxygen in the presence of water in contrast oh radicals are formed at the vb through the reaction of the h2o and oxygen both the radicals then interact with the micropollutant molecules which results in the degradation of the micropollutant molecules 113 180 181 fig 8 depicts the photocatalytic removal of micropollutants utilizing a plasmonic assisted tio2 photocatalyst photocatalytic degradation of micropollutant molecules is a highly efficient advanced oxidation process which enables perhaps complete mineralization of micropollutant molecules to its end products i e co2 and h2o further the presence of water produces active species in response to light illumination and electron hole pair recombination hinders attaining high photocatalytic efficiency the attack of the produced active species on the micropollutant molecules breaks down the pollutant molecules into smaller fragments eventually leading to total mineralization one of the important characteristics of heterogeneous photocatalysts is their photon energy adsorbing nature which increases the degradation efficiency the adsorbed micropollutant molecules at the photocatalyst s surface are readily attacked by the active radical species and cause for mineralization of micropollutants the repeated cycles of operations provide enhanced efficiency of the catalyst several techniques enable the identification of the by products and reaction pathways to understand the photocatalytic process at molecular levels the absorption spectra are commonly employed to monitor the degradation process the complete mineralization of the contaminants is assessed using the total organic carbon toc data or partly with the total chemical oxygen demand cod 182 several micropollutants such as phenol polychlorinated bisphenols organophosphorus and organochlorine compounds are efficiently degraded using the plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts in the photocatalytic processes 183 184 the dyes are widely used in pharmaceutical and industrial enterprises and effluent of these industries contains high concentrations of dyes which ultimately reach the water bodies 46 185 numerous approaches are demonstrated to improve light absorption capabilities in tio2 in both the uv and visible regions 101 186 plasmonic noble metal doped tio2 photocatalysts permit a more efficient harnessing of visible light reducing electron hole pair recombination in the semiconductor ag and au nanoparticles exhibit excellent light absorption capacity and produce a strong electromagnetic field due to the lspr effect hot electrons are highly energetic and not in thermal equilibrium 187 as illustrated in fig 9 a and b the schottky junction is formed by the close contact between plasmonic nanoparticles and tio2 from which hot electrons are transferred once after crossing the energy barrier 188 4 1 use of au doped tio2 in the photocatalytic elimination of various micropollutants the photocatalytic performance of tio2 with au sio2 nanorods au sio2 nanostars and au sio2 nanospheres was compared in the breakdown of rhodamine b the composite materials showed substantial improvement in the photocatalytic performance in removing rhodamine b the electromagnetic field was created near the au nanostars spikes which led to a high density of hot electrons near the metal semiconductor interface and synergized the photocatalytic activity in addition theoretical studies revealed that the au nanostars possess enhanced photochemical response primarily due to additional hot spots as a result the anisotropic au nanostars produce chemical energy from the solar light source more efficiently 110 the semiconductor superstructures facilitating the electron migration injected from noble metal nanoparticles for improved photocatalytic efficiency were long debated bian et al synthesized a plasmonic au mesoporous tio2 photocatalyst with au nanoparticles on the mesoporous tio2 base plane and assessed the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue using the photocatalyst 189 the photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalyst was compared with that of typical photocatalyst au mesotio2 pd au p25 and au nanotio2 the reaction kinetics of electrons transported from au nanoparticles to mesoporous tio2 were examined using time resolved drs diffuse reflectance spectroscopy the electrons moved to active sites from the base surface lying at the margins of plate like tio2 mesocrystals a large number of electrons are transported from au nanoparticles to mesoporous tio2 due to the lspr excitations and their life was extended due to the anisotropic electron flow from the centre to the edge which improves the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst the degradation reaction was carried out using monochromatic visible light irradiation 9 6 mw cm2 intensity it was determined that the lspr effect due to the presence of au np synergizes the micropollutant degradation the photocatalytic efficiency of au meso tio2 in visible light was obtained to be 10 times higher than that of au mesotio2 pd au p25 and au nanotio2 photocatalysts in addition the au meso tio2 system had a much shorter duration of electron accumulation 5 6 min than the au meso tio2 pd system separated electrons showed a longer lifetime i e 10 ns which is much longer compared to other photocatalytic processes this research showed that semiconductor superstructures greatly aid plasmonic electron migration 189 rgo au nps m tio2 hybrid shell nanocomposite was prepared using the sol gel method utilizing silica as a template 190 rhodamine b rhb degraded in the photocatalytic process under visible light and uv light irradiations the higher photocatalytic efficacy of the photocatalyst is responsible for the hybrid shells synergistic effects of adsorptive catalytic plasmonic and porous nature the electron hole pairs in m tio2 are separated by uv light irradiation the photoexcited charge carriers oxidize the dye molecules by highly reducing and oxidizing species graphene captures and transports electrons allowing the charge carriers to separate graphene also improves the dye molecules adsorption capability on the photocatalyst s surface under uv light irradiation au nanoparticles operate as co catalysts separating the charge carriers and enhancing photocatalytic efficiency the visible light irradiation causes the lspr effect with the au nanoparticles and excites the hot electrons to be injected into the tio2 conduction band due to their inherent electrical properties these electrons are transported to rgo simultaneously fig s3 depicts the apparent reaction rate constant under simulated daylight irradiation and visible light during the photocatalytic operations the au tio2 is prepared by the sol gel method and the catalyst is active under visible light irradiations the optical absorption and uv visible diffuse reflection spectra drs revealed that a new energy level lower than 3 2 ev was obtained in the au au3 tio2 nanostructure which promotes light absorption toward the lower energy region of the electromagnetic radiation thus energy corresponding to visible light is adequate to excite the photocatalyst as the band gap energy was reduced e 3 2 ev further methylene blue was taken as a model micropollutant and was treated under 110 w visible light the photocatalytic degradation allowed the removal of toc to 73 6 using 0 5 au3 tio2 78 the reactivity of the plasmonic au tio2 photocatalyst was tailored using bio based chitosan fibre fabricated by adopting an ionic gelation process 191 the au tio2 fibre is highly efficient for removing methylene blue metronidazole and carbofuran within 250 min of operation under 25 w visible light the xps analysis illustrates the concurrent occurrence of two valences ti4 and ti3 on the tio2 surface some ti4 exists on the surface of chitosan fibre after photocatalysis the remaining ti4 activates the h2o2 under light irradiation which leads to the formation of oh radical and is again reduced to ti3 thus the interconversion of ti4 and ti3 through the h2o2 or au nps enhances the surface charge immobilization the degradation curve and breakdown rate in the degradation of metronidazole and carbofuran are depicted in fig s4 the catalytic activity of plasmonic materials depends partly on the size and shape of noble metal particles in the bulk substrate fabricating of au nanoparticles tio2 hybrid films on ti wires using the electrochemical method was demonstrated the efficiency of the fabricated material was studied by treating methyl orange dye the percent degradation with tio2 nanotubes au tio2 au tio2 tio2 au tio2 and au tio2 were reported to be 39 2 68 1 39 2 and 17 0 respectively after 30 min of irradiation the increased catalytic activity of the hybrid material was due to the reduced size of the au particles as a result the surface area to volume ratio was increased enhancing the separation of electron and hole additionally the au nanoparticles exhibit electro catalysis oxidation properties for biological and organic species 192 sol gel dip coating method was adopted to fabricate the au tio2 thin films and the thin film was utilized under sunlight for photocatalytic phenol degradation 193 the au 1 2 doped with tio2 caused significantly increased the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst by 2 2 3 times greater than that of the bare tio2 under sunlight irradiation further adding 1 2 au with tio2 results in a shifting of absorption wavelength from 340 nm to 450 nm from uv to visible region moreover concerning the electron transfer process at the surface of tio2 and the interfacial contact between gold nanoparticles on tio2 the interaction is not an ohmic type but a schottky barrier type as a result the excited electron moves to the noble metal through the conduction band of tio2 induced by an electric field facilitating the surface charge separation this reduces the rate of electron hole recombination and further increases the photocatalytic efficacy of the nanocomposite catalyst the au nanopillars tio2 thin film was fabricated by the facile sol gel template synthetic method 181 the fine grains of tio2 were distributed smoothly over the borosilicate glass substrate forming uniform nanopillars of tio2 the doped au nanoparticles size ranged from 5 to 10 nm the nanocomposite material was highly efficient in the photocatalytic elimination of tetracycline 113 and alizarin yellow gg 181 further the study s insights showed that the oh singlet oxygen and photogenerated holes are mainly involved in the photocatalytic breakdown of these micropollutants mono cu ag

cu and 1 5 wt for ag and au under irradiation using simulated sunlight ag and au doped tio2 exhibited greater photocatalytic efficiency than cu doped tio2 the bi metallic nanocomposite synergizes the process as a co catalyst under uv light irradiations however the photocatalytic efficiency was reduced under sunlight irradiation mass spectra reveal that the reaction proceeds through three different pathways the first reaction path involves the breaking of the nh so2 bond sn bond dissociation energy 111 0 kcal mol to form 3 amino 5 methyl isoxazole m z 98 and sulfanilic acid m z 173 the second reaction pathway involves breaking the isoxazole ring induced by breaking the nc bond forming 5 methyl isoxazole m z 83 and sulfanilamide m z 172 the third reaction pathway involves hydroxylation of the sulfamethoxazole identifying the by products and toxicity study revealed that even though 100 mineralization was not attained under sunlight irradiation the residual by products are non toxic and showed restricted biocide activity 194 fig 10 depicts the pseudo first order rate kinetics in the breakdown of sulfamethoxazole using various metal au ag and cu loading in mono metallic materials au pd alloy was impregnated with the tio2 using a photo deposition method resulting in the au pd tio2 nanotube the impregnated au pd tio2 possesses an improved photooxidation efficiency in malathion degradation the improved photocatalytic efficiency was due to the efficient electron hole separation and enhanced rate of h2o2 formation 195 au loaded tio2 nanotube arrays synthesized by the electrochemical anodic oxidation method followed by a photo deposition showed efficient elimination of rhodamine b under photocatalytic operations utilizing sunlight irradiation using au 0 4 wt tio2 photocatalyst the degradation rate constant of rhodamine b was 0 3672 h 1 which is 1 4 times higher than the pure tio2 0 2634 h 1 it was found that both oh and holes are taking part in the oxidation of rhodamine b fluorescence study revealed that the hydroxyl radicals are generated under the illumination of a xenon lamp the fluorescence emission spectra confirmed the generation of the photoexcited electrons the study provides valuable insights and the reaction center s conformational and functional probe light activating the photocatalysts produces electrons and holes and some of the electrons and holes recombine and produce energy by undergoing fluorescence emission laser fluorescence emission intensity infers a decreased rate of recombination of electron hole pairs 196 chansa et al reported the fabrication of tio2 tio2 doped gold nanorods aunrs and tio2 doped gold nanospheres aunss using nucleation and growth method and the catalyst was used for photocatalytic degradation of orange16 dye 197 a comparative study in photocatalytic degradation of the dye showed that the removal efficiency followed the order tio2 tio2 doped aunss tio2 doped aunrs the higher degradation efficiency of the tio2 doped aunrs compared to the tio2 doped aunss is due to the involvement of both transverse and longitudinal peaks of the aunrs in the photon absorption process and a significant enhancement of the electromagnetic field interestingly bare tio2 tio2 doped with aunss and aunrs showed the percentage photodegradation of dye as 0 82 79 24 and 86 65 respectively within 120 min of irradiation a green synthesis was followed to obtain a visible light active nanocomposite au tio2 modified with reduced graphene oxide rgo biofilm and ag2cro4 198 the quaternary ag2cro4 tio2 au rgo nanocomposite biofilm was synthesized using a simple impregnation method which was then reduced in situ in the presence of acacia gum further the removal of methylene blue was examined under visible light irradiation to study the photocatalytic efficiency of the nanocomposite photocatalyst the ag2cro4 tio2 au rgo heterostructures degraded the dye at a rate of 97 in 52 min which was 3 1 6 5 and 10 8 times faster than ag2cro4 tio2 au biofilm ag2cro4 tio2 and ag2cro4 respectively moreover the photoelectrochemical tests revealed that the representative biofilm possesses higher photocatalytic activity fig 11 depicts methylene blue degradation s mechanistic insights with the band position of ag2cro4 tio2 au rgo hybrid biofilm a ternary plasmonic photocatalyst au tio2 g c3n4 enabled an improved photocatalytic efficiency in the elimination of bisphenol a bpa and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp under uv visible light irradiations 199 the quantity of g c3n4 and nanocrystalline tio2 was optimized for greater photocatalytic activity further enhanced by doping plasmonic au nanoparticles compared to the g c3n4 and tio2 the doping of au nanoparticles enhanced the photocatalytic activity by increasing the degradation rate by 3 1 and 5 11 times for bpa and 2 4 dcp respectively the lspr and catalytic effects of au nanoparticles in the nanocomposite are summarised in fig 12 using the solvothermal approach the au and ag nanoparticles were successfully doped within the pores of tio2 101 under visible light and solar irradiations the photocatalytic activity of the plasmonic tio2 was examined using the azo dyes eliminations remazol red acid orange 10 congo red and methyl orange the bare tio2 showed lower photocatalytic efficiency than tio2 doped with plasmonic nanoparticles when exposed to light au ag nanoparticles perform as co catalysts trapping electrons from the conduction band of tio2 the metal nanoparticles show fermi levels which are shifted to the negative potential and the resultant interfacial charge transfer process is greatly enhanced thus the number of holes in tio2 increases and the density of electrons in metal nanoparticles increases facilitating the breakdown of azo dyes moreover the au tio2 catalyst showed about two times higher photocatalytic efficiency than the ag tio2 catalyst this is because au 5 1 ev has a greater work function than ag 4 7 ev allowing for effective charge carrier separation similarly the bimetallic au ag nanoparticles were decorated onto a porous aerogel tio2 photocatalyst and employed in the photocatalytic elimination of salicylic acid sa under visible light irradiation a highly intense plasmonic effect was obtained resulting in an increase in photocatalytic efficiency compared to the monometallic decorated tio2 photocatalyst 200 the au tio2 nanohybrids prepared using the hydrothermal method showed ca 95 methylene blue dye degradation within 100 min under uv irradiation 30 w 201 choi et al reported the synthesis of fe3o4 tio2 au nanocomposite using a sol gel process 202 fe3o4 tio2 au has shown an improved electron hole pairs separation induced by the charge transfer of the inter particle or energy transfer between au and tio2 the material was used to remove 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and 97 7 was degraded within 40 min of irradiation under 150 w visible light xe lamp due to the magnetic property of core fe3o4 particles the fe3o4 tio2 au is easily separated by applying an external magnetic field table 2 summarises numerous photocatalysts used for the variety of micropollutants removal using the plasmonic au doped tio2 photocatalysts 4 2 use of ag doped tio2 in the photocatalytic elimination of various micropollutants the ag tio2 nanocomposite with plasmonic ag nanowires impregnated with tio2 nanoparticles was previously synthesized 231 because of the lspr effect the hot electrons are transported through the interface hence the nanocomposite exhibited high photocatalytic efficacy in degrading the methylene blue under solar light illumination under visible light irradiation the lspr effect is predominant in the oxidation of several organic dyes and micropollutants such as methyl orange 4 chlorophenol phenol and tetracycline with ag tio2 photocatalysts 232 233 ag decorated with s tio2 x nanorods was synthesized using in situ solid state chemical reduction and photo deposition the nanocomposite showed good crystallinity reduced band gap and was efficient with visible and near infrared light excitations the synergistic effect was obtained due to the s doping self doping of ti3 and the ag nanoparticles further the lspr effect is attributed to the high photocatalytic efficiency of nanocomposite in the elimination of phenol and the mechanism is illustrated in fig 13 234 to explore the photocatalytic efficiency of a ternary ag tio2 nanocomposite coated over three dimensional activated carbon nanotubes acnt degradation removal of organic micropollutants was carried out using the nanocomposite material the acnt possesses a large surface area which enables an enhanced exposure of light irradiations and adsorption of organic contaminants onto the catalyst surface further the photocatalytic process showed an almost complete breakdown of rhodamine 6g 235 the reusability stability of the plasmonic photocatalysts was improved by forming composites with highly magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 this photocatalyst with magneto plasmonic was utilized to eliminate rhodamine 6g rh6g in textile effluent 236 the activity of the ternary au ag tio2 fe3o4 photocatalyst showed ca four times better efficiency than that of the unmodified tio2 photocatalyst furthermore the photocatalyst was recycled up to five times without losing its photocatalytic efficiency yun et al synthesized the ag tio2 nanorods using the sol gel synthetic method photocatalytic degradation of acid red 44 using the ag tio2 nanorods was performed using eis electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cv cyclic voltammetry methods and the efficiency was compared with the tio2 nanorods and nanospheres ag tio2 nanorods showed enhanced electrochemical behavior including fast electron transfer to the electrode due to ag nps doped titania furthermore the electron hole recombination is suppressed significantly due to the delocalization of electrons at the nanorods which synergizes the catalytic process therefore the photocatalytic efficacy of ag tio2 was increased for the removal of acid red 44 90 of the dye was removed using 0 1 g of ag tio2 nanocomposite under uv light 300 w for 45 min 79 ag tio2 was synthesized using the green deposition method and the catalyst was efficiently utilized for the inactivation of bacteria and removing methylene blue the biogenic ag nps were deposited on the tio2 surface further ag nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed onto the tio2 surface as a result intense schottky junctions were formed between ag and tio2 further reducing the electron hole separation the photocatalytic process removed ca 90 of methylene blue in just 40 min of irradiation 237 the wet impregnation synthesized plasmonic ag tio2 photocatalyst was employed remove methyl red dye the average size of the particle for both tio2 and ag doped tio2 was determined to be 2 μm using 1 g l dosage of ag tio2 methyl red dye was degraded 99 under 16 w a uv light for 45 min further the breakdown process was analyzed in the absence or occurrence of atmospheric oxygen the degradation efficiency was significantly less in the absence of oxygen signifying that oxygen is involved in the mechanism of the photocatalytic breakdown process 238 highly efficient heterogeneous plasmonic ag doped tio2 was prepared using the ultrasonic assisted sol gel method to purify wastewater contaminated with different aromatic micropollutants especially chlorinated substances 2 4 6 trichlorophenol was taken as a model micropollutant and treated under an 8 w uv a light source the results specified that the photocatalytic efficiency of ag tio2 ag content below 1 0 wt was significantly higher than that of the bare tio2 ag deposits on the tio2 surface and perform as active sites where the accumulation of electrons takes place improved separation of holes and electrons on the doped tio2 surface permits greater effective channeling of the charge carriers for efficient oxidation and reduction reactions rather than recombination reactions 95 of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol was removed using ag tio2 catalyst within 120 min and ca 80 of the micropollutant was mineralized the degradation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol proceeds through chlorine release pathways i e dechlorination 64 a highly efficient ag tio2 composite exhibits 100 removal efficiency in the degradation of chloramphenicol sol gel method and photo deposition method were applied for synthesizing the nanocomposite material the tem image of the solid showed that 2 10 nm ag nanoparticles were dispersed on the tio2 surface it was observed that ag loading of 0 96 wt was the optimal doping amount to attain the highest efficiency of chloramphenicol degradation further using ag tio2 0 96 wt ag 88 of toc was removed after 120 mins of treatment 239 ag doped hollow tio2 nanospheres ag h tio2 were obtained using the sol gel method 240 the ag nanoparticles were doped with the host tio2 in its interstitial sites the tio2 in the ag h tio2 nanocomposite possesses the anatase phase and is highly crystalline compared to solid tio2 nanoparticles the surface area of hollow ag h tio2 nanoparticles was increased significantly to 103 2 m2 g the quantum yield with ag h tio2 nanoparticles was also improved by 18 7 compared to bare tio2 solid the elimination of nitrobenzene and metronidazole by the

methyl orange under uv and solar light irradiations further ca 65 4 removal efficiency was achieved after 120 min of light irradiation using a 350 w uv light the improved photocatalytic activity of ag tio2 was attributed to the plasmonic absorption by the silver nanoparticles the degradation of methyl orange using ag tio2 nanocomposites followed langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order kinetic model 241 ag tio2 nanofibers fabricated using electrospinning method the material is effective in the removal of phenol under visible light irradiation the response surface method rsm designed the

catalyst dosage the square of phenol concentration and the interaction of ph and phenol concentration substantially influence phenol degradation the degradation percentage was reported to be higher at higher ph ph 8 this is attributed to the higher concentrations of hydroxyl ions at higher ph values favoring the degradation percentage at an optimized photocatalyst 2 06 g l 92 9 of phenol was degraded under visible light irradiation 242 fabrication of ag doped tio2 nanowire arrays graphene oxide coated with carbon fibre composite ag tio2nas gocf using a simple self template method was reported elsewhere the composite material was highly effective for degrading tetracycline hydrochloride under visible and uv light the increased photocatalytic activity of the composite material was attributed to the presence of graphene oxide the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of tio2 are transferred to the graphene oxide these photogenerated electrons on the graphene oxide surface reacted with oxygen molecules in the presence of water and formed superoxide anion radical o2 ˉ this superoxide anion radical then interacted with h to form hydroxyl radical oh hydroxyl radical further oxidized the tetracycline molecules and led to the degradation of the micropollutant molecules 243 the plasmonic ag np tio2 thin film was fabricated using the synthetic sol gel template method tio2 fine grains were distributed finely over the borosilicate glass surface forming a uniform ag0 np tio2 thin film and the size of the particles ranged from 10 to 15 nm the

was prepared using a one step hydrothermal process which showed 100 removal efficiency in the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b within 120 min of irradiation under uv light uv vis absorption spectra displayed that the deposition of ag onto tio2 showed a significant redshift compared to the pristine tio2 which results in increased photocatalytic efficiency for rhodamine b degradation 212 mustafa et al reported ag doped ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 ag d nzf as an alternative plasmonic photocatalyst having comparable efficiency as ag doped tio2 244 10 mg of ag d nzf degraded 99 of metronidazole antibiotic within 360 min at ph 3 further ag d nzf demonstrated bactericidal effects against bacterial strains after 65 min table 3 summarises the numerous photocatalysts used to eliminate several potential micropollutants in an aqueous medium using the plasmonic ag doped tio2 4 3 photocatalytic efficiency of plasmonic pd doped tio2 photocatalysts the atomic layer deposition method fabricated a plasmonic pd tio2 photocatalyst 291 the photocatalyst s active site densities were measured resulting in variations of the lspr effect the photocatalyst removed methylene blue and 2 4d a pesticide under visible and uv vis light the highest removal rate was obtained with 2 7 percentage weight of pd nanoparticles loading therefore the plasmonic effect is crucial in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency of noble metal doped tio2 photocatalyst in degrading organic contaminants due to their broad solar radiation absorption anisotropic nanoparticles of pd with tio2 showed greater attention in research fig 16 depicts the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and 2 4 d degradation using pd tio2 under uv vis and visible light the results pave the way for developing and designing low cost highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts that are excited with solar radiations to achieve optimum photocatalytic efficiency the impregnation method synthesized pd tio2 chitosan cs photocatalyst it was then successfully utilized for breaking down methylene blue under visible light irradiation xrd patterns of the pd tio2 cs tio2 cs pd tio2 tio2 and cs showed that in all the composite materials tio2 possessed the anatase phase which validates no apparent effect on the crystallizing process of tio2 upon adding cs cs facilitates the crystallization and further the xrd patterns reveal that characteristic diffraction peaks are widened and result in a decrease in diffraction peak intensity fig s5 the tio2 nanoparticles in the absence of cs exhibited very high agglomeration further pd tio2 without cs exhibited very high agglomeration on the other hand pd tio2 with cs exhibited an even distribution of pd within the tio2 pd tio2 cs showed very high photocatalytic degradation efficiency compared to other composite materials further 99 5 of methylene blue 75 mg l was degraded using pd tio2 cs photocatalyst within 30 min of irradiation 292 the influence of tio2 doped with shape

oxalic acid was much higher than the bare tio2 p25 almost 100 removal efficiency was achieved for the micropollutants using the pd tio2 catalyst under 2 h of uv irradiation in contrast the removal efficiency was much reduced with the bare tio2 p25 the primary degradation by products of the phenol are benzene 1 3 diol resorcinol res benzene 1 2 diol pyrocatechol py and benzene 1 4 diol hydroquinone hq the quantity of the breakdown intermediates was maximum in the case of pd cubic comprising nanocomposites while the maximum ratio of toxic intermediates was given by the pd spherical composite table 4 summarises numerous photocatalysts for micropollutant degradation using the plasmonic pd doped tio2 photocatalysts 4 4 photocatalytic efficiency of plasmonic pt doped tio2 photocatalysts pt doped tio2 photocatalyst was fabricated using sol gel and photo reductive deposition methods the catalyst showed high photocatalytic efficiency in removing methyl orange 293 the optimum doping amount of pt was found to be 1 5 wt giving a higher degradation percentage of 86 2 under 500 w uv light irradiation for 30 min the decolorization rate was enhanced with an increase in the concentration of h2o2 from 0 4 to 2 mm l a maximum decolorization was attained at 1 2 mm l and then declined with increased h2o2 concentration h2o2 favored the formation of oh radicals and thus photocatalytic activity was increased however further increase in h2o2 scavenged the oh and thus the degradation reaction was hindered therefore only a moderate amount of h2o2 is useful to attain a higher degradation rate pt modified tio2 nanotube arrays ntas with controlled deposition and better visible light photocatalytic activity were synthesized using the uv light photoreduction method 294 the uv light induced photoreduction enabled uniform deposition of pt nanoparticles onto the tio2 nanotubes using h2ptcl6 as a precursor the photocatalytic action of the material was examined using methyl orange dye the visible light irradiation strikes the photocatalyst electron hole pairs are generated in pt nanoparticles because of the surface plasmon resonance and the presence of pt showed the schottky barrier at metal and semiconductor heterojunction which hindered the recombination of charge carriers significantly and allowed smooth interfacial charge transfer reactions as a result the pt tio2 ntas show enhanced visible light stimulated photocatalytic efficiency using pt tio2 ntas under irradiation with visible light 250 w for 2 h methyl orange s removal rate reached 84 27 solar light stimulated photocatalytic degradation of acetaminophen using pt doped tio2 and bare tio2 was studied elsewhere 295 the one pot photo deposition fabricated pt doped tio2 nanocomposite showed 80 photodegradation of acetaminophen within 90 min irradiation while only 63 was removed with bare tio2 under similar experimental conditions mass spectrometry study reveals that twenty one degradation

bimetallic au ag doped tio2 nanomaterial fabricated by sol immobilization method showed a very high percentage removal of tetracycline with up to 80 under visible light irradiation within 120 min and the removal efficiency was further improved to 90 under the dynamic system 296 the electron spin resonance esr technique enabled the identification of active radical species utilizing dmpo as a spin trapping agent without visible light esr signals were not detected indicating that no photocatalytic activity occurred in the absence of light irradiation however strong signals for dmpo o2 and dmpo oh were observed which indicated the presence of oh and o2 active radicals in the degradation process various reactive oxygen species ros like oh oh2 and o2 were detected utilizing the fluorescence spectroscopic study using 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da the free radicals react with dcfh da and lead to dichlorofluorescein dcf generation the dcf is detected with a fluorescence spectrophotometer it is revealed that all the composite photocatalysts with dcfh da exhibited a notable peak at 525 nm after 15 min of treatment this inferred the generation of ros the fluorescence intensity for dcf was observed to be in the order of au0 1ag0 9 tio2 au1 tio2 ag1 tio2 tio2 which confirmed that the bimetallic au0 1ag0 9 tio2 nanocomposite efficiently enhance the generation of ros fabrication of aupd nanoparticles decorated tio2 nanobelts using potentiostatic anodization electrodeposition method was performed and the catalyst degraded the potential antibiotic levofloxacin efficiently using solar light the au pd tio2 removed ca 95 of antibiotic levofloxacin after 60 min irradiation under simulated solar light further it was concluded that oh o2 and h2o2 are the main active species degrading the levofloxacin in an aqueous medium 297 gołąbiewska et al synthesized the tio2 decorated with pt au bimetallic nanoparticles using the sol gel process 298 the nanocomposite showed high photocatalytic efficiency in removing the phenol moreover the bimetallic pt au loaded tio2 exhibited a significantly higher removal percentage of phenol than bare tio2 under 1000 w xenon lamp visible light however if the weight percentage of au is too high in the pt au bimetallic system the photocatalytic degradation efficiency decreases significantly further it was also concluded that only the pt played a crucial role in the photocatalytic breakdown process the proposed mechanism for transferring excited electrons from pt au nps to tio2 is represented in fig 18 table 6 summarises numerous photocatalysts for micropollutants degradation using the plasmonic bimetallic loaded tio2 photocatalysts further table 7 summarises the comparison of characterization of various
