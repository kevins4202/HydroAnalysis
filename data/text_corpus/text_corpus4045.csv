20225,in this paper we consider trajectory tracking control for autonomous surface vehicles asvs with unknown boundary model uncertainties and external disturbances the neural networks nns and the sliding mode control smc with a switched adaptive law are combined for the first time the nns are used to approximate model uncertainties and external disturbances of asvs the parameters of the robust smc term first increase until the sliding variable reaches a quasi sliding mode which bound is associated with the parameter of the barrier function bf then the bf is selected as the parameter of the robust term for the smc strategy to estimate the nn approximation error and to constrain the sliding variable inside the predefined quasi sliding mode one salient feature of our approach is that the robust control parameter is no more than approximation error of nns in sliding and steady phases of smc simulation studies are performed to illustrate the advantage of the proposed control method keywords adaptive sliding mode control smc barrier function bf neural networks nns autonomous surface vehicles asvs 1 introduction the autonomous surface vehicles asvs have attracted much attention for various missions such as ocean surveillance rescue and military tasks vehicle navigation can be classified into three basic problems tracking a reference trajectory following a path and point stabilization fierro and lewis 1998 for the path following control of surface vehicles the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path that is specified without a temporal law aguiar and hespanha 2007 zheng and sun 2016 xiang et al 2017 ghommam et al 2018 the line of sight guidance law is commonly used for path following of asvs fossen et al 2003 another tremendous practical application of the asvs is to automatically track a time varying trajectory in the application the goal is to make the state of the asv follow a reference or desired trajectory however the efficient tracking control design for asvs is still a challenge problem for engineers and researchers due to the complex dynamics for the ocean vehicles such as parameter variation and environmental disturbances wang and han 2018 wu et al 2018 qiao and zhang 2019 yu et al 2019 hu et al 2020 hence the main purpose of the present paper is to propose a method to design controllers which achieves a trajectory tracking objective for asvs affected by model uncertainties and external disturbances which are bounded with unknown boundary the sliding mode control smc is a very effective robust control method due to its attractive properties including simple in control design and robust in parameter variations and disturbances edwards and spurgeon 1998 yu et al 2020 there are some significant results for the control of physical systems by using the smc method ding et al 2020 du et al 2019 hou et al 2020 in the past few years the smc approach has been used to the trajectory tracking control of ocean vehicles for example see yan and yu 2018 and hao et al 2020 however the upper bounds of the matched model uncertainties and external disturbances should be assumed to be known previously before using the equivalent smc utkin 2013 hence most smc methods for ocean vehicles are designed with the assumption that the upper bounds of the model uncertainties and external disturbances should be known nevertheless in practical applications the upper bounds are not constants and often unknown by using a dynamical adaptation of the control gain the adaptive smc methods are used to establish the sliding mode in finite time without a requirement to know the upper bound of the disturbances plestan et al 2010 the barrier function bf can reach infinity while its arguments approaching the boundaries of constraints by incorporating a bf in adaptive backstepping design the constraints for the systems are not violated ngo et al 2005 tee et al 2009 he et al 2016 by adding a bf to the adaptive smc law the sliding variable can be maintained in a predefined neighborhood of zero without knowing the upper bound of disturbances obeid et al 2018 in addition the bf based adaptive method is applied to the super twisting systems obeid et al 2020 and higher order smc systems obeid et al 2021 laghrouche et al 2021 as another kind of adaptation strategy neural networks nns are used to approximate model uncertainties and external disturbances in trajectory tracking control of systems lewis et al 1996 wang and huang 2005 sun et al 2011 mu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 the neural network nn is a useful tool in the adaptive control due to its learning ability to approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions the smc of the nn via event triggered algorithm time delay and quantization is given in sun et al 2020 and wang et al 2020 adaptive neural control with the compensations of modeling uncertainties and external disturbances is developed in he et al 2016 and rout et al 2020 to guarantee tracking performances for ocean vessels the nn is adopted to approximate the complex hydrodynamics and differential of desired tracking velocities of underwater vehicles in zhang et al 2020 in cui et al 2017 adaptive critic based nn controllers are proposed for asvs in this paper we consider the design of a bf based adaptive smc law for trajectory tracking control of asvs which are subject to model uncertainties and external disturbances with unknown boundary the bf based adaptive nn smc strategy is composed of an equivalent smc law a nn and a switched adaptive law for the parameter of robust smc term the radial basis function rbf nn is used to approximate the model uncertainties and external disturbances the robust control parameter increases first until the sliding variable reaches a quasi sliding mode region then a bf is selected as the parameter of the robust control term to estimate the nn approximation error and to prevent the sliding variable from steering out of the quasi sliding mode region compared with other nn smc approaches the adaptive law is switched according to the amplitude of the sliding variable then the parameter of the robust smc term is no more than the approximation error of the nn in the sliding and steady phases of the smc the sliding variable and the tracking errors can converge to a bounded region related to the parameter of the bf at last comparative simulations with the bf based smc scheme are given using an asv to show the superiority of the bf based adaptive nn smc strategy this paper is organized as follows the dynamics of the asv the definition of the bf and the rbf nn are described in section 2 the controller design and stability analysis are given in section 3 simulation results are provided in section 4 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 system dynamics and preliminaries 2 1 kinematic and dynamic model of the asv the dynamics of the asv are described by fossen 2002 1 η

y r n v i z is the moment of inertia about the yaw rotation c 13 ν m y v ν m x g y r c 23 ν m x u d 11 ν x u x u u u d 22 ν y v y v v v y r v r d 23 ν y r y v r v y r r r d 32 ν n v n v v v n r v r d 33 ν n r n v r v n r r r and the coefficients x y n are hydrodynamic parameters skjetne et al 2004 note that the rotation matrix has the properties r ψ t r ψ i and r ψ i where represents the 2 norm of a matrix or a vector the matrices c and d in 1 are considered as the unknown parts of the asv dynamics let c 0 and d 0 be the nominal values of c and d we have c δ c c 0 and d δ d d 0 where δ c and δ d are the uncertain parts of c and d respectively then the dynamic equations of the asv in 1 can be written in the following form 2 η r ψ ν m ν c 0 ν ν d 0 ν ν τ δ c ν ν δ d ν ν d t in this paper the control objective is to develop a control input vector τ such that actual position vector of the asv in 1 with unknown bounded model uncertainties and disturbances can track the desired trajectory vector η d t exactly the following assumptions are made for system 2 assumption 1 lewis et al 1996 the upper bound of the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances is unknown that is there exists a constant l such that δ c ν ν δ d ν ν d t l but l is not known assumption 2 the reference signal η d t η d t and η d t are smooth and bounded 2 2 barrier function bf in this paper we consider the positive semi definite bf with obeid et al 2018 3 k b z z ε z where ε 0 is the parameter of the bf from 3 we can obtain k b 0 0 and the property k b z as z approaches ε the plot of function k b z is shown in fig 1 where z ε and z ε are vertical asymptotes 2 3 rbf nn rbf nns are nns that use rbf as the activation functions let u x be a compact set of r a let f x be a smooth function from r a to r b define w r l b by the ideal weight matrix of the nn with the number of neurons in a hidden layer l then as long as x is restricted in u x the nonlinear function f x with x r a can be approximated by the rbf nn as lewis et al 1996 4 f x w t ϕ x δ where x r a is the input vector ϕ x ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x ϕ l x t and δ δ 1 δ 2 δ b t is the network reconstruction error vector in addition one can find a nn such that δ δ n holds for any choice of a positive constant δ n in u x let ϕ j x be the gaussian function then we have 5 ϕ j x exp x μ j 2 2 σ 2 j 1 2 l where μ j μ j 1 μ j 2 μ j a t is the center of the gaussian function and σ 0 is the width of the gaussian function noting that w is unknown we need to estimate w online let w ˆ be the estimation of w we will design an adaptive law to update w ˆ in the next section assumption 3 the ideal weights are bounded by known positive values so that w f w m 3 bf based adaptive nn smc design with modeling uncertainties and disturbances this section will give the design of a bf based adaptive nn smc law the block diagram of the control system is shown in fig 2 where η x y ψ t is the position and posture vector ν u v r t is the velocity vector and τ is control input let η d t and ν d t denote the desired position and velocity vectors respectively the nn is used to approximate the modeling uncertainties and the external disturbances the nn output is denoted as f ˆ let s be the designed sliding variable note that the smc law τ in fig 1 is composed of the equivalent control term τ e q and the robust control term τ s which will be introduced later we define the tracking errors by 6 e 1 η η d t e 2 η η d t noting r r s with s 0 r 0 r 0 0 0 0 0 and recalling 2 we obtain the dynamics of tracking errors as follows 7 e 1 e 2 e 2 r s ν ν f r m 1 c 0 ν ν d 0 ν ν τ η d t where f r m 1 δ c ν ν δ d ν ν d t choose the following sliding variable 8 s c 1 e 1 e 2 where the constant c 1 0 is the parameter of sliding variable and e 1 and e 2 are given in 6 by using the equivalent smc method utkin 2013 the control law can be chosen as the following form 9 τ τ e q τ s with 10 τ e q c 0 ν d 0 ν ν m r 1 f ˆ c 1 e 2 r s ν ν η d 11 τ s m r 1 k t s t sgn s where τ e q is the equivalent control term f ˆ is an estimate of f provided by the nn τ s is the robust control term and k t s t diag k 1 t s 1 t k 2 t s 2 t k 3 t s 3 t is the adaptive parameter matrix the sign function sgn is defined as sgn z 1 if z 0 sgn z 1 if z 0 sgn z 1 1 if z 0 for a scalar z r and operated element wise for a vector z r n shtessel et al 2014 suppose that there exists a constant ideal weight matrix w such that f can be written as 12 f w t ϕ x δ where x ν r 3 is the nn input vector and w r l 3 with the number of neurons in the hidden layer l here we use the rbf network to approximate f in 7 the output of the nn can be expressed by 13 f ˆ w ˆ t ϕ x where w ˆ is the estimation of the nn weight w ϕ x ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x ϕ l x t and ϕ j x is the gaussian function as given in 5 for j 1 2 l the time derivative of 8 along 7 becomes 14 s c 1 e 2 e 2 c 1 e 2 r s ν ν f r m 1 c 0 ν ν d 0 ν ν τ η d substituting 9 into 14 and from f ˆ w ˆ t ϕ x as given in 13 the dynamics of s can be rewritten as 15 s w t ϕ x δ k t s t sgn s where w w w ˆ is the weight estimation error of the rbf network in this paper the parameter of the robust term in the equivalent smc method given in 11 is dynamically turned to make sure the sliding variable s i reaches the region s i ε where ε 0 is the parameter of bf as given in 3 then the gain is switched to the bf in order to counteract the approximation errors of the rbf nn moreover the bf can prevent the siding variable s i from reaching the upper bound of the quasi sliding mode s i ε for i 1 2 3 the next theorem gives the main content in this paper theorem 1 consider the asv 1 with bounded initial conditions as well as unknown parameter uncertainties and external disturbances which satisfy assumptions 1 3 and the control input 9 the nn weight update law and the adaptive control gain k t s t of the robust control term τ s as given in 11 are chosen as 16 w ˆ γ ϕ x s t 17 k i t s i t k a i t k a i t k s i t if 0 t t i k b i s i t if t t i where γ diag γ 1 γ 2 γ l 0 is any constant matrix k 0 is a positive constant k b i s i s i ε s i with the parameter of the bf ε 0 t i is the smallest root of s i ε 2 and i 1 2 3 given any positive number v m 0 for all initial conditions satisfying i 1 3 s i 2 1 γ k a i k i 2 1 γ i w i t w i 2 v m with a constant k i k a i then neural network weight estimation error w and all system states are uniformly ultimate bounded moreover the system state can reach the region s 3 ε and stay in it thereafter the tracking errors of the asv can converge to the region e 1 3 ε c 1 proof the proof is composed of two steps the first step concerns that s i will reach ε 2 in finite time t i whereas the second one concerns that s i can coverage to s i ε in finite time for t t i and s i t s a where 0 s a ε and i 1 2 3 step 1 if s i 0 ε 2 then we enter the step 2 directly with t i 0 according to the lemma 1 in plestan et al 2010 there exists a constant k 0 such that 18 k a i k t 0 when 0 t t i for i 1 2 3 select the lyapunov function 19 v a i 1 2 s i 2 1 2 γ k a i k i 2 1 2 γ i w i t w i where γ is a positive constant satisfying 0 γ k k is given in 18 and w ˆ i r l 1 is the i th column of w ˆ eq 15 can be rewritten as 20 s i w i t ϕ x δ i k i t s i t sgn s i i 1 2 3 differentiating 19 along 17 and 20 we have 21 v a i s i s i 1 γ k a i k i k a i w i t w i γ i s i k i t s i t sgn s i 1 γ k a i k i k a i w i t w i γ i s i ϕ x s i δ i note that the third term in the last equation is zero if we select 22 w i γ i ϕ x s i for i 1 2 3 since w i w i w ˆ i and w i is a constant then w i w ˆ i and the nn update law 16 are obtained according to 17 and 20 22 the time derivative of v a i yields 23 v a i s i s i 1 γ k a i k i k a i w i t w ˆ i s i δ k s i k s i k a i s i k γ k a i k s i k δ n s i k γ 1 k k a i s i note that the terms w i t ϕ x δ i ψ in 20 with unknown upper bound ψ 0 according to lemma 1 in plestan et al 2010 k a i is increasing and there exists a time t 1 such that k a i ψ δ n from k k a i and 0 γ k we obtain that always exists k such that k δ n 0 and k γ 1 k k a i 0 for all t 0 it yields v a i 0 then we obtain that s i k a i k and w i are bounded note that v a i 0 is not necessary for s i to reach zero in finite time hence we use another lyapunov function as 24 v a 1 i 1 2 s i 2 1 2 γ k a i k i 2 differentiating 24 with respect to time and using 20 we obtain 25 v a 1 i s i s i 1 γ k a i k k a i w i t ϕ i x δ n k a i s i k s i k s i 1 γ k a i k k s i k δ n w i t ϕ i x β a s i k γ 1 s i β b k k a i observe that the gaussian function ϕ i x is bounded by 0 ϕ i x 1 it follows that w i t ϕ i x w i t there always exist k and γ such that k δ n w i t ϕ i x and γ k it follows that β a 0 and β b 0 then we have 26 v a 1 i β a s i β b k k a i β a 2 s i 2 β b 2 γ k k a i 2 γ min β a 2 β b 2 γ s i 2 k k a i 2 γ β 1 v a 1 i 1 2 where β 1 min β a 2 β b 2 γ thus it can be concluded that s i t can converge to zero in finite time moreover there exists t i 0 such that t i is the smallest root of s i ε 2 for i 1 2 3 step 2 when t t i with s i t i ε 2 for i 1 2 3 choose the lyapunov function 27 v b i 1 2 s i 2 1 2 k b i 2 s i 1 2 γ i w i t w i substituting 17 20 and 22 into the derivative of 27 yields 28 v b i s i w i t ϕ x δ i k b i t s i t sgn s i k b i k b i 1 γ i w i t γ i ϕ x s i s i δ i k b i sgn s i k b i s i ε ε s i 2 sgn s i ξ i k b i s i k b i s i δ n s i ε ε s i 2 k b i s i ξ i k b i s i where ξ i w i t ϕ i x δ denote 29 s a i ε ξ i ξ i 1 note that s a i ε for any ξ i 0 from 3 and fig 1 we get k b i s i k b i s a ξ i δ n when s i t s a i according to the last inequality of 28 it follows that v b i 0 and s i k b i and w i are bounded in the condition s i t s a i according to lemma 6 in obeid et al 2018 the next lyapunov function is used to prove that s i can converge to s i s a in a finite time t i for i 1 2 3 30 v b 1 i 1 2 s i 2 1 2 k b i s i t 2 differentiating 30 with respect to time leads to 31 v b 1 i s i s i k b i k b i s i w i t ϕ i x δ i k b i s i ε k b i ε s i 2 sgn s i w i t ϕ i x δ k b i k b i s i ξ i β c s i k b i s i ξ i ε ε s i 2 β d k b i s i noting k b i s i k b i s a when s i s a and from k b i s a ξ i δ n we obtain β c 0 and β d 0 when s i s a it follows that 32 v b 1 i min β c 2 β d 2 s i 2 k b i s i 2 β 2 v b 1 i 1 2 where β 2 min β c 2 β d 2 hence after t t i s i can converge to the region s i s a in finite time 33 t i 2 β 2 v b 1 i 1 2 s i t i k b i s i t i v b 1 i 1 2 s a k b i s a where i 1 2 3 according to 26 and 33 s converges to the region s 3 s a in finite time t max t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 t 3 t 3 noting e 1 s c 1 it follows that the bound of tracking error e 1 is e 1 3 s a c 1 the theorem 1 is proven remark 1 from theorem 1 the bf parameter ε affects the upper bound of the quasi sliding mode and tracking accuracy that is s o ε and e o ε remark 2 for the bf based adaptive smc method obeid et al 2018 after t i t i the adaptive gain k i decreases until the value allows to compensate model uncertainties and disturbances f i with f r m 1 δ c ν ν δ d ν ν d t as given in 7 by using the bf based adaptive nn smc strategy given in theorem 1 after t i t i the adaptive gain k i decreases till the value can compensate the term w i t ϕ x δ i as shown in 20 for i 1 2 3 remark 3 when t t i from s i ε s i sgn s i s i ε s i we obtain that the control input of the asv is continuous obeid et al 2018 and the dynamics of s i becomes s i w i t ϕ x δ i 1 ε s i s i for i 1 2 3 4 simulations in this section we use a well known asv named cybership ii to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller the model parameters of cybership ii can be found in table 1 skjetne et al 2004 the reference trajectory is given as η d t 6 sin 0 02 t 0 25 1 cos 0 02 t 0 02 t t the initial condition of the asv is η 0 0 3 0 5 π 4 t and ν 0 0 0 0 t let the model uncertainties and time varying disturbances introduced into the model be δ c ν ν δ d ν ν 0 7 u 2 v r 0 9 u 3 v 0 8 u 2 v 0 142 v 2 t and d 3 cos t cos 0 5 t 2 sin 0 3 t cos 0 8 t 1 4 cos t 0 6 3 sin 0 03 t π 8 cos 0 5 t 5 sin t cos 0 2 t 4 cos 0 1 t t wang and pan 2019 we apply the smc 9 with the bf based adaptive law 17 to achieve the control objective the bf parameter is chosen as ε 0 1 the sliding variable parameter is selected as c 1 15 we set k 0 05 and k a i 0 0 1 to prevent the value of k a i from increasing too fast during 0 t t i i 1 2 3 for the adaptive law the number of neurons in the hidden layer is chosen as l 15 the rbf widths are 5 and the centers are evenly spaced on 0 7 0 7 by using the same system parameters the control tasks model uncertainties and disturbances the initial conditions the bf and the controller parameters we compare the performance between the bf based adaptive nn smc bf nn smc proposed in this paper and a bf based adaptive smc bf smc designed in obeid et al 2018 the simulation results under the bf nn smc and bf smc are presented in figs 3 10 fig 3 shows the desired and actual trajectories of the asvs in the horizontal plane denote f r m 1 δ c ν ν δ d ν ν d with f f 1 f 2 f 3 t f is plotted in fig 4 by using black lines whereas the outputs of the nns are plotted by using red dash lines it demonstrates that unknown model uncertainties and disturbances are efficiently compensated by the proposed rbf nn the performances of the adaptive parameters k 1 k 2 and k 3 with nn and without nn are illustrated in fig 5 it can be seen that the absolutely values of k i decrease dramatically by using bf nn smc for i 1 2 3 this is due to that k i is used to compensate the nn approximation error for bf nn smc whereas k i is used to compensate the unknown model uncertainties and disturbances for bf smc as given in remark 2 furthermore the adaptive control parameter k i for bf nn smc is an increasing function when t i t i with t 1 6 077 t 2 6 253 and t 3 7 411 as illustrated in fig 5 figs 6 7 show that the sliding variable s i can converge to the quasi sliding mode bound s i ε when using bf nn smc and bf smc it can be observed that after reaching s i ε the oscillation amplitude of s i by using bf smc is greater than that by using bf nn smc this verifies the description that for s i ε control input is continuous as shown in remark 3 in addition the term w i t ϕ x δ i and the term f affect the oscillation amplitude of s i for bf nn smc and bf smc respectively by comparing figs 8 and 9 it can be seen that the chattering amplitudes of the attitude tracking error e 1 for the nn bf smc are smaller than that for the bf smc the control inputs τ i with nn and without nn are given in fig 10 for i 1 2 3 the red and blue lines represent the behaviors of the bf nn smc system and the bf smc system respectively fig 10 shows that the control input τ i becomes continuous when t t i for i 1 2 3 as given in remark 3 5 conclusion in this paper a bf based adaptive nn smc scheme has been proposed for the trajectory tracking control of the asv which has model uncertainties and disturbances with unknown upper bound a nn a bf based switched adaptive law and the equivalent smc approach have been combined the rbf nn has been introduced to approximate the unknown disturbances and model uncertainties in the sliding and steady phases of smc the bf has been selected as the parameter of the robust smc term to estimate the nn approximation error and to prevent the sliding variable from steering out of the quasi sliding mode in addition by using cybership ii comparative studies between the proposed strategy and the bf based adaptive smc law have shown the effectiveness of the proposed scheme future research will extend the proposed method to address the asv with input saturation and formation control of multiple asvs as well as on experimental validating the advanced

2016 and rout et al 2020 to guarantee tracking performances for ocean vessels the nn is adopted to approximate the complex hydrodynamics and differential of desired tracking velocities of underwater vehicles in zhang et al 2020 in cui et al 2017 adaptive critic based nn controllers are proposed for asvs in this paper we consider the design of a bf based adaptive smc law for trajectory tracking control of asvs which are subject to model uncertainties and external disturbances with unknown boundary the bf based adaptive nn smc strategy is composed of an equivalent smc law a nn and a switched adaptive law for the parameter of robust smc term the radial basis function rbf nn is used to approximate the model uncertainties and external disturbances the robust control parameter increases first until the sliding variable reaches a quasi sliding mode region then a bf is selected as the parameter of the robust control term to estimate the nn approximation error and to prevent the sliding variable from steering out of the quasi sliding mode region compared with other nn smc approaches the adaptive law is switched according to the amplitude of the sliding variable then the parameter of the robust smc term is no more than the approximation error of the nn in the sliding and steady phases of the smc the sliding variable and the tracking errors can converge to a bounded region related to the parameter of the bf at last comparative simulations with the bf based smc scheme are given using an asv to show the superiority of the bf based adaptive nn smc strategy this paper is organized as follows the dynamics of the asv the definition of the bf and the rbf nn are described in section 2 the controller design and stability analysis are given in section 3 simulation results are provided in section 4 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 system dynamics and preliminaries 2 1 kinematic and dynamic model of the asv the dynamics of the asv are described by fossen 2002 1 η

33 ν n r n v r v n r r r and the coefficients x y n are hydrodynamic parameters skjetne et al 2004 note that the rotation matrix has the properties r ψ t r ψ i and r ψ i where represents the 2 norm of a matrix or a vector the matrices c and d in 1 are considered as the unknown parts of the asv dynamics let c 0 and d 0 be the nominal values of c and d we have c δ c c 0 and d δ d d 0 where δ c and δ d are the uncertain parts of c and d respectively then the dynamic equations of the asv in 1 can be written in the following form 2 η r ψ ν m ν c 0 ν ν d 0 ν ν τ δ c ν ν δ d ν ν d t in this paper the control objective is to develop a control input vector τ such that actual position vector of the asv in 1 with unknown bounded model uncertainties and disturbances can track the desired trajectory vector η d t exactly the following assumptions are made for system 2 assumption 1 lewis et al 1996 the upper bound of the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances is unknown that is there exists a constant l such that δ c ν ν δ d ν ν d t l but l is not known assumption 2 the reference signal η d t η d t and η d t are smooth and bounded 2 2 barrier function bf in this paper we consider the positive semi definite bf with obeid et al 2018 3 k b z z ε z where ε 0 is the parameter of the bf from 3 we can obtain k b 0 0 and the property k b z as z approaches ε the plot of function k b z is shown in fig 1 where z ε and z ε are vertical asymptotes 2 3 rbf nn rbf nns are nns that use rbf as the activation functions let u x be a compact set of r a let f x be a smooth function from r a to r b define w r l b by the ideal weight matrix of the nn with the number of neurons in a hidden layer l then as long as x is restricted in u x the nonlinear function f x with x r a can be approximated by the rbf nn as lewis et al 1996 4 f x w t ϕ x δ where x r a is the input vector ϕ x ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x ϕ l x t and δ δ 1 δ 2 δ b t is the network reconstruction error vector in addition one can find a nn such that δ δ n holds for any choice of a positive constant δ n in u x let ϕ j x be the gaussian function then we have 5 ϕ j x exp x μ j 2 2 σ 2 j 1 2 l where μ j μ j 1 μ j 2 μ j a t is the center of the gaussian function and σ 0 is the width of the gaussian function noting that w is unknown we need to estimate w online let w ˆ be the estimation of w we will design an adaptive law to update w ˆ in the next section assumption 3 the ideal weights are bounded by known positive values so that w f w m 3 bf based adaptive nn smc design with modeling uncertainties and disturbances this section will give the design of a bf based adaptive nn smc law the block diagram of the control system is shown in fig 2 where η x y ψ t is the position and posture vector ν u v r t is the velocity vector and τ is control input let η d t and ν d t denote the desired position and velocity vectors respectively the nn is used to approximate the modeling uncertainties and the external disturbances the nn output is denoted as f ˆ let s be the designed sliding variable note that the smc law τ in fig 1 is composed of the equivalent control term τ e q and the robust control term τ s which will be introduced later we define the tracking errors by 6 e 1 η η d t e 2 η η d t noting r r s with s 0 r 0 r 0 0 0 0 0 and recalling 2 we obtain the dynamics of tracking errors as follows 7 e 1 e 2 e 2 r s ν ν f r m 1 c 0 ν ν d 0 ν ν τ η d t where f r m 1 δ c ν ν δ d ν ν d t choose the following sliding variable 8 s c 1 e 1 e 2 where the constant c 1 0 is the parameter of sliding variable and e 1 and e 2 are given in 6 by using the equivalent smc method utkin 2013 the control law can be chosen as the following form 9 τ τ e q τ s with 10 τ e q c 0 ν d 0 ν ν m r 1 f ˆ c 1 e 2 r s ν ν η d 11 τ s m r 1 k t s t sgn s where τ e q is the equivalent control term f ˆ is an estimate of f provided by the nn τ s is the robust control term and k t s t diag k 1 t s 1 t k 2 t s 2 t k 3 t s 3 t is the adaptive parameter matrix the sign function sgn is defined as sgn z 1 if z 0 sgn z 1 if z 0 sgn z 1 1 if z 0 for a scalar z r and operated element wise for a vector z r n shtessel et al 2014 suppose that there exists a constant ideal weight matrix w such that f can be written as 12 f w t ϕ x δ where x ν r 3 is the nn input vector and w r l 3 with the number of neurons in the hidden layer l here we use the rbf network to approximate f in 7 the output of the nn can be expressed by 13 f ˆ w ˆ t ϕ x where w ˆ is the estimation of the nn weight w ϕ x ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x ϕ l x t and ϕ j x is the gaussian function as given in 5 for j 1 2 l the time derivative of 8 along 7 becomes 14 s c 1 e 2 e 2 c 1 e 2 r s ν ν f r m 1 c 0 ν ν d 0 ν ν τ η d substituting 9 into 14 and from f ˆ w ˆ t ϕ x as given in 13 the dynamics of s can be rewritten as 15 s w t ϕ x δ k t s t sgn s where w w w ˆ is the weight estimation error of the rbf network in this paper the parameter of the robust term in the equivalent smc method given in 11 is dynamically turned to make sure the sliding variable s i reaches the region s i ε where ε 0 is the parameter of bf as given in 3 then the gain is switched to the bf in order to counteract the approximation errors of the rbf nn moreover the bf can prevent the siding variable s i from reaching the upper bound of the quasi sliding mode s i ε for i 1 2 3 the next theorem gives the main content in this paper theorem 1 consider the asv 1 with bounded initial conditions as well as unknown parameter uncertainties and external disturbances which satisfy assumptions 1 3 and the control input 9 the nn weight update law and the adaptive control gain k t s t of the robust control term τ s as given in 11 are chosen as 16 w ˆ γ ϕ x s t 17 k i t s i t k a i t k a i t k s i t if 0 t t i k b i s i

positive number v m 0 for all initial conditions satisfying i 1 3 s i 2 1 γ k a i k i 2 1 γ i w i t w i 2 v m with a constant k i k a i then neural network weight estimation error w and all system states are uniformly ultimate bounded moreover the system state can reach the region s 3 ε and stay in it thereafter the tracking errors of the asv can converge to the region e 1 3 ε c 1 proof the proof is composed of two steps the first step concerns that s i will reach ε 2 in finite time t i whereas the second one concerns that s i can coverage to s i ε in finite time for t t i and s i t s a where 0 s a ε and i 1 2 3 step 1 if s i 0 ε 2 then we enter the step 2 directly with t i 0 according to the lemma 1 in plestan et al 2010 there exists a constant k 0 such that 18 k a i k t 0 when 0 t t i for i 1 2 3 select the lyapunov function 19 v a i 1 2 s i 2 1 2 γ k a i k i 2 1 2 γ i w i t w i where γ is a positive constant satisfying 0 γ k k is given in 18 and w ˆ i r l 1 is the i th column of w ˆ eq 15 can be rewritten as 20 s i w i t ϕ x δ i k i t s i t sgn s i i 1 2 3 differentiating 19 along 17 and 20 we have 21 v a i s i s i 1 γ k a i k i k a i w i t w i γ i s i k i t s i t sgn s i 1 γ k a i k i k a i w i t w i γ i s i ϕ x s i δ i note that the third term in the last equation is zero if we select 22 w i γ i ϕ x s i for i 1 2 3 since w i w i w ˆ i and w i is a constant then w i w ˆ i and the nn update law 16 are obtained according to 17 and 20 22 the time derivative of v a i yields 23 v a i s i s i 1 γ k a i k i k a i w i t w ˆ i s i δ k s i k s i k a i s i k γ k a i k s i k δ n s i k γ 1 k k a i s i note that the terms w i t ϕ x δ i ψ in 20 with unknown upper bound ψ 0 according to lemma 1 in plestan et al 2010 k a i is increasing and there exists a time t 1 such that k a i ψ δ n from k k a i and 0 γ k we obtain that always exists k such that k δ n 0 and k γ 1 k k a i 0 for all t 0 it yields v a i 0 then we obtain that s i k a i k and w i are bounded note that v a i 0 is not necessary for s i to reach zero in finite time hence we use another lyapunov function as 24 v a 1 i 1 2 s i 2 1 2 γ k a i k i 2 differentiating 24 with respect to time and using 20 we obtain 25 v a 1 i s i s i 1 γ k a i k k a i w i t ϕ i x δ n k a i s i k s i k s i 1 γ k a i k k s i k δ n w i t ϕ i x β a s i k γ 1 s i β b k k a i observe that the gaussian function ϕ i x is bounded by 0 ϕ i x 1 it follows that w i t ϕ i x w i t there always exist k and γ such that k δ n w i t ϕ i x and γ k it follows that β a 0 and β b 0 then we have 26 v a 1 i β a s i β b k k a i β a 2 s i 2 β b 2 γ k k a i 2 γ min β a 2 β b 2 γ s i 2 k k a i 2 γ β 1 v a 1 i 1 2 where β 1 min β a 2 β b 2 γ thus it can be concluded that s i t can converge to zero in finite time moreover there exists t i 0 such that t i is the smallest root of s i ε 2 for i 1 2 3 step 2 when t t i with s i t i ε 2 for i 1 2 3 choose the lyapunov function 27 v b i 1 2 s i 2 1 2 k b i 2 s i 1 2 γ i w i t w i substituting 17 20 and 22 into the derivative of 27 yields 28 v b i s i w i t ϕ x δ i k b i t s i t sgn s i k b i k b i 1 γ i w i t γ i ϕ x s i s i δ i k b i sgn s i k b i s i ε ε s i 2 sgn s i ξ i k b i s i k b i s i δ n s i ε ε s i 2 k b i s i ξ i k b i s i where ξ i w i t ϕ i x δ denote 29 s a i ε ξ i ξ i 1 note that s a i ε for any ξ i 0 from 3 and fig 1 we get k b i s i k b i s a ξ i δ n when s i t s a i according to the last inequality of 28 it follows that v b i 0 and s i k b i and w i are bounded in the condition s i t s a i according to lemma 6 in obeid et al 2018 the next lyapunov function is used to prove that s i can converge to s i s a in a finite time t i for i 1 2 3 30 v b 1 i 1 2 s i 2 1 2 k b i s i t 2 differentiating 30 with respect to time leads to 31 v b 1 i s i s i k b i k b i s i w i t ϕ i x δ i k b i s i ε k b i ε s i 2 sgn s i w i t ϕ i x δ k b i k b i s i ξ i β c s i k b i s i ξ i ε ε s i 2 β d k b i s i noting k b i s i k b i s a when s i s a and from k b i s a ξ i δ n we obtain β c 0 and β d 0 when s i s a it follows that 32 v b 1 i min β c 2 β d 2 s i 2 k b i s i 2 β 2 v b 1 i 1 2 where β 2 min β c 2 β d 2 hence after t t i s i can converge to the region s i s a in finite time 33 t i 2 β 2 v b 1 i 1 2 s i t i k b i s i t i v b 1 i 1 2 s a k b i s a where i 1 2 3 according to 26 and 33 s converges to the region s 3 s a in finite time t max t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 t 3 t 3 noting e 1 s c 1 it follows that the bound of tracking error e 1 is e 1 3 s a c 1 the theorem 1 is proven remark 1 from theorem 1 the bf parameter ε affects the upper bound of the quasi sliding mode and tracking accuracy that is s o ε and e o ε remark 2 for the bf based adaptive smc method obeid et al 2018 after t i t i the adaptive gain k i decreases until the value allows to compensate model uncertainties and disturbances f i with f r m 1 δ c ν ν δ d ν ν d t as given in 7 by using the bf based adaptive nn smc strategy given in theorem 1 after t i t i the adaptive gain k i decreases till the value can compensate the term w i t ϕ x δ i as shown in 20 for i 1 2 3 remark 3 when t t i from s i ε s i sgn s i s i ε s i we obtain that the control input of the asv is continuous obeid et al 2018 and the dynamics of s i becomes s i w i t ϕ x δ i 1 ε s i s i for i 1 2 3 4 simulations in this section we use a well known asv named cybership ii to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller the model parameters of cybership ii can be found in table 1 skjetne et al 2004 the reference trajectory is given as η d t 6 sin 0 02 t 0 25 1 cos 0 02 t 0 02 t t the initial condition of the asv is η 0 0 3 0 5 π 4 t and ν 0 0 0 0 t let the model uncertainties and time varying disturbances introduced into the model be δ c ν ν δ d ν ν 0 7 u 2 v r 0 9 u 3 v 0 8 u 2 v 0 142 v 2 t and d 3 cos t cos 0 5 t 2

bf parameter is chosen as ε 0 1 the sliding variable parameter is selected as c 1 15 we set k 0 05 and k a i 0 0 1 to prevent the value of k a i from increasing too fast during 0 t t i i 1 2 3 for the adaptive law the number of neurons in the hidden layer is chosen as l 15 the rbf widths are 5 and the centers are evenly spaced on 0 7 0 7 by using the same system parameters the control tasks model uncertainties and disturbances the initial conditions the bf and the controller parameters we compare the performance between the bf based adaptive nn smc bf nn smc proposed in this paper and a bf based adaptive smc bf smc designed in obeid et al 2018 the simulation results under the bf nn smc and bf smc are presented in figs 3 10 fig 3 shows the desired and actual trajectories of the asvs in the horizontal plane denote f r m 1 δ c ν ν δ d ν ν d with f f 1 f 2 f 3 t f is plotted in fig 4 by using black lines whereas the outputs of the nns are plotted by using red dash lines it demonstrates that unknown model uncertainties and disturbances are efficiently compensated by the proposed rbf nn the performances of the adaptive parameters k 1 k 2 and k 3 with nn and without nn are illustrated in fig 5 it can be seen that the absolutely values of k i decrease dramatically by using bf nn smc for i 1 2 3 this is due to that k i is used to compensate the nn approximation error for bf nn smc whereas k i is used to compensate the unknown model uncertainties and disturbances for bf smc as given in remark 2 furthermore the adaptive control parameter k i for bf nn smc is an increasing function when t i t i with t 1 6 077 t 2 6 253 and t 3 7 411 as illustrated in fig 5 figs 6 7 show that the sliding variable s i can converge to the quasi sliding mode bound s i ε when using bf nn smc and bf smc it can be observed that after reaching s i ε the oscillation amplitude of s i by using bf smc is greater than that by using bf nn smc this verifies the description that for s i ε control input is continuous as shown in remark 3 in addition the term w i t ϕ x δ i and the term f affect the oscillation amplitude of s i for bf nn smc and bf smc respectively by comparing figs 8 and 9 it can be seen that the chattering amplitudes of the attitude tracking error e 1 for the nn bf smc are smaller than that for the bf smc the control inputs τ i with nn and without nn are given in fig 10 for i 1 2 3 the red and blue lines represent the behaviors of the bf nn smc system and the bf smc system respectively fig 10 shows that the control input τ i becomes continuous when t t i for i 1 2 3 as given in remark 3 5 conclusion in this paper a bf based adaptive nn smc scheme has been proposed for the trajectory tracking control of the asv which has model uncertainties and disturbances with unknown upper bound a nn a bf based switched adaptive law and the equivalent smc approach have been combined the rbf nn has been introduced to approximate the unknown disturbances and model uncertainties in the sliding and steady phases of smc the bf has been selected as the parameter of the robust smc term to estimate the nn approximation error and to prevent the sliding variable from steering out of the quasi sliding mode in addition by using cybership ii comparative studies between the proposed strategy and the bf based adaptive smc law have shown the effectiveness of the proposed scheme future research will extend the proposed method to address the asv with input saturation and formation control of multiple asvs as well as on experimental validating the advanced

20226,this research investigated the relationship of tree crown height with the trunk part under the mobile bed condition for the proper management of inland coastal forests a series of flume experiments under the quasi steady flow conditions were performed while varying different parameters like change in crown heights from the ground highest h ct 0 7 medium h ct 0 5 and lowest h ct 0 3 where h ct h c h t h ct is the non dimensional parameter h c is the crown height from ground and h t is the tree height forest thicknesses in the streamwise direction i e l and l 2 where l is the forest length and initial froude number conditions f r ranging from 0 668 to 0 732 the outcomes demonstrated that the flow structures are strongly influenced by the lowest crown height i e h ct 0 3 causing the maximum flow energy reduction i e 40 43 on the contrary the scour produced around the forest due to the high impact force of overflowing water became excessive that can significantly damage the coastal forest defense system the optimum results in the form of significant energy reduction of the approaching current and minimum vulnerability permissible scouring of the defense system have been observed to be associated with the medium crown height i e h ct 0 5 and largest possible forest thickness keywords tsunami current defense system coastal forest management tree crown flow structures scour phenomena 1 introduction when a large flood like a tsunami is occurred and reaches the shore of the coast some part of it is reflected back while some part of it runs up approaching the coastal region and then the inland regions the approaching tsunami current carries large energy and high fluid force that causes a huge disaster in the coastal and inland regions udo et al 2012 to mitigate the tsunami damage a coastal forest has been observed to be an effective natural solution despite the fact that it does not completely diminish the tsunami flow energy the effectiveness of the forest varies with the approaching tsunami level forest arrangement and strength of the substrate shuto 1987 the coastal forest is not only the economical solution against the tsunami propagation but it also performs a natural function of tsunami disaster reduction and delays the overflowing volume of water harada and imamura 2000 hiraishi and harada 2003 on the contrary when a high level tsunami breaks through the coastal and inland regions travelling with a high fluid force and velocity it damages and uproots the tree structures from the forest cochard et al 2008 the field investigations in the kanto and tohoku regions of japan carried by tanaka 2012 and udo et al 2012 after the 2011 great east japan tsunami gejt observed that many of the tree structures within the forest region were broken and destroyed which was mainly due to the high fluid force and significant scouring many of the previous researchers indicated that the driftwood production is due to the large moment acting on the trees because of the sudden impact of flowing water local scour around the tree structures within the forest region and poor root strength of the substrate shuto 1993 tanaka and yagisawa 2009 huang et al 2011 behrens and dias 2015 the washout or damaged trees may collide and cause significant damage to the buildings and residential properties in the inland regions de costa and tanaka 2020 therefore the high fluid force and the steep water slope just behind the forest must be possibly controlled to avoid the destruction of the forest itself that may otherwise cause economical ecological and social losses the driftwood generation does not only take place behind the embankment structure and in front of the coastal forest but also from the landward side of the forest tanaka 2012 the flow passing through the coastal forest defense system experiences resistance from the tree structures with a backwater rise at the front of the forest however the water surface gradient inside the forest becomes steep iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 which increases the flow velocity behind the forest and shear stress acting on the ground thus the high shear stress on the ground causes the soil particles to get erode and separated from the landward side tanaka et al 2007 leading to the production of scouring just behind the forest hence it could lead to the generation of dangerous zone behind the forest tanaka 2012 iimura and tanaka 2013 that can result in the eradication of the tree structures from the forest backend a managed inland coastal forest with a large trunk diameter and a higher crown height of the trees to resist a high level tsunami current and capturing the driftwood was recommended by tanaka et al 2018 a suitable managing and proper planning of the forest are necessary for increasing the resilience of the social system especially during the attack of large tsunamis pasha and tanaka 2016 although the breaking pattern of trees and driftwood production were previously clarified tanaka and onai 2017 tanaka and ogino 2017 not much attention has been paid to the scouring around the tree forest focused on the influence of the tree crown part therefore an understanding of the management of coastal forests needs to be developed for an effective mitigation strategy against the approaching tsunamis research has been previously conducted on the scour pattern around a single cylinder of circular shape e g roulund et al 2005 debnath and chaudhuri 2010 baykal et al 2015 tonkin et al 2003 pointed out that the scour development around the cylinder with time is primarily dependent on the condition of the substrate for solitary wave an experimental study conducted by yagci et al 2017 investigated the scour distribution around a combined arrangement of circular cylinders under steady and clear water conditions ali and tanaka 2020 conducted an experimental study on scouring around the coastal forest and concluded that the maximum scour hole moves inside the forest region under the gravel bed mobile conditions because of the failure of the defense systems against the approaching tsunamis most of the researchers proposed hybrid or compound mitigation strategies in recent decades including hard as well as natural structures tanaka et al 2006 igarashi and tanaka 2018 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 anjum and tanaka 2020a however the construction of such defense systems needs more space in the coastal and inland regions and it could be very expensive especially for the developing countries therefore an effective tsunami mitigation bioshield should be proposed that could be practically applicable in the field and economically possible for developing nations the previously conducted studies e g irtem et al 2009 ismail et al 2012 including physical as well as computational modeling used the simplified tree model in the form of a circular cylinder as a replica although the crown part of the tree and its height from the ground has significant importance which showed noteworthy differences in the damage during a post tsunami survey after the gejt sato et al 2012 to elucidate the effectiveness and influence of the complete tree structure in a forest it is very important to replicate both parts of the tree i e trunk and crown part while modeling it physically or numerically although some of the previous studies highlighted the importance of the crown part of the trees focused on breaking patterns tanaka et al 2013 2015 2018 not many studies paid special attention on the variation of the flow structures scour distributions and the resistance caused due to the change in height of the crown part of trees there is still a lack of knowledge on how the tree stand structures are eradicated from the forest backend and how important the crown height from the ground is regarding the optimum resistance and resilience of the defense system itself therefore the relationship between the crown part and trunk part of the tree in a coastal forest is still needed to be explored the understanding of the correlation between the type of tree structures and its damage produced by the tsunami has been a vital part of research in the recent decade the management practices can significantly influence the extent of damage caused to the tree stand structures within the coastal forest thus for the proper construction and management of the coastal forest for tsunami risk reduction the flood mitigation effects and limitations of the tree crown height from the ground should be clarified this research will contribute to developing an understanding of the influence of the tree crown height and fulfilling the gap in the literature as well therefore the specific objectives of this study were to a investigate the effects of tree crown height of the forest on the tsunami mitigation capability and scour pattern under the moveable gravel bed condition b demonstrate the flow structure changes and energy reduction while comparison with the varying conditions of forest thickness and crown part and c develop and propose an effective bioshield against the inland approaching tsunami currents that can sustain the impact of the intense tsunami fluid forces and produce less driftwood due to scouring around the coastal forest 2 methods 2 1 experimental setup and procedures 2 1 1 flume characteristics the laboratory experiments were performed at saitama university japan in a glass sided flume having the dimensions of 14m long 0 5m wide and 0 4m deep

studies matsutomi et al 2011 spiske et al 2010 pasha et al 2018 adopted quasi steady flow conditions for understanding the basics around the inland forest region the approaching tsunamis can have long flow durations nandasena et al 2012 schimmels et al 2014 therefore to replicate a long flow duration in the laboratory flume quasi steady condition of flow was generated and assumed to be appropriate for this study for this physical experiment froude similarity was implemented to set the model scale after the 2011 gejt the flow was observed to be subcritical at many regions around the inland forest spiske et al 2010 tanaka et al 2013 with the froude numbers f r v o gy o 0 5 where v o is the depth averaged velocity m s g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 and y o is the flow depth ranging from 0 6 to 1 initially several calibrations were done in the experimental flume in order to achieve the desired range of froude numbers hence four initial froude numbers i e f r of 0 668 0 700 0 727 and 0 732 were finally set when there was nothing placed in the flume channel for the experiments which were achieved against the initial flow depths i e y o of approximately 5 6 7 and 8 cm respectively the characteristics of tsunami inundations in the study were considered in general being not specific to any particular location the flow conditions considered for this study are presented in table 1 2 1 3 soil characteristics the soil bed layer was prepared with the gravel particles material having a median grain size d 50 of approximately 4 5 mm with a dry density of 2650 kg m3 in the real scenario soil like clay or sand is usually cohesive and handling this kind of soil becomes difficult in experimental runs since the similitudes are fundamental and important in performing any modeling experiments the similarity law of the clear water scour mechanism was considered in this study for taking account of the similitude of the water soil bed interaction the so called clear water condition occurs when a ridge is present downstream of the scour hole with no sediment transport downstream of a mobile bed it practically reaches its final configuration i e developed stage pagliara 2007 quezada et al 2018 previous research studies e g lenzi and comiti 2003 pagliara 2007 afreen et al 2015 also considered clear water scour conditions while adopting gravel particles because it is widely accepted that maximum scouring is achieved under these conditions ali and tanaka 2020 rahman et al 2021 therefore the gravel particles focused on clear water scour with equilibrium conditions were considered in this study following the similarity law a gravel bed of 2m in the upstream and 2 5m in the downstream region of the forest model was set in the experimental flume covering the full width of the flume and having a depth of approximately 18 cm as shown in fig 1d moreover a flat plate wooden material with a similar depth to that of the material was also placed at the end of the soil layer as a support in order to keep the soil material not to be completely washout during the flow 2 2 model design the present study considered japanese tree species for the forest model with the average tree height of 15m and diameter of 0 4m which was found in the sendai coastal regions tanaka 2012 in addition to the tsunami inundation depths and froude similarity observed in an actual tsunami other parameters like tree characteristics were also imitated and scaled down for a better representation considering the possibility of modeling the tree trunk in the form of a circular cylinder as has been done by previous researchers e g tanaka et al 2014 rahman et al 2020 the circular cylinders of wooden material with 18 cm tree height h t and 0 4 cm tree diameter d on a model scale of 1 100 was used as a replica of tree trunk structures in addition to this the tree crown part can provide larger resistance than that of the trunk part but it depends on the flow depth hence while considering a natural condition the relationship becomes complicated therefore the crown part was also modeled in the form of circular cylinders keeping the same diameter i e d 0 4 cm as a first step modeling for simplicity as shown in the scheme in fig 1b however based on the resistance from both parts of the tree and the possible construction and application of forest in the actual field the density of forest was maintained in this study previous researchers e g takemura and tanaka 2007 pasha and tanaka 2017 highlighted that the tree density can be represented by g d where g is the clear spacing between the cylinders factor with 2 135 as sparse 1 09 as intermediate and 0 25 as dense configuration therefore the sparse arrangement of tree models as the tall trees require large spacing to grow well and the dense arrangement of the crown model as the crown part is denser were considered in the form of staggered arrangement as shown in fig 1c that can significantly influence the flow structures takemura and tanaka 2007 anjum and tanaka 2020b these values of g d 2 125 sparse configuration for tree trunk arrangement and g d 0 041 dense configuration for tree crown arrangement were used to calculate the porosity p r of each configuration of the forest giving values of approximately 98 and 79 porosity respectively the porosity based on cylinders density was calculated by equation 1 iimura and tanaka 2012 1 p r 1 n t π d 2 4 where n t is the number of cylinders per unit area which represents the density of trees the cross shore streamwise direction forest length l considered in this study resembles the forest thickness such that the soil around the tree structures may get scoured and the fringe of the forest may get damaged shuto 1987 the forest models were prepared by drilling holes in a wooden flat plate in which the circular cylinders were inserted which were then mounted on the flume bed the individual models of the forest were placed at a distance of approximately 4 9m from the inlet of the experimental flume covering the entire flume width crosswise the forest configurations and the cases considered in this study are presented in table 1 as the primary objective of this study was to explore the effect of tree crown height h c therefore it was considered as a varying parameter similar to the modeling of tree height and diameter other tree characteristics like the tree trunk and tree crown parts were also imitated in this study for better replication of the modeled structures thus the tree characteristics data were considered from a previous research study that was measured in the actual field of the coastal regions tanaka et al 2018 therefore using a non dimensional parameter for the crown height variation de costa and tanaka 2021 i e h ct h c h t where h ct is the non dimensional parameter for the crown height variation h c is the height of the crown from the ground and h t is the total tree height three different ratios of 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 were considered in order to elucidate the influence of tree crown height from the ground for the management of forestry for the general applicability of this research outcomes to other cases and also for a better understanding of the important relationship of crown height with that of the initial water depth i e without forest the tree crown height has also been non dimensionalized with respect to the initial water depth being the more dominant factor in this study for non dimensionalizing thus the non dimensional crown height parameter i e h cy h c y o where y o is the highest initial water depth also gave three approximate values of 0 7 1 1 and 1 5 hence the results will be discussed with respect to both parameters i e h ct and h cy for a clear understanding the ratio h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 represents the lowest crown height from the ground h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 represents the medium crown height whereas h ct 0 7 or h cy 1 5 represents the highest crown height the tree characteristics detail is also presented in table 1 furthermore as the thickness of the forest model also plays an important role in the flow structure variation and reduction of the tsunami current energy pasha and tanaka 2017 therefore two forest thicknesses i e l and l 2 were considered and investigated in this study under the same flow conditions in order to further clarify the importance of this parameter in addition to this a case with a forest thickness of l was also considered in this study having no crown n c part i e with only the trunk part of the trees for the comparison purpose thus the response of different forest configurations was explored against the approaching tsunami current under the varying flow conditions 2 3 measurement and analysis 2 3 1 water surface measurement after the placement of forest models in the experimental flume the characteristics of the flow and the bed profiles varied significantly the scheme of the resulting flow structures and scour pattern is shown in fig 1e during the flow duration the experiment was recorded with a video camera olympus tg 835 with a frame rate of 1 30 in order to analyze and get the variations in the water surface later on as the tsunami current duration was not long enough to measure the elevations of the water surface using a point gauge manually the water elevations were measured throughout the considered length of the flume at an interval of 1 10 cm depending on the variation in the water surface all the crests and troughs were measured moreover the oscillations in the water surface profile especially near the forest model make the flow very complex and difficult to measure by a simple point gauge and hence the instantaneous readings could not be considered satisfactory in such a case therefore the variation in the water levels i e minimum and maximum water depths at each location were recorded through several consecutive frames which were then averaged to get the water surface profile this data of water surface profiles was then utilized to calculate the flow structure properties 2 3 2 energy reduction the resistance by the coastal forest causes the reduction of flow energy in the downstream region iimura and tanaka 2012 as defined by chow 1959 the specific energy is the energy of water per unit volume over a location measured with reference to the bed of the channel the equation used for calculating the specific energy in the upstream and downstream of the forest model is given as 2 e y α v 2 2 g where e is the specific energy y is the elevation of water α is the coefficient for accounting the velocity variations which was taken as 1 in this study v is the depth averaged velocity which was calculated using the continuity relation v q a where q and a are known discharge and area respectively the noteworthy difference in the water surface profile between the upstream and downstream regions of the forest model resulted in the reduction of flow energy therefore the relative flow energy reductionδe through the forest was calculated by 3 δ e e 1 e 3 e 1 x 100 where e 1 is the mean specific energy in the forest upstream and e 3 is the mean specific energy in the forest downstream region 2 3 3 scour measurement after the flow approached the forest model the regions around the forest especially the downstream were influenced significantly causing the soil to get erode and scouring was generated as shown in fig 1e a bed profile before running the flow was recorded for calculating the difference with the profile resulting after the flow passed through the forest model after the conduction of flow experiments the resulting bed profiles i e deposition and scouring were measured with the help of a laser displacement gauge keyence lk 500 which were then used to calculate the scour properties the scour data was measured at an interval of 2 5 cm depending on the bed profile variation in both lateral y and streamwise x directions the scour data in the y direction was subsequently averaged to get the bed scour profile along the channel length moreover the scour profile data was also used to calculate the scour properties 2 3 4 tsunami current duration at the start of the flow the scoured region around the forest was rapidly changing then gradually and then very slightly with the passage of time thus as the scoured region and scour profile changes with the passage of time tonkin et al 2003 therefore a developed stage of scour was supposed to achieve in this study in order to certify the equilibrium condition in general the calibrations were initially performed to adopt a suitable tsunami duration for this physical experiment five flow durations of 1 2 3 4 and 5 min in model scale were considered for the calibrations the time series data of the scour development against the maximum considered froude number condition i e f r 0 732 is presented in fig 2 a b the scour profiles along the channel length fig 2a and the maximum scour depth inside the forest model fig 2b are observed to be stable developed at a flow duration of 4 min after which the data analysis and visualization showed no noteworthy variations in the scour properties thus the flow duration of 5 min was finally selected for further experiments moreover this flow duration becomes 50 min when the physical scale is 1 100 considering the froude similarity law which can be considered appropriate to the actual tsunami duration 3 results after the modeled tsunami current propagated and reached the inland region the forest model produced significant drag to the approaching flow and hence distinct flow patterns were observed for the respective configurations of the forest fig 3 not only the flow structures but also the bed profiles varied depending on the flow conditions and forest configurations fig 3a g shows the water level variations and the resulting scour patterns for all the cases against the maximum f r 0 732 conditions that were visually observed in the physical experiment it can be seen that the disparity in the flow structures and scour phenomena are mainly influenced by the change in crown height from the ground both properties i e flow structures and scour distribution around the coastal forest plays an important role in the efficiency of the tsunami mitigation strategy and the safety of the defense system itself therefore the quantification of the resulting parameters is necessary to elucidate the effectiveness of the defense structure hence the profiles of water surface elevations and bed variations were analyzed to replicate the resulting phenomenon and to compute the resulting parameters 3 1 flow structures the water surface profiles and scour distributions for the considered forest configurations are presented in fig 4 in the fig n c stands for no crown h ct crown height tree height y o is the initial water depth the horizontal continuous line shows the water surface profile the horizontal dashed line shows the scour profile along the channel and the vertical dotted lines shows the forest start and end in all the cases the flow experienced noticeable drag offered by the tree models in the forest region that caused the water level to rise in front of the forest followed by a water surface gradient occurring within the forest region thus a water level difference was formed between the forest upstream and downstream regions which contributes to the reduction of flow energy iimura and tanaka 2012 in cases of half forest thickness i e l 2 fig 4 ii a d the intensity of variation of the flow depth especially in the forest upstream can be observed to be noticeably low than that of the cases with a forest thickness l fig 4i a d in the initial f r settings of approximately 0 668 and 0 70 except the case with the lowest crown height i e h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 no noticeable difference between the n c model case and h ct 0 5 0 7 h cy 1 1 1 5 cases is observed for most of the considered f r conditions water surface profile in the forest downstream region showed undulation type structure in all the configurations except the forest with h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 in both l and l 2 cases in case of h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 the water surface became almost horizontally flat without showing any undulations kind of structures can be seen in fig 3 with a constant decreasing slope of approximately 0 04 and a reduction rate of approximately 33 thus the flow depth became even lower than the normal initial flow depth at some distance from the forest backend that caused the increment of average velocity in this region which could be dangerous for the hinterland regions thus the flow structure properties like water level rise in the forest front water surface gradient inside the forest region and the resulting reduction of flow energy due to the resistance offered by the forest models need to be quantified in order to clearly understand the effectiveness of the considered model configurations 3 1 1 water level rise the drag offered by the tree structures in the forest region resulted in the reflection of the water wave which caused the flow depth to rise significantly at the forest front this result of the increase in the water surface in the upstream region of the forest is logical and consistent with the previous tsunami related studies e g iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 the water level rise δh y 1 y o where y 1 is the averaged flow depth in front of the forest model and y o is the initial flow depth for all the cases is presented in fig 5 i a b the water level rise increased almost linearly with the increase in f r condition for all the considered configurations compared to that of the cases with half forest thickness l 2 fig 5i b the rise of the water level was noticeably higher i e 25 36 for the cases with the forest thickness of l fig 5i a thus the increment in forest thickness indicates an increase in the forest resistance being more capable to produce higher drag and showing consistency to the results highlighted by pasha and tanaka 2017 the understanding of the influence of crown height can also be developed by this results data for both forest thicknesses l and l 2 the largest water level rise can be found for the lowest crown height case h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 compared to the other crown height cases or n c case this is because of the reason that by keeping the lowest distance height of the tree crown part from the ground level the largest possible drag is offered by the dense crown part and hence it becomes more active in producing resistance as the flow interacts with most part of the crown structures as can also be seen in fig 3 furthermore although the water level rise with respect to the initial flow depth was larger for the highest f r 0 732 the linearly increasing trend was not followed in case of h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 this may be due to the reason that there was a significant increase in scouring downstream of the forest for this lowest crown height condition the influence of the medium crown height i e h ct 0 5 h cy 1 1 on the water level rise is also observed to be not negligible compared to that of n c case or highest crown model case i e h ct 0 7 or h cy 1 5 fig 5i a these results indicate that the water level rise in the forest front depends on the thickness of the forest the height of the crown from the ground and the bed condition 3 1 2 water surface gradient the passing flow through the forest region was resisted by the tree structures hence caused the water surface gradient inside the forest which directly influences the scouring just behind the forest ali and tanaka 2020 fig 5 ii a b demonstrates the water surface gradient tanθ against the considered f r conditions the results showed that the tanθ increased linearly with the increase in f r value for all the considered cases however the linearly increasing trend isn t followed by the lowest crown model case i e h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 for the highest initial considered settings of f r 0 727 and f r 0 732 this may be due to the reason that there was a significant change in the bed condition against these flow conditions which resulted by the occurrence of scouring phenomena inside as well as directly behind the forest region and hence ultimately affected the flow structures similar to the water level rise at the forest front the tanθ is also significantly influenced by the variation in tree crown height i e lower is the crown height from the ground level higher is the gradient of water surface inside the forest model region and vice versa as compared to the n c model case the tanθ is found to be increased by approximately 5 17 and 25 42 for the cases with the crown heights of h ct 0 5 h cy 1 1 and h ct 0 3 h cy 0 7 respectively with the forest thickness of l whereas in the case of half forest thickness i e l 2 the corresponding percentage differences are found to be approximately 30 40 and 50 60 thus it indicates the importance of tree crown height which influences the water surface gradient inside the forest region i e an inverse relation is found between the tree crown height and water surface slope inside the forest region moreover the tanθ is observed to increase by a percentage difference of approximately 21 35 when the thickness of forest was reduced to half length thus the forest with the large thickness produced minimum as well as comparatively less gradient showing the importance of thick forest against the approaching current and this result is also found to be consistent with the experimental study conducted by pasha and tanaka 2017 3 1 3 the relative flow energy reduction δe the relative flow energy reduction δe through the forest is the difference between the specific energy at the upstream and downstream of it as discussed in the previous sections the resistance offered by the tree structures of the forest raised the water level upstream of it with the formation of water surface gradient inside the forest region followed by a reduced flow depth in the forest downstream region this caused a significant water level difference between the forest upstream and downstream regions depending upon the forest configurations which consequently resulted in the loss of current energy behind the forest the relationship between δe and the considered f r conditions is presented in fig 6 a b when the f r condition was varied from 0 668 to 0 721 the δe showed no significant variations and remained almost unchanged for most of the cases the results show that the relative reduction of the flow energy is nearly independent of the froude conditions or initial flow depths which is also consistent with the previous research work pasha and tanaka 2017 in other words it can be concluded that as the flow with a relatively high froude number approaches the forest with large energy fluid force and velocity the resistance by the forest also increases causing a larger backwater rise as well as mean specific energy at the forest upstream as compared to that of the approaching flow with a relatively low froude number thus the effectiveness of the considered model also increases while dissipating the almost same percentage of relative flow energy at low as well as high froude conditions since the results of the difference of the flow specific energies at the forest upstream and downstream are presented in relation to the e 1 therefore the relative energy reduction becomes nearly independent of f r however the graph results showed a slightly decreasing trend only for h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 against the highest two f r conditions which might be due to the reason that the resulting flow structures and scour phenomena were influenced for these two flow conditions as already discussed in the previous section the outcomes of δe again showed the importance and influence of tree crown height and forest thickness parameter fig 6 also shows that in all the studied cases the maximum δe i e 43 was found to be associated with the lowest tree crown height h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 with a forest thickness of l whereas it was approximately 34 with a forest thickness of l 2 in comparison to the n c model case the forest configurations with the crown heights at h ct 0 3 h cy 0 7 and h ct 0 5 h cy 1 1 showed an increasing percentage of 18 26 and 5 12 respectively in δe on the contrary the crown height of h ct 0 7 or h cy 1 5 showed no significant influence on the resulting flow structures and hence caused no variations in δe indicating that the resistance role is played only when the crown height h ct or h cy is less than 0 7 or 1 5 moreover considering the forest thickness parameter when the forest thickness was reduced to half length the δe also generally reduced by a significant percentage of approximately 20 35 this indicates the importance of thick forest being more capable of opposing the flow approaching towards the inland region 3 2 scour distribution despite being more influential on the resulting flow structures and δe the lowest tree crown height from the ground could have more negative impacts like excessive scouring of the bed due to the increased bed shear stress as can be visualized in fig 3 hence it is very important to quantify and clarify the scour phenomena and impacts of the considered forest configurations thus the results about the scour distribution around the forest region are presented in next section for a better understanding it has been observed that the external flow structures have not only affected the δe but also influenced the bed profile depending upon the forest configuration which can be visualized in fig 4 it can be observed from the bed profile that the upstream region of the forest is almost unaffected in all the cases with a small deposition just in the forest front followed by a considerable amount of scouring within the forest as well as just behind the forest the extent of which depends on the crown height and initial setting of f r moreover further downstream region of the forest was also slightly influenced thus focusing on the important aspect of forest vulnerability it is necessary to quantify the scour properties i e scour distributions around the forest for a clear understanding and managing the tree crown height the scour properties are discussed below 3 2 1 contour plot distribution the visualized contour plot distribution of the scour phenomena for all the considered forest configurations is presented in fig 7 the x axis represents the stream wise length of the forest with 0 cm indicating the location of the forest backend whereas the y axis represents the crosswise channel width the positive and negative values indicate the deposition and scouring respectively it can be observed that the region just behind the forest i e an approximate length of 10 cm region was more influenced in all the cases where the larger magnitudes of scouring were resulted it is obvious from this spatial distribution of the bed scour that the peak excessive magnitudes of scouring just behind the forest occurred in case of lowest crown height i e h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 in both forest thicknesses in comparison to those of h ct 0 5 h cy 1 1 h ct 0 7 h cy 1 5 and n c cases thus this excessive scouring directly behind the forest with crown height h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 could lead to washout of the tree structures and generation of the driftwood that can also cause secondary damage to the inland residential areas 3 2 2 maximum scour around the forest the scour distribution profiles were analyzed to quantify the important parameters like maximum scour around the forest region fig 8 a b shows the relationship between the maximum local scour and crown height variation h ct h cy the results of maximum scour have been plotted against both parameters h ct h cy for a better understanding of the relationship of crown height to that of tree height as well as initial water depth respectively it can be observed that the maximum scour magnitudes increased with the increase in f r condition in almost all the considered cases the difference of which is found to be highly dependent on the height of the tree crown the increase in maximum scour depth with the increase in the initial setting of f r value is logical because the approaching flow with a higher froude number comprises higher flow velocity which increases the shear stress acting on the bed soil and hence results in a large scour depth this result is also consistent with the outcomes presented in previous research studies e g balachandar et al 2000 kells et al 2001 the crown height is observed to have significantly influenced the magnitudes of maximum scour around the forest fig 8a b except for the lowest initial setting of f r 0 668 in which the crown has no noticeable influence the trend is such that the opposite logarithmic profile pattern is observed and the slope of the profile is also found to become steeper with the decrement in crown height the lowest magnitudes are found against the highest considered crown height i e h ct 0 7 or h cy 1 5 and vice versa furthermore the scour magnitudes at h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 are found to be lower than 2 cm which could be considered in the permissible limit and hence can be regarded as the critical limit in this study in terms of optimum results of the scour phenomena on the other hand the fig also shows that the peak scour depth magnitudes showed a sudden rise as the h ct or h cy became lower than 0 5 or 1 1 the forest model with the lowest crown height h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 showed comparatively very large amount of scouring magnitudes particularly for the highest two considered froude number conditions f r 0 727 and 0 732 i e about 83 86 higher in case of half stream wise length of the forest l 2 and about 75 80 higher in case of larger length of the forest l this is due to the reason that the lowest crown offered large flow resistance especially against the two mentioned flow conditions increased the water surface gradient inside the forest region fig 5ii and allowed the flow to hit the ground with a large impact force which resulted in an increase in the bed shear stress and thus ultimately resulted in an excessive scouring thus the results demonstrated that the forest could become more exposed to excessive scouring with the h ct or h cy lower than 0 5 or 1 1 from a physical point of view the crown height of coastal trees in early young ages is low and the resistance towards tsunami flows would be large by the crown part than that by the trunk part however on the other hand the overflowing water especially through the lower part of the tree i e trunk part may carry high fluid forces that can easily initiate the scouring process and may become responsible for the driftwood production despite the fact that large forest length is provided as a stronger bioshield against tsunami inundations therefore it can be said that when the crown height h ct of trees in a coastal forest in actual filed is less than 0 5 there may be a large possibility of the forest vulnerability 3 2 3 position of maximum scouring fig 8c d shows the relationship between the position of maximum scouring and the initial froude number condition the horizontal dotted line represents the boundary i e the backend of the forest the position of maximum scouring x is made non dimensional with the length of the forest l i e ps max x l the values after the boundary line right side shows that the maximum scour depth is occurred downstream of the forest and the values before the boundary line left side shows that ps max is occurred within the forest region whereas the values on the boundary line shows the occurrence of ps max at exactly the forest backend location the ps max is observed to be away from the downstream end of the forest model at the minimum considered f r condition i e 0 668 however it moved back towards the forest backend region with the increase in f r condition for almost all the cases this result is consistent with the results found by ali and tanaka 2020 in their research study under the moveable bed condition the variation in thickness of the forest is observed to have no significant difference on the position of maximum scour except for the lowest crown height against the highest two f r conditions i e f r 0 727 and 0 732 almost all the crown heights showed the ps max near the last line of forest tree cylinders i e the downstream end of the forest whereas the ps max further moved inside the forest region in case of the large thickness fig 8c when the h ct was 0 3 or h cy was 0 7 thus the h ct less than 0 5 or h cy 1 1 can cause excessive scouring along with the occurrence of ps max inside the forest region or at the downstream end of the forest that could be very dangerous not only for the forest itself but also for the buildings in the vicinity 3 2 4 average scour behind the forest the landside of the coastal forest is an important region as the excessive scouring behind the forest can result in overturning and washout of the tree stand structures which ultimately results in the production of large driftwood therefore in order to quantify and understand the scour distribution directly behind the forest region the scour data of 10 cm length being the most influenced area for all the cases in general from the forest backend was analyzed and averaged average scour was calculated by the summation of scour readings in the streamwise and lateral directions divided by the total number of readings the scheme of the considered region is shown in fig 9 a fig 9b c shows the relationship between the average scour just behind the forest and non dimensional tree crown height h ct h cy the results showed no significant difference for the low f r conditions however a considerable increase in the average scour values can be observed for the highest two froude conditions i e f r 0 727 and 0 732 which was due to the high approaching flow velocity that resulted in large shear stress at the bed and hence caused more scouring similar to the maximum scour around the forest region the model with the lowest crown height condition i e h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 showed a large and sudden increase especially for the higher f r conditions in the average scour behind the forest i e approximately 90 94 higher in the case of half forest streamwise length l 2 and approximately 70 75 higher in case of large length of the forest l which could be excessive and may cause the eradication of the tree structures from the forest backend on the contrary the average scour behind the forest for medium h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 and highest h ct 0 7 or h cy 1 5 considered crown heights were observed to be almost lower than 1 cm for all the cases which may be considered comparatively satisfactory for the safety of the coastal forest as a defense system in addition to this when h ct was reduced from 0 5 to 0 3 or h cy from 1 1 to 0 7 the average scour profiles generally showed a large steepness even with the noticeably higher magnitudes for the forest with half thickness l 2 as compared to that of forest with l thickness this is because of the reason that the scouring was influenced by the water surface gradient inside the forest region fig 5ii i e higher was the gradient of water surface within the forest larger is the scouring behind the forest as the approaching flow in the forest region is supposed to strike the ground with a high fluid force and thus increasing the intensity of bed shear stress and causing a considerable percentage of scouring 3 2 5 scour initiation around the forest the removal of soil bed material due to the impact of flowing water acting on the ground is an important aspect as it can increase the risk of disaster the location of scour initiation around the forest does not only represent the fluid force and flow velocity exceeding the threshold value but also represents the extent of damage caused to the specific length of the forest therefore the location of scour initiation in this study was also measured the scheme of which is shown in fig 10 a fig 10b demonstrates the start of scouring occurring within the forest region for all the cases the longitudinal length of the forest for both thicknesses l and l 2 was converted to unit length for a better understanding and comparison purpose the horizontal dashed line at scale 1 shows the position of forest start and the horizontal continuous line at scale 0 shows the position of forest end point whereas the red strip shows the starting position of scouring it can be observed that the scour production inside the forest region was influenced by the crown height of the tree and forest thickness parameter against the lowest h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 the scour starts from the very start of the forest indicating that whole of the forest region is affected due to scouring on the other hand the forest with the h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 has comparatively observed to influence substantially less area i e 50 or less than that of the forest length region thus the crown height parameter is observed to be more critical in the perspective of affecting the forest region and its relation to the total tree height and or initial water depth is observed to be very important 4 discussion the coastal forest being the most effective and suitable natural tsunami mitigation measure has been recommended as a strong bioshield against the approaching floods and tsunami currents by many of the previous researchers focused on planting the forest as a combination in the hybrid defense designs ahmed and ghumman 2019 kimiwada et al 2020 however considering the availability of land in the coastal regions as well as other factors like economy especially for the developing countries tanaka et al 2011 it would be sometimes difficult to construct such compound defense systems the coastal forest in previous tsunami events has also been observed to be failed due to washout and breaking of the tree structures tanaka 2012 however the use of the coastal forest as a tsunami mitigation measure is still beneficial as it can significantly reduce the tsunami forces nandasena et al 2008 tanaka and onai 2017 tanaka and ogino 2017 the knowledge regarding the influencing factors leading to the damage of the forest and its failure against the approaching flows could better help in the management of coastal forests as the ecosystem based disaster risk reduction eco drr techniques are always encouraged to eliminate or mitigate the tsunami damages therefore the simple design of tree crown height parameter in relation to that of tree height and or initial water depth of the coastal forest has been elucidated primarily in this study in order to control the production of driftwood and to maintain the sustainability of the forest defense system itself the present study clarified the effectiveness and limitation of the crown part of the trees as well as the thickness of the coastal forest defense system which is a very important aspect of proper designing and management of forestry against the approaching tsunami currents towards the inland regions 4 1 flow structure phenomena the flow structures and scour phenomena are significantly influenced by the variation in crown height of the trees the lowest crown height from the ground resulted in the highest backwater rise at the upstream and largest water surface gradient inside the forest which caused the maximum energy reduction of the flow moreover the highest crown height was observed to be not effective in causing significant flow resistance as the role played by the highest crown was minimum in comparison to the no crown model case the mitigation capability in the form of flow resistance energy reduction of the forest with crown h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 is higher and noteworthy also the large thickness of the forest resulted in increased resistance to the approaching current which consequently resulted in a significantly higher loss of flow energy than that of the forest with half thickness under the same flow conditions thus the outcomes of this study demonstrated that these parameters i e tree crown height and forest thickness are vital for increasing the mitigation capability of the coastal forest although this study showed that the forest with the lowest crown height can significantly play a role in contributing to the maximum reduction of flow energy the resulting flow structures at the same time if strongly influenced can make the forest defense system as unsafe and vulnerable which ultimately decreases the mitigation function of it as witnessed in the results the forest with the lowest crown height configuration can significantly reduce the overflowing volume by causing the large difference in water levels between the forest upstream and downstream regions which on the other hand can result in an excessive scouring because of the increase in the steepness of water surface gradient inside the forest region that ultimately increases the bed shear stress as the flow hits the ground with a high fluid force in the forest downstream the previous researchers also highlighted that when the gradient of water surface within the forest becomes steep the flow progresses with a very high fluid force in the forest downstream that can cause a significant percentage of scouring due to the increased bed shear stress rashedunnabi and tanaka 2020 ali and tanaka 2020 4 2 scouring phenomena as soon as the impact of the overflowing water on bed shear stress surpasses the critical shear stress the scouring process starts the time development of the scour around a cylinder for a solitary wave condition is dependent on the substrate condition tonkin et al 2003 however scouring around a group of cylinders depends on the type of array and it achieves an equilibrium state after a certain time yagci et al 2017 thus the scour characteristics in this study were considered after the equilibrium scour conditions were achieved quezada et al 2018 highlighted that the induced bed shear stress that causes scouring around the cylinders or circular pile structures depends on the flow behavior i e hydrodynamic force carried by the approaching fluid which is also observed in the present study that the scouring is influenced by the flow structures sumer et al 2005 and ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 carried out scour experiments to investigate the local scour around the individual piles while considering the group of piles arrangement piles spacing flow rates and size of sediment for predicting the maximum scour depth they concluded that the induced scour depends much on the spacing of piles later on yagci et al 2017 performed flume experiments to investigate the scouring phenomena around a finite array of cylinders and found that the scour depth and scour volume behind the group of thin circular cylinders reduced as compared to that of a thick cylinder of similar diameter or area they also highlighted that the sparse arrangement of cylinders experiences large scouring due to the turbulence induced eddies shed by the cylinders array formation and thus the scour pattern scour hole and scour evolution was influenced by the type of array recently igarashi et al 2018 also highlighted that the large spacing between the piles cause greater water surface fluctuations behind and reduce the energy reduction they also clarified that this effect can be countered by providing a large number of rows in the cross stream direction and the replacement of piles with the real trees in an actual field case can increase the flow resistance when the crown height is low the present study confirms the increased strength of forest as a bioshield due to increased length of the forest and lowering of tree crown height however at the same time identifies an important concern about the limit of crown height since the overflowing water through the trunk part below the crown part approaches the ground behind the forest with a high fluid force and velocity that could be dangerous a recent study by ali and tanaka 2020 highlighted that the maximum scouring hole around the coastal forest especially the downstream region can be significantly reduced by providing large forest thickness they also clarified that if the bed inside the forest is mobile the position of maximum scouring is moved inside the forest region with the rise in initial flow conditions which is not desirable for the safety of the forest the present study also confirmed such phenomena and further contributes in highlighting the effects of the tree crown the results in this study revealed that the erosion of bed material has found to be in permissible limit for the forest configurations having h ct or h cy equal or greater than 0 5 or 1 1 the scour phenomena occurring against the lowest crown height experienced excessive maximum scouring i e 2 cm critical position of the occurrence of peak scour hole inside or directly behind the forest region while affecting almost the full length of the forest region due to scouring previous research studies found that the root depth of uprooted trees was observed to be approximately 1 5 2m in real scale e g mattheck 2002 2007 de costa and tanaka 2020 which indicate that exceeding such depth of scouring may lead to the washout of the tree structures moreover the position of maximum scouring around the coastal forest is a serious concern as the excessive scouring caused due to increased bed shear stress baykal et al 2015 can uproot and eradicate the tree structures from the forest backend resulting in the production of driftwood tanaka 2012 which will not only cause the damage to the defense system itself but also being a serious threat to the residential areas downstream will cause economic social and ecological losses furthermore considering the influence of forest thickness the forest with a reduced cross shore length i e half forest thickness experienced a substantial reduction in energy loss of the current and a noticeable increase in the scour downstream thus this extra large increase in the scouring behind the forest with less thickness would result in the earlier removal of tree structures from the forest backend i e causing the complete destruction of the forest and a significant reduction in flow resistance to the approaching current would make this defense system as a weak bioshield against the devastating tsunami inundations thus in order to counter measure the inland approaching tsunami currents and increasing the resilience of the social system during huge tsunami attacks and proper forest planning and management it would be better to limit the height of the crown part of the trees and construct the largest possible forest thickness in an actual field 4 3 general even in the designs of hybrid or compound defense systems the driftwood production by the coastal forest located behind the hard structures like embankment occurred tanaka et al 2013 the failure of such designs would cause a great loss to the economy as well thus this study gives the basic idea for future researchers to consider the crown height parameter of the coastal forest while investigating the effectiveness of hybrid or compound mitigation systems against devastating tsunamis moreover the washout of the forest tree structures can also be influenced by the conditions of specific soil and its strength anchored with the roots tanaka and yagisawa 2009 antonellini and mollema 2010 tanaka and ogino 2017 as the weaker root soil strength has the higher risk of the tree being overturned or be washed out nandasena et al 2012 de costa and tanaka 2021 therefore in order to ensure the safety of the coastal forest defense system and the inland residential areas the production of driftwood may also be further controlled by providing some suitable soil material or growing some grass cover or by protecting the directly downstream region of the forest in the form of concreting in order to reduce the impact of the overflowing water in recent decades the relationship between the tree structures of the coastal forest and the damage caused to it by the tsunami events have gained vital importance after the plantation of trees in coastal regions the forestry management practices like forest thinning largely affects the tree characteristics i e tree trunk and crown part igarashi et al 2019 the differences in forest management techniques also influence the effectiveness of the mitigation function as well as the level of secondary disaster caused in a large flood or tsunami event tanaka et al 2018 although the previous studies e g hiraishi and harada 2003 tanaka et al 2007 igarashi et al 2019 contributed to increase the knowledge about the management of coastal forests for increasing the mitigation functions in terms of tree density and tree diameter based on the reduction effects of fluid force this study further contributes to provide important knowledge about the role of the coastal forest as a bioshield implying the influence and control of tree crown height and forest stream wise length in order to increase its mitigation function and to possibly reduce the scouring behind the forest and therefore reducing the production of driftwood in general this study supports the utilization of coastal forest as a natural effective and economical solution but also elucidates the technique that could be adopted to reduce the damage caused in extreme tsunami events thus in general while designing and managing the coastal forests for tsunami based disaster risk reductions the potential factor of controlling the tree crown height should be accounted for the present study considered modeled the tsunami inundation and the coastal forest focused on the inland regions assuming the more relevant case scenario of subcritical flow conditions that is why the phenomena of water retreatment from the beach have been ignored in this study the present study found a scour hole on the downstream side of the forest however there could be some scouring on the other side of the forest in real tsunami events when water retreats from the beach this phenomenon is likely supposed to occur in the scenario of forest defense system around the coastal region i e close to beach shoreline where the flow is usually supercritical in both scenarios the sustainability of the forest defense system is very important and necessary thus the understanding of the influencing factor like the crown part of the tree needs to be explored and developed therefore this scenario of water retreatment from the beach could further be investigated to clarify the phenomena considering the replication of the gravel bed material to that of the real cohesive sediment although the final stable shape of the scour may be similar but the time developing process and the quantitative value may be different because of the scale effect the mode of sediment transport and the characteristics of scour profile may vary when the finer sediment like cohesive soil is used therefore it is further recommended to investigate the pattern of erosion using the cohesive soil as a moveable bed material for further clarifying the phenomena and applicability of this research in a broader perspective 5 summary the effectiveness of crown height variation of the coastal forest against the inland approaching tsunami has been elucidated under the subcritical flow conditions the mitigation capability and the vulnerability of the forest defense system has been observed to be associated with the energy reduction and scouring phenomena due to the impact of high fluid force of the approaching tsunami current this study summarizes that the flow structures and scour phenomena are strongly influenced by the variation in tree crown height the mitigation capability of the forest defense system in the form of relative flow energy reduction has an indirect relation with the tree crown height i e the relative flow energy reduction increases with the decrease in crown height from the ground level despite being capable of dissipating the highest percentage of energy of the approaching tsunami current with the lowest crown height i e h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 this condition among all cases experiences the large excessive scouring around the forest which can allow the complete destruction of the forest thus the overall reduction in the mitigation function with large exposure to vulnerability makes the forest defense system with the lowest crown height as an unsafe bioshield for future tsunamis the optimum results in the form of flow resistance and permissible scouring around the forest occurs at medium crown height i e h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 thus the threshold or critical value of the ratio of crown height to tree height could be possibly set as h ct 0 5 or the relationship between the crown height and the initial water depth could be considered critical at h cy 1 1 for the inland coastal forest management in order to sustain the tsunami fluid forces and less production of the driftwood in addition this study also encourages to construct the largest possible forest thickness that could act as a stronger shield against tsunamis therefore in order to increase the resilience of the social defense system during huge tsunami attacks and for the proper forest planning and management it would be better to limit the height of the tree crown in the coastal forest in order to reduce excessive scouring and control driftwood production the coastal forest thickness perpendicular to the shoreline has been considered in this study therefore the important knowledge about considering the effects of aspect ratio length along the shoreline direction length of cross shore direction of the coastal forest on tsunami mitigation is still lacking and needs to be explored hence leading on from this research work further study on elucidating the effects of crown height on scour pattern phenomena relating the shear stress distribution while considering the influence of aspect ratio would allow the forest planners and designers to propose an effective and applicable mitigation strategy against tsunamis and floods in the

20226,this research investigated the relationship of tree crown height with the trunk part under the mobile bed condition for the proper management of inland coastal forests a series of flume experiments under the quasi steady flow conditions were performed while varying different parameters like change in crown heights from the ground highest h ct 0 7 medium h ct 0 5 and lowest h ct 0 3 where h ct h c h t h ct is the non dimensional parameter h c is the crown height from ground and h t is the tree height forest thicknesses in the streamwise direction i e l and l 2 where l is the forest length and initial froude number conditions f r ranging from 0 668 to 0 732 the outcomes demonstrated that the flow structures are strongly influenced by the lowest crown height i e h ct 0 3 causing the maximum flow energy reduction i e 40 43 on the contrary the scour produced around the forest due to the high impact force of overflowing water became excessive that can significantly damage the coastal forest defense system the optimum results in the form of significant energy reduction of the approaching current and minimum vulnerability permissible scouring of the defense system have been observed to be associated with the medium crown height i e h ct 0 5 and largest possible forest thickness keywords tsunami current defense system coastal forest management tree crown flow structures scour phenomena 1 introduction when a large flood like a tsunami is occurred and reaches the shore of the coast some part of it is reflected back while some part of it runs up approaching the coastal region and then the inland regions the approaching tsunami current carries large energy and high fluid force that causes a huge disaster in the coastal and inland regions udo et al 2012 to mitigate the tsunami damage a coastal forest has been observed to be an effective natural solution despite the fact that it does not completely diminish the tsunami flow energy the effectiveness of the forest varies with the approaching tsunami level forest arrangement and strength of the substrate shuto 1987 the coastal forest is not only the economical solution against the tsunami propagation but it also performs a natural function of tsunami disaster reduction and delays the overflowing volume of water harada and imamura 2000 hiraishi and harada 2003 on the contrary when a high level tsunami breaks through the coastal and inland regions travelling with a high fluid force and velocity it damages and uproots the tree structures from the forest cochard et al 2008 the field investigations in the kanto and tohoku regions of japan carried by tanaka 2012 and udo et al 2012 after the 2011 great east japan tsunami gejt observed that many of the tree structures within the forest region were broken and destroyed which was mainly due to the high fluid force and significant scouring many of the previous researchers indicated that the driftwood production is due to the large moment acting on the trees because of the sudden impact of flowing water local scour around the tree structures within the forest region and poor root strength of the substrate shuto 1993 tanaka and yagisawa 2009 huang et al 2011 behrens and dias 2015 the washout or damaged trees may collide and cause significant damage to the buildings and residential properties in the inland regions de costa and tanaka 2020 therefore the high fluid force and the steep water slope just behind the forest must be possibly controlled to avoid the destruction of the forest itself that may otherwise cause economical ecological and social losses the driftwood generation does not only take place behind the embankment structure and in front of the coastal forest but also from the landward side of the forest tanaka 2012 the flow passing through the coastal forest defense system experiences resistance from the tree structures with a backwater rise at the front of the forest however the water surface gradient inside the forest becomes steep iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 which increases the flow velocity behind the forest and shear stress acting on the ground thus the high shear stress on the ground causes the soil particles to get erode and separated from the landward side tanaka et al 2007 leading to the production of scouring just behind the forest hence it could lead to the generation of dangerous zone behind the forest tanaka 2012 iimura and tanaka 2013 that can result in the eradication of the tree structures from the forest backend a managed inland coastal forest with a large trunk diameter and a higher crown height of the trees to resist a high level tsunami current and capturing the driftwood was recommended by tanaka et al 2018 a suitable managing and proper planning of the forest are necessary for increasing the resilience of the social system especially during the attack of large tsunamis pasha and tanaka 2016 although the breaking pattern of trees and driftwood production were previously clarified tanaka and onai 2017 tanaka and ogino 2017 not much attention has been paid to the scouring around the tree forest focused on the influence of the tree crown part therefore an understanding of the management of coastal forests needs to be developed for an effective mitigation strategy against the approaching tsunamis research has been previously conducted on the scour pattern around a single cylinder of circular shape e g roulund et al 2005 debnath and chaudhuri 2010 baykal et al 2015 tonkin et al 2003 pointed out that the scour development around the cylinder with time is primarily dependent on the condition of the substrate for solitary wave an experimental study conducted by yagci et al 2017 investigated the scour distribution around a combined arrangement of circular cylinders under steady and clear water conditions ali and tanaka 2020 conducted an experimental study on scouring around the coastal forest and concluded that the maximum scour hole moves inside the forest region under the gravel bed mobile conditions because of the failure of the defense systems against the approaching tsunamis most of the researchers proposed hybrid or compound mitigation strategies in recent decades including hard as well as natural structures tanaka et al 2006 igarashi and tanaka 2018 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 anjum and tanaka 2020a however the construction of such defense systems needs more space in the coastal and inland regions and it could be very expensive especially for the developing countries therefore an effective tsunami mitigation bioshield should be proposed that could be practically applicable in the field and economically possible for developing nations the previously conducted studies e g irtem et al 2009 ismail et al 2012 including physical as well as computational modeling used the simplified tree model in the form of a circular cylinder as a replica although the crown part of the tree and its height from the ground has significant importance which showed noteworthy differences in the damage during a post tsunami survey after the gejt sato et al 2012 to elucidate the effectiveness and influence of the complete tree structure in a forest it is very important to replicate both parts of the tree i e trunk and crown part while modeling it physically or numerically although some of the previous studies highlighted the importance of the crown part of the trees focused on breaking patterns tanaka et al 2013 2015 2018 not many studies paid special attention on the variation of the flow structures scour distributions and the resistance caused due to the change in height of the crown part of trees there is still a lack of knowledge on how the tree stand structures are eradicated from the forest backend and how important the crown height from the ground is regarding the optimum resistance and resilience of the defense system itself therefore the relationship between the crown part and trunk part of the tree in a coastal forest is still needed to be explored the understanding of the correlation between the type of tree structures and its damage produced by the tsunami has been a vital part of research in the recent decade the management practices can significantly influence the extent of damage caused to the tree stand structures within the coastal forest thus for the proper construction and management of the coastal forest for tsunami risk reduction the flood mitigation effects and limitations of the tree crown height from the ground should be clarified this research will contribute to developing an understanding of the influence of the tree crown height and fulfilling the gap in the literature as well therefore the specific objectives of this study were to a investigate the effects of tree crown height of the forest on the tsunami mitigation capability and scour pattern under the moveable gravel bed condition b demonstrate the flow structure changes and energy reduction while comparison with the varying conditions of forest thickness and crown part and c develop and propose an effective bioshield against the inland approaching tsunami currents that can sustain the impact of the intense tsunami fluid forces and produce less driftwood due to scouring around the coastal forest 2 methods 2 1 experimental setup and procedures 2 1 1 flume characteristics the laboratory experiments were performed at saitama university japan in a glass sided flume having the dimensions of 14m long 0 5m wide and 0 4m deep under the constant bed slope condition of 1 700 a model scale of 1 100 was used for this study the schematic diagram of the experimental setup showing all the flume characteristics is presented in fig 1 a the flow discharge was circulated through the flume channel and tunnel using an electric pump being controlled by a connected flow controlling pc 2 1 2 flow conditions the tsunami related previous studies matsutomi et al 2011 spiske et al 2010 pasha et al 2018 adopted quasi steady flow conditions for understanding the basics around the inland forest region the approaching tsunamis can have long flow durations nandasena et al 2012 schimmels et al 2014 therefore to replicate a long flow duration in the laboratory flume quasi steady condition of flow was generated and assumed to be appropriate for this study for this physical experiment froude similarity was implemented to set the model scale after the 2011 gejt the flow was observed to be subcritical at many regions around the inland forest spiske et al 2010 tanaka et al 2013 with the froude numbers f r v o gy o 0 5 where v o is the depth averaged velocity m s g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 and y o is the flow depth ranging from 0 6 to 1 initially several calibrations were done in the experimental flume in order to achieve the desired range of froude numbers hence four initial froude numbers i e f r of 0 668 0 700 0 727 and 0 732 were finally set when there was nothing placed in the flume channel for the experiments which were achieved against the initial flow depths i e y o of approximately 5 6 7 and 8 cm respectively the characteristics of tsunami inundations in the study were considered in general being not specific to any particular location the flow conditions considered for this study are presented in table 1 2 1 3 soil characteristics the soil bed layer was prepared with the gravel particles material having a median grain size d 50 of approximately 4 5 mm with a dry density of 2650 kg m3 in the real scenario soil like clay or sand is usually cohesive and handling this kind of soil becomes difficult in experimental runs since the similitudes are fundamental and important in performing any modeling experiments the similarity law of the clear water scour mechanism was considered in this study for taking account of the similitude of the water soil bed interaction the so called clear water condition occurs when a ridge is present downstream of the scour hole with no sediment transport downstream of a mobile bed it practically reaches its final configuration i e developed stage pagliara 2007 quezada et al 2018 previous research studies e g lenzi and comiti 2003 pagliara 2007 afreen et al 2015 also considered clear water scour conditions while adopting gravel particles because it is widely accepted that maximum scouring is achieved under these conditions ali and tanaka 2020 rahman et al 2021 therefore the gravel particles focused on clear water scour with equilibrium conditions were considered in this study following the similarity law a gravel bed of 2m in the upstream and 2 5m in the downstream region of the forest model was set in the experimental flume covering the full width of the flume and having a depth of approximately 18 cm as shown in fig 1d moreover a flat plate wooden material with a similar depth to that of the material was also placed at the end of the soil layer as a support in order to keep the soil material not to be completely washout during the flow 2 2 model design the present study considered japanese tree species for the forest model with the average tree height of 15m and diameter of 0 4m which was found in the sendai coastal regions tanaka 2012 in addition to the tsunami inundation depths and froude similarity observed in an actual tsunami other parameters like tree characteristics were also imitated and scaled down for a better representation considering the possibility of modeling the tree trunk in the form of a circular cylinder as has been done by previous researchers e g tanaka et al 2014 rahman et al 2020 the circular cylinders of wooden material with 18 cm tree height h t and 0 4 cm tree diameter d on a model scale of 1 100 was used as a replica of tree trunk structures in addition to this the tree crown part can provide larger resistance than that of the trunk part but it depends on the flow depth hence while considering a natural condition the relationship becomes complicated therefore the crown part was also modeled in the form of circular cylinders keeping the same diameter i e d 0 4 cm as a first step modeling for simplicity as shown in the scheme in fig 1b however based on the resistance from both parts of the tree and the possible construction and application of forest in the actual field the density of forest was maintained in this study previous researchers e g takemura and tanaka 2007 pasha and tanaka 2017 highlighted that the tree density can be represented by g d where g is the clear spacing between the cylinders factor with 2 135 as sparse 1 09 as intermediate and 0 25 as dense configuration therefore the sparse arrangement of tree models as the tall trees require large spacing to grow well and the dense arrangement of the crown model as the crown part is denser were considered in the form of staggered arrangement as shown in fig 1c that can significantly influence the flow structures takemura and tanaka 2007 anjum and tanaka 2020b these values of g d 2 125 sparse configuration for tree trunk arrangement and g d 0 041 dense configuration for tree crown arrangement were used to calculate the porosity p r of each configuration of the forest giving values of approximately 98 and 79 porosity respectively the porosity based on cylinders density was calculated by equation 1 iimura and tanaka 2012 1 p r 1 n t π d 2 4 where n t is the number of cylinders per unit area which represents the density of trees the cross shore streamwise direction forest length l considered in this study resembles the forest thickness such that the soil around the tree structures may get scoured and the fringe of the forest may get damaged shuto 1987 the forest models were prepared by drilling holes in a wooden flat plate in which the circular cylinders were inserted which were then mounted on the flume bed the individual models of the forest were placed at a distance of approximately 4 9m from the inlet of the experimental flume covering the entire flume width crosswise the forest configurations and the cases considered in this study are presented in table 1 as the primary objective of this study was to explore the effect of tree crown height h c therefore it was considered as a varying parameter similar to the modeling of tree height and diameter other tree characteristics like the tree trunk and tree crown parts were also imitated in this study for better replication of the modeled structures thus the tree characteristics data were considered from a previous research study that was measured in the actual field of the coastal regions tanaka et al 2018 therefore using a non dimensional parameter for the crown height variation de costa and tanaka 2021 i e h ct h c h t where h ct is the non dimensional parameter for the crown height variation h c is the height of the crown from the ground and h t is the total tree height three different ratios of 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 were considered in order to elucidate the influence of tree crown height from the ground for the management of forestry for the general applicability of this research outcomes to other cases and also for a better understanding of the important relationship of crown height with that of the initial water depth i e without forest the tree crown height has also been non dimensionalized with respect to the initial water depth being the more dominant factor in this study for non dimensionalizing thus the non dimensional crown height parameter i e h cy h c y o where y o is the highest initial water depth also gave three approximate values of 0 7 1 1 and 1 5 hence the results will be discussed with respect to both parameters i e h ct and h cy for a clear understanding the ratio h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 represents the lowest crown height from the ground h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 represents the medium crown height whereas h ct 0 7 or h cy 1 5 represents the highest crown height the tree characteristics detail is also presented in table 1 furthermore as the thickness of the forest model also plays an important role in the flow structure variation and reduction of the tsunami current energy pasha and tanaka 2017 therefore two forest thicknesses i e l and l 2 were considered and investigated in this study under the same flow conditions in order to further clarify the importance of this parameter in addition to this a case with a forest thickness of l was also considered in this study having no crown n c part i e with only the trunk part of the trees for the comparison purpose thus the response of different forest configurations was explored against the approaching tsunami current under the varying flow conditions 2 3 measurement and analysis 2 3 1 water surface measurement after the placement of forest models in the experimental flume the characteristics of the flow and the bed profiles varied significantly the scheme of the resulting flow structures and scour pattern is shown in fig 1e during the flow duration the experiment was recorded with a video camera olympus tg 835 with a frame rate of 1 30 in order to analyze and get the variations in the water surface later on as the tsunami current duration was not long enough to measure the elevations of the water surface using a point gauge manually the water elevations were measured throughout the considered length of the flume at an interval of 1 10 cm depending on the variation in the water surface all the crests and troughs were measured moreover the oscillations in the water surface profile especially near the forest model make the flow very complex and difficult to measure by a simple point gauge and hence the instantaneous readings could not be considered satisfactory in such a case therefore the variation in the water levels i e minimum and maximum water depths at each location were recorded through several consecutive frames which were then averaged to get the water surface profile this data of water surface profiles was then utilized to calculate the flow structure properties 2 3 2 energy reduction the resistance by the coastal forest causes the reduction of flow energy in the downstream region iimura and tanaka 2012 as defined by chow 1959 the specific energy is the energy of water per unit volume over a location measured with reference to the bed of the channel the equation used for calculating the specific energy in the upstream and downstream of the forest model is given as 2 e y α v 2 2 g where e is the specific energy y is the elevation of water α is the coefficient for accounting the velocity variations which was taken as 1 in this study v is the depth averaged velocity which was calculated using the continuity relation v q a where q and a are known discharge and area respectively the noteworthy difference in the water surface profile between the upstream and downstream regions of the forest model resulted in the reduction of flow energy therefore the relative flow energy reductionδe through the forest was calculated by 3 δ e e 1 e 3 e 1 x 100 where e 1 is the mean specific energy in the forest upstream and e 3 is the mean specific energy in the forest downstream region 2 3 3 scour measurement after the flow approached the forest model the regions around the forest especially the downstream were influenced significantly causing the soil to get erode and scouring was generated as shown in fig 1e a bed profile before running the flow was recorded for calculating the difference with the profile resulting after the flow passed through the forest model after the conduction of flow experiments the resulting bed profiles i e deposition and scouring were measured with the help of a laser displacement gauge keyence lk 500 which were then used to calculate the scour properties the scour data was measured at an interval of 2 5 cm depending on the bed profile variation in both lateral y and streamwise x directions the scour data in the y direction was subsequently averaged to get the bed scour profile along the channel length moreover the scour profile data was also used to calculate the scour properties 2 3 4 tsunami current duration at the start of the flow the scoured region around the forest was rapidly changing then gradually and then very slightly with the passage of time thus as the scoured region and scour profile changes with the passage of time tonkin et al 2003 therefore a developed stage of scour was supposed to achieve in this study in order to certify the equilibrium condition in general the calibrations were initially performed to adopt a suitable tsunami duration for this physical experiment five flow durations of 1 2 3 4 and 5 min in model scale were considered for the calibrations the time series data of the scour development against the maximum considered froude number condition i e f r 0 732 is presented in fig 2 a b the scour profiles along the channel length fig 2a and the maximum scour depth inside the forest model fig 2b are observed to be stable developed at a flow duration of 4 min after which the data analysis and visualization showed no noteworthy variations in the scour properties thus the flow duration of 5 min was finally selected for further experiments moreover this flow duration becomes 50 min when the physical scale is 1 100 considering the froude similarity law which can be considered appropriate to the actual tsunami duration 3 results after the modeled tsunami current propagated and reached the inland region the forest model produced significant drag to the approaching flow and hence distinct flow patterns were observed for the respective configurations of the forest fig 3 not only the flow structures but also the bed profiles varied depending on the flow conditions and forest configurations fig 3a g shows the water level variations and the resulting scour patterns for all the cases against the maximum f r 0 732 conditions that were visually observed in the physical experiment it can be seen that the disparity in the flow structures and scour phenomena are mainly influenced by the change in crown height from the ground both properties i e flow structures and scour distribution around the coastal forest plays an important role in the efficiency of the tsunami mitigation strategy and the safety of the defense system itself therefore the quantification of the resulting parameters is necessary to elucidate the effectiveness of the defense structure hence the profiles of water surface elevations and bed variations were analyzed to replicate the resulting phenomenon and to compute the resulting parameters 3 1 flow structures the water surface profiles and scour distributions for the considered forest configurations are presented in fig 4 in the fig n c stands for no crown h ct crown height tree height y o is the initial water depth the horizontal continuous line shows the water surface profile the horizontal dashed line shows the scour profile along the channel and the vertical dotted lines shows the forest start and end in all the cases the flow experienced noticeable drag offered by the tree models in the forest region that caused the water level to rise in front of the forest followed by a water surface gradient occurring within the forest region thus a water level difference was formed between the forest upstream and downstream regions which contributes to the reduction of flow energy iimura and tanaka 2012 in cases of half forest thickness i e l 2 fig 4 ii a d the intensity of variation of the flow depth especially in the forest upstream can be observed to be noticeably low than that of the cases with a forest thickness l fig 4i a d in the initial f r settings of approximately 0 668 and 0 70 except the case with the lowest crown height i e h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 no noticeable difference between the n c model case and h ct 0 5 0 7 h cy 1 1 1 5 cases is observed for most of the considered f r conditions water surface profile in the forest downstream region showed undulation type structure in all the configurations except the forest with h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 in both l and l 2 cases in case of h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 the water surface became almost horizontally flat without showing any undulations kind of structures can be seen in fig 3 with a constant decreasing slope of approximately 0 04 and a reduction rate of approximately 33 thus the flow depth became even lower than the normal initial flow depth at some distance from the forest backend that caused the increment of average velocity in this region which could be dangerous for the hinterland regions thus the flow structure properties like water level rise in the forest front water surface gradient inside the forest region and the resulting reduction of flow energy due to the resistance offered by the forest models need to be quantified in order to clearly understand the effectiveness of the considered model configurations 3 1 1 water level rise the drag offered by the tree structures in the forest region resulted in the reflection of the water wave which caused the flow depth to rise significantly at the forest front this result of the increase in the water surface in the upstream region of the forest is logical and consistent with the previous tsunami related studies e g iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 the water level rise δh y 1 y o where y 1 is the averaged flow depth in front of the forest model and y o is the initial flow depth for all the cases is presented in fig 5 i a b the water level rise increased almost linearly with the increase in f r condition for all the considered configurations compared to that of the cases with half forest thickness l 2 fig 5i b the rise of the water level was noticeably higher i e 25 36 for the cases with the forest thickness of l fig 5i a thus the increment in forest thickness indicates an increase in the forest resistance being more capable to produce higher drag and showing consistency to the results highlighted by pasha and tanaka 2017 the understanding of the influence of crown height can also be developed by this results data for both forest thicknesses l and l 2 the largest water level rise can be found for the lowest crown height case h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 compared to the other crown height cases or n c case this is because of the reason that by keeping the lowest distance height of the tree crown part from the ground level the largest possible drag is offered by the dense crown part and hence it becomes more active in producing resistance as the flow interacts with most part of the crown structures as can also be seen in fig 3 furthermore although the water level rise with respect to the initial flow depth was larger for the highest f r 0 732 the linearly increasing trend was not followed in case of h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 this may be due to the reason that there was a significant increase in scouring downstream of the forest for this lowest crown height condition the influence of the medium crown height i e h ct 0 5 h cy 1 1 on the water level rise is also observed to be not negligible compared to that of n c case or highest crown model case i e h ct 0 7 or h cy 1 5 fig 5i a these results indicate that the water level rise in the forest front depends on the thickness of the forest the height of the crown from the ground and the bed condition 3 1 2 water surface gradient the passing flow through the forest region was resisted by the tree structures hence caused the water surface gradient inside the forest which directly influences the scouring just behind the forest ali and tanaka 2020 fig 5 ii a b demonstrates the water surface gradient tanθ against the considered f r conditions the results showed that the tanθ increased linearly with the increase in f r value for all the considered cases however the linearly increasing trend isn t followed by the lowest crown model case i e h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 for the highest initial considered settings of f r 0 727 and f r 0 732 this may be due to the reason that there was a significant change in the bed condition against these flow conditions which resulted by the occurrence of scouring phenomena inside as well as directly behind the forest region and hence ultimately affected the flow structures similar to the water level rise at the forest front the tanθ is also significantly influenced by the variation in tree crown height i e lower is the crown height from the ground level higher is the gradient of water surface inside the forest model region and vice versa as compared to the n c model case the tanθ is found to be increased by approximately 5 17 and 25 42 for the cases with the crown heights of h ct 0 5 h cy 1 1 and h ct 0 3 h cy 0 7 respectively with the forest thickness of l whereas in the case of half forest thickness i e l 2 the corresponding percentage differences are found to be approximately 30 40 and 50 60 thus it indicates the importance of tree crown height which influences the water surface gradient inside the forest region i e an inverse relation is found between the tree crown height and water surface slope inside the forest region moreover the tanθ is observed to increase by a percentage difference of approximately 21 35 when the thickness of forest was reduced to half length thus the forest with the large thickness produced minimum as well as comparatively less gradient showing the importance of thick forest against the approaching current and this result is also found to be consistent with the experimental study conducted by pasha and tanaka 2017 3 1 3 the relative flow energy reduction δe the relative flow energy reduction δe through the forest is the difference between the specific energy at the upstream and downstream of it as discussed in the previous sections the resistance offered by the tree structures of the forest raised the water level upstream of it with the formation of water surface gradient inside the forest region followed by a reduced flow depth in the forest downstream region this caused a significant water level difference between the forest upstream and downstream regions depending upon the forest configurations which consequently resulted in the loss of current energy behind the forest the relationship between δe and the considered f r conditions is presented in fig 6 a b when the f r condition was varied from 0 668 to 0 721 the δe showed no significant variations and remained almost unchanged for most of the cases the results show that the relative reduction of the flow energy is nearly independent of the froude conditions or initial flow depths which is also consistent with the previous research work pasha and tanaka 2017 in other words it can be concluded that as the flow with a relatively high froude number approaches the forest with large energy fluid force and velocity the resistance by the forest also increases causing a larger backwater rise as well as mean specific energy at the forest upstream as compared to that of the approaching flow with a relatively low froude number thus the effectiveness of the considered model also increases while dissipating the almost same percentage of relative flow energy at low as well as high froude conditions since the results of the difference of the flow specific energies at the forest upstream and downstream are presented in relation to the e 1 therefore the relative energy reduction becomes nearly independent of f r however the graph results showed a slightly decreasing trend only for h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 against the highest two f r conditions which might be due to the reason that the resulting flow structures and scour phenomena were influenced for these two flow conditions as already discussed in the previous section the outcomes of δe again showed the importance and influence of tree crown height and forest thickness parameter fig 6 also shows that in all the studied cases the maximum δe i e 43 was found to be associated with the lowest tree crown height h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 with a forest thickness of l whereas it was approximately 34 with a forest thickness of l 2 in comparison to the n c model case the forest configurations with the crown heights at h ct 0 3 h cy 0 7 and h ct 0 5 h cy 1 1 showed an increasing percentage of 18 26 and 5 12 respectively in δe on the contrary the crown height of h ct 0 7 or h cy 1 5 showed no significant influence on the resulting flow structures and hence caused no variations in δe indicating that the resistance role is played only when the crown height h ct or h cy is less than 0 7 or 1 5 moreover considering the forest thickness parameter when the forest thickness was reduced to half length the δe also generally reduced by a significant percentage of approximately 20 35 this indicates the importance of thick forest being more capable of opposing the flow approaching towards the inland region 3 2 scour distribution despite being more influential on the resulting flow structures and δe the lowest tree crown height from the ground could have more negative impacts like excessive scouring of the bed due to the increased bed shear stress as can be visualized in fig 3 hence it is very important to quantify and clarify the scour phenomena and impacts of the considered forest configurations thus the results about the scour distribution around the forest region are presented in next section for a better understanding it has been observed that the external flow structures have not only affected the δe but also influenced the bed profile depending upon the forest configuration which can be visualized in fig 4 it can be observed from the bed profile that the upstream region of the forest is almost unaffected in all the cases with a small deposition just in the forest front followed by a considerable amount of scouring within the forest as well as just behind the forest the extent of which depends on the crown height and initial setting of f r moreover further downstream region of the forest was also slightly influenced thus focusing on the important aspect of forest vulnerability it is necessary to quantify the scour properties i e scour distributions around the forest for a clear understanding and managing the tree crown height the scour properties are discussed below 3 2 1 contour plot distribution the visualized contour plot distribution of the scour phenomena for all the considered forest configurations is presented in fig 7 the x axis represents the stream wise length of the forest with 0 cm indicating the location of the forest backend whereas the y axis represents the crosswise channel width the positive and negative values indicate the deposition and scouring respectively it can be observed that the region just behind the forest i e an approximate length of 10 cm region was more influenced in all the cases where the larger magnitudes of scouring were resulted it is obvious from this spatial distribution of the bed scour that the peak excessive magnitudes of scouring just behind the forest occurred in case of lowest crown height i e h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 in both forest thicknesses in comparison to those of h ct 0 5 h cy 1 1 h ct 0 7 h cy 1 5 and n c cases thus this excessive scouring directly behind the forest with crown height h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 could lead to washout of the tree structures and generation of the driftwood that can also cause secondary damage to the inland residential areas 3 2 2 maximum scour around the forest the scour distribution profiles were analyzed to quantify the important parameters like maximum scour around the forest region fig 8 a b shows the relationship between the maximum local scour and crown height variation h ct h cy the results of maximum scour have been plotted against both parameters h ct h cy for a better understanding of the relationship of crown height to that of tree height as well as initial water depth respectively it can be observed that the maximum scour magnitudes increased with the increase in f r condition in almost all the considered cases the difference of which is found to be highly dependent on the height of the tree crown the increase in maximum scour depth with the increase in the initial setting of f r value is logical because the approaching flow with a higher froude number comprises higher flow velocity which increases the shear stress acting on the bed soil and hence results in a large scour depth this result is also consistent with the outcomes presented in previous research studies e g balachandar et al 2000 kells et al 2001 the crown height is observed to have significantly influenced the magnitudes of maximum scour around the forest fig 8a b except for the lowest initial setting of f r 0 668 in which the crown has no noticeable influence the trend is such that the opposite logarithmic profile pattern is observed and the slope of the profile is also found to become steeper with the decrement in crown height the lowest magnitudes are found against the highest considered crown height i e h ct 0 7 or h cy 1 5 and vice versa furthermore the scour magnitudes at h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 are found to be lower than 2 cm which could be considered in the permissible limit and hence can be regarded as the critical limit in this study in terms of optimum results of the scour phenomena on the other hand the fig also shows that the peak scour depth magnitudes showed a sudden rise as the h ct or h cy became lower than 0 5 or 1 1 the forest model with the lowest crown height h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 showed comparatively very large amount of scouring magnitudes particularly for the highest two considered froude number conditions f r 0 727 and 0 732 i e about 83 86 higher in case of half stream wise length of the forest l 2 and about 75 80 higher in case of larger length of the forest l this is due to the reason that the lowest crown offered large flow resistance especially against the two mentioned flow conditions increased the water surface gradient inside the forest region fig 5ii and allowed the flow to hit the ground with a large impact force which resulted in an increase in the bed shear stress and thus ultimately resulted in an excessive scouring thus the results demonstrated that the forest could become more exposed to excessive scouring with the h ct or h cy lower than 0 5 or 1 1 from a physical point of view the crown height of coastal trees in early young ages is low and the resistance towards tsunami flows would be large by the crown part than that by the trunk part however on the other hand the overflowing water especially through the lower part of the tree i e trunk part may carry high fluid forces that can easily initiate the scouring process and may become responsible for the driftwood production despite the fact that large forest length is provided as a stronger bioshield against tsunami inundations therefore it can be said that when the crown height h ct of trees in a coastal forest in actual filed is less than 0 5 there may be a large possibility of the forest vulnerability 3 2 3 position of maximum scouring fig 8c d shows the relationship between the position of maximum scouring and the initial froude number condition the horizontal dotted line represents the boundary i e the backend of the forest the position of maximum scouring x is made non dimensional with the length of the forest l i e ps max x l the values after the boundary line right side shows that the maximum scour depth is occurred downstream of the forest and the values before the boundary line left side shows that ps max is occurred within the forest region whereas the values on the boundary line shows the occurrence of ps max at exactly the forest backend location the ps max is observed to be away from the downstream end of the forest model at the minimum considered f r condition i e 0 668 however it moved back towards the forest backend region with the increase in f r condition for almost all the cases this result is consistent with the results found by ali and tanaka 2020 in their research study under the moveable bed condition the variation in thickness of the forest is observed to have no significant difference on the position of maximum scour except for the lowest crown height against the highest two f r conditions i e f r 0 727 and 0 732 almost all the crown heights showed the ps max near the last line of forest tree cylinders i e the downstream end of the forest whereas the ps max further moved inside the forest region in case of the large thickness fig 8c when the h ct was 0 3 or h cy was 0 7 thus the h ct less than 0 5 or h cy 1 1 can cause excessive scouring along with the occurrence of ps max inside the forest region or at the downstream end of the forest that could be very dangerous not only for the forest itself but also for the buildings in the vicinity 3 2 4 average scour behind the forest the landside of the coastal forest is an important region as the excessive scouring behind the forest can result in overturning and washout of the tree stand structures which ultimately results in the production of large driftwood therefore in order to quantify and understand the scour distribution directly behind the forest region the scour data of 10 cm length being the most influenced area for all the cases in general from the forest backend was analyzed and averaged average scour was calculated by the summation of scour readings in the streamwise and lateral directions divided by the total number of readings the scheme of the considered region is shown in fig 9 a fig 9b c shows the relationship between the average scour just behind the forest and non dimensional tree crown height h ct h cy the results showed no significant difference for the low f r conditions however a considerable increase in the average scour values can be observed for the highest two froude conditions i e f r 0 727 and 0 732 which was due to the high approaching flow velocity that resulted in large shear stress at the bed and hence caused more scouring similar to the maximum scour around the forest region the model with the lowest crown height condition i e h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 showed a large and sudden increase especially for the higher f r conditions in the average scour behind the forest i e approximately 90 94 higher in the case of half forest streamwise length l 2 and approximately 70 75 higher in case of large length of the forest l which could be excessive and may cause the eradication of the tree structures from the forest backend on the contrary the average scour behind the forest for medium h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 and highest h ct 0 7 or h cy 1 5 considered crown heights were observed to be almost lower than 1 cm for all the cases which may be considered comparatively satisfactory for the safety of the coastal forest as a defense system in addition to this when h ct was reduced from 0 5 to 0 3 or h cy from 1 1 to 0 7 the average scour profiles generally showed a large steepness even with the noticeably higher magnitudes for the forest with half thickness l 2 as compared to that of forest with l thickness this is because of the reason that the scouring was influenced by the water surface gradient inside the forest region fig 5ii i e higher was the gradient of water surface within the forest larger is the scouring behind the forest as the approaching flow in the forest region is supposed to strike the ground with a high fluid force and thus increasing the intensity of bed shear stress and causing a considerable percentage of scouring 3 2 5 scour initiation around the forest the removal of soil bed material due to the impact of flowing water acting on the ground is an important aspect as it can increase the risk of disaster the location of scour initiation around the forest does not only represent the fluid force and flow velocity exceeding the threshold value but also represents the extent of damage caused to the specific length of the forest therefore the location of scour initiation in this study was also measured the scheme of which is shown in fig 10 a fig 10b demonstrates the start of scouring occurring within the forest region for all the cases the longitudinal length of the forest for both thicknesses l and l 2 was converted to unit length for a better understanding and comparison purpose the horizontal dashed line at scale 1 shows the position of forest start and the horizontal continuous line at scale 0 shows the position of forest end point whereas the red strip shows the starting position of scouring it can be observed that the scour production inside the forest region was influenced by the crown height of the tree and forest thickness parameter against the lowest h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 the scour starts from the very start of the forest indicating that whole of the forest region is affected due to scouring on the other hand the forest with the h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 has comparatively observed to influence substantially less area i e 50 or less than that of the forest length region thus the crown height parameter is observed to be more critical in the perspective of affecting the forest region and its relation to the total tree height and or initial water depth is observed to be very important 4 discussion the coastal forest being the most effective and suitable natural tsunami mitigation measure has been recommended as a strong bioshield against the approaching floods and tsunami currents by many of the previous researchers focused on planting the forest as a combination in the hybrid defense designs ahmed and ghumman 2019 kimiwada et al 2020 however considering the availability of land in the coastal regions as well as other factors like economy especially for the developing countries tanaka et al 2011 it would be sometimes difficult to construct such compound defense systems the coastal forest in previous tsunami events has also been observed to be failed due to washout and breaking of the tree structures tanaka 2012 however the use of the coastal forest as a tsunami mitigation measure is still beneficial as it can significantly reduce the tsunami forces nandasena et al 2008 tanaka and onai 2017 tanaka and ogino 2017 the knowledge regarding the influencing factors leading to the damage of the forest and its failure against the approaching flows could better help in the management of coastal forests as the ecosystem based disaster risk reduction eco drr techniques are always encouraged to eliminate or mitigate the tsunami damages therefore the simple design of tree crown height parameter in relation to that of tree height and or initial water depth of the coastal forest has been elucidated primarily in this study in order to control the production of driftwood and to maintain the sustainability of the forest defense system itself the present study clarified the effectiveness and limitation of the crown part of the trees as well as the thickness of the coastal forest defense system which is a very important aspect of proper designing and management of forestry against the approaching tsunami currents towards the inland regions 4 1 flow structure phenomena the flow structures and scour phenomena are significantly influenced by the variation in crown height of the trees the lowest crown height from the ground resulted in the highest backwater rise at the upstream and largest water surface gradient inside the forest which caused the maximum energy reduction of the flow moreover the highest crown height was observed to be not effective in causing significant flow resistance as the role played by the highest crown was minimum in comparison to the no crown model case the mitigation capability in the form of flow resistance energy reduction of the forest with crown h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 is higher and noteworthy also the large thickness of the forest resulted in increased resistance to the approaching current which consequently resulted in a significantly higher loss of flow energy than that of the forest with half thickness under the same flow conditions thus the outcomes of this study demonstrated that these parameters i e tree crown height and forest thickness are vital for increasing the mitigation capability of the coastal forest although this study showed that the forest with the lowest crown height can significantly play a role in contributing to the maximum reduction of flow energy the resulting flow structures at the same time if strongly influenced can make the forest defense system as unsafe and vulnerable which ultimately decreases the mitigation function of it as witnessed in the results the forest with the lowest crown height configuration can significantly reduce the overflowing volume by causing the large difference in water levels between the forest upstream and downstream regions which on the other hand can result in an excessive scouring because of the increase in the steepness of water surface gradient inside the forest region that ultimately increases the bed shear stress as the flow hits the ground with a high fluid force in the forest downstream the previous researchers also highlighted that when the gradient of water surface within the forest becomes steep the flow progresses with a very high fluid force in the forest downstream that can cause a significant percentage of scouring due to the increased bed shear stress rashedunnabi and tanaka 2020 ali and tanaka 2020 4 2 scouring phenomena as soon as the impact of the overflowing water on bed shear stress surpasses the critical shear stress the scouring process starts the time development of the scour around a cylinder for a solitary wave condition is dependent on the substrate condition tonkin et al 2003 however scouring around a group of cylinders depends on the type of array and it achieves an equilibrium state after a certain time yagci et al 2017 thus the scour characteristics in this study were considered after the equilibrium scour conditions were achieved quezada et al 2018 highlighted that the induced bed shear stress that causes scouring around the cylinders or circular pile structures depends on the flow behavior i e hydrodynamic force carried by the approaching fluid which is also observed in the present study that the scouring is influenced by the flow structures sumer et al 2005 and ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 carried out scour experiments to investigate the local scour around the individual piles while considering the group of piles arrangement piles spacing flow rates and size of sediment for predicting the maximum scour depth they concluded that the induced scour depends much on the spacing of piles later on yagci et al 2017 performed flume experiments to investigate the scouring phenomena around a finite array of cylinders and found that the scour depth and scour volume behind the group of thin circular cylinders reduced as compared to that of a thick cylinder of similar diameter or area they also highlighted that the sparse arrangement of cylinders experiences large scouring due to the turbulence induced eddies shed by the cylinders array formation and thus the scour pattern scour hole and scour evolution was influenced by the type of array recently igarashi et al 2018 also highlighted that the large spacing between the piles cause greater water surface fluctuations behind and reduce the energy reduction they also clarified that this effect can be countered by providing a large number of rows in the cross stream direction and the replacement of piles with the real trees in an actual field case can increase the flow resistance when the crown height is low the present study confirms the increased strength of forest as a bioshield due to increased length of the forest and lowering of tree crown height however at the same time identifies an important concern about the limit of crown height since the overflowing water through the trunk part below the crown part approaches the ground behind the forest with a high fluid force and velocity that could be dangerous a recent study by ali and tanaka 2020 highlighted that the maximum scouring hole around the coastal forest especially the downstream region can be significantly reduced by providing large forest thickness they also clarified that if the bed inside the forest is mobile the position of maximum scouring is moved inside the forest region with the rise in initial flow conditions which is not desirable for the safety of the forest the present study also confirmed such phenomena and further contributes in highlighting the effects of the tree crown the results in this study revealed that the erosion of bed material has found to be in permissible limit for the forest configurations having h ct or h cy equal or greater than 0 5 or 1 1 the scour phenomena occurring against the lowest crown height experienced excessive maximum scouring i e 2 cm critical position of the occurrence of peak scour hole inside or directly behind the forest region while affecting almost the full length of the forest region due to scouring previous research studies found that the root depth of uprooted trees was observed to be approximately 1 5 2m in real scale e g mattheck 2002 2007 de costa and tanaka 2020 which indicate that exceeding such depth of scouring may lead to the washout of the tree structures moreover the position of maximum scouring around the coastal forest is a serious concern as the excessive scouring caused due to increased bed shear stress baykal et al 2015 can uproot and eradicate the tree structures from the forest backend resulting in the production of driftwood tanaka 2012 which will not only cause the damage to the defense system itself but also being a serious threat to the residential areas downstream will cause economic social and ecological losses furthermore considering the influence of forest thickness the forest with a reduced cross shore length i e half forest thickness experienced a substantial reduction in energy loss of the current and a noticeable increase in the scour downstream thus this extra large increase in the scouring behind the forest with less thickness would result in the earlier removal of tree structures from the forest backend i e causing the complete destruction of the forest and a significant reduction in flow resistance to the approaching current would make this defense system as a weak bioshield against the devastating tsunami inundations thus in order to counter measure the inland approaching tsunami currents and increasing the resilience of the social system during huge tsunami attacks and proper forest planning and management it would be better to limit the height of the crown part of the trees and construct the largest possible forest thickness in an actual field 4 3 general even in the designs of hybrid or compound defense systems the driftwood production by the coastal forest located behind the hard structures like embankment occurred tanaka et al 2013 the failure of such designs would cause a great loss to the economy as well thus this study gives the basic idea for future researchers to consider the crown height parameter of the coastal forest while investigating the effectiveness of hybrid or compound mitigation systems against devastating tsunamis moreover the washout of the forest tree structures can also be influenced by the conditions of specific soil and its strength anchored with the roots tanaka and yagisawa 2009 antonellini and mollema 2010 tanaka and ogino 2017 as the weaker root soil strength has the higher risk of the tree being overturned or be washed out nandasena et al 2012 de costa and tanaka 2021 therefore in order to ensure the safety of the coastal forest defense system and the inland residential areas the production of driftwood may also be further controlled by providing some suitable soil material or growing some grass cover or by protecting the directly downstream region of the forest in the form of concreting in order to reduce the impact of the overflowing water in recent decades the relationship between the tree structures of the coastal forest and the damage caused to it by the tsunami events have gained vital importance after the plantation of trees in coastal regions the forestry management practices like forest thinning largely affects the tree characteristics i e tree trunk and crown part igarashi et al 2019 the differences in forest management techniques also influence the effectiveness of the mitigation function as well as the level of secondary disaster caused in a large flood or tsunami event tanaka et al 2018 although the previous studies e g hiraishi and harada 2003 tanaka et al 2007 igarashi et al 2019 contributed to increase the knowledge about the management of coastal forests for increasing the mitigation functions in terms of tree density and tree diameter based on the reduction effects of fluid force this study further contributes to provide important knowledge about the role of the coastal forest as a bioshield implying the influence and control of tree crown height and forest stream wise length in order to increase its mitigation function and to possibly reduce the scouring behind the forest and therefore reducing the production of driftwood in general this study supports the utilization of coastal forest as a natural effective and economical solution but also elucidates the technique that could be adopted to reduce the damage caused in extreme tsunami events thus in general while designing and managing the coastal forests for tsunami based disaster risk reductions the potential factor of controlling the tree crown height should be accounted for the present study considered modeled the tsunami inundation and the coastal forest focused on the inland regions assuming the more relevant case scenario of subcritical flow conditions that is why the phenomena of water retreatment from the beach have been ignored in this study the present study found a scour hole on the downstream side of the forest however there could be some scouring on the other side of the forest in real tsunami events when water retreats from the beach this phenomenon is likely supposed to occur in the scenario of forest defense system around the coastal region i e close to beach shoreline where the flow is usually supercritical in both scenarios the sustainability of the forest defense system is very important and necessary thus the understanding of the influencing factor like the crown part of the tree needs to be explored and developed therefore this scenario of water retreatment from the beach could further be investigated to clarify the phenomena considering the replication of the gravel bed material to that of the real cohesive sediment although the final stable shape of the scour may be similar but the time developing process and the quantitative value may be different because of the scale effect the mode of sediment transport and the characteristics of scour profile may vary when the finer sediment like cohesive soil is used therefore it is further recommended to investigate the pattern of erosion using the cohesive soil as a moveable bed material for further clarifying the phenomena and applicability of this research in a broader perspective 5 summary the effectiveness of crown height variation of the coastal forest against the inland approaching tsunami has been elucidated under the subcritical flow conditions the mitigation capability and the vulnerability of the forest defense system has been observed to be associated with the energy reduction and scouring phenomena due to the impact of high fluid force of the approaching tsunami current this study summarizes that the flow structures and scour phenomena are strongly influenced by the variation in tree crown height the mitigation capability of the forest defense system in the form of relative flow energy reduction has an indirect relation with the tree crown height i e the relative flow energy reduction increases with the decrease in crown height from the ground level despite being capable of dissipating the highest percentage of energy of the approaching tsunami current with the lowest crown height i e h ct 0 3 or h cy 0 7 this condition among all cases experiences the large excessive scouring around the forest which can allow the complete destruction of the forest thus the overall reduction in the mitigation function with large exposure to vulnerability makes the forest defense system with the lowest crown height as an unsafe bioshield for future tsunamis the optimum results in the form of flow resistance and permissible scouring around the forest occurs at medium crown height i e h ct 0 5 or h cy 1 1 thus the threshold or critical value of the ratio of crown height to tree height could be possibly set as h ct 0 5 or the relationship between the crown height and the initial water depth could be considered critical at h cy 1 1 for the inland coastal forest management in order to sustain the tsunami fluid forces and less production of the driftwood in addition this study also encourages to construct the largest possible forest thickness that could act as a stronger shield against tsunamis therefore in order to increase the resilience of the social defense system during huge tsunami attacks and for the proper forest planning and management it would be better to limit the height of the tree crown in the coastal forest in order to reduce excessive scouring and control driftwood production the coastal forest thickness perpendicular to the shoreline has been considered in this study therefore the important knowledge about considering the effects of aspect ratio length along the shoreline direction length of cross shore direction of the coastal forest on tsunami mitigation is still lacking and needs to be explored hence leading on from this research work further study on elucidating the effects of crown height on scour pattern phenomena relating the shear stress distribution while considering the influence of aspect ratio would allow the forest planners and designers to propose an effective and applicable mitigation strategy against tsunamis and floods in the

established and an optimized maintenance strategy is finally determined based on the gspn outcomes the results indicate that the proposed approach is an effective tool to evaluate the system risk and save the maintenance expenditure of fpso topsides keywords risk assessment generalized stochastic petri net fpso topside maintenance optimization 1 introduction fpsos floating production storage and offloading units are one of the most widely used facilities for offshore oil and gas exploration which have greater capacity to survive in extreme weather conditions than other types of platforms lee and kwon 2020 it is a floating production platform integrating oil and gas production oil and gas processing oil storage and unloading the topside of the fpso as an essential component to realize these functions has the potential risks of oil and gas leakage fire and explosion due to its compact arrangement and complex composition of the equipment which could pose a significant threat to the safety of personnel property and environment the risk assessment of the fpso topside is essential for the prevention of accidents and the survival of the platform and its crew in the event of accidents jin and jang 2015 the risk assessment is implemented to determine the risk level in each stage of the whole life cycle to make reasonable risk prevention and emergency plan and to reduce the possibility of hazard occurrence gupta and chan 2015 the risk analysis of the fpso has been carried out by many researchers in recent years chang et al 2010 used the monte carlo method to evaluate the production availability of offshore facilities the influence of maintenance strategies on the production availability was demonstrated santos et al 2020 investigated the performance shape factor psf that affects the safety operation based on the decision making model of analytic hierarchy process ahp and then analysed the related accidents of fpsos abhulimen 2009 proposed a risk and reliability analysis model for a typical fpso riser system based on the monte carlo method and markov chain algorithms the fuzzy risk data sets of transient and non transient failure results of system equipment were obtained through weighted index training and simulations this model can be used to predict the failure probability of complex risk systems rahimi et al 2011 proposed a reliability assessment framework based on the proportional hazard model to study the impact of arctic harsh environment on operational reliability of offshore oil and gas production equipment and system production availability the important factors that affect the system performance and equipment reliability were evaluated and discussed kang et al 2019 employed bayesian statistical methods to analyse the oil and gas leakage of fpso inner turret according to the system failure mechanism two bayesian statistical models were established based on the weibull distribution and lognormal distribution respectively and the posterior distribution of corresponding reliability parameters was determined meng et al 2018 introduced a stochastic simulation method to assess system availability the production availability of the fpso system was calculated at different failure rates and maintenance rates and sensitivity analyses were carried out lu et al 2018 employed a genetic algorithm to optimize the artificial neural network ann and quantitatively analysed the falling object collision probability of fpsos the time varying simulation method was applied to predict the structural response caused by the impact of falling objects the risk level of the collision was evaluated according to the dnv standard and the uncertainty of the result was analysed the commonly used risk assessment methods such as reliability block diagram rbd fault tree method ftm event tree method etm and markov method have limitations when dealing with the life cycle risk assessment of fpsos the rbd is a static modelling and analysis method ftm and etm cannot describe the temporal relationship of the system discrete behaviour although markov chain can describe the dynamic change of system state it cannot directly reflect the static structure of the system and there is a state space explosion problem therefore the traditional reliability analysis model cannot precisely describe the reliability of a complex system comparing with the traditional models the petri net pn model has the advantage in its capacity to accurately model complex systems especially for systems with dependent relationships the pn model uses graphic elements such as places transitions and arcs to describe the static structure of the system and the dynamic characteristics of the system are simulated using token rules it allows observation and investigation on the probability of the occurrence of events the competition and uncertainty of occupying shared resources the confusion caused by the competition and uncertainty etc it has sound theoretical background to deal with these problems of the system the pn and its extensions are widely used in reliability analyses due to their flexibility in modelling complex system the offshore system consists of a large number of subsystems and equipment with different functions which is suitable to be modelled by the pn the pn has been applied in the risk assessment of ocean engineering systems signoret and leroy 1995 used the pn to investigate the reliability of underwater subordinate production system subsequently the application of the pn theory in the reliability assessment was extended to more underwater equipment and systems such as the high integrity protection systems system and all electric subsea tree signoret 2007 elusakin and shafiee 2020 used the stochastic petri net spn to evaluate the reliability of an underwater blowout preventer system based on state maintenance under different failure modes and calculated the availability reliability and mean time between failures of the blowout preventer system bris 2013 assessed the availability of offshore platform processing facilities with multi state output operations using spn and monte carlo simulation investigated production levels in multiple states and carried out detailed calculations and discussions of various maintenance strategies grunt and briš 2015 discussed the application of the pn in oil and gas leakage risk modelling of offshore platforms comparing with the monte carlo method and etm the results showed that the pn method is a reasonable modelling tool for the dynamic process ramos and de souza 2017 established a simplified gas processing model based on the random pn conducted reliability analysis on the natural gas processing system of an offshore platform and reached a conclusion that the influence of the average failure time on the availability results increases with the average repair time the pn is also widely used in the operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms tazi et al 2018 and santos et al 2018 analysed the reliability of the offshore wind turbine based on the spn and estimated the maintenance cost in the present study a gspn model is introduced to assess the risk of the fpso topside considering the waiting time caused by the changeable marine environment kang and guedessoares 2020 and the maintenance effectiveness uncertainty the reliability and availability of the system are derived using the model the optimized maintenance strategy is determined based on the calculated results the paper is organized in the following manner the proposed gspn model of the fpso topside is described in section 2 section 3 performs the risk assessment of the system the optimized maintenance strategy is determined in section 4 the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 gspn model 2 1 gspn algorithm the pn is a graphical modelling tool used to model and analyse complex systems which are defined as distributed stochastic simultaneous and non deterministic a typical pn model comprises of four essential graphical features namely places transitions arcs and tokens as shown in fig 1 the place is represented by a circle it is used to describe a state of a system subsystem or component such as the normal operation of the system or equipment system failure maintenance etc the transition is represented by a rectangle which is used to describe an event or behaviour it allows the system to change its state so that the dynamic behaviour of the system can be modelled the transitions can represent events such as system equipment failure and maintenance the connection is represented by a directed arc which is used to express the directed flow relationship between basic elements the flow relationship only exists between the place and the transition in other words arcs run from the place to the transition or vice versa which are described by arrows the token denoted by a black dot is always in the place when an event or behaviour occurs the token can be transferred to other places through arcs thus describing different states of the system or device if a place represents a condition it can contain a token or not the condition is true when the token is in the place otherwise it is false the system state changes when one or more transitions are triggered indicating that the token has been transferred from one place to another a transition becomes enabled only when pre defined requirements are met in reliability and safety engineering the pn technique has been applied in different areas including remaining useful life rul prediction elmeliani et al 2013 reliability evaluation liu et al 2017 safety analysis leveson and stolzy 1987 and maintenance modelling rochdi et al 1999 the conventional pn which does not consider changes in time is defined as a five tuple 1 p n p t f w m 0 where p p 1 p 2 p 3 p m is the set of palaces t t 1 t 2 t 3 t m is the set of transitions f p t t p is the set of arcs w f n is the weight function m 0 p n is the initial marking with p t the spn is a variation of the conventional pn which was developed to take the concept of time into account when performing reliability analyses kleyner and volovoi 2010 kleyner and volovoi 2010 the spn can analyse the dynamic behaviour of systems the transitions of spns have delay time which can either be deterministic or follow a probability distribution the spn is a six tuple given by 2 s p n p t f w m 0 λ where λ λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ l is the set of transition firing rates the gspn is an extension of the spn it can efficiently deal with the state explosion problem in pns the main characteristics of the gspn are there are two types of transitions one is the immediate transition i e the time delay is zero another is the timed transition i e the time delay follows an exponential distribution since the gspn has less state space than the spn for the same problem the former has a wider range of applications the gspn which is used in the present study is defined as follows 3 g s p n p t f k w m 0 λ where k is the capacity function of places t is divided into two subsets t t t t i t t t i namely timed transition set t t t 1 t 2 t k immediate transition set t i t k 1 t n and λ λ 1 λ 2 λ k is the set of transition firing rates which is related to the timed transition set the set of arcs f may include forbidden arcs running from the place to the transition when the transition that is connected with the forbidden arc is implemented no token would transferred from the place the gspn model of a repairable system is shown in fig 2 after a period of time the status of the system is changed from working to failure which is not yet detected the failure is then detected after a timed transition one maintenance crew is called to carry out the repair of the system finally the status of the system is changed back to working and the loop is completed the white box black box and bar represent stochastic timed transitions deterministic timed transitions and immediate transitions respectively 2 2 gspn model of fpso topside in the present study the critical equipment of the fpso topside is considered to formulate the gspn model for maintenance decision making the weather factors and maintenance replacement strategy under imperfect maintenance are taken into account the topside system of the fpso is complex to simplify the model the components that can be directly replaced and maintained e g valves and flanges are not considered and the equipment is assumed to be independent of each other and connected in series the composition of the fpso topside is shown in fig 3 the equipment maintenance data is collected from the offshore and offshore reliability data oreda dnv 2015 the oreda project was established in 1981 in cooperation with the norwegian petroleum directorate the database has reliability and maintenance data from a wide range of equipment used in oil and gas exploration and production it includes not only offshore underwater and topside equipment but also onshore equipment nowadays the oreda database has covered a large amount of failure and maintainability data of the equipment in offshore installations according to the statistical data from oreda the failure rate and maintenance man hour of the critical equipment of the fpso topside are listed in table 1 the weather factors can significantly affect the accessibility of maintenance the maintenance would be inaccessible for a period of time when the significant wave height is higher than a threshold value if the weather window effect is ignored the downtime and some costs are significantly reduced which would be unrealistically optimistic the underestimation of the downtime and some costs caused by ignoring the window effect is expected to be significant the distribution of the inaccessible period in different seasons can be obtained through statistical analyses of wave data the mean values of the waiting period and duration of each season denoted by t w and t d respectively were given by martins et al 2015 as listed in table 2 and the petri net model is demonstrated in fig 4 the values in tables 1 and 2 in the pn model are used to determine the period from the time that the equipment enters the state of waiting for maintenance to the time that the equipment can work again after the maintenance is completed the firing delays of repair transition are not determined by maintenance man hours but by the number of maintenance teams the waiting time caused by the weather window in the pn model affects the process from the waiting state to the maintenance state the grif software is used to simulate the model and the result of the gspn model simulation is obtained by analyzing the algorithm of the triggering event of the change the maintenance decision making model of the fpso topside based on the gspn is established three types of equipment exists namely cold standby redundant equipment hot standby redundant equipment and single equipment the gspn models for one type of equipment are similar the examples of gspn models for the three types of equipment are shown in figs 5 7 the crude pump and production water circulating pump are the cold standby redundant equipment the crude heater crude heat exchanger air compressor nitrogen compressor flare ko drum pump heating medium boiler and heating medium circulating pump are the hot standby redundant equipment the others are the single equipment without redundancy take fig 5 as an example to explain the proposed gspn model it shows the gspn model of the crude pump cold standby redundant equipment the pump system has two pumps one is the working pump and another is the standby pump the pump cp a keeps working until the transition cp a fail is activated the token will be transferred from cp a on to cp a failed and the pump cp a will fail accordingly then the transition tr2 is activated and the pump cp a will be tested the test result is that the pump cp a fails and it enters the state of waiting for maintenance the token is transferred from cp a failed to cp a starttorepair the pump cp a standby remains in the standby state until the transition tr13 is activated assigning cp a fail true the token is transferred from cp a standby to cp a standby on the standby state is transferred to the working state until the transition call mc is activated the pump cp a enters the maintenance state cp a repairing if the transition mc unavilable is activated it continues to wait and enters the waiting for maintenance state cp a waitingforrepair after a waiting period it enters the maintenance state cp a repairing the pump cp a returns to the working state cp a on when the maintenance is completed the transition tr14 is activated at this time assigning cp a fail false the pump cp a standby enters the standby state from the working state when the number of maintenance times of pump cp a reaches a certain value pump cp a is replaced by a new one when the pump cp a standby is not working and the transition cp a standby fail is activated the token is transferred from cp a standby to cp a standby failed the subsequent process of the pump cp a stanby is similar to that of the pump cp a since figs 6 and 7 show a similar structure of the model they are not introduced in detail in these figures lambda λ means rate of failure and tao τ means downtime caused by maintenance activities as shown in the figures to consider the imperfect maintenance effect in the maintenance strategy after each maintenance activity the transition firing rate i e failure rate is updated as λ λ 1 p where p is the failure rate growth factor it indicates that the failure rate increases with the number of failure times when the number of failure times of the equipment is equal to n the replacement of the equipment is carried out and the performance of the equipment is restored the failure rate growth factor is proposed to consider the imperfect maintenance effect in practice the failure rate is generally given as a constant value even though the equipment presents different failure rates at different times in their service life it seems to be a difficult task to accurately determine the factor since experiments have to be performed which are time consuming and laborious approximations from experimental data of a similar equipment may be a potential solution in the present study various values of the factor are assumed because of the lack of relevant data for other engineering systems to generate the gspn models an identification of critical subsystems and equipment and their composition are carried out the inputs i e the equipment maintenance data and values of other involved factors are then collected the gspn models are established for each equipment subsystem and finally the whole system the simulation is performed to determine the availability reliability and maintainability 2 3 model validation to verify the accuracy of the gspn approach in the risk assessment the results of the gspn approach are compared with those of the markov method the oil and gas processing system in the fpso topside is taken as an example the markov method can be used to analytically assess risk it has the advantage in describing the change of system dynamic characteristics the random changes of the system state can be described on the basis of a series of random variables the process state and the reliability result can be well predicted by using the method according to the relationship between all state transitions in the gspn model a markov state transition model of the oil and gas processing system is established as shown in fig 8 stage 1 represents the normal working state of the system stage 2 represents the failure state of the system stage 3 and stage 4 represent the failure state of the high pressure separator and low pressure separator respectively implying that the system is not available stage 5 stage 6 stage 7 and stage 8 represent the failure state of the crude pump production water circulating pump crude heater and crude heat exchanger respectively since they are equipment with redundancy the system is still available this model could describe six different failure modes stage 3 8 the system will find the fastest path from stage 1 2 after system malfunctions in stage 2 the corresponding maintenance process to fix the problem one limitation of this model is that when the system falls into stage 2 because one failure path is activated the other five components will keep working indicating that it cannot consider the downtime of the five working components however since the system downtime is relatively short compared with the operation time the overall tolerances are controllable the repair rate mu μ is determined based on the information from oreda μ total failure times total maintenance duration i e μ 1 average maintenance man hour in the risk assessment it is assumed that the maintenance is perfect and no replacement is carried out i e p 0 the equipment maintenance parameters listed in table 1 are used the simulation time is set to be 5 years the availability of the oil and gas processing system after 5 years of operation is 0 9823 for the gspn approach and 0 9769 for the markov method for the study case the error of the gspn approach is 0 5 indicating its accuracy it has been shown that due to the explosion of the state space the calculation time of the markov state transition model is much longer than that of the gspn model besides the former cannot describe the maintenance process therefore it is more effective to use the gspn approach in solving the problem that involves complex systems such as the fpso topside 3 risk assessment based on gspn model the input information of the gspn model is provided by table 1 the failure rate growth factor p is assumed to be 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 respectively the number of failure times before the equipment replacement n varies from 2 to 10 the maintenance resource is assumed to be sufficient the simulated period of time is set to be 5 years in this study we applied grif software to establish and solve the pn model the results of the gspn model is derived based on random sampling and the confidence intervals is 90 the availability of the fpso topside is determined by solving the gspn model meanwhile to implement the sensitivity analysis the variance of system availability under different p is also calculated the results are presented in fig 9 the failure rate is an important parameter that characterizes the reliability the larger the failure rate the greater the number of system failures in a fixed period as shown in fig 9 a a low failure rate growth factor p leads to a high system availability under the same maintenance and replacement strategy i e the same n the reason is that p represents the inherent degradation property of the equipment and the higher the value the faster the degradation of the equipment the figure also shows that at the same p the availability of the system decreases with the increase of n obviously the more times the equipment is repaired before the replacement the higher the failure rate of the equipment is accumulated indicating that the failure is more likely to occur the variance of system availability with respect to p under the same replacement strategy is used to study the sensitivity of system availability about p it can be seen from fig 9 b when n is low the variance of system availability is relatively low the reason is that the timely update of the equipment leads to a small change in the failure rate thus the change in the system availability is also small the variance of the system availability trends to increase with n which indicates that with the increase of the maintenance times the influence of equipment failure rate growth factor on system availability change is more significant the availability reliability and maintainability of each subsystem of the fpso topside are given below 3 1 availability fig 10 shows the availability of the four subsystems it can be seen that the trend of the availability of three subsystems is similar to that of the overall availability of the topside the heating medium system has the highest availability followed by the cold vent system oil and gas processing system and nitrogen system the high failure rate of the nitrogen system equipment is one of the reasons for its low availability in addition the redundant equipment in nitrogen system accounts for two thirds of all the equipment in the subsystem and the maintenance man hour of the nitrogen generator non redundant equipment can reach 120 h for the cold vent system although the redundant equipment accounts for only a third and the maintenance man hour of the flash drum and flare knockout drum non redundant equipment is up to 252 h its availability is higher than that of the nitrogen system the reason is that the failure rate of the cold vent system equipment is relatively low which once again implies that the equipment failure rate is the one of the most important factors influencing the system availability for the heating medium system all the equipment are redundant equipment therefore the simultaneous failure of the equipment is more difficult to occur leading to high availabilities of the system in general the effective methods to improve the availability of the system are choosing equipment with lower failure rates and installing standby equipment to increase the redundancy 3 2 frequency of subsystem failures the number of failure times of each subsystem under different conditions is shown in fig 11 the oil and gas processing system has the highest number of failure times due to the highest number of equipment and the complex composition of the equipment although the nitrogen system and cold vent system contain the same number of equipment the failure frequency of the former is higher than that of the latter it indicates that the influence of equipment failure rate on the frequency of system failures is significant the number of failure times of each subsystem is closely related to the failure rate of the equipment in the subsystem the low failure frequency of the thermal medium system implies the importance of installing standby equipment and improving the redundancy of the system 3 3 downtime fig 12 shows the downtime of each subsystem the downtime of each subsystem is related not only to the frequency of equipment failure but also to the maintenance man hour of the equipment it has been shown in fig 11 that the failure frequency of the cold vent system is far less than the oil and gas processing system and the nitrogen system however it can be seen from fig 12 that the downtime of the cold vent system is close to those two systems this is due to the great contribution of the maintenance man hour of the equipment in the cold vent system which extends the downtime of the system 3 4 number of maintenance times the number of maintenance times of each subsystem are shown in fig 13 it is related to the failure rate of the equipment and the complexity of the system it can be seen from the figure that the number of maintenance times of the oil and gas processing system is the highest followed by the nitrogen system this is because the former contains the highest number of equipment and the failure rate of nitrogen system equipment is relatively high for the cold vent system the low number of equipment and low failure rates of the equipment lead to the least number of maintenance times 3 5 number of replacement times of spare parts the number of replacement times of spare parts for each subsystem are shown in fig 14 it is related to the maintenance replacement strategy and maintenance frequency it can be seen from the figure that the number of replacement times reaches the maximum with the decrease of n and decreases with the increase of n it should be noted that when n is increased to a certain value the number of replacement times of some subsystems starts to increase the reason is that with the increase of n the equipment in the system suffers from a serious degradation which results in an increase in the number of maintenance times and in the number of replacement times of spare parts 4 optimization of risk based maintenance strategy the system operation cost is caused by maintenance and replacement activities in this section the operation cost model of the fpso topside will be established and the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy based on the risk will be established aiming at reducing the total cost to quantify the production loss the crude oil production capacity of the oil and gas processing system is considered to be constant during the shutdown period the shutdown of the topside system mainly depends on the feasibility of the maintenance 4 f f n t f a s t a a t r a m t a s p where f f n t is the feasibility of the maintenance at time t a s t a is the availability of weather a t r is the availability of ships for maintenance a m t is the availability of personnel for maintenance and a m t is the availability of spare parts it is difficult to determine the specific form of ffn in the present study a concise form of ffn is assumed to judge the feasibility of the maintenance see eq 5 all the variables in the equation are binary variables their values can only be 0 unavailable or infeasible or 1 available or feasible the value of ffn depends on the weather conditions and resource availability 5 f f n a s t a a t r a m t a s p in the model it is assumed that when the binary variable value is 0 the maintenance cannot be performed due to the inaccessibility of maintenance resources resulting in continuous downtime the maintenance is only carried out when there is no restriction the downtime duration is expressed as 6 t s d t int t m s v t w t t m h the downtime loss is 7 c s d t s d q c p c q g p g the maintenance cost is 8 c m c m t t m h k i c i the transportation cost is 9 c t c m s v t m s v t w t the replacement cost of spare parts is 10 c r k i n c s b in summary the total annual operating cost is 11 c c s d c m c t c r y the meaning of all the parameters in above equations is explained in table 3 the maximum design capacity of crude oil processing is 2 104 t year considering the influence of extreme environments the average annual production time is 300 days and the design capacity of crude oil processing is 194 5 bbl h the design capacity of natural gas processing is 2000 nm3 h the distance between the fpso and the coast is 300 km and the sailing time of the maintenance ship is 2 days note that some values listed in table 3 are from experiences or approximations fig 15 shows the annual downtime loss the annual downtime loss increases with n the reason is that if n is high the failure rate of the equipment continuously increases with the number of maintenance times resulting in a long downtime for the same maintenance and replacement strategy the annual downtime loss increases with the failure rate growth factor the annual downtime losses under different p are relatively close for low values of n indicating that p has no significant impact on the downtime cost in these cases however the annual downtime loss varies significantly under different p for high values of n the annual maintenance cost which is directly related to the maintenance man hour and number of maintenance times is presented in fig 16 similar to the downtime loss the maintenance cost increases with p and n the annual transportation cost is shown in fig 17 the occupation period of ships is directly proportional to the number of maintenance or replacement activities the annual transportation cost increases with n the annual replacement cost is closely related to the number of replacement times and is shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the number of equipment replacement and the replacement cost reach the maximum with the decrease of n and decrease with the increase of n however when n is increased to a certain value the replacement cost would no longer decrease and start to slowly rise the reason is that with the increase of n the failure rate of the equipment in the system would increase rapidly with time resulting in an increase in the number of maintenance times and in the number of replacement times it can be seen from the figure that considering only the replacement cost the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy n for p 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 is 8 10 10 and 9 respectively the annual total operating cost is the sum of the above four parts and is shown in fig 19 it can be seen that for the same maintenance and replacement strategy high failure rate growth factors lead to high total operating costs the total operating cost of the system decreases or changes little at the beginning and then increases with the increase of n in general it shows that n is the most important control factor in the actual maintenance activities n 3 seems to be the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy n according to the results the highest cost always appears at n 10 comparing with the highest cost the operation under the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy saves 10 759 10 964 11 164 and 16 56 million dollars for p 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 respectively therefore for the equipment with more serious degradation it is more necessary to adopt the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy to reduce the operating cost fig 20 shows the proportion of each item cost and each subsystem cost in the total annual operating cost under the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy it is found that the downtime loss accounts for the largest proportion of 31 47 while the maintenance cost contributes the least to the total cost therefore once the equipment fails the maintenance should be carried out as soon as possible to reduce the downtime loss of the system fig 21 shows the proportion of each subsystem cost in each item cost under the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy it can be seen that the nitrogen system accounts for 38 35 of the total downtime loss while the hot medium system contributes only 2 73 of the total downtime loss due to almost no failure of the thermal medium system for other cost items the oil and gas treatment system accounts for the largest proportion while the cold vent system accounts for the least therefore it can be seen from fig 20 b that the oil and gas treatment system accounts for the highest proportion of the total operating cost of the whole system while the contribution of the cold vent system is the lowest 5 conclusions in the present study the reliability availability and maintainability of the fpso topside are investigated based on the gspn model the weather factors and the influence of the imperfect maintenance effect are considered the failure rate growth factor which represents equipment performance degradation is introduced the maintenance decision making model of each subsystem is established based on gspn and is validated using the markov method a series of parameters related to the reliability availability and maintainability are calculated the system downtime loss maintenance cost transportation cost and replacement cost are evaluated and the operation and maintenance optimization of the fpso topside based on risk is performed the results indicate that oil and gas processing system is the major contributor to the number of failure times followed by the nitrogen system and cold vent system in terms of maintenance man hour oil and gas processing system is also the largest contributor followed by nitrogen system and heating medium system the results demonstrated that heating medium system has the highest system availability and oil and gas processing system dominates the number of maintenance times it can be summarized that the oil and gas processing system is the most hazardous module and heating medium system is relatively safe based on the gspn outcomes the optimized maintenance and replacement strategy is determined and the corresponding results demonstrate that the cost of the oil and gas processing system occupies the largest proportion it can be concluded that the developed model provides an effective tool for the

offloading units are one of the most widely used facilities for offshore oil and gas exploration which have greater capacity to survive in extreme weather conditions than other types of platforms lee and kwon 2020 it is a floating production platform integrating oil and gas production oil and gas processing oil storage and unloading the topside of the fpso as an essential component to realize these functions has the potential risks of oil and gas leakage fire and explosion due to its compact arrangement and complex composition of the equipment which could pose a significant threat to the safety of personnel property and environment the risk assessment of the fpso topside is essential for the prevention of accidents and the survival of the platform and its crew in the event of accidents jin and jang 2015 the risk assessment is implemented to determine the risk level in each stage of the whole life cycle to make reasonable risk prevention and emergency plan and to reduce the possibility of hazard occurrence gupta and chan 2015 the risk analysis of the fpso has been carried out by many researchers in recent years chang et al 2010 used the monte carlo method to evaluate the production availability of offshore facilities the influence of maintenance strategies on the production availability was demonstrated santos et al 2020 investigated the performance shape factor psf that affects the safety operation based on the decision making model of analytic hierarchy process ahp and then analysed the related accidents of fpsos abhulimen 2009 proposed a risk and reliability analysis model for a typical fpso riser system based on the monte carlo method and markov chain algorithms the fuzzy risk data sets of transient and non transient failure results of system equipment were obtained through weighted index training and simulations this model can be used to predict the failure probability of complex risk systems rahimi et al 2011 proposed a reliability assessment framework based on the proportional hazard model to study the impact of arctic harsh environment on operational reliability of offshore oil and gas production equipment and system production availability the important factors that affect the system performance and equipment reliability were evaluated and discussed kang et al 2019 employed bayesian statistical methods to analyse the oil and gas leakage of fpso inner turret according to the system failure mechanism two bayesian statistical models were established based on the weibull distribution and lognormal distribution respectively and the posterior distribution of corresponding reliability parameters was determined meng et al 2018 introduced a stochastic simulation method to assess system availability the production availability of the fpso system was calculated at different failure rates and maintenance rates and sensitivity analyses were carried out lu et al 2018 employed a genetic algorithm to optimize the artificial neural network ann and quantitatively analysed the falling object collision probability of fpsos the time varying simulation method was applied to predict the structural response caused by the impact of falling objects the risk level of the collision was evaluated according to the dnv standard and the uncertainty of the result was analysed the commonly used risk assessment methods such as reliability block diagram rbd fault tree method ftm event tree method etm and markov method have limitations when dealing with the life cycle risk assessment of fpsos the rbd is a static modelling and analysis method ftm and etm cannot describe the temporal relationship of the system discrete behaviour although markov chain can describe the dynamic change of system state it cannot directly reflect the static structure of the system and there is a state space explosion problem therefore the traditional reliability analysis model cannot precisely describe the reliability of a complex system comparing with the traditional models the petri net pn model has the advantage in its capacity to accurately model complex systems especially for systems with dependent relationships the pn model uses graphic elements such as places transitions and arcs to describe the static structure of the system and the dynamic characteristics of the system are simulated using token rules it allows observation and investigation on the probability of the occurrence of events the competition and uncertainty of occupying shared resources the confusion caused by the competition and uncertainty etc it has sound theoretical background to deal with these problems of the system the pn and its extensions are widely used in reliability analyses due to their flexibility in modelling complex system the offshore system consists of a large number of subsystems and equipment with different functions which is suitable to be modelled by the pn the pn has been applied in the risk assessment of ocean engineering systems signoret and leroy 1995 used the pn to investigate the reliability of underwater subordinate production system subsequently the application of the pn theory in the reliability assessment was extended to more underwater equipment and systems such as the high integrity protection systems system and all electric subsea tree signoret 2007 elusakin and shafiee 2020 used the stochastic petri net spn to evaluate the reliability of an underwater blowout preventer system based on state maintenance under different failure modes and calculated the availability reliability and mean time between failures of the blowout preventer system bris 2013 assessed the availability of offshore platform processing facilities with multi state output operations using spn and monte carlo simulation investigated production levels in multiple states and carried out detailed calculations and discussions of various maintenance strategies grunt and briš 2015 discussed the application of the pn in oil and gas leakage risk modelling of offshore platforms comparing with the monte carlo method and etm the results showed that the pn method is a reasonable modelling tool for the dynamic process ramos and de souza 2017 established a simplified gas processing model based on the random pn conducted reliability analysis on the natural gas processing system of an offshore platform and reached a conclusion that the influence of the average failure time on the availability results increases with the average repair time the pn is also widely used in the operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms tazi et al 2018 and santos et al 2018 analysed the reliability of the offshore wind turbine based on the spn and estimated the maintenance cost in the present study a gspn model is introduced to assess the risk of the fpso topside considering the waiting time caused by the changeable marine environment kang and guedessoares 2020 and the maintenance effectiveness uncertainty the reliability and availability of the system are derived using the model the optimized maintenance strategy is determined based on the calculated results the paper is organized in the following manner the proposed gspn model of the fpso topside is described in section 2 section 3 performs the risk assessment of the system the optimized maintenance strategy is determined in section 4 the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 gspn model 2 1 gspn algorithm the pn is a graphical modelling tool used to model and analyse complex systems which are defined as distributed stochastic simultaneous and non deterministic a typical pn model comprises of four essential graphical features namely places transitions arcs and tokens as shown in fig 1 the place is represented by a circle it is used to describe a state of a system subsystem or component such as the normal operation of the system or equipment system failure maintenance etc the transition is represented by a rectangle which is used to describe an event or behaviour it allows the system to change its state so that the dynamic behaviour of the system can be modelled the transitions can represent events such as system equipment failure and maintenance the connection is represented by a directed arc which is used to express the directed flow relationship between basic elements the flow relationship only exists between the place and the transition in other words arcs run from the place to the transition or vice versa which are described by arrows the token denoted by a black dot is always in the place when an event or behaviour occurs the token can be transferred to other places through arcs thus describing different states of the system or device if a place represents a condition it can contain a token or not the condition is true when the token is in the place otherwise it is false the system state changes when one or more transitions are triggered indicating that the token has been transferred from one place to another a transition becomes enabled only when pre defined requirements are met in reliability and safety engineering the pn technique has been applied in different areas including remaining useful life rul prediction elmeliani et al 2013 reliability evaluation liu et al 2017 safety analysis leveson and stolzy 1987 and maintenance modelling rochdi et al 1999 the conventional pn which does not consider changes in time is defined as a five tuple 1 p n p t f w m 0 where p p 1 p 2 p 3 p m is the set of palaces t t 1 t 2 t 3 t m is the set of transitions f p t t p is the set of arcs w f n is the weight function m 0 p n is the initial marking with p t the spn is a variation of the conventional pn which was developed to take the concept of time into account when performing reliability analyses kleyner and volovoi 2010 kleyner and volovoi 2010 the spn can analyse the dynamic behaviour of systems the transitions of spns have delay time which can either be deterministic or follow a probability distribution the spn is a six tuple given by 2 s p n p t f w m 0 λ where λ λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ l is the set of transition firing rates the gspn is an extension of the spn it can efficiently deal with the state explosion problem in pns the main characteristics of the gspn are there are two types of transitions one is the immediate transition i e the time delay is zero another is the timed transition i e the time delay follows an exponential distribution since the gspn has less state space than the spn for the same problem the former has a wider range of applications the gspn which is used in the present study is defined as follows 3 g s p n p t f k w m 0 λ where k is the capacity function of places t is divided into two subsets t t t t i t t t i namely timed transition set t t t 1 t 2 t k immediate transition set t i t k 1 t n and λ λ 1 λ 2 λ k is the set of transition firing rates which is related to the timed transition set the set of arcs f may include forbidden arcs running from the place to the transition when the transition that is connected with the forbidden arc is implemented no token would transferred from the place the gspn model of a repairable system is shown in fig 2 after a period of time the status of the system is changed from working to failure which is not yet detected the failure is then detected after a timed transition one maintenance crew is called to carry out the repair of the system finally the status of the system is changed back to working and the loop is completed the white box black box and bar represent stochastic timed transitions deterministic timed transitions and immediate transitions respectively 2 2 gspn model of fpso topside in the present study the critical equipment of the fpso topside is considered to formulate the gspn model for maintenance decision making the weather factors and maintenance replacement strategy under imperfect maintenance are taken into account the topside system of the fpso is complex to simplify the model the components that can be directly replaced and maintained e g valves and flanges are not considered and the equipment is assumed to be independent of each other and connected in series the composition of the fpso topside is shown in fig 3 the equipment maintenance data is collected from the offshore and offshore reliability data oreda dnv 2015 the oreda project was established in 1981 in cooperation with the norwegian petroleum directorate the database has reliability and maintenance data from a wide range of equipment used in oil and gas exploration and production it includes not only offshore underwater and topside equipment but also onshore equipment nowadays the oreda database has covered a large amount of failure and maintainability data of the equipment in offshore installations according to the statistical data from oreda the failure rate and maintenance man hour of the critical equipment of the fpso topside are listed in table 1 the weather factors can significantly affect the accessibility of maintenance the maintenance would be inaccessible for a period of time when the significant wave height is higher than a threshold value if the weather window effect is ignored the downtime and some costs are significantly reduced which would be unrealistically optimistic the underestimation of the downtime and some costs caused by ignoring the window effect is expected to be significant the distribution of the inaccessible period in different seasons can be obtained through statistical analyses of wave data the mean values of the waiting period and duration of each season denoted by t w and t d respectively were given by martins et al 2015 as listed in table 2 and the petri net model is demonstrated in fig 4 the values in tables 1 and 2 in the pn model are used to determine the period from the time that the equipment enters the state of waiting for maintenance to the time that the equipment can work again after the maintenance is completed the firing delays of repair transition are not determined by maintenance man hours but by the number of maintenance teams the waiting time caused by the weather window in the pn model affects the process from the waiting state to the maintenance state the grif software is used to simulate the model and the result of the gspn model simulation is obtained by analyzing the algorithm of the triggering event of the change the maintenance decision making model of the fpso topside based on the gspn is established three types of equipment exists namely cold standby redundant equipment hot standby redundant equipment and single equipment the gspn models for one type of equipment are similar the examples of gspn models for the three types of equipment are shown in figs 5 7 the crude pump and production water circulating pump are the cold standby redundant equipment the crude heater crude heat exchanger air compressor nitrogen compressor flare ko drum pump heating medium boiler and heating medium circulating pump are the hot standby redundant equipment the others are the single equipment without redundancy take fig 5 as an example to explain the proposed gspn model it shows the gspn model of the crude pump cold standby redundant equipment the pump system has two pumps one is the working pump and another is the standby pump the pump cp a keeps working until the transition cp a fail is activated the token will be transferred from cp a on to cp a failed and the pump cp a will fail accordingly then the transition tr2 is activated and the pump cp a will be tested the test result is that the pump cp a fails and it enters the state of waiting for maintenance the token is transferred from cp a failed to cp a starttorepair the pump cp a standby remains in the standby state until the transition tr13 is activated assigning cp a fail true the token is transferred from cp a standby to cp a standby on the standby state is transferred to the working state until the transition call mc is activated the pump cp a enters the maintenance state cp a repairing if the transition mc unavilable is activated it continues to wait and enters the waiting for maintenance state cp a waitingforrepair after a waiting period it enters the maintenance state cp a repairing the pump cp a returns to the working state cp a on when the maintenance is completed the transition tr14 is activated at this time assigning cp a fail false the pump cp a standby enters the standby state from the working state when the number of maintenance times of pump cp a reaches a certain value pump cp a is replaced by a new one when the pump cp a standby is not working and the transition cp a standby fail is activated the token is transferred from cp a standby to cp a standby failed the subsequent process of the pump cp a stanby is similar to that of the pump cp a since figs 6 and 7 show a similar structure of the model they are not introduced in detail in these figures lambda λ means rate of failure and tao τ means downtime caused by maintenance activities as shown in the figures to consider the imperfect maintenance effect in the maintenance strategy after each maintenance activity the transition firing rate i e failure rate is updated as λ λ 1 p where p is the failure rate growth factor it indicates that the failure rate increases with the number of failure times when the number of failure times of the equipment is equal to n the replacement of the equipment is carried out and the performance of the equipment is restored the failure rate growth factor is proposed to consider the imperfect maintenance effect in practice the failure rate is generally given as a constant value even though the equipment presents different failure rates at different times in their service life it seems to be a difficult task to accurately determine the factor since experiments have to be performed which are time consuming and laborious approximations from experimental data of a similar equipment may be a potential solution in the present study various values of the factor are assumed because of the lack of relevant data for other engineering systems to generate the gspn models an identification of critical subsystems and equipment and their composition are carried out the inputs i e the equipment maintenance data and values of other involved factors are then collected the gspn models are established for each equipment subsystem and finally the whole system the simulation is performed to determine the availability reliability and maintainability 2 3 model validation to verify the accuracy of the gspn approach in the risk assessment the results of the gspn approach are compared with those of the markov method the oil and gas processing system in the fpso topside is taken as an example the markov method can be used to analytically assess risk it has the advantage in describing the change of system dynamic characteristics the random changes of the system state can be described on the basis of a series of random variables the process state and the reliability result can be well predicted by using the method according to the relationship between all state transitions in the gspn model a markov state transition model of the oil and gas processing system is established as shown in fig 8 stage 1 represents the normal working state of the system stage 2 represents the failure state of the system stage 3 and stage 4 represent the failure state of the high pressure separator and low pressure separator respectively implying that the system is not available stage 5 stage 6 stage 7 and stage 8 represent the failure state of the crude pump production water circulating pump crude heater and crude heat exchanger respectively since they are equipment with redundancy the system is still available this model could describe six different failure modes stage 3 8 the system will find the fastest path from stage 1 2 after system malfunctions in stage 2 the corresponding maintenance process to fix the problem one limitation of this model is that when the system falls into stage 2 because one failure path is activated the other five components will keep working indicating that it cannot consider the downtime of the five working components however since the system downtime is relatively short compared with the operation time the overall tolerances are controllable the repair rate mu μ is determined based on the information from oreda μ total failure times total maintenance duration i e μ 1 average maintenance man hour in the risk assessment it is assumed that the maintenance is perfect and no replacement is carried out i e p 0 the equipment maintenance parameters listed in table 1 are used the simulation time is set to be 5 years the availability of the oil and gas processing system after 5 years of operation is 0 9823 for the gspn approach and 0 9769 for the markov method for the study case the error of the gspn approach is 0 5 indicating its accuracy it has been shown that due to the explosion of the state space the calculation time of the markov state transition model is much longer than that of the gspn model besides the former cannot describe the maintenance process therefore it is more effective to use the gspn approach in solving the problem that involves complex systems such as the fpso topside 3 risk assessment based on gspn model the input information of the gspn model is provided by table 1 the failure rate growth factor p is assumed to be 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 respectively the number of failure times before the equipment replacement n varies from 2 to 10 the maintenance resource is assumed to be sufficient the simulated period of time is set to be 5 years in this study we applied grif software to establish and solve the pn model the results of the gspn model is derived based on random sampling and the confidence intervals is 90 the availability of the fpso topside is determined by solving the gspn model meanwhile to implement the sensitivity analysis the variance of system availability under different p is also calculated the results are presented in fig 9 the failure rate is an important parameter that characterizes the reliability the larger the failure rate the greater the number of system failures in a fixed period as shown in fig 9 a a low failure rate growth factor p leads to a high system availability under the same maintenance and replacement strategy i e the same n the reason is that p represents the inherent degradation property of the equipment and the higher the value the faster the degradation of the equipment the figure also shows that at the same p the availability of the system decreases with the increase of n obviously the more times the equipment is repaired before the replacement the higher the failure rate of the equipment is accumulated indicating that the failure is more likely to occur the variance of system availability with respect to p under the same replacement strategy is used to study the sensitivity of system availability about p it can be seen from fig 9 b when n is low the variance of system availability is relatively low the reason is that the timely update of the equipment leads to a small change in the failure rate thus the change in the system availability is also small the variance of the system availability trends to increase with n which indicates that with the increase of the maintenance times the influence of equipment failure rate growth factor on system availability change is more significant the availability reliability and maintainability of each subsystem of the fpso topside are given below 3 1 availability fig 10 shows the availability of the four subsystems it can be seen that the trend of the availability of three subsystems is similar to that of the overall availability of the topside the heating medium system has the highest availability followed by the cold vent system oil and gas processing system and nitrogen system the high failure rate of the nitrogen system equipment is one of the reasons for its low availability in addition the redundant equipment in nitrogen system accounts for two thirds of all the equipment in the subsystem and the maintenance man hour of the nitrogen generator non redundant equipment can reach 120 h for the cold vent system although the redundant equipment accounts for only a third and the maintenance man hour of the flash drum and flare knockout drum non redundant equipment is up to 252 h its availability is higher than that of the nitrogen system the reason is that the failure rate of the cold vent system equipment is relatively low which once again implies that the equipment failure rate is the one of the most important factors influencing the system availability for the heating medium system all the equipment are redundant equipment therefore the simultaneous failure of the equipment is more difficult to occur leading to high availabilities of the system in general the effective methods to improve the availability of the system are choosing equipment with lower failure rates and installing standby equipment to increase the redundancy 3 2 frequency of subsystem failures the number of failure times of each subsystem under different conditions is shown in fig 11 the oil and gas processing system has the highest number of failure times due to the highest number of equipment and the complex composition of the equipment although the nitrogen system and cold vent system contain the same number of equipment the failure frequency of the former is higher than that of the latter it indicates that the influence of equipment failure rate on the frequency of system failures is significant the number of failure times of each subsystem is closely related to the failure rate of the equipment in the subsystem the low failure frequency of the thermal medium system implies the importance of installing standby equipment and improving the redundancy of the system 3 3 downtime fig 12 shows the downtime of each subsystem the downtime of each subsystem is related not only to the frequency of equipment failure but also to the maintenance man hour of the equipment it has been shown in fig 11 that the failure frequency of the cold vent system is far less than the oil and gas processing system and the nitrogen system however it can be seen from fig 12 that the downtime of the cold vent system is close to those two systems this is due to the great contribution of the maintenance man hour of the equipment in the cold vent system which extends the downtime of the system 3 4 number of maintenance times the number of maintenance times of each subsystem are shown in fig 13 it is related to the failure rate of the equipment and the complexity of the system it can be seen from the figure that the number of maintenance times of the oil and gas processing system is the highest followed by the nitrogen system this is because the former contains the highest number of equipment and the failure rate of nitrogen system equipment is relatively high for the cold vent system the low number of equipment and low failure rates of the equipment lead to the least number of maintenance times 3 5 number of replacement times of spare parts the number of replacement times of spare parts for each subsystem are shown in fig 14 it is related to the maintenance replacement strategy and maintenance frequency it can be seen from the figure that the number of replacement times reaches the maximum with the decrease of n and decreases with the increase of n it should be noted that when n is increased to a certain value the number of replacement times of some subsystems starts to increase the reason is that with the increase of n the equipment in the system suffers from a serious degradation which results in an increase in the number of maintenance times and in the number of replacement times of spare parts 4 optimization of risk based maintenance strategy the system operation cost is caused by maintenance and replacement activities in this section the operation cost model of the fpso topside will be established and the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy based on the risk will be established aiming at reducing the total cost to quantify the production loss the crude oil production capacity of the oil and gas processing system is considered to be constant during the shutdown period the shutdown of the topside system mainly depends on the feasibility of the maintenance 4 f f n t f a s t a a t r a m t a s p where f f n t is the feasibility of the maintenance at time t a s t a is the availability of weather a t r is the availability of ships for maintenance a m t is the availability of personnel for maintenance and a m t is the availability of spare parts it is difficult to determine the specific form of ffn in the present study a concise form of ffn is assumed to judge the feasibility of the maintenance see eq 5 all the variables in the equation are binary variables their values can only be 0 unavailable or infeasible or 1 available or feasible the value of ffn depends on the weather conditions and resource availability 5 f f n a s t a a t r a m t a s p in the model it is assumed that when the binary variable value is 0 the maintenance cannot be performed due to the inaccessibility of maintenance resources resulting in continuous downtime the maintenance is only carried out when there is no restriction the downtime duration is expressed as 6 t s d t int t m s v t w t t m h the downtime loss is 7 c s d t s d q c p c q g p g the maintenance cost is 8 c m c m t t m h k i c i the transportation cost is 9 c t c m s v t m s v t w t the replacement cost of spare parts is 10 c r k i n c s b in summary the total annual operating cost is 11 c c s d c m c t c r y the meaning of all the parameters in above equations is explained in table 3 the maximum design capacity of crude oil processing is 2 104 t year considering the influence of extreme environments the average annual production time is 300 days and the design capacity of crude oil processing is 194 5 bbl h the design capacity of natural gas processing is 2000 nm3 h the distance between the fpso and the coast is 300 km and the sailing time of the maintenance ship is 2 days note that some values listed in table 3 are from experiences or approximations fig 15 shows the annual downtime loss the annual downtime loss increases with n the reason is that if n is high the failure rate of the equipment continuously increases with the number of maintenance times resulting in a long downtime for the same maintenance and replacement strategy the annual downtime loss increases with the failure rate growth factor the annual downtime losses under different p are relatively close for low values of n indicating that p has no significant impact on the downtime cost in these cases however the annual downtime loss varies significantly under different p for high values of n the annual maintenance cost which is directly related to the maintenance man hour and number of maintenance times is presented in fig 16 similar to the downtime loss the maintenance cost increases with p and n the annual transportation cost is shown in fig 17 the occupation period of ships is directly proportional to the number of maintenance or replacement activities the annual transportation cost increases with n the annual replacement cost is closely related to the number of replacement times and is shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the number of equipment replacement and the replacement cost reach the maximum with the decrease of n and decrease with the increase of n however when n is increased to a certain value the replacement cost would no longer decrease and start to slowly rise the reason is that with the increase of n the failure rate of the equipment in the system would increase rapidly with time resulting in an increase in the number of maintenance times and in the number of replacement times it can be seen from the figure that considering only the replacement cost the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy n for p 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 is 8 10 10 and 9 respectively the annual total operating cost is the sum of the above four parts and is shown in fig 19 it can be seen that for the same maintenance and replacement strategy high failure rate growth factors lead to high total operating costs the total operating cost of the system decreases or changes little at the beginning and then increases with the increase of n in general it shows that n is the most important control factor in the actual maintenance activities n 3 seems to be the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy n according to the results the highest cost always appears at n 10 comparing with the highest cost the operation under the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy saves 10 759 10 964 11 164 and 16 56 million dollars for p 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 respectively therefore for the equipment with more serious degradation it is more necessary to adopt the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy to reduce the operating cost fig 20 shows the proportion of each item cost and each subsystem cost in the total annual operating cost under the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy it is found that the downtime loss accounts for the largest proportion of 31 47 while the maintenance cost contributes the least to the total cost therefore once the equipment fails the maintenance should be carried out as soon as possible to reduce the downtime loss of the system fig 21 shows the proportion of each subsystem cost in each item cost under the optimal maintenance and replacement strategy it can be seen that the nitrogen system accounts for 38 35 of the total downtime loss while the hot medium system contributes only 2 73 of the total downtime loss due to almost no failure of the thermal medium system for other cost items the oil and gas treatment system accounts for the largest proportion while the cold vent system accounts for the least therefore it can be seen from fig 20 b that the oil and gas treatment system accounts for the highest proportion of the total operating cost of the whole system while the contribution of the cold vent system is the lowest 5 conclusions in the present study the reliability availability and maintainability of the fpso topside are investigated based on the gspn model the weather factors and the influence of the imperfect maintenance effect are considered the failure rate growth factor which represents equipment performance degradation is introduced the maintenance decision making model of each subsystem is established based on gspn and is validated using the markov method a series of parameters related to the reliability availability and maintainability are calculated the system downtime loss maintenance cost transportation cost and replacement cost are evaluated and the operation and maintenance optimization of the fpso topside based on risk is performed the results indicate that oil and gas processing system is the major contributor to the number of failure times followed by the nitrogen system and cold vent system in terms of maintenance man hour oil and gas processing system is also the largest contributor followed by nitrogen system and heating medium system the results demonstrated that heating medium system has the highest system availability and oil and gas processing system dominates the number of maintenance times it can be summarized that the oil and gas processing system is the most hazardous module and heating medium system is relatively safe based on the gspn outcomes the optimized maintenance and replacement strategy is determined and the corresponding results demonstrate that the cost of the oil and gas processing system occupies the largest proportion it can be concluded that the developed model provides an effective tool for the fpso topside risk assessment and maintenance optimization credit authorship contribution statement jichuan kang conceptualization methodology writing original draft xinyuan geng software data curation

20228,in this paper numerical investigations are performed to examine the effect of reynolds numbers re and spacing ratios g on flow around a row of five side by side square cylinders using the lattice boltzmann method the reynolds number is varied in the range 75 re 175 while spacing ratio is varied between 0 5 and 5 the flow structure mechanism around a row of five side by side square cylinders is studied in terms of vorticity contours visualization time trace analysis of drag and lifts coefficients and power spectrum analysis of lift coefficient the effect of re on force statistics like mean drag coefficient and strouhal number is also analyzed the present data are compared with the data of single square cylinder and good agreement is observed for large spacing ratio g 5 the flow behind five side by side square cylinders is classified into three different flow regimes and these regimes are further subdivided into seven different regimes the observed flow regimes are compared with those of the other researchers published studies and found good agreement keywords flow regimes lattice boltzmann method reynolds number spacing ratio square cylinder strouhal number 1 introduction circular and square cylinders are the most common bluff bodies widely used in many applications for example beams bridges chimneys etc fluid structure interaction plays a key role in number of engineering applications when the reynolds number re umaxd ʋ where umax d and ʋ are the uniform inflow velocity size of the cylinder and shear kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively is high the applications of flow around multiple bluff structures can be found in tall buildings fences packages of high voltage lines chemical reaction towers etc and when the reynolds number is small these applications can be found in micro devices such as in micro electro mechanical systems and fibre cooling in this study the effect of reynolds number on flow around a row of five side by side square cylinders will be carried out for different spacing ratios g s d where s is the surface to surface distance between the two successive cylinders many researchers had studied the characteristics of flow behind one two three and a row more than three of cylinders in side by side arrangement some representative studies will be discussed in this section as a literature survey by applying multi relaxation time lattice boltzmann method mrt lbm islam et al 2014 reported that when fluid interact with a single square cylinder the fluid forces showed periodic nature and only primary vortex shedding frequency was investigated for different reynolds numbers golani and dhiman 2014 examined that the drag coefficient cd 2fx ρu2 maxd where fx is the force component along stream wise direction and ρ is the fluid density falls for increasing re while the shedding frequency improves gera et al 2010 found variations in strouhal st fsd umax where fs is the vortex shedding

leading edge separation separation bubble and attached flow and found that the lift coefficient cl 2fy ρu2 maxd where fy is the force component along transverse direction does not vary significantly against re guo et al 2008 reported symmetric flow in which the lift force is zero and drag force varies with reynolds number breuer et al 2000 classified the flow around a square cylinder into steady and unsteady flow for reynolds number of 0 5 re 60 and 60 re 300 respectively sohankar et al 1998 reported that the onset of vortex shedding occurs within the range 40 re 55 for flow behind a single cylinder from this discussion it is clear that reynolds number strongly affects the flow structure mechanism around a single cylinder that s why in the current study we will examine the effect of reynolds number on flow around a row of five side by side square cylinders for different spacing ratios agrawal et al 2006 developed two dimensional lbm code and found formation of vortices at re 10 and at re 30 flow start oscillation around the two side by side cylinders for g 2 5 the synchronized and flip flopping flow regimes were investigated in which the amalgamations of vortices were gradual for the former regime and rapid for the later one kang 2003 carried out numerical simulations and divided the flow structure mechanism behind a pair of side by side cylinders into six different flow regimes which are anti phase synchronized in phase synchronized flip flopping deflected single bluff body and steady flows he investigated that the effect of spacing ratio on flow mechanism is much stronger than the re moreover the mean drag coefficient cdm cd i n where n are total number of steps dependent only on spacing ratio while the lift coefficient is dependent on both g and re alam and zhou 2013 classified the flow past two side by side square cylinders into single body asymmetric transition and coupled vortex street regimes the two dimensional unsteady compressible navier stokes equations were directly solved by inoue et al 2006 for flow behind a pair of side by side square cylinders and observed non synchronized flip flopping single bluff body in phase and anti phase synchronized and steady flow regimes han et al 2014 investigated three flow regimes single bluff body the gap flow interface and anti phase synchronized regimes for flow around two side by side square cylinders alam et al 2011 studied the wake mechanism of flow past two side by side square cylinders and categorized the flow into four different flow regimes the flow structure mechanism becomes more complex when the number of cylinders is increased from two to three four five and so forth because when more cylinders are arranged side by side the number of gaps increased and the generated flow in the gaps in the form of jet flow made the flow structure mechanism more complex zheng et al 2019 numerically studied the effect of spacing ratio on flow past three side by side square cylinders and identified base bleed flip flopping symmetrically biased beat non biased beat and weak interaction flows kang 2004 numerically used the immersed boundary method at low reynolds number of 100 to investigate the flow around three side by side circular cylinders the observed flow regimes are single bluff body deflected flip flopping in phase synchronized and modulation synchronized the author also reported that the st of middle cylinder was larger than the lower and upper cylinders and the middle cylinder experienced higher cdm than the upper and lower cylinders for modulation synchronized regime rahman et al 2015 studied the effect of re on flow behind three side by side square cylinders for small moderate and large unequal spacing ratios the observed flow regimes in their study are modulated synchronized fully synchronized and flip flopping they also reported that for larger spacing values and reynolds numbers the flow was fully dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency islam et al 2016a performed lattice boltzmann simulations and reported bistable asymmetric in phase anti phase synchronized and modulated synchronized flow regimes they also found that the force statistics were strongly affected by unequal spacing and their behaviour was notably different from those of equal spacing also at large g the flow was dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency alam et al 2017 numerically classified the flow around four side by side cylinders into four regimes single bluff body flip flopping quasi interlocked and interlocked flows for different g they found that the inner and outer cylinders experienced identical drag however the inner cylinders drag was observed to be larger than the outer two cylinders and this trend reverses for lift force awala awale 2014 categorized the flow around a row of four circular cylinders into synchronized quasi periodic i quasi periodic ii and chaotic flow regimes for different g at re 100 he reported that the cdm of inner two cylinders was larger than the outer two cylinders and for increasing g both mean drag coefficient and st decreased the effect of spacing ratio on flow around a row of five side by side cylinders for different aspect ratios was studied by islam et al 2016b 2016c 2018 and rahman et al 2018 using lbm islam et al 2016b categorized the flow into flip flopping nearly unsteady in phase modulated in phase anti phase non synchronized and synchronized flow regimes they also found that the average mean drag coefficient and strouhal number decreased for increasing g islam et al 2018 performed lattice boltzmann simulations and studied the effect of g on flow around a row of five side by side rectangular cylinders and observed the nearly symmetric flip flopping modulated strongly and weakly interactive flow regimes the authors also found formation of vortices on the surface of cylinders due to which the drag and lift forces of each cylinder showed modulated behaviour for small g the flow was dominated by secondary cylinder interaction frequencies due to strong effect of generated jet between the gaps of consecutive cylinders while for large g the flow was dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency rahman et al 2018 concluded that when merging and distortion of shed vortices were observed throughout computational domain this type of flow structure was named as modulated class and this class was further subdivided into nearly bistable deflected chaotic and flip flopping flow regimes when the flow behind the middle cylinder in a row of five side by side rectangular cylinders showed steady or nearly steady behaviour then this class was named as symmetric class and the flow regime for this class was either symmetric or nearly symmetric and when the effect of spacing ratio between the cylinders vanished and each cylinder behaved like a single cylinder this class was named as synchronized and the observed flow regimes in this class were synchronized quasi synchronized and non synchronized furthermore the authors reported that mean drag coefficient of each rectangular cylinder showed increasing behaviour for decreasing g and small g had more control on st of each cylinder as compared to large g depending on spacing g 0 5 4 between the cylinders for fixed aspect ratio islam et al 2016c divided the flow behind a row of five side by side rectangular cylinders into symmetric flip flopping in phase and anti phase modulated deflected in phase modulated non synchronized and in phase and anti phase modulated synchronized flow regimes they reported modulated drag for all g except at g 0 5 and average mean drag coefficient decreases and st increases for increasing g chatterjee et al 2010 used finite volume method to investigate the effect of g on flow behind a row of five square cylinders and observed flip flopping in phase and anti phase synchronized and non synchronized flow regimes for different spacing ratios at small g the authors characterized the flow by secondary cylinder interaction frequencies due the generated jet flow between the gaps while for large g the flow was predominated by primary vortex shedding frequency from the above literature it is clear that although there are a large number of studies available for flow behind one two three four and five cylinders arranged side by side in most of the studies the effect of spacing ratio aspect ratio are studied but surprisingly the effect of reynolds number is very scare to the best of authors knowledge there is no reference data available in open literature on the effect of reynolds numbers for flow behind a row of five side by side square cylinders furthermore very little documentation and limited information about flow regime results from different reynolds number are available about the flow behind multiple cylinders which aims the present study in this study the effect of reynolds numbers on flow behind a row of five side by side square cylinders will be systematically studied qualitatively the flow around the cylinders will be analyzed in terms of vorticity contours time trace analysis of cd and cl and power spectra of cl the quantitative information of cdm and st will also be computed on each cylinder and will be presented 2 statement of the problem the schematic configuration for five square cylinders in a channel is presented in fig 1 the channel is fixed in longitudinal direction x and varies in transverse direction y for different spacing ratios five fixed two dimensional square cylinders c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 of size d are exposed to uniform incoming flow u umax v 0 the computational domain length is l and height is h the five square cylinders are arranged side by side in the channel from bottom to top the upstream distance is represented by ud and the downstream distance by dd in fig 1 s represents the surface to surface distance between two consecutive cylinders the boundary conditions used for the proposed problem were the same as used in the authors previously published work for flow around a row of five rectangular cylinders islam et al 2016b 2016c 2018 rahman et al 2018 3 lattice boltzmann method lattice boltzmann method has many advantages compared to conventional methods like finite difference finite volume and finite element method lbm can be easily applied to the problems having complex geometries guo and chan 2013 can easily handle the non linear term in navier stokes equations chen and doolen 1998 it is second order accurate both in time and space explicit in natures mohamad 2011 pressure term is calculated using the equation of state wolf gladrow 2000 and it can be easily parallelized due to its local nature chen and doolen 1998 on the basis of these advantages lbm is a better choice for the proposed model in this section a brief introduction of lbm is given and for more details the readers can concern islam et al 2016b 2016c 2018 rahman et al 2018 guo and chan 2013 chen and doolen 1998 mohamad 2011 wolf gladrow 2000 the governing navier stokes equations considered in the present study are 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p ν 2 u equation 1 represents the continuity equation while eq 2 represents the momentum equation these equations can be recovered by applying the chapman enskog expansion chapman and cowling 1970 to the discretized lattice boltzmann equation given as 3 h i x e i δ t t δ t h i x t streaming 1 τ h i x t h i eq x t collision where h i is the density evolution function at position x and time t τ is the single relaxation time parameter and is related to kinematic viscosity with the following equation 4 τ 6 ϑ 1 2 the stability analysis shows that the value of relaxation parameter should be greater than 0 5 the equilibrium distribution function h i eq is given by the relation 5 h i eq ρ ω i 1 3 e i u 3 2 u 2 9 4 e i u 2 where ω i are the weighting coefficients these weighting coefficients are different for different models used in lbm for the two dimensional nine velocity particles d2q9 model used in present study the weighting coefficients are 6 ω i 4 9 i 0 1 9 i 1 2 3 4 1 36 i 5 6 7 8 4 grid independence and validation of code 4 1 grid independence in this subsection we will discuss the adequacy of the grid on the surface of the square cylinder in order to check the spatial adequacy d 5 10 20 40 and 80 number of grid points on the surface of the cylinder are considered the mean drag coefficient strouhal number root mean square values for drag and lift coefficient cdrms and clrms for different grid points are calculated and the computed data are presented in table 1 it can be seen from the table that for d 40 and 80 the cylinder experiences higher drag and also for these grids a large computational domain is required as well more computational time it is also observed that at d 5 and d 10 the cdm for both the cases is almost similar to cdm of d 20 case but smaller values of strouhal can be seen see table 1 higher values for cdrms and clrms are observed at d 40 and 80 and smaller values for cdrms at d 5 and 10 while higher values of clrms at d 5 and 10 compared to d 20 table 1 from the above analysis it is deduced that 20 grid points on the surface of cylinder gives better results in terms of accuracy and computational time compared to other cases guo et al 2008 also used 20 grid points on the surface of a square cylinder 4 2 validation of code before going to fully analyze the flow structure behind a row of five side by side square cylinders it is very essential to validate the code used for the study for this purpose a code for flow behind a single square cylinder is originally written in fortran and the mean drag coefficient strouhal number root mean square values of drag and lift coefficient of the cylinder for different reynolds numbers ranging from re 60 to 200 is compared with the experimental data of okajima 1982 norberg 1993 davis and moore 1982 and dutta et al 2004 and numerical simulations of sohankar et al 1995 de and dalal 2006 robichuax et al 1999 and gera et al 2010 this comparison is depicted in fig 2 from fig 2 a it can be seen that the cdm of present study is in agreement with experimental data of okajima 1982 at re 150 and 200 norberg 1993 and dutta et al 2004 at re 200 with numerical data of sohankar et al 1995 at re 100 150 and 200 and de and dalal 2006 and gera et al 2010 at re 150 175 and 200 respectively also from fig 2 b it is clear that the st of present study is consistent with experimental and numerical data of okajima 1982 at re 100 norberg 1993 at re 100 and 200 davis and moore 1982 dutta et al 2004 and sohankar et al 1995 at re 100 robichuax et al 1999 at re 175 respectively the clrms values of present code are consistent with the numerical data of sohankar et al 1995 de and dalal 2006 and gera et al 2010 at re 150 see fig 2 d also at re 150 a good agreement between present clrms values and gera et al 2010 and de and dalal 2006 can be seen from fig 2 d also minor variations in cdrms values can be observed from numerical data of sohankar et al 1995 fig 2 c from this comparison it can be concluded that the code developed for flow around a single isolated cylinder can capture all the features of flow structure mechanism around a square cylinder capably and accurately that s why this code is extended for five square cylinders and is used for the current study 5 domain independence study it is very necessary to select an appropriate domain when the fluid structure interaction problems are analyzed for this purpose different upstream downstream and computational height are checked in terms of mean drag coefficients for flow around a row of five square cylinders at g re 2 150 the observed results are given in table 2 from table it can be seen that the cdm of all cylinders decreases as ud increases from 4 5d to 10 5d when dd and h are fixed at 36 5d and 14d respectively for fixed ud 7 5d and h 14d the mean drag coefficients of all cylinders shows negligible variations and the same phenomena occurs when ud and dd are fixed at 7 5d and 36 5d respectively and h is varied from 10d to 18d since negligible differences occur between mean drag coefficients of all cylinders the selected domain for the present study is ud 7 5d dd 36 5 and h 14d excluding the cylinders 6 results and discussions 6 1 flow regimes in this section the flow is categorized into three flow regimes on the basis of their flow characteristics in vorticity contours time trace analysis of cd and cl and the fast fourier transform fft spectrum of lift coefficient each flow regime is further subdivided into different flow regimes similar cases are omitted and only representative cases of each flow regime are discussed in the subsequent subsections the considered g and re for the current study are 0 5 1 1 2 1 5 2 2 5 3 3 5 4 and 5 and 75 90 100 110 125 130 140 150 160 and 175 respectively 6 1 1 flow regime i in this flow regime the vortices behind the cylinders show merging distortion and irregular behaviour throughout the channel even at immediate downstream the vortices amalgamated with each other and a complex flow structure can be seen at further downstream of the channel the drag and lift coefficient signals of each cylinder is modulated the fft spectrum of cl shows that the flow structure mechanism is predominated by secondary cylinder interaction frequencies and multiple peaks can be seen in general the flow structure mechanism in the flow regime i shows irregular and distorted manner this regime is further classified in to different flow regimes for different combination of spacing ratios and reynolds numbers the first flow regime is nearly bistable flow observed at g re 0 5 150 0 5 175 1 110 1 160 1 175 1 2 100 and 1 2 125 the vorticity contours and time trace analysis of cd and cl of a representative case at g re 1 110 is shown in fig 3 the irregular and inconsistent vortices behind the cylinders can be seen fig 3 a at small downstream position the shed vortices merges and bistability can clearly be seen at further downstream position see fig 3 a due to small g the strong effect of jet flow generated among the gaps of two consecutive cylinders can be seen in fig 3 a from open literature it was observed that zdravkovich 1987 classified the flow interface between two side by side circular cylinders into single vortex street coupled vortex street and bistable flow for the first time in 1987 for this flow regime the irregularity and inconsistency of flow can also be verified from the time series investigations of drag and lift coefficients shown in fig 3 b and c the drag and lift signals of each cylinder show modulated behaviour with varying amplitude see fig 3 b and c it is clear from these graphs that no periodicity can be seen in the signals of cd and cl while the behaviour of first and fifth and second and fourth cylinder lift signals is identical and opposite to each other respectively fig 3 c this behaviour of lift signals confirms the bistability of flow due to modulation of lift coefficient the spectrum of each cylinder is very intricate and it is very hard to differentiate the highest peak primary vortex shedding frequency from multiple peaks secondary cylinder interaction frequencies due to small spacing ratio fig 6 a c a broaden spectrum is observed due to bistability of flow behind the cylinders see fig 6 c only the spectrum of first three cylinders is shown for the sake of brevity in our previous work rahman et al 2018 we have also reported nearly bistable flow regime for flow around a row of five rectangular cylinders at g re 0 5 150 chaotic flow regime is the second flow regime of flow regime i observed at g re 1 75 1 125 1 150 1 2 75 1 2 90 1 2 130 1 2 140 1 5 110 0 5 160 1 100 and 1 5 140 the snapshots of vorticity and signal analysis of drag and lift coefficient at g re 0 5 160 is presented in fig 4 the vortices behind the cylinders at downstream position are narrower or wider and this narrowness and wideness of vortices do not follow any pattern clear from fig 4 a the amalgamations and distortion of generated vortices is observed throughout the channel and there is no relationship between these vortices see fig 4 a it can also be seen from fig 4 a that the shed vortices merge initially and due to oscillation the generated shear layer is strengthen and two strong wakes can be seen as the vortices are either narrower or wider and due to this change in shape and size of vortices the drag show modulated behaviour see fig 4 b it is clear from fig 4 b that the first and fifth cylinders outer two cylinders experience more drag compared to second third and fourth cylinders inner three cylinder in lift coefficient signals fig 4 c the outer two cylinders c1 and c5 are anti phase to each other and the variations in amplitude is observed both the cd and cl curves show modulated behaviour and when the flow travels in the channel its amplitude show variation that is either increasing or decreasing the first and fifth and second and fourth cylinder spectrum graphs are identical for g re 0 5 160 while the spectrum of middle cylinder third show very complex behaviour due to this only the spectrum of first three cylinders is presented in fig 6 d f this similarity of spectrum for c1 c5 and c2 c4 was also reported by islam et al 2016c for flow behind a row of five rectangular cylinders the power spectrum of each cylinder in fig 6 d f is chaotic and diffused peaks can be seen the cylinder c3 is more chaotic compared to cylinders c1 and c2 our previous results rahman et al 2018 and awale 2014 for flow behind five and four cylinders respectively are consistent with the present results the last observed flow regime in flow regime i is the flip flopping flow regime investigated at g re 1 130 1 140 1 2 110 1 2 150 1 2 160 1 2 175 1 5 75 1 5 90 1 5 100 1 5 125 1 5 130 1 5 150 1 5 160 and 1 5 175 here g re 1 2 110 will be discussed as a representative case from the vorticity plot it is clear that the generated vortices are not clear at small downstream and at further downstream the vortices breaks and a scattered flow structure can be seen see fig 5 a this is due to the fact that the generated jet flow between the gaps of two consecutive cylinders is very strong and it prevents the vortices to generate even at immediate downstream of the computational domain fig 5 a chatterjee et al 2010 also observed the same flow regime for flow around a row of five square cylinders at g re 1 2 150 the vortices bursts at downstream of the channel in flip flopping flow regime and narrow and wide wakes can be seen and these wakes switch from one to other randomly fig 5 a at re 100 and 0 25 g 1 alam et al 2017 reported the flip flopping flow regime for flow around a row of four circular cylinders we have also reported the flip flopping flow regime in our previous work islam et al 2016b 2016c 2018 rahman et al 2018 for flow around a row of five rectangular cylinders for different spacing values and aspect ratios the time series analysis of drag and lift coefficients presented in fig 5 b and c show that both the drag and lift curves are modulated and due to strong effect of jet flow the dynamic of drag and lift force decoupled moreover the cycles of both curves are not constant and also variation in amplitude is clear in fig 5 b and c it is clear from the lift graph fig 5 c the outer two cylinders c1 and c5 experience large lift force in magnitude compared to the inner three cylinders c2 c3 and c4 the power spectra of first three cylinders at g re 1 2 110 is shown in fig 6 g i as the flow flip flop and due to strong effect of jet the flow is dominated by secondary cylinder interaction frequencies multiple peaks the spectrum of flip flopping flow is broad compared to the other flow regimes observed in the flow regime i see fig 6 this is because at g re 1 2 110 the vortices burst and scattered at downstream position can be seen in fig 5 a and this is due to generated jet flow in the gaps 6 1 2 flow regime ii in this flow regime the behaviour of lower two cylinders c1 and c2 and upper two cylinders c4 and c5 is same while the middle cylinder c3 is steady straight line on the basis of this property this flow regime can also be named as symmetric flow regime symmetric flow regime is observed at g re 0 5 75 140 1 90 2 150 2 160 and 2 175 in symmetric flow the middle cylinder lift coefficient is steady which mean that there is no vortex shedding from this cylinder the vorticity contours at g re 0 5 130 and 2 175 is presented in fig 7 a and b and fig 7 c and d shows the temporal variations of drag and lift coefficients for symmetric flow regime at g re 0 5 130 at small downstream a negative elongated wake and vortices can be seen at upper side of the channel while a positive elongated wake and vortices are clearly visible at lower side of the channel fig 7 a only streamlines can be seen behind the cylinder c3 in the case when g re 2 175 and the vortices of cylinders c1 c2 and c4 c5 are clearly apparent at small downstream and show amalgamation and distortion at downstream position of the computational domain fig 7 b it is clear from the temporal variations of lift coefficient fig 7 d that the middle cylinder is steady straight line about the mean for g re 2 175 a representative case the cylinders c1 c5 and c2 c4 lift coefficients signals are identical and cylinders c1 c5 and c2 c4 are anti phase to one another the drag coefficients of all cylinders show periodic behaviour for g re 0 5 130 because of the narrow spacing ratio in which all the cylinders behave like a single bluff body not shown while for g re 2 175 the variations in amplitude of drag coefficients can be clearly seen fig 6 c the cylinder c3 experiences small drag compared to cylinders c1 c2 c4 and c5 for g re 2 175 the power spectrum of lift coefficient for symmetric flow regime is shown in fig 8 a d we have not given the spectrum of cylinder c3 because its lift signal shows steady behaviour clear from fig 7 d the spectrum of cylinders c1 c5 and c2 c4 are identical see fig 8 because the lift signals of cylinders c1 c5 and c2 c4 have identical behaviour and anti phase to each other fig 7 d minute effect of secondary cylinder interaction frequencies can be seen in the form of secondary peaks in fig 8 because of the variations in amplitude of lift coefficient see fig 7 d but the flow is dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency this flow regime was also investigated in our previous published papers islam et al 2018 rahman et al 2018 6 1 3 flow regime iii in this flow regime the shed vortices from each cylinder are clearly apparent at immediate downstream position and show merging behaviour at further downstream in some cases due to clearly appearance of vortices at immediate downstream this flow regime can also be named as periodic flow regime on the basis of merging and distortion of generated vortices at downstream location of the computational domain this flow regime is further classified into three flow regimes the first flow regime in this flow regime is quasi periodic flow i observed at g re 2 75 140 and 2 5 75 175 the quasi periodic flow i is discussed in this subsection in terms of vorticity contour plot time series analysis of drag and lift coefficients fig 9 and power spectrum of lift coefficient of first three cylinders fig 12 a c at g re 2 5 130 it can be seen from vorticity plots fig 9 a that the vortices are clearly apparent at small downstream but soon after when the vortices are fully developed merges with each other x 15d and this merging behaviour of vortices is consistent throughout the computational domain the merging of vortices can also be verified from time series of lift coefficient which clearly indicates the variation in magnitude see fig 9 c due to different shape and size of vortices the time series of drag coefficient show modulated behaviour fig 9 b the lift coefficients signals phase relationship of two consecutive cylinders are checked and are observed that the anti phase and in phase vortex shedding is dominant which means that the vortex shedding from two consecutive cylinders is in phase at some downstream and at further downstream it is anti phase or vice versa this type of flow was also reported by awale 2014 at 3 g 5 and kumar et al 2008 at 3 g 4 for flow structure mechanism around a row of four and nine circular and square cylinders respectively due to variation in amplitude of lift signal shown in fig 9 c in the fft spectrum of cl a secondary cylinder frequency can be seen see fig 12 a c in the flow regime iii the second flow regime is quasi periodic flow ii observed at g re 3 75 175 3 5 75 150 3 5 175 4 75 125 4 140 4 150 and 4 175 compared to quasi periodic flow i in this flow the merging and distortion of shed vortices starts at far downstream position near the exit of the channel see fig 10 a the downstream region for which merging of vortices happen is approximately x 31d kumar et al 2008 reported that in quasi periodic flow ii the downstream merging of vortices around a row of nine square cylinders at x 5d the vortices do not merge behind each cylinder and for the chosen case it can be seen behind the cylinders c1 c2 at g re 3 5 140 also the separate karman vortex street alternate negative and positive vortices can be seen behind each cylinder see fig 10 a in this type of flow when the merging of vortices are negligibly small can normally be seen for large spacing values but in this study it is observed at moderate spacing values also the drag shows modulated behaviour fig 10 b while lift signal is periodic with some evidence of variation in amplitude at far downstream fig 10 c also it is clear from fig 10 b that the inner three cylinders c2 c3 and c4 experiences more drag force compared to outer two cylinders c1 and c5 also we have check the lift signals of successive pairs of cylinders c1 c2 c2 c3 c3 c4 and c4 c5 and found in phase anti phase anti phase and anti phase for g re 3 5 140 see fig 10 c from this analysis it is clear that the anti phase vortex shedding is predominant in this flow regime awale 2014 and kumar et al 2008 also observed quasi periodic flow ii at g 2 and at 1 g 3 for flow around a row of four and nine circular and square cylinders respectively as the lift coefficient signal of each cylinder shows sinusoidal behaviour the primary vortex shedding frequency dominates the flow shown in fig 12 d f as the spacing ratio is large enough and the effect of jet flow between gaps of consecutive cylinders completely diminishes no secondary peaks secondary cylinder interaction frequencies can be seen fig 12 d f the last observed flow regime for flow regime iii is fully periodic flow analyzed at g re 3 5 160 4 130 4 160 and 5 75 175 from the vorticity plot of a representative case at g re 5 175 shown in fig 11 a it is clear that the generated vortices behind each cylinder is fully developed and no amalgamation and distortion can be seen throughout the computational domain the flow structure behind the cylinders when there are no interactions of vortices is also called weakly interactive flow regime a separate karman vortex street can be clearly seen behind each cylinder and every cylinder behave like a single bluff body as effect of jet flow vanish due to large spacing ratios fig 11 a one important finding is that as the reynolds number increases the vortices strength increases for fixed spacing ratio g 5 the phenomenon can be verified from time series analysis of drag coefficient which shows chaotic behaviour for weaker vortices investigated at g re 5 75 not shown and periodic behaviour with varying amplitude fig 10 b for stronger vortices observed at g re 5 175 the lift coefficient signal show sinusoidal behaviour with dominant anti phase vortex shedding see fig 10 c at g re 5 75 the vortex shedding from cylinders c3 and c4 are in phase while for c1 c2 c2 c3 and c4 c5 the vortex shedding is anti phase not shown in case when g re 5 175 the vortex shedding from cylinders c1 and c2 is in phase and for c2 c3 c3 c4 and c4 c5 it is anti phase fig 11 c for large spacing ratios when there is no or very weak interactions between the vortices and flow structure behind the cylinders is fully developed the power spectrum of each cylinder is fully dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency see fig 12 g i only a predominant single highest peak can be seen in fig 12 g i and there are no signs of secondary peaks such type of flow structure in which the flow is fully developed behind each cylinder was reported by alam et al 2017 and awale 2014 for a row of four cylinders islam et al 2016b 2016c 2018 rahman et al 2018 and chatterjee et al 2010 for a row of five cylinders and kumar et al 2008 for a row of nine cylinders 6 2 data analysis the mean drag coefficients and strouhal numbers of five square cylinders along with the cdm and st of single square cylinder is calculated for re 75 175 and g 0 5 1 5 3 and 5 the calculated values are given in fig 13 the mean drag coefficient values at g 0 5 of c1 c2 and c4 c5 are identical and are different from cdm3 up to re 140 and for re 150 160 and 175 all the cylinders mean drag coefficients values are same fig 13 a variations increasing decreasing behaviour in cdm of all cylinders can be seen in fig 13 a up to re 110 decreasing for re 125 130 and 150 and increasing for remaining re as the spacing ratio is small and the effect of generated jet flow between the gaps is very strong and all cylinders behaves like a single rectangle due to which the mean drag coefficient values of all cylinders are larger than single cylinder cdm the st of the five square cylinders at g 0 5 are shown in fig 13 b along with single cylinder data for comparison for g 0 5 and re 75 90 100 110 140 and 160 we have not calculated the st value of cylinder c3 as the cl shows steady behaviour while for g 0 5 and re 125 130 and 175 the vortex shedding frequency of c3 is very small compared to other cylinders and single cylinder st values fig 13 b all the five cylinders and single cylinder st values are identical for all chosen re except the st3 at re 125 130 and 175 and st2 and st4 at re 160 and 175 respectively where the values are smaller than other cylinders st values and close to zero see fig 13 b fig 13 c and d represent the effect of re on mean drag coefficient and vortex shedding frequency at g 1 5 the cdm1 values are identical to cdm5 values for all re and similarly that of cdm2 and cdm4 while the cdm3 values are smaller than the cdm values of c1 c2 c4 and c5 see fig 13 c it can be seen from fig 13 c that mean drag coefficient values of all cylinders are larger that the single cylinder values for increasing re small variations can be seen in cdm values of all cylinders on the other hand the st values show increasing and decreasing behaviour for increasing re at re 125 the st values of c1 c4 and c5 are almost identical and smaller than the st values of c2 and c3 see fig 13 d st1 and st5 values are identical for all re except at re 125 and st2 and st4 values are same for all re fig 13 d at g 3 the effect of re on cdm and st is presented in fig 13 e and f due to large spacing ratio no variations can be seen in mean drag coefficients and strouhal numbers of all cylinders for increasing re and these values are larger than single cylinder data this is because that at g 3 the observed flow regime is flow regime iii in which the flow is fully developed the mean drag coefficient of first cylinder is identical to fifth and the second is similar to fourth and these cdm curves show decreasing behaviour for increasing re while small variation in cdm3 can be seen fig 13 e the same trend is also observed for strouhal values but contrary to cdm values the st values are approaching to single cylinder data see fig 13 e and f for large spacing ratio g 5 the values of mean drag coefficient and strouhal of all cylinders are identical for all chosen reynolds numbers as illustrated in fig 13 g and h also the values are approximately equals to the data of single square cylinder and the trend is also similar see fig 13 g and h because g 5 is large enough spacing among the cylinders the effect of jet flow disappears and every cylinder behave like a single isolated body it is also clear from fig 13 that for increasing g the cdm values of all cylinders show decreasing behaviour and approaching to single cylinder data the st values also show the same behaviour except for g 0 5 where most of st values are identical to single cylinder data this indicates that the effect of g is more on the physical parameters compared to re but at large g the effect of re is more the observed flow regimes at different combinations of g re is illustrated in fig 14 the flow regime i is investigated at small spacing ratios that is g 0 5 1 1 2 and 1 5 for all chosen re except at g re 0 5 75 0 5 90 0 5 100 0 5 110 0 5 125 0 5 130 0 5 140 and 1 90 where the flow regime ii is investigated also for large spacing ratios g 2 5 the flow regime iii is examined except for g re 2 150 2 160 and 2 175 where the flow regime ii is investigated 7 conclusions numerical simulations for flow behind a row of five side by side square cylinders were performed in this paper using the lattice boltzmann method the effect of reynolds numbers 75 re 175 and spacing ratios 0 5 g 5 on flow structure mechanism behind a row of five square cylinders were fully analyzed and documented the main findings of the present study are summarized below i the flow structure behind the cylinders was classified into three major flow regimes flow regime i in which the flow showed merging and distortion behaviour throughout the computational domain flow regime ii in which the flow was symmetric about the middle cylinder and flow regime iii in which the flow was fully developed and each cylinder behave like a single bluff body each flow regime was further subdivided in different flow regimes there were total seven flow regimes observed in this study in which three regimes in flow regime i one in flow regime ii and three in flow regime iii ii in flow regime i at g re 0 5 150 0 5 175 1 110 1 160 1 175 1 2 100 and 1 2 125 the nearly bistable flow regime at g re 0 5 160 1 100 1 75

flip flopping regime were observed iii in flow regime ii at g re 0 5 75 0 5 90 0 5 100 0 5 110 0 5 125 0 5 130 0 5 140 1 90 2 150 2 160 and 2 175 the symmetric flow regime was found iv in flow regime iii at g re 2 75 140 and 2 5 75 175 quasi periodic flow i at g re 3 75 175 3 5 75 150 3 5 175 4 75 125 4 140 4 150 and 4 175 quasi periodic flow ii and at g re 3 5 160 4 130 4 160 and 5 75 175 fully periodic flow regime were investigated v it was found that in flow regime i the outer two cylinders c1 and c5 experienced larger drag compared to inner three cylinders c2 c3 and c4 vi it was also observed that for flow regime i the fft spectrum of flow was dominated by secondary cylinder interaction frequencies while for flow regime iii the flow was dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency vii the mean drag coefficient values at g 0 5 of c1 c2 and c4 c5 were found identical and are different from cdm3 up to re 140 and for re 150 160 and 175 all the cylinders mean drag coefficients were same at g 1 5 the cdm1 values were found identical to cdm5 values for all re and similarly that of cdm2 and cdm4 while the cdm3 values was analyzed smaller than the cdm values of c1 c2 c4 and c5 for g 5 all cylinders cdm showed identical behaviour for increasing re and were found similar to single cylinder data it was also found that for increasing g the cdm values of all cylinders showed decreasing behaviour and approaching to single cylinder data viii in this paper the strouhal values for cylinder c3 was not calculated for flow regime ii due to its steady behaviour of lift signal the st values of all cylinders approached to the st values of single isolated cylinder at g 5 and for g 1 5 and 3 these values were found larger than the single cylinder data for increasing re ix for large g it was examined that for increasing re the vortices became strengthen x for small spacing ratios the effect of g on physical parameters was observed more compared to re while for large g this trend reversed credit authorship contribution statement hamid rahman writing original draft conceptualization methodology software validation investigation resources project

20228,in this paper numerical investigations are performed to examine the effect of reynolds numbers re and spacing ratios g on flow around a row of five side by side square cylinders using the lattice boltzmann method the reynolds number is varied in the range 75 re 175 while spacing ratio is varied between 0 5 and 5 the flow structure mechanism around a row of five side by side square cylinders is studied in terms of vorticity contours visualization time trace analysis of drag and lifts coefficients and power spectrum analysis of lift coefficient the effect of re on force statistics like mean drag coefficient and strouhal number is also analyzed the present data are compared with the data of single square cylinder and good agreement is observed for large spacing ratio g 5 the flow behind five side by side square cylinders is classified into three different flow regimes and these regimes are further subdivided into seven different regimes the observed flow regimes are compared with those of the other researchers published studies and found good agreement keywords flow regimes lattice boltzmann method reynolds number spacing ratio square cylinder strouhal number 1 introduction circular and square cylinders are the most common bluff bodies widely used in many applications for example beams bridges chimneys etc fluid structure interaction plays a key role in number of engineering applications when the reynolds number re umaxd ʋ where umax d and ʋ are the uniform inflow velocity size of the cylinder and shear kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively is high the applications of flow around multiple bluff structures can be found in tall buildings fences packages of high voltage lines chemical reaction towers etc and when the reynolds number is small these applications can be found in micro devices such as in micro electro mechanical systems and fibre cooling in this study the effect of reynolds number on flow around a row of five side by side square cylinders will be carried out for different spacing ratios g s d where s is the surface to surface distance between the two successive cylinders many researchers had studied the characteristics of flow behind one two three and a row more than three of cylinders in side by side arrangement some representative studies will be discussed in this section as a literature survey by applying multi relaxation time lattice boltzmann method mrt lbm islam et al 2014 reported that when fluid interact with a single square cylinder the fluid forces showed periodic nature and only primary vortex shedding frequency was investigated for different reynolds numbers golani and dhiman 2014 examined that the drag coefficient cd 2fx ρu2 maxd where fx is the force component along stream wise direction and ρ is the fluid density falls for increasing re while the shedding frequency improves gera et al 2010 found variations in strouhal st fsd umax where fs is the vortex shedding frequency against reynolds numbers and observed dominant primary vortex shedding frequency for re 55 islam et al 2012 examined discontinuity in st for re 250 and decreasing behaviour for re 100 and 150 abdollah et al 2008 experimentally investigated constant st value at re 8600 and 17400 for flow around a single cylinder yen and yang 2011 divided the flow mechanism around a square cylinder into leading edge separation separation bubble and attached flow and found that the lift coefficient cl 2fy ρu2 maxd where fy is the force component along transverse direction does not vary significantly against re guo et al 2008 reported symmetric flow in which the lift force is zero and drag force varies with reynolds number breuer et al 2000 classified the flow around a square cylinder into steady and unsteady flow for reynolds number of 0 5 re 60 and 60 re 300 respectively sohankar et al 1998 reported that the onset of vortex shedding occurs within the range 40 re 55 for flow behind a single cylinder from this discussion it is clear that reynolds number strongly affects the flow structure mechanism around a single cylinder that s why in the current study we will examine the effect of reynolds number on flow around a row of five side by side square cylinders for different spacing ratios agrawal et al 2006 developed two dimensional lbm code and found formation of vortices at re 10 and at re 30 flow start oscillation around the two side by side cylinders for g 2 5 the synchronized and flip flopping flow regimes were investigated in which the amalgamations of vortices were gradual for the former regime and rapid for the later one kang 2003 carried out numerical simulations and divided the flow structure mechanism behind a pair of side by side cylinders into six different flow regimes which are anti phase synchronized in phase synchronized flip flopping deflected single bluff body and steady flows he investigated that the effect of spacing ratio on flow mechanism is much stronger than the re moreover the mean drag coefficient cdm cd i n where n are total number of steps dependent only on spacing ratio while the lift coefficient is dependent on both g and re alam and zhou 2013 classified the flow past two side by side square cylinders into single body asymmetric transition and coupled vortex street regimes the two dimensional unsteady compressible navier stokes equations were directly solved by inoue et al 2006 for flow behind a pair of side by side square cylinders and observed non synchronized flip flopping single bluff body in phase and anti phase synchronized and steady flow regimes han et al 2014 investigated three flow regimes single bluff body the gap flow interface and anti phase synchronized regimes for flow around two side by side square cylinders alam et al 2011 studied the wake mechanism of flow past two side by side square cylinders and categorized the flow into four different flow regimes the flow structure mechanism becomes more complex when the number of cylinders is increased from two to three four five and so forth because when more cylinders are arranged side by side the number of gaps increased and the generated flow in the gaps in the form of jet flow made the flow structure mechanism more complex zheng et al 2019 numerically studied the effect of spacing ratio on flow past three side by side square cylinders and identified base bleed flip flopping symmetrically biased beat non biased beat and weak interaction flows kang 2004 numerically used the immersed boundary method at low reynolds number of 100 to investigate the flow around three side by side circular cylinders the observed flow regimes are single bluff body deflected flip flopping in phase synchronized and modulation synchronized the author also reported that the st of middle cylinder was larger than the lower and upper cylinders and the middle cylinder experienced higher cdm than the upper and lower cylinders for modulation synchronized regime rahman et al 2015 studied the effect of re on flow behind three side by side square cylinders for small moderate and large unequal spacing ratios the observed flow regimes in their study are modulated synchronized fully synchronized and flip flopping they also reported that for larger spacing values and reynolds numbers the flow was fully dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency islam et al 2016a performed lattice boltzmann simulations and reported bistable asymmetric in phase anti phase synchronized and modulated synchronized flow regimes they also found that the force statistics were strongly affected by unequal spacing and their behaviour was notably different from those of equal spacing also at large g the flow was dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency alam et al 2017 numerically classified the flow around four side by side cylinders into four regimes single bluff body flip flopping quasi interlocked and interlocked flows for different g they found that the inner and outer cylinders experienced identical drag however the inner cylinders drag was observed to be larger than the outer two cylinders and this trend reverses for lift force awala awale 2014 categorized the flow around a row of four circular cylinders into synchronized quasi periodic i quasi periodic ii and chaotic flow regimes for different g at re 100 he reported that the cdm of inner two cylinders was larger than the outer two cylinders and for increasing g both mean drag coefficient and st decreased the effect of spacing ratio on flow around a row of five side by side cylinders for different aspect ratios was studied by islam et al 2016b 2016c 2018 and rahman et al 2018 using lbm islam et al 2016b categorized the flow into flip flopping nearly unsteady in phase modulated in phase anti phase non synchronized and synchronized flow regimes they also found that the average mean drag coefficient and strouhal number decreased for increasing g islam et al 2018 performed lattice boltzmann simulations and studied the effect of g on flow around a row of five side by side rectangular cylinders and observed the nearly symmetric flip flopping modulated strongly and weakly interactive flow regimes the authors also found formation of vortices on the surface of cylinders due to which the drag and lift forces of each cylinder showed modulated behaviour for small g the flow was dominated by secondary cylinder interaction frequencies due to strong effect of generated jet between the gaps of consecutive cylinders while for large g the flow was dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency rahman et al 2018 concluded that when merging and distortion of shed vortices were observed throughout computational domain this type of flow structure was named as modulated class and this class was further subdivided into nearly bistable deflected chaotic and flip flopping flow regimes when the flow behind the middle cylinder in a row of five side by side rectangular cylinders showed steady or nearly steady behaviour then this class was named as symmetric class and the flow regime for this class was either symmetric or nearly symmetric and when the effect of spacing ratio between the cylinders vanished and each cylinder behaved like a single cylinder this class was named as synchronized and the observed flow regimes in this class were synchronized quasi synchronized and non synchronized furthermore the authors reported that mean drag coefficient of each rectangular cylinder showed increasing behaviour for decreasing g and small g had more control on st of each cylinder as compared to large g depending on spacing g 0 5 4 between the cylinders for fixed aspect ratio islam et al 2016c divided the flow behind a row of five side by side rectangular cylinders into symmetric flip flopping in phase and anti phase modulated deflected in phase modulated non synchronized and in phase and anti phase modulated synchronized flow regimes they reported modulated drag for all g except at g 0 5 and average mean drag coefficient decreases and st increases for increasing g chatterjee et al 2010 used finite volume method to investigate the effect of g on flow behind a row of five square cylinders and observed flip flopping in phase and anti phase synchronized and non synchronized flow regimes for different spacing ratios at small g the authors characterized the flow by secondary cylinder interaction frequencies due the generated jet flow between the gaps while for large g the flow was predominated by primary vortex shedding frequency from the above literature it is clear that although there are a large number of studies available for flow behind one two three four and five cylinders arranged side by side in most of the studies the effect of spacing ratio aspect ratio are studied but surprisingly the effect of reynolds number is very scare to the best of authors knowledge there is no reference data available in open literature on the effect of reynolds numbers for flow behind a row of five side by side square cylinders furthermore very little documentation and limited information about flow regime results from different reynolds number are available about the flow behind multiple cylinders which aims the present study in this study the effect of reynolds numbers on flow behind a row of five side by side square cylinders will be systematically studied qualitatively the flow around the cylinders will be analyzed in terms of vorticity contours time trace analysis of cd and cl and power spectra of cl the quantitative information of cdm and st will also be computed on each cylinder and will be presented 2 statement of the problem the schematic configuration for five square cylinders in a channel is presented in fig 1 the channel is fixed in longitudinal direction x and varies in transverse direction y for different spacing ratios five fixed two dimensional square cylinders c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 of size d are exposed to uniform incoming flow u umax v 0 the computational domain length is l and height is h the five square cylinders are arranged side by side in the channel from bottom to top the upstream distance is represented by ud and the downstream distance by dd in fig 1 s represents the surface to surface distance between two consecutive cylinders the boundary conditions used for the proposed problem were the same as used in the authors previously published work for flow around a row of five rectangular cylinders islam et al 2016b 2016c 2018 rahman et al 2018 3 lattice boltzmann method lattice boltzmann method has many advantages compared to conventional methods like finite difference finite volume and finite element method lbm can be easily applied to the problems having complex geometries guo and chan 2013 can easily handle the non linear term in navier stokes equations chen and doolen 1998 it is second order accurate both in time and space explicit in natures mohamad 2011 pressure term is calculated using the equation of state wolf gladrow 2000 and it can be easily parallelized due to its local nature chen and doolen 1998 on the basis of these advantages lbm is a better choice for the proposed model in this section a brief introduction of lbm is given and for more details the readers can concern islam et al 2016b 2016c 2018 rahman et al 2018 guo and chan 2013 chen and doolen 1998 mohamad 2011 wolf gladrow 2000 the governing navier stokes equations considered in the present study are 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p ν 2 u equation 1 represents the continuity equation while eq 2 represents the momentum equation these equations can be recovered by applying the chapman enskog expansion chapman and cowling 1970 to the discretized lattice boltzmann equation given as 3 h i x e i δ t t δ t h i x t streaming 1 τ h i x t h i eq x t collision where h i is the density evolution function at position x and time t τ is the single relaxation time parameter and is related to kinematic viscosity with the following equation 4 τ 6 ϑ 1 2 the stability analysis shows that the value of relaxation parameter should be greater than 0 5 the equilibrium distribution function h i eq is given by the relation 5 h i eq ρ ω i 1 3 e i u 3 2 u 2 9 4 e i u 2 where ω i are the weighting coefficients these weighting coefficients are different for different models used in lbm for the two dimensional nine velocity particles d2q9 model used in present study the weighting coefficients are 6 ω i 4 9 i 0 1 9 i 1 2 3 4 1 36 i 5 6 7 8 4 grid independence and validation of code 4 1 grid independence in this subsection we will discuss the adequacy of the grid on the surface of the square cylinder in order to check the spatial adequacy d 5 10 20 40 and 80 number of grid points on the surface of the cylinder are considered the mean drag coefficient strouhal number root mean square values for drag and lift coefficient cdrms and clrms for different grid points are calculated and the computed data are presented in table 1 it can be seen from the table that for d 40 and 80 the cylinder experiences higher drag and also for these grids a large computational domain is required as well more computational time it is also observed that at d 5 and d 10 the cdm for both the cases is almost similar to cdm of d 20 case but smaller values of strouhal can be seen see table 1 higher values for cdrms and clrms are observed at d 40 and 80 and smaller values for cdrms at d 5 and 10 while higher values of clrms at d 5 and 10 compared to d 20 table 1 from the above analysis it is deduced that 20 grid points on the surface of cylinder gives better results in terms of accuracy and computational time compared to other cases guo et al 2008 also used 20 grid points on the surface of a square cylinder 4 2 validation of code before going to fully analyze the flow structure behind a row of five side by side square cylinders it is very essential to validate the code used for the study for this purpose a code for flow behind a single square cylinder is originally written in fortran and the mean drag coefficient strouhal number root mean square values of drag and lift coefficient of the cylinder for different reynolds numbers ranging from re 60 to 200 is compared with the experimental data of okajima 1982 norberg 1993 davis and moore 1982 and dutta et al 2004 and numerical simulations of sohankar et al 1995 de and dalal 2006 robichuax et al 1999 and gera et al 2010 this comparison is depicted in fig 2 from fig 2 a it can be seen that the cdm of present study is in agreement with experimental data of okajima 1982 at re 150 and 200 norberg 1993 and dutta et al 2004 at re 200 with numerical data of sohankar et al 1995 at re 100 150 and 200 and de and dalal 2006 and gera et al 2010 at re 150 175 and 200 respectively also from fig 2 b it is clear that the st of present study is consistent with experimental and numerical data of okajima 1982 at re 100 norberg 1993 at re 100 and 200 davis and moore 1982 dutta et al 2004 and sohankar et al 1995 at re 100 robichuax et al 1999 at re 175 respectively the clrms values of present code are consistent with the numerical data of sohankar et al 1995 de and dalal 2006 and gera et al 2010 at re 150 see fig 2 d also at re 150 a good agreement between present clrms values and gera et al 2010 and de and dalal 2006 can be seen from fig 2 d also minor variations in cdrms values can be observed from numerical data of sohankar et al 1995 fig 2 c from this comparison it can be concluded that the code developed for flow around a single isolated cylinder can capture all the features of flow structure mechanism around a square cylinder capably and accurately that s why this code is extended for five square cylinders and is used for the current study 5 domain independence study it is very necessary to select an appropriate domain when the fluid structure interaction problems are analyzed for this purpose different upstream downstream and computational height are checked in terms of mean drag coefficients for flow around a row of five square cylinders at g re 2 150 the observed results are given in table 2 from table it can be seen that the cdm of all cylinders decreases as ud increases from 4 5d to 10 5d when dd and h are fixed at 36 5d and 14d respectively for fixed ud 7 5d and h 14d the mean drag coefficients of all cylinders shows negligible variations and the same phenomena occurs when ud and dd are fixed at 7 5d and 36 5d respectively and h is varied from 10d to 18d since negligible differences occur between mean drag coefficients of all cylinders the selected domain for the present study is ud 7 5d dd 36 5 and h 14d excluding the cylinders 6 results and discussions 6 1 flow regimes in this section the flow is categorized into three flow regimes on the basis of their flow characteristics in vorticity contours time trace analysis of cd and cl and the fast fourier transform fft spectrum of lift coefficient each flow regime is further subdivided into different flow regimes similar cases are omitted and only representative cases of each flow regime are discussed in the subsequent subsections the considered g and re for the current study are 0 5 1 1 2 1 5 2 2 5 3 3 5 4 and 5 and 75 90 100 110 125 130 140 150 160 and 175 respectively 6 1 1 flow regime i in this flow regime the vortices behind the cylinders show merging distortion and irregular behaviour throughout the channel even at immediate downstream the vortices amalgamated with each other and a complex flow structure can be seen at further downstream of the channel the drag and lift coefficient signals of each cylinder is modulated the fft spectrum of cl shows that the flow structure mechanism is predominated by secondary cylinder interaction frequencies and multiple peaks can be seen in general the flow structure mechanism in the flow regime i shows irregular and distorted manner this regime is further classified in to different flow regimes for different combination of spacing ratios and reynolds numbers the first flow regime is nearly bistable flow observed at g re 0 5 150 0 5 175 1 110 1 160 1 175 1 2 100 and 1 2 125 the vorticity contours and time trace analysis of cd and cl of a representative case at g re 1 110 is shown in fig 3 the irregular and inconsistent vortices behind the cylinders can be seen fig 3 a at small downstream position the shed vortices merges and bistability can clearly be seen at further downstream position see fig 3 a due to small g the strong effect of jet flow generated among the gaps of two consecutive cylinders can be seen in fig 3 a from open literature it was observed that zdravkovich 1987 classified the flow interface between two side by side circular cylinders into single vortex street coupled vortex street and bistable flow for the first time in 1987 for this flow regime the irregularity and inconsistency of flow can also be verified from the time series investigations of drag and lift coefficients shown in fig 3 b and c the drag and lift signals of each cylinder show modulated behaviour with varying amplitude see fig 3 b and c it is clear from these graphs that no periodicity can be seen in the signals of cd and cl while the behaviour of first and fifth and second and fourth cylinder lift signals is identical and opposite to each other respectively fig 3 c this behaviour of lift signals confirms the bistability of flow due to modulation of lift coefficient the spectrum of each cylinder is very intricate and it is very hard to differentiate the highest peak primary vortex shedding frequency from multiple peaks secondary cylinder interaction frequencies due to small spacing ratio fig 6 a c a broaden spectrum is observed due to bistability of flow behind the cylinders see fig 6 c only the spectrum of first three cylinders is shown for the sake of brevity in our previous work rahman et al 2018 we have also reported nearly bistable flow regime for flow around a row of five rectangular cylinders at g re 0 5 150 chaotic flow regime is the second flow regime of flow regime i observed at g re 1 75 1 125 1 150 1 2 75 1 2 90 1 2 130 1 2 140 1 5 110 0 5 160 1 100 and 1 5 140 the snapshots of vorticity and signal analysis of drag and lift coefficient at g re 0 5 160 is presented in fig 4 the vortices behind the cylinders at downstream position are narrower or wider and this narrowness and wideness of vortices do not follow any pattern clear from fig 4 a the amalgamations and distortion of generated vortices is observed throughout the channel and there is no relationship between these vortices see fig 4 a it can also be seen from fig 4 a that the shed vortices merge initially and due to oscillation the generated shear layer is strengthen and two strong wakes can be seen as the vortices are either narrower or wider and due to this change in shape and size of vortices the drag show modulated behaviour see fig 4 b it is clear from fig 4 b that the first and fifth cylinders outer two cylinders experience more drag compared to second third and fourth cylinders inner three cylinder in lift coefficient signals fig 4 c the outer two cylinders c1 and c5 are anti phase to each other and the variations in amplitude is observed both the cd and cl curves show modulated behaviour and when the flow travels in the channel its amplitude show variation that is either increasing or decreasing the first and fifth and second and fourth cylinder spectrum graphs are identical for g re 0 5 160 while the spectrum of middle cylinder third show very complex behaviour due to this only the spectrum of first three cylinders is presented in fig 6 d f this similarity of spectrum for c1 c5 and c2 c4 was also reported by islam et al 2016c for flow behind a row of five rectangular cylinders the power spectrum of each cylinder in fig 6 d f is chaotic and diffused peaks can be seen the cylinder c3 is more chaotic compared to cylinders c1 and c2 our previous results rahman et al 2018 and awale 2014 for flow behind five and four cylinders respectively are consistent with the present results the last observed flow regime in flow regime i is the flip flopping flow regime investigated at g re 1 130 1 140 1 2 110 1 2 150 1 2 160 1 2 175 1 5 75 1 5 90 1 5 100 1 5 125 1 5 130 1 5 150 1 5 160 and 1 5 175 here g re 1 2 110 will be discussed as a representative case from the vorticity plot it is clear that the generated vortices are not clear at small downstream and at further downstream the vortices breaks and a scattered flow structure can be seen see fig 5 a this is due to the fact that the generated jet flow between the gaps of two consecutive cylinders is very strong and it prevents the vortices to generate even at immediate downstream of the computational domain fig 5 a chatterjee et al 2010 also observed the same flow regime for flow around a row of five square cylinders at g re 1 2 150 the vortices bursts at downstream of the channel in flip flopping flow regime and narrow and wide wakes can be seen and these wakes switch from one to other randomly fig 5 a at re 100 and 0 25 g 1 alam et al 2017 reported the flip flopping flow regime for flow around a row of four circular cylinders we have also reported the flip flopping flow regime in our previous work islam et al 2016b 2016c 2018 rahman et al 2018 for flow around a row of five rectangular cylinders for different spacing values and aspect ratios the time series analysis of drag and lift coefficients presented in fig 5 b and c show that both the drag and lift curves are modulated and due to strong effect of jet flow the dynamic of drag and lift force decoupled moreover the cycles of both curves are not constant and also variation in amplitude is clear in fig 5 b and c it is clear from the lift graph fig 5 c the outer two cylinders c1 and c5 experience large lift force in magnitude compared to the inner three cylinders c2 c3 and c4 the power spectra of first three cylinders at g re 1 2 110 is shown in fig 6 g i as the flow flip flop and due to strong effect of jet the flow is dominated by secondary cylinder interaction frequencies multiple peaks the spectrum of flip flopping flow is broad compared to the other flow regimes observed in the flow regime i see fig 6 this is because at g re 1 2 110 the vortices burst and scattered at downstream position can be seen in fig 5 a and this is due to generated jet flow in the gaps 6 1 2 flow regime ii in this flow regime the behaviour of lower two cylinders c1 and c2 and upper two cylinders c4 and c5 is same while the middle cylinder c3 is steady straight line on the basis of this property this flow regime can also be named as symmetric flow regime symmetric flow regime is observed at g re 0 5 75 140 1 90 2 150 2 160 and 2 175 in symmetric flow the middle cylinder lift coefficient is steady which mean that there is no vortex shedding from this cylinder the vorticity contours at g re 0 5 130 and 2 175 is presented in fig 7 a and b and fig 7 c and d shows the temporal variations of drag and lift coefficients for symmetric flow regime at g re 0 5 130 at small downstream a negative elongated wake and vortices can be seen at upper side of the channel while a positive elongated wake and vortices are clearly visible at lower side of the channel fig 7 a only streamlines can be seen behind the cylinder c3 in the case when g re 2 175 and the vortices of cylinders c1 c2 and c4 c5 are clearly apparent at small downstream and show amalgamation and distortion at downstream position of the computational domain fig 7 b it is clear from the temporal variations of lift coefficient fig 7 d that the middle cylinder is steady straight line about the mean for g re 2 175 a representative case the cylinders c1 c5 and c2 c4 lift coefficients signals are identical and cylinders c1 c5 and c2 c4 are anti phase to one another the drag coefficients of all cylinders show periodic behaviour for g re 0 5 130 because of the narrow spacing ratio in which all the cylinders behave like a single bluff body not shown while for g re 2 175 the variations in amplitude of drag coefficients can be clearly seen fig 6 c the cylinder c3 experiences small drag compared to cylinders c1 c2 c4 and c5 for g re 2 175 the power spectrum of lift coefficient for symmetric flow regime is shown in fig 8 a d we have not given the spectrum of cylinder c3 because its lift signal shows steady behaviour clear from fig 7 d the spectrum of cylinders c1 c5 and c2 c4 are identical see fig 8 because the lift signals of cylinders c1 c5 and c2 c4 have identical behaviour and anti phase to each other fig 7 d minute effect of secondary cylinder interaction frequencies can be seen in the form of secondary peaks in fig 8 because of the variations in amplitude of lift coefficient see fig 7 d but the flow is dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency this flow regime was also investigated in our previous published papers islam et al 2018 rahman et al 2018 6 1 3 flow regime iii in this flow regime the shed vortices from each cylinder are clearly apparent at immediate downstream position and show merging behaviour at further downstream in some cases due to clearly appearance of vortices at immediate downstream this flow regime can also be named as periodic flow regime on the basis of merging and distortion of generated vortices at downstream location of the computational domain this flow regime is further classified into three flow regimes the first flow regime in this flow regime is quasi periodic flow i observed at g re 2 75 140 and 2 5 75 175 the quasi periodic flow i is discussed in this subsection in terms of vorticity contour plot time series analysis of drag and lift coefficients fig 9 and power spectrum of lift coefficient of first three cylinders fig 12 a c at g re 2 5 130 it can be seen from vorticity plots fig 9 a that the vortices are clearly apparent at small downstream but soon after when the vortices are fully developed merges with each other x 15d and this merging behaviour of vortices is consistent throughout the computational domain the merging of vortices can also be verified from time series of lift coefficient which clearly indicates the variation in magnitude see fig 9 c due to different shape and size of vortices the time series of drag coefficient show modulated behaviour fig 9 b the lift coefficients signals phase relationship of two consecutive cylinders are checked and are observed that the anti phase and in phase vortex shedding is dominant which means that the vortex shedding from two consecutive cylinders is in phase at some downstream and at further downstream it is anti phase or vice versa this type of flow was also reported by awale 2014 at 3 g 5 and kumar et al 2008 at 3 g 4 for flow structure mechanism around a row of four and nine circular and square cylinders respectively due to variation in amplitude of lift signal shown in fig 9 c in the fft spectrum of cl a secondary cylinder frequency can be seen see fig 12 a c in the flow regime iii the second flow regime is quasi periodic flow ii observed at g re 3 75 175 3 5 75 150 3 5 175 4 75 125 4 140 4 150 and 4 175 compared to quasi periodic flow i in this flow the merging and distortion of shed vortices starts at far downstream position near the exit of the channel see fig 10 a the downstream region for which merging of vortices happen is approximately x 31d kumar et al 2008 reported that in quasi periodic flow ii the downstream merging of vortices around a row of nine square cylinders at x 5d the vortices do not merge behind each cylinder and for the chosen case it can be seen behind the cylinders c1 c2 at g re 3 5 140 also the separate karman vortex street alternate negative and positive vortices can be seen behind each cylinder see fig 10 a in this type of flow when the merging of vortices are negligibly small can normally be seen for large spacing values but in this study it is observed at moderate spacing values also the drag shows modulated behaviour fig 10 b while lift signal is periodic with some evidence of variation in amplitude at far downstream fig 10 c also it is clear from fig 10 b that the inner three cylinders c2 c3 and c4 experiences more drag force compared to outer two cylinders c1 and c5 also we have check the lift signals of successive pairs of cylinders c1 c2 c2 c3 c3 c4 and c4 c5 and found in phase anti phase anti phase and anti phase for g re 3 5 140 see fig 10 c from this analysis it is clear that the anti phase vortex shedding is predominant in this flow regime awale 2014 and kumar et al 2008 also observed quasi periodic flow ii at g 2 and at 1 g 3 for flow around a row of four and nine circular and square cylinders respectively as the lift coefficient signal of each cylinder shows sinusoidal behaviour the primary vortex shedding frequency dominates the flow shown in fig 12 d f as the spacing ratio is large enough and the effect of jet flow between gaps of consecutive cylinders completely diminishes no secondary peaks secondary cylinder interaction frequencies can be seen fig 12 d f the last observed flow regime for flow regime iii is fully periodic flow analyzed at g re 3 5 160 4 130 4 160 and 5 75 175 from the vorticity plot of a representative case at g re 5 175 shown in fig 11 a it is clear that the generated vortices behind each cylinder is fully developed and no amalgamation and distortion can be seen throughout the computational domain the flow structure behind the cylinders when there are no interactions of vortices is also called weakly interactive flow regime a separate karman vortex street can be clearly seen behind each cylinder and every cylinder behave like a single bluff body as effect of jet flow vanish due to large spacing ratios fig 11 a one important finding is that as the reynolds number increases the vortices strength increases for fixed spacing ratio g 5 the phenomenon can be verified from time series analysis of drag coefficient which shows chaotic behaviour for weaker vortices investigated at g re 5 75 not shown and periodic behaviour with varying amplitude fig 10 b for stronger vortices observed at g re 5 175 the lift coefficient signal show sinusoidal behaviour with dominant anti phase vortex shedding see fig 10 c at g re 5 75 the vortex shedding from cylinders c3 and c4 are in phase while for c1 c2 c2 c3 and c4 c5 the vortex shedding is anti phase not shown in case when g re 5 175 the vortex shedding from cylinders c1 and c2 is in phase and for c2 c3 c3 c4 and c4 c5 it is anti phase fig 11 c for large spacing ratios when there is no or very weak interactions between the vortices and flow structure behind the cylinders is fully developed the power spectrum of each cylinder is fully dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency see fig 12 g i only a predominant single highest peak can be seen in fig 12 g i and there are no signs of secondary peaks such type of flow structure in which the flow is fully developed behind each cylinder was reported by alam et al 2017 and awale 2014 for a row of four cylinders islam et al 2016b 2016c 2018 rahman et al 2018 and chatterjee et al 2010 for a row of five cylinders and kumar et al 2008 for a row of nine cylinders 6 2 data analysis the mean drag coefficients and strouhal numbers of five square cylinders along with the cdm and st of single square cylinder is calculated for re 75 175 and g 0 5 1 5 3 and 5 the calculated values are given in fig 13 the mean drag coefficient values at g 0 5 of c1 c2 and c4 c5 are identical and are different from cdm3 up to re 140 and for re 150 160 and 175 all the cylinders mean drag coefficients values are same fig 13 a variations increasing decreasing behaviour in cdm of all cylinders can be seen in fig 13 a up to re 110 decreasing for re 125 130 and 150 and increasing for remaining re as the spacing ratio is small and the effect of generated jet flow between the gaps is very strong and all cylinders behaves like a single rectangle due to which the mean drag coefficient values of all cylinders are larger than single cylinder cdm the st of the five square cylinders at g 0 5 are shown in fig 13 b along with single cylinder data for comparison for g 0 5 and re 75 90 100 110 140 and 160 we have not calculated the st value of cylinder c3 as the cl shows steady behaviour while for g 0 5 and re 125 130 and 175 the vortex shedding frequency of c3 is very small compared to other cylinders and single cylinder st values fig 13 b all the five cylinders and single cylinder st values are identical for all chosen re except the st3 at re 125 130 and 175 and st2 and st4 at re 160 and 175 respectively where the values are smaller than other cylinders st values and close to zero see fig 13 b fig 13 c and d represent the effect of re on mean drag coefficient and vortex shedding frequency at g 1 5 the cdm1 values are identical to cdm5 values for all re and similarly that of cdm2 and cdm4 while the cdm3 values are smaller than the cdm values of c1 c2 c4 and c5 see fig 13 c it can be seen from fig 13 c that mean drag coefficient values of all cylinders are larger that the single cylinder values for increasing re small variations can be seen in cdm values of all cylinders on the other hand the st values show increasing and decreasing behaviour for increasing re at re 125 the st values of c1 c4 and c5 are almost identical and smaller than the st values of c2 and c3 see fig 13 d st1 and st5 values are identical for all re except at re 125 and st2 and st4 values are same for all re fig 13 d at g 3 the effect of re on cdm and st is presented in fig 13 e and f due to large spacing ratio no variations can be seen in mean drag coefficients and strouhal numbers of all cylinders for increasing re and these values are larger than single cylinder data this is because that at g 3 the observed flow regime is flow regime iii in which the flow is fully developed the mean drag coefficient of first cylinder is identical to fifth and the second is similar to fourth and these cdm curves show decreasing behaviour for increasing re while small variation in cdm3 can be seen fig 13 e the same trend is also observed for strouhal values but contrary to cdm values the st values are approaching to single cylinder data see fig 13 e and f for large spacing ratio g 5 the values of mean drag coefficient and strouhal of all cylinders are identical for all chosen reynolds numbers as illustrated in fig 13 g and h also the values are approximately equals to the data of single square cylinder and the trend is also similar see fig 13 g and h because g 5 is large enough spacing among the cylinders the effect of jet flow disappears and every cylinder behave like a single isolated body it is also clear from fig 13 that for increasing g the cdm values of all cylinders show decreasing behaviour and approaching to single cylinder data the st values also show the same behaviour except for g 0 5 where most of st values are identical to single cylinder data this indicates that the effect of g is more on the physical parameters compared to re but at large g the effect of re is more the observed flow regimes at different combinations of g re is illustrated in fig 14 the flow regime i is investigated at small spacing ratios that is g 0 5 1 1 2 and 1 5 for all chosen re except at g re 0 5 75 0 5 90 0 5 100 0 5 110 0 5 125 0 5 130 0 5 140 and 1 90 where the flow regime ii is investigated also for large spacing ratios g 2 5 the flow regime iii is examined except for g re 2 150 2 160 and 2 175 where the flow regime ii is investigated 7 conclusions numerical simulations for flow behind a row of five side by side square cylinders were performed in this paper using the lattice boltzmann method the effect of reynolds numbers 75 re 175 and spacing ratios 0 5 g 5 on flow structure mechanism behind a row of five square cylinders were fully analyzed and documented the main findings of the present study are summarized below i the flow structure behind the cylinders was classified into three major flow regimes flow regime i in which the flow showed merging and distortion behaviour throughout the computational domain flow regime ii in which the flow was symmetric about the middle cylinder and flow regime iii in which the flow was fully developed and each cylinder behave like a single bluff body each flow regime was further subdivided in different flow regimes there were total seven flow regimes observed in this study in which three regimes in flow regime i one in flow regime ii and three in flow regime iii ii in flow regime i at g re 0 5 150 0 5 175 1 110 1 160 1 175 1 2 100 and 1 2 125 the nearly bistable flow regime at g re 0 5 160 1 100 1 75 1 125 1 150 1 2 75 1 2 90 1 2 130 1 2 140 1 5 110 and 1 5 140 chaotic flow regime at g re 1 130 1 140 1 2 110 1 2 150 1 2 160 1 2 175 1 5 75 1 5 90 1 5 100 1 5 125 1 5 130 1 5 150 1 5 160 and 1 5 175 flip flopping regime were observed iii in flow regime ii at g re 0 5 75 0 5 90 0 5 100 0 5 110 0 5 125 0 5 130 0 5 140 1 90 2 150 2 160 and 2 175 the symmetric flow regime was found iv in flow regime iii at g re 2 75 140 and 2 5 75 175 quasi periodic flow i at g re 3 75 175 3 5 75 150 3 5 175 4 75 125 4 140 4 150 and 4 175 quasi periodic flow ii and at g re 3 5 160 4 130 4 160 and 5 75 175 fully periodic flow regime were investigated v it was found that in flow regime i the outer two cylinders c1 and c5 experienced larger drag compared to inner three cylinders c2 c3 and c4 vi it was also observed that for flow regime i the fft spectrum of flow was dominated by secondary cylinder interaction frequencies while for flow regime iii the flow was dominated by primary vortex shedding frequency vii the mean drag coefficient values at g 0 5 of c1 c2 and c4 c5 were found identical and are different from cdm3 up to re 140 and for re 150 160 and 175 all the cylinders mean drag coefficients were same at g 1 5 the cdm1 values were found identical to cdm5 values for all re and similarly that of cdm2 and cdm4 while the cdm3 values was analyzed smaller than the cdm values of c1 c2 c4 and c5 for g 5 all cylinders cdm showed identical behaviour for increasing re and were found similar to single cylinder data it was also found that for increasing g the cdm values of all cylinders showed decreasing behaviour and approaching to single cylinder data viii in this paper the strouhal values for cylinder c3 was not calculated for flow regime ii due to its steady behaviour of lift signal the st values of all cylinders approached to the st values of single isolated cylinder at g 5 and for g 1 5 and 3 these values were found larger than the single cylinder data for increasing re ix for large g it was examined that for increasing re the vortices became strengthen x for small spacing ratios the effect of g on physical parameters was observed more compared to re while for large g this trend reversed credit authorship contribution statement hamid rahman writing original draft conceptualization methodology software validation investigation resources project

20229,ammonia cargo requires special expertise in terms of handling storage and transportation aspects as it is unquestionably one of the toughest goods carried by tankers due to its intrinsically dangerous properties any malfunction experienced during the cargo operation may result in disasters cargo manifold leakage is one of the most critical hazards that may arise during cargo operations according to the characteristics of the ammonia manifold leakages contain risks that may result in explosion fire pollution and poisoning in this study all probable root causes and risk of cargo manifold leakage event of a gas tanker carrying ammonia is introduced by employing fault tree analysis fta in fuzzy environment which is a systematic method to access reliability of complex systems both quantitatively and qualitatively by using exact occurrence probability values of all probable root causes as a result occurrence probability of ammonia leakage from cargo manifold is calculated as 0 00539 which is found realistic by consulted field experts this study aims to introduce an appropriate management tool to identify root causes and mitigate the cargo manifold leakage risk by reducing the occurrence probabilities of the root causes keywords ammonia leakage failure probability analysis ffta gas tankers 1 introduction safety is an extremely important phenomenon in maritime transportation industry as an undesired event onboard may lead to catastrophic consequences kuzu et al 2018 şenol et al 2013 over time many regulations and rules have come into force for safer shipping operations international convention for the safety of life at sea solas international convention on standards of training certification and watchkeeping for seafarers stcw international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol and maritime labour convention mlc known as the four pillars of the maritime transportation industry they are mostly created with the aim of increasing the safety of life property and environment however when the accidents in the literature are examined it is understood that these regulations and improvements are not yet sufficient to perform safe operations at the desired level gökçek and şenol 2018 şenol et al 2013 it is an indisputable necessity for both tankers and tanker terminals to be designed and operated proactively in terms of safety precautions since many cargoes transported by tanker ships are dangerous in terms of their characteristics such type of ships especially stand out with respect to safety related issues depending on the prominent hazards of cargoes the international maritime dangerous goods imdg code 2018 which was developed for safe transportation of dangerous goods by international maritime organization imo classified them as explosive flammable radioactive toxic and infectious asphyxiating corrosive polluting and oxidizing in general terms is identified as flammable toxic corrosive for human skin and very toxic to aquatic as a matter of fact in 1976 the ship s captain and chief officer died of poisoning in an accident due to a leakage on ship shore connection ots 2000 similarly an explosion at the ammonia plant in the baoshan district of shanghai in 2013 caused the death of 15 people and injury of 25 people specific to baoshan case yilang et al 2014 established a fault tree analysis fta structure to find out the most prominent causation factors among the human factors material factors management factors and environmental factors for the purpose of minimising risk of similar accidents zhang and zhao 2012 employed safeti methodology to quantitative assessment of the risk and consequence stemming from toxic hazards in ammonia leakage similarly kang et al 2017 proposed safeti approach for consequence and frequency analysis to analyse risk of ammonia leakage in the refrigeration manufacturing facilities where event tree analysis and part count methodology were employed for final quantitative risk assessment the incidents and unique studies in the literature dealing with health hazards of ammonia obviously reveal the hazards of ammonia cargo and its requirement for a special expertise and attention in terms of loading storage and discharging operations in this sense in this study effective variables based on their probabilistic dependencies on the risk of the ammonia leakage are shown and thus it is aimed to propose a methodological solution to reduce the relevant operational risk of anhydrous ammonia factors and root causes that may affect the risk of the ammonia leakage from manifold are revealed by using the fta it provides coherent fault tree structure and outcomes for operators and is one of the most frequently utilised method for safety reliability and hazard analysis of complex systems both qualitatively and quantitatively jung et al 2020a kumar and kaushik 2020 qualitative analysis skill of fta enables to identify root causes basic events of an undesired event top event and causality relations between root causes and top event quantitative analysis skill provides probabilistic relations between basic events bes and top event te mathematically fta uses exact value for computing probability of undesired event however due to lack of statistical data fuzzy theory is utilised for probability calculation of root causes which was firstly proposed by tanaka et al 1983 1 1 recognition of anhydrous ammonia characteristics of anhydrous ammonia is described as colourless toxic and corrosive gas with a pungent odour it is declared that short term exposure limit of anhydrous ammonia which indicates a working period of 15 min is 35 parts per million ppm and an exposure of 5 min to anhydrous ammonia with more than 5000 ppm leads to death imo 2018 in case of exposure an extremely low temperature 33 c emerges that causes freezing tissues moreover due to formation of hydroxyl ions as a result of vaporization it leads to chemical burns on skin eyes and respiratory mucosa by liquefactive necrosis waheed and fuller 2017 the vapours of ammonia are flammable and burn with a yellow flame but requires a high concentration to be flammable it has a high ignition energy requirement and burns with low combustion energy woolcott 2009 apart from the other hazards of anhydrous ammonia toxicity and corrosiveness aspects obviously come into prominence for that respect this study focused on safety aspects of anhydrous ammonia leakage from manifold connection 1 2 manifold connection fundamentals the main hazard at the ship shore interface is spillage or leakage of cargo ship shore manifold connection becomes more of an issue for safe cargo operations improper ship shore manifold connection and uncontrolled releases of cargo are already leading cause of cargo operations related accidents on tankers nowatzki 2008 ots 2000 operational procedures and arrangements for cargo manifold connection cargo loading discharging operations and cargo manifold disconnection process are designed to prevent exceeding limits and leakage or release of cargo both ship and terminal manifold arrangement must comply with standards and technical specifications must be in compliance with imo s standards details of manifold design fittings and specifications flange marks manifold distance cargo hose supporter and illumination of manifold area are described in recommendations for manifolds for refrigerated liquefied gas carriers for cargoes from 0 c to 104 1994 the movement of a vessel must be limited within the design of the cargo arms mooring systems are to be correctly positioned and sufficiently strong maximum wind and current strength for berths and ships must be determined for disconnection of manifolds another ship movement way on berth is due to changes of ships freeboard during cargo operation as the tanker rises or falls due to tide or cargo operations the hose strings are to be arranged so as to avoid undue strain on the hoses connections and ship s manifold in this way the radius of curvature of the hose will stay within the recommended limits determined by the manufacturers ics 2020 maximum allowable horizontal vertical and angular limits of arms are defined as standard for gas carrying tankers woolcott 2009 each liquid and vapour cargo manifold shall be provided with at least one pressure indicator pressure gauge indicating manifold pressure between ship shore manifold connections emergency shut down esd valve must be provided at each manifold connection imo 2016 all metal cargo arms have a designed operating movement limit which comprehends tidal range at the berth freeboard dimensions of the largest and smallest tankers limits for position changes of ship in horizontal vertical and angular plane maximum spatial area for safe operation of loading discharging flange must be coherently determined to the range of the ship s manifold location that may change due to surge sway and changes in freeboard unused manifold connections are to be isolated and blanked before cargo operation cargo hoses are suspended from suitable equipment so cargo hoses do not bend excessively and cargo manifold and exert excessive force on the manifold care is taken not to damage the mechanical loading arms gaskets which used to seal manifold connections must be suitable for connection arm hose nuts and bolts for manifold connection must be compatible and undamaged in size and material bolts are to be installed in each hole and properly tightened whilst connecting the manifold proper illumination for the manifold area must be enabled during cargo operations manifold pressure gauges must be in good condition and always be checked for excessive pressure increase or decrease after completion of cargo operations both ship and shore cargo manifold arm hose valves are to be closed properly drained disconnected and securely blanked respectively ccnr 2010 ics 2018 sigtto 1997 consideration of the risks that may arise in the case of manifold leakage leads to conclude that there is a strong need for a systematic root cause analysis with a comprehensive understanding to reduce the risk of ammonia leakage from manifold connection main intended contribution of this study is to satisfy the needs for a comprehensive study that determines the root causes of manifold leakage of ammonia in detail by employing fault tree analysis fta in other words we aim to identify an appropriate management tool to mitigate the risk by reducing the probability of the manifold leakage event some series of group discussions and expert consultations were implemented for modelling the fta structure however due to lack of statistical information disclosed to public for carrying out root cause analysis an alternative solution fuzzy fault tree analysis ffta approach was put into effect 2 methodology international organization for standardization iso 31000 risk management 2009 outlines the risk which has consequences in terms of economic performance and professional reputation however there should be also environmental safety and social considerations iso 2009 in the literature there exist risk analysis methods for predicting preventing and mitigating the risks of processes or operations most of conventional risk analysis methods such as failure modes and effect analysis fmea functional effect analysis and hazard and operability hazop studies are utilised for qualitative analysis typically such methods are usually utilised for the feedback preparation stage for a fta lee et al 1985 fta is a flexible and proper risk assessment tool that deals with identifying potential root causes and occurrence probability of unwished events moreover it is a systematic solution for estimating safety performance maintainability and reliability of a complex and vague systems both qualitatively and quantitatively goodman 1988 kuzu et al senol et al 2015 wang et al 2013 within this consideration fta is frequently employed method due to its easy applicability and user friendly graphical illustration for the purpose of identifying weaknesses by proposing a possible upgrade and predicting behaviour of a system it is utilised in many fields such as marine transportation railway industry nuclear power industry tunnelling and underground space technology computer sciences etc hyun et al 2015 jung et al 2020b kum and sahin 2015 purba et al 2020 senol and sahin 2016 ünver et al 2019 due to its flexibility and applicability fta is able to be combined with some appropriate methods such as fuzzy fta with fuzzy analytic hierarchy process ahp and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis fta with event tree analysis eta bow tie model for risk and failure analysis of complex systems akyuz et al 2020 chen and wang 2019 yazdi et al 2020 despite the advantages and wide applicability of fta there exist some weaknesses and limitations requirement of excessive number of gates and events connected with each other in logical relations for complex systems could constitute a disadvantage for analysers in this regard it may be time consuming and complicated also fta assumes all bes as independent however real life usually necessitates combination of bes and thus constitution process of a fault tree should be conducted carefully examining only one top event in same time can be considered as another limitation of the fta 2 1 fault tree analysis method generic fault tree starts with a te and occurrence of the reasons are divided into branches gradually the analysis is conducted until a boundary conditions or basic reasons are reached a basic cause is named as basic event which is symbolised with circle shape in the tree structure they are reached when the tree is not required to be developed more in other words basic events are lowest level in the hierarchy of tree structure if an event cannot be developed due to lack of available data it is symbolised with diamond shape which is named undeveloped event ue triangular shape is used for the purpose of transferring some branch es of the tree to another place of layout stapelberg 2009 in the ft schematics or and and gates are mainly used as logical operators the output of the and gate depends upon the occurrence of any input events this implies that the and gate is an intersection of all input events containing sets one of the input events influences the output of the or gate directly this implies that the or gate is a union of all input events containing sets a successful fta should base on five main rules as follows ericson and ll 1999 1 te should represent critical failure with its boundary conditions 2 duplicated events and branches increase complexity of the system 3 constructing the structure of fault tree where the relations between the events are based on cause and effect principle 4 controlling the cut sets and path sets to be ensure they are valid and correct 5 ensuring the tree is further expanded 2 1 1 notation and quantification of logic gates let

is an extended form of fta with fuzzy sets fuzzy approach enables to convert weakness on lack of previous data into opportunity for fta ffta is used where probabilities of root causes are not established or not previously collected via online or face to face interviews or questionnaires experts decision makers are asked to assess failure possibilities of be they declare their beliefs by the predefined linguistic expressions the decisions of the group are then aggregated analysed and then converted to numerical output values fuzzy integrated fta may have some disadvantages and limitations depending on human knowledge and expertise may constitute major weaknesses of fuzzy connected fta due to improper selection of the consulted experts and improper conducted expert consultation process could lead to obtain inconsistent and unrealistic results employed ffta process can be described by following steps kuzu et al 2019 lavasani et al 2015a lavasani et al 2015b sahin 2017 senol et al 2015 2 2 1 step 1 aggregating stage expert opinions on a particular topic can be expected to differ from each other depending on knowledge and experiences of expert e k k 1 2 m according to ford and sterman 1998 experts judgements are affected by their perspectives and objectives the issue is to determine whether homogenous expert group where all experts are in same work of interest or heterogeneous expert group where the experts are from different work of interest in this study heterogeneous expert group is established including academicians company operations managers

proposed by hsu and chen 1996 steps of sam for aggregating experts assessment relating to each be are described below calculate the degree of similarity s u v r u r v 0 1 where s stands for the degree

defuzzification of fuzzy numbers is a very important process in this study the most commonly used one centre of area method is employed for the defuzzification process which is expressed as follows 13 x μ i x x d x μ i x where x is defuzzified output μ i x is aggregated membership function and x is output variable membership functions are graphical form of representation of truth in the literature there exist different type of membership functions such as triangular trapezoidal sigmoid gaussian singleton etc value of a membership function is between 0 and 1 this value represents membership

determined as top event structure of fault tree is built by conducting online expert consultations after a comprehensive literature review session fault tree of ammonia leakage from cargo manifold is provided in fig 1 and fig 2 cumulative list of bes is provided in table 1 probabilities of each be is calculated depending on expert judgements by employing fuzzy approach seven diverse variables are adopted for converting linguistic expressions into crisp outputs as number of linguistic terms should be determined between 5 and 9 for a proper estimation miller 1956 linguistic expressions and corresponding fuzzy numbers are given in table 2 possibility scale and corresponding membership functions are shown in fig 3 ten experienced experts including academicians company operations managers company deck inspectors masters and chief officers were consulted to compute occurrence possibilities of each be four of these experts are academic staff of different universities in turkey two of them are company operations manager who had liquefied gas tanker experiences and are already working as responsible manager of similar tanker fleet operations one company deck inspector and rest of the expert group consists of masters and chief officers working onboard gas tankers each expert has onboard experiences of gas tankers their names and companies are not revealed due to ethical concerns table 3 indicates parameters of expert classification and identical scores and table 4 and fig 4 shows profiles of anonymous consulted expert and their weights calculation results of step 1 step 3 expressed in section 2 2 are represented in the following tables specific to be 47 draught change which is obtained as the most probable be in the fault tree accordingly table 5 shows fuzzy numbers of experts judgement and calculated similarity functions and their corresponding values are given in table 6 in the similarity function calculation step each expert judgement is compared to other experts judgement for each be degree of similarity is to be between 0 and 1 greater degree stands for more similarity between two related experts opinions if degree of similarity is 1 the opinions of two related experts are same in other words degree of similarity indicates percental similarity of experts opinions for example similarity of experts e1 and e2 opinions is 80 where similarity of experts e2 and e9 opinions is 100 average agreement and relative agreement values of experts are provided in table 7 which indicates a numerical comparison of each expert s opinion with all other experts and normalization of average agreement values respectively in other words as average agreement value is calculated by dividing sum of fuzzy numbers of experts opinion to number of experts it indicates the similarity of related experts opinion on average opinion relative agreement value is calculated by normalising the obtained average agreement value as ten experts were consulted within this study relative agreement value of ideally and fully agreed expert s opinion is expected to be 0 1 the farther relative agreement value from 0 1 the less agreed opinion with the average table 8 shows consensus coefficient of expert s opinion this stage is the first one where weights of the experts based on their professional background are considered in this step as mentioned in section 2 2 1 sam gives an occasion the moderator to re evaluate expertise of the consultant experts by courtesy of β value if β is assigned as 0 cc is directly determined with ra values if β is set as 1 ra value of each expert is ignored and cc is determined as weight of each expert directly in this study effect of experts weight and their ra values are determined equal by setting the β value as 0 5 by means of cc value if the weight of an expert is high his opinion can be considered as more reliable even his ra value is far from average value fuzzy trapezoidal number form of final aggregated experts opinion for be 47 is provided in table 9 aggregation step is summation of multiplied consensus coefficient and corresponding fuzzy numbers the calculated aggregation fuzzy number is converted to crisp value as described before defuzzification process is maintained by employing centre of area method given in eq 13 and 14 accordingly the obtained value of crisp failure possibility is converted to be failure probability with eq 15 and 16 fig 5 indicates crisp failure possibility of all bes and fig 6 provides failure probability of all bes values are colourised highest to lowest green to red principle after this stage the application of fuzzy logic is completed and generic fta application is conducted in this context top event probability is calculated depending on the corresponding logic gates as described in section 2 1 2 and failure probability of ammonia leakage on manifold top event is obtained as 0 00539 the result is assessed as consistent by the consultant experts and moderators in view of any minor or major leakage event in practise fig 7 provides occurrence probability of each mcs and fig 8 indicates their importance measurement values obtained as result of sensitivity analysis process described in eq 18 f vim is an important indicator for revealing contribution of each mcs to occurrence probability of te in other words it enables to introduce how much each mcs affects the occurrence probability of te it is calculated by dividing probability of te to each computed probability value of mcs obtained related value indicates the proportional influence of mcs on te occurrence which is called as sensitivity of mcs for example mcs consisting of be38 and be47 is the highest influencing mcs by 0 538 4 results and discussions the fault tree is divided into 3 main branches intermediate event as overpressure movement of ship at berth and connection error movement of ship at berth has the highest failure probability among the others with 0 00346 according to mcs sensitivity calculations which is sufficient for the occurrence of the top event it was observed that the highest priority value was calculated as 5 379e 04 for the mcs of rope failure and draft change be38 be47 which is connected to the movement of ship at berth intermediate event it is seen that the next 5 most prior mcss are obtained as be37 be47 be40 be47 be43 be47 be39 be47 and be42 be47 respectively accordingly it is conspicuous that draft change be47 is found in each the most prior 6 mcss three of them are originated from directly human element related bes be40 be42 be43 other three of the mcss are related to equipment failure events be37 be38 be39 which indirectly point out the human element due to underlying reasons such as improper maintenance incorrect usage lack of periodical controls etc be47 is an external factor that may not be possible to mitigate but all linked human element related bes could be minimised by taking some appropriate measures concordantly theoretical and practical training for crew is assessed as the most important control measure mcss of incorrect screw and incompatible arm hose be57 be59 and missing bolt nut and incompatible arm hose be58 be59 which are linked to the main branch of connection error intermediate event have the lowest priority it is noteworthy that be of incompatible arm hose be59 is present in both mcss it is thought that the aforementioned mcss are obtained as the least effective ones due to sufficient manifold connection and control standards and properly applied procedures for the purpose of validation by employing online interviews with each expert independently all the obtained results were examined one by one within the framework of practical logical approach consequently they are assessed to be valid realistic and appropriate to the real case the most prior three mcss were shared with consultant experts and eight of them confirmed that the obtained order fits their expectations two of them expressed that the most prior three mcss met their expectations but the order of them was different however they expressed the obtained order is found acceptable depending on their field expertise due to the movement of ship at berth intermediate event it is understood that the probability of the top event increases significantly in general it is obvious that throughout the operation frequent and efficient controlling the status of the rope windlass and hydraulic motors of windlass by the watch keeper on deck who is well informed and has no fatigue will be very effective in reducing the occurrence probability of ammonia cargo leakage from manifold 5 conclusion as a result of the detailed examination of the literature it has been observed that there is no study that clearly describes the health hazards of ammonia cargo by revealing the root causes of the manifold leakage in detail due to the dangers of such cargo a detailed fault tree analysis has been presented that can reveal the root causes in detail and meet the demands for both the maritime transportation industry and other related industries to identify the hazards of manifold leakage fuzzy extension of fta is employed for the purpose of obtaining failure probabilities of bes fuzzy integrated fta may have some disadvantages and limitations depending on human knowledge and expertise may constitute major weaknesses of fuzzy connected fta due to improper selection of the consulted experts and improper conducted expert consultation process could lead to obtain inconsistent and unrealistic results therefore ffta application requires careful and sensitive effort for expert selection weighting of experts and expert consultation processes as a result of careful expert consultancy crisp be values are able to be calculated and obtaining the occurrence probability of ammonia cargo leakage from manifold is achieved in addition the courtesy of fta method mcss that affect the top event is revealed with their priority thus an appropriate management tool is proposed to identify root causes and mitigate the cargo manifold leakage risk by reducing the occurrence probabilities of the root causes and mcss according to findings be38 be47 be37 be47 be40 be47 be43 be47 be39 be47 and be42 be47 are found the most prior mcss it is remarkable that the aforementioned bes linked to draught change be47 are basically depends on human element therefore human element directly or indirectly is found as main and the most effective root cause for this study theoretical and practical trainings is assessed as the most prominent mitigating action beyond the standard tanker operations training the continuous training and evaluation programs are to be implemented for the crew involved in the cargo handling operations would be an effective measure in reducing the risk of ammonia cargo leakage from manifold moreover it is assessed that the required competence for the relevant operations may not be achieved with only theoretical or computer based simulator trainings instead conducting applied training in environments where the real operational environment is better simulated would support much more effective results it is necessary to systematically assess and evaluate the practical training and practical capabilities of the crew in the process of being employed as trainees and to proactively understand the results as a future research the obtained results will be compared with results of ammonia cargo manifold leakage incident analysed by bayesian network approach which is another widely employed method that represents the occurrence of certain events together with their causality relations by a graphical representation also based on moderators practical knowledge and field expertise it is planned to extent the study for preventing controlling and mitigating the leakage risk through development of a logical relationship between the bes mcss

20229,ammonia cargo requires special expertise in terms of handling storage and transportation aspects as it is unquestionably one of the toughest goods carried by tankers due to its intrinsically dangerous properties any malfunction experienced during the cargo operation may result in disasters cargo manifold leakage is one of the most critical hazards that may arise during cargo operations according to the characteristics of the ammonia manifold leakages contain risks that may result in explosion fire pollution and poisoning in this study all probable root causes and risk of cargo manifold leakage event of a gas tanker carrying ammonia is introduced by employing fault tree analysis fta in fuzzy environment which is a systematic method to access reliability of complex systems both quantitatively and qualitatively by using exact occurrence probability values of all probable root causes as a result occurrence probability of ammonia leakage from cargo manifold is calculated as 0 00539 which is found realistic by consulted field experts this study aims to introduce an appropriate management tool to identify root causes and mitigate the cargo manifold leakage risk by reducing the occurrence probabilities of the root causes keywords ammonia leakage failure probability analysis ffta gas tankers 1 introduction safety is an extremely important phenomenon in maritime transportation industry as an undesired event onboard may lead to catastrophic consequences kuzu et al 2018 şenol et al 2013 over time many regulations and rules have come into force for safer shipping operations international convention for the safety of life at sea solas international convention on standards of training certification and watchkeeping for seafarers stcw international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol and maritime labour convention mlc known as the four pillars of the maritime transportation industry they are mostly created with the aim of increasing the safety of life property and environment however when the accidents in the literature are examined it is understood that these regulations and improvements are not yet sufficient to perform safe operations at the desired level gökçek and şenol 2018 şenol et al 2013 it is an indisputable necessity for both tankers and tanker terminals to be designed and operated proactively in terms of safety precautions since many cargoes transported by tanker ships are dangerous in terms of their characteristics such type of ships especially stand out with respect to safety related issues depending on the prominent hazards of cargoes the international maritime dangerous goods imdg code 2018 which was developed for safe transportation of dangerous goods by international maritime organization imo classified them as explosive flammable radioactive toxic and infectious asphyxiating corrosive polluting and oxidizing in general terms is identified as flammable toxic corrosive for human skin and very toxic to aquatic as a matter of fact in 1976 the ship s captain and chief officer died of poisoning in an accident due to a leakage on ship shore connection ots 2000 similarly an explosion at the ammonia plant in the baoshan district of shanghai in 2013 caused the death of 15 people and injury of 25 people specific to baoshan case yilang et al 2014 established a fault tree analysis fta structure to find out the most prominent causation factors among the human factors material factors management factors and environmental factors for the purpose of minimising risk of similar accidents zhang and zhao 2012 employed safeti methodology to quantitative assessment of the risk and consequence stemming from toxic hazards in ammonia leakage similarly kang et al 2017 proposed safeti approach for consequence and frequency analysis to analyse risk of ammonia leakage in the refrigeration manufacturing facilities where event tree analysis and part count methodology were employed for final quantitative risk assessment the incidents and unique studies in the literature dealing with health hazards of ammonia obviously reveal the hazards of ammonia cargo and its requirement for a special expertise and attention in terms of loading storage and discharging operations in this sense in this study effective variables based on their probabilistic dependencies on the risk of the ammonia leakage are shown and thus it is aimed to propose a methodological solution to reduce the relevant operational risk of anhydrous ammonia factors and root causes that may affect the risk of the ammonia leakage from manifold are revealed by using the fta it provides coherent fault tree structure and outcomes for operators and is one of the most frequently utilised method for safety reliability and hazard analysis of complex systems both qualitatively and quantitatively jung et al 2020a kumar and kaushik 2020 qualitative analysis skill of fta enables to identify root causes basic events of an undesired event top event and causality relations between root causes and top event quantitative analysis skill provides probabilistic relations between basic events bes and top event te mathematically fta uses exact value for computing probability of undesired event however due to lack of statistical data fuzzy theory is utilised for probability calculation of root causes which was firstly proposed by tanaka et al 1983 1 1 recognition of anhydrous ammonia characteristics of anhydrous ammonia is described as colourless toxic and corrosive gas with a pungent odour it is declared that short term exposure limit of anhydrous ammonia which indicates a working period of 15 min is 35 parts per million ppm and an exposure of 5 min to anhydrous ammonia with more than 5000 ppm leads to death imo 2018 in case of exposure an extremely low temperature 33 c emerges that causes freezing tissues moreover due to formation of hydroxyl ions as a result of vaporization it leads to chemical burns on skin eyes and respiratory mucosa by liquefactive necrosis waheed and fuller 2017 the vapours of ammonia are flammable and burn with a yellow flame but requires a high concentration to be flammable it has a high ignition energy requirement and burns with low combustion energy woolcott 2009 apart from the other hazards of anhydrous ammonia toxicity and corrosiveness aspects obviously come into prominence for that respect this study focused on safety aspects of anhydrous ammonia leakage from manifold connection 1 2 manifold connection fundamentals the main hazard at the ship shore interface is spillage or leakage of cargo ship shore manifold connection becomes more of an issue for safe cargo operations improper ship shore manifold connection and uncontrolled releases of cargo are already leading cause of cargo operations related accidents on tankers nowatzki 2008 ots 2000 operational procedures and arrangements for cargo manifold connection cargo loading discharging operations and cargo manifold disconnection process are designed to prevent exceeding limits and leakage or release of cargo both ship and terminal manifold arrangement must comply with standards and technical specifications must be in compliance with imo s standards details of manifold design fittings and specifications flange marks manifold distance cargo hose supporter and illumination of manifold area are described in recommendations for manifolds for refrigerated liquefied gas carriers for cargoes from 0 c to 104 1994 the movement of a vessel must be limited within the design of the cargo arms mooring systems are to be correctly positioned and sufficiently strong maximum wind and current strength for berths and ships must be determined for disconnection of manifolds another ship movement way on berth is due to changes of ships freeboard during cargo operation as the tanker rises or falls due to tide or cargo operations the hose strings are to be arranged so as to avoid undue strain on the hoses connections and ship s manifold in this way the radius of curvature of the hose will stay within the recommended limits determined by the manufacturers ics 2020 maximum allowable horizontal vertical and angular limits of arms are defined as standard for gas carrying tankers woolcott 2009 each liquid and vapour cargo manifold shall be provided with at least one pressure indicator pressure gauge indicating manifold pressure between ship shore manifold connections emergency shut down esd valve must be provided at each manifold connection imo 2016 all metal cargo arms have a designed operating movement limit which comprehends tidal range at the berth freeboard dimensions of the largest and smallest tankers limits for position changes of ship in horizontal vertical and angular plane maximum spatial area for safe operation of loading discharging flange must be coherently determined to the range of the ship s manifold location that may change due to surge sway and changes in freeboard unused manifold connections are to be isolated and blanked before cargo operation cargo hoses are suspended from suitable equipment so cargo hoses do not bend excessively and cargo manifold and exert excessive force on the manifold care is taken not to damage the mechanical loading arms gaskets which used to seal manifold connections must be suitable for connection arm hose nuts and bolts for manifold connection must be compatible and undamaged in size and material bolts are to be installed in each hole and properly tightened whilst connecting the manifold proper illumination for the manifold area must be enabled during cargo operations manifold pressure gauges must be in good condition and always be checked for excessive pressure increase or decrease after completion of cargo operations both ship and shore cargo manifold arm hose valves are to be closed properly drained disconnected and securely blanked respectively ccnr 2010 ics 2018 sigtto 1997 consideration of the risks that may arise in the case of manifold leakage leads to conclude that there is a strong need for a systematic root cause analysis with a comprehensive understanding to reduce the risk of ammonia leakage from manifold connection main intended contribution of this study is to satisfy the needs for a comprehensive study that determines the root causes of manifold leakage of ammonia in detail by employing fault tree analysis fta in other words we aim to identify an appropriate management tool to mitigate the risk by reducing the probability of the manifold leakage event some series of group discussions and expert consultations were implemented for modelling the fta structure however due to lack of statistical information disclosed to public for carrying out root cause analysis an alternative solution fuzzy fault tree analysis ffta approach was put into effect 2 methodology international organization for standardization iso 31000 risk management 2009 outlines the risk which has consequences in terms of economic performance and professional reputation however there should be also environmental safety and social considerations iso 2009 in the literature there exist risk analysis methods for predicting preventing and mitigating the risks of processes or operations most of conventional risk analysis methods such as failure modes and effect analysis fmea functional effect analysis and hazard and operability hazop studies are utilised for qualitative analysis typically such methods are usually utilised for the feedback preparation stage for a fta lee et al 1985 fta is a flexible and proper risk assessment tool that deals with identifying potential root causes and occurrence probability of unwished events moreover it is a systematic solution for estimating safety performance maintainability and reliability of a complex and vague systems both qualitatively and quantitatively goodman 1988 kuzu et al senol et al 2015 wang et al 2013 within this consideration fta is frequently employed method due to its easy applicability and user friendly graphical illustration for the purpose of identifying weaknesses by proposing a possible upgrade and predicting behaviour of a system it is utilised in many fields such as marine transportation railway industry nuclear power industry tunnelling and underground space technology computer sciences etc hyun et al 2015 jung et al 2020b kum and sahin 2015 purba et al 2020 senol and sahin 2016 ünver et al 2019 due to its flexibility and applicability fta is able to be combined with some appropriate methods such as fuzzy fta with fuzzy analytic hierarchy process ahp and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis fta with event tree analysis eta bow tie model for risk and failure analysis of complex systems akyuz et al 2020 chen and wang 2019 yazdi et al 2020 despite the advantages and wide applicability of fta there exist some weaknesses and limitations requirement of excessive number of gates and events connected with each other in logical relations for complex systems could constitute a disadvantage for analysers in this regard it may be time consuming and complicated also fta assumes all bes as independent however real life usually necessitates combination of bes and thus constitution process of a fault tree should be conducted carefully examining only one top event in same time can be considered as another limitation of the fta 2 1 fault tree analysis method generic fault tree starts with a te and occurrence of the reasons are divided into branches gradually the analysis is conducted until a boundary conditions or basic reasons are reached a basic cause is named as basic event which is symbolised with circle shape in the tree structure they are reached when the tree is not required to be developed more in other words basic events are lowest level in the hierarchy of tree structure if an event cannot be developed due to lack of available data it is symbolised with diamond shape which is named undeveloped event ue triangular shape is used for the purpose of transferring some branch es of the tree to another place of layout stapelberg 2009 in the ft schematics or and and gates are mainly used as logical operators the output of the and gate depends upon the occurrence of any input events this implies that the and gate is an intersection of all input events containing sets one of the input events influences the output of the or gate directly this implies that the or gate is a union of all input events containing sets a successful fta should base on five main rules as follows ericson and ll 1999 1 te should represent critical failure with its boundary conditions 2 duplicated events and branches increase complexity of the system 3 constructing the structure of fault tree where the relations between the events are based on cause and effect principle 4 controlling the cut sets and path sets to be ensure they are valid and correct 5 ensuring the tree is further expanded 2 1 1 notation and quantification of logic gates let q 0 t is the probability of the te occurs at time t q i t probability of the be e i occurs at time t q 0 t is the probability of the minimal cut set mcs j fails at time t let stands for the be e i

connected to the te by an or gate therefore when at least one of the mcss fails the te occurs the probability of te is 7 q 0 t 1 j 1 k 1 φ j t 2 2 fuzzy fault tree analysis method the fuzzy fta ffta is an extended form of fta with fuzzy sets fuzzy approach enables to convert weakness on lack of previous data into opportunity for fta ffta is used where probabilities of root causes are not established or not previously collected via online or face to face interviews or questionnaires experts decision makers are asked to assess failure possibilities of be they declare their beliefs by the predefined linguistic expressions the decisions of the group are then aggregated analysed and then converted to numerical output values fuzzy integrated fta may have some disadvantages and limitations depending on human knowledge and expertise may constitute major weaknesses of fuzzy connected fta due to improper selection of the consulted experts and improper conducted expert consultation process could lead to obtain inconsistent and unrealistic results employed ffta process can be described by following steps kuzu et al 2019 lavasani et al 2015a lavasani et al 2015b sahin 2017 senol et al 2015 2 2 1 step 1 aggregating stage expert opinions on a particular topic can be expected to differ from each other depending on knowledge and experiences of expert e k k 1 2 m according to ford and sterman 1998 experts judgements are affected by their perspectives and objectives the issue is to determine whether homogenous expert group where all experts are in same work of interest or heterogeneous expert group where the experts are from different work of interest in this study heterogeneous expert group is established including academicians company operations managers company deck inspectors masters and chief officers another issue is to aggregate experts opinions with a systematic technique for that respect similarity aggregation method sam is utilised which was proposed by hsu and chen 1996 steps of sam for aggregating experts assessment relating to each be are described below calculate the degree of similarity s u v r u r v 0 1 where s stands for the degree of similarity for experts opinion symbolised with r u r u 1 r u 2 r u 3 r u 4 and r v r v 1 r v 2 r v 3 r v 4 which represent two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers degree of similarity between these two experts opinion is calculated as follows 8 s r u r v 1 1 4 i 1 4 r u i r v i calculate the degree of average agreement a a e u for the experts 9 a a e u 1 n 1 u v v 1 n s r u r v where n is total

consensus coefficient degree and weight of expert is equal appropriate β value assignment is important to obtain proper results aggregated experts opinion r a g is calculated as follows 12 r a g c c e 1 r 1 c c e 2 r 2 c c e m r m 2 2 2 step 2 defuzzification stage defuzzification process allows to obtain measurable results in fuzzy environment for decision making on fuzzy problems the defuzzification of fuzzy numbers is a very important process in this study the most commonly used one centre of area method is employed for the defuzzification process which is expressed as follows 13 x μ i x x d x μ i x where x is defuzzified output μ i x is aggregated membership function and x is output variable membership functions are graphical form of representation of truth in the literature there exist different type of membership functions such as triangular trapezoidal sigmoid gaussian singleton etc value of a membership function is between 0 and 1 this value represents membership

on mcss a mcs is minimal combination of bes that is able to lead te occurrence in other words in a mcs combination if any be that stands for a fault does not occur the te will not occur each fault

which allows to introduce the sensitivity of te probability by ranking the mcss in terms of their contribution degree in this study fussell vesely importance measure f vim is utilised for sensitivity analysis f vim is calculated as follows modarres 2006 18 i i f v t q i t q s t where q i t is probability of mcs and q s t is te probability 3 application ammonia leakage from cargo manifold is

provided in fig 1 and fig 2 cumulative list of bes is provided in table 1 probabilities of each be is calculated depending on expert judgements by employing fuzzy approach seven diverse variables are adopted for converting linguistic expressions into crisp outputs as number of linguistic terms should be determined between 5 and 9 for a proper estimation miller 1956 linguistic expressions and corresponding fuzzy numbers are given in table 2 possibility scale and corresponding membership functions are shown in fig 3 ten experienced experts including academicians company operations managers company deck inspectors masters and chief officers were consulted to compute occurrence possibilities of each be four of these experts are academic staff of different universities in turkey two of them are company operations manager who had liquefied gas tanker experiences and are already working as responsible manager of similar tanker fleet operations one company deck inspector and rest of the expert group consists of masters and chief officers working onboard gas tankers each expert has onboard experiences of gas tankers their names and companies are not revealed due to ethical concerns table 3 indicates parameters of expert classification and identical scores and table 4 and fig 4 shows profiles of anonymous consulted expert and their weights calculation results of step 1 step 3 expressed in section 2 2 are represented in the following tables specific to be 47 draught change which is obtained as the most probable be in the fault tree accordingly table 5 shows fuzzy numbers of experts judgement and calculated similarity functions and their corresponding values are given in table 6 in the similarity function calculation step each expert judgement is compared to other experts judgement for each be degree of similarity is to be between 0 and 1 greater degree stands for more similarity between two related experts opinions if degree of similarity is 1 the opinions of two related experts are same in other words degree of similarity indicates percental similarity of experts opinions for example similarity of experts e1 and e2 opinions is 80 where similarity of experts e2 and e9 opinions is 100 average agreement and relative agreement values of experts are provided in table 7 which indicates a numerical comparison of each expert s opinion with all other experts and normalization of average agreement values respectively in other words as average agreement value is calculated by dividing sum of fuzzy numbers of experts opinion to number of experts it indicates the similarity of related experts opinion on average opinion relative agreement value is calculated by normalising the obtained average agreement value as ten experts were consulted within this study relative agreement value of ideally and fully agreed expert s opinion is expected to be 0 1 the farther relative agreement value from 0 1 the less agreed opinion with the average table 8 shows consensus coefficient of expert s opinion this stage is the first one where weights of the experts based on their professional background are considered in this step as mentioned in section 2 2 1 sam gives an occasion the moderator to re evaluate expertise of the consultant experts by courtesy of β value if β is assigned as 0 cc is directly determined with ra values if β is set as 1 ra value of each expert is ignored and cc is determined as weight of each expert directly in this study effect of experts weight and their ra values are determined equal by setting the β value as 0 5 by means of cc value if the weight of an expert is high his opinion can be considered as more reliable even his ra value is far from average value fuzzy trapezoidal number form of final aggregated experts opinion for be 47 is provided in table 9 aggregation step is summation of multiplied consensus coefficient and corresponding fuzzy numbers the calculated aggregation fuzzy number is converted to crisp value as described before defuzzification process is maintained by employing centre of area method given in eq 13 and 14 accordingly the obtained value of crisp failure possibility is converted to be failure probability with eq 15 and 16 fig 5 indicates crisp failure possibility of all bes and fig 6 provides failure probability of all bes values are colourised highest to lowest green to red principle after this stage the application of fuzzy logic is completed and generic fta application is conducted in this context top event probability is calculated depending on the corresponding logic gates as described in section 2 1 2 and failure probability of ammonia leakage on manifold top event is obtained as 0 00539 the result is assessed as consistent by the consultant experts and moderators in view of any minor or major leakage event in practise fig 7 provides occurrence probability of each mcs and fig 8 indicates their importance measurement values obtained as result of sensitivity analysis process described in eq 18 f vim is an important indicator for revealing contribution of each mcs to occurrence probability of te in other words it enables to introduce how much each mcs affects the occurrence probability of te it is calculated by dividing probability of te to each computed probability value of mcs obtained related value indicates the proportional influence of mcs on te occurrence which is called as sensitivity of mcs for example mcs consisting of be38 and be47 is the highest influencing mcs by 0 538 4 results and discussions the fault tree is divided into 3 main branches intermediate event as overpressure movement of ship at berth and connection error movement of ship at berth has the highest failure probability among the others with 0 00346 according to mcs sensitivity calculations which is sufficient for the occurrence of the top event it was observed that the highest priority value was calculated as 5 379e 04 for the mcs of rope failure and draft change be38 be47 which is connected to the movement of ship at berth intermediate event it is seen that the next 5 most prior mcss are obtained as be37 be47 be40 be47 be43 be47 be39 be47 and be42 be47 respectively accordingly it is conspicuous that draft change be47 is found in each the most prior 6 mcss three of them are originated from directly human element related bes be40 be42 be43 other three of the mcss are related to equipment failure events be37 be38 be39 which indirectly point out the human element due to underlying reasons such as improper maintenance incorrect usage lack of periodical controls etc be47 is an external factor that may not be possible to mitigate but all linked human element related bes could be minimised by taking some appropriate measures concordantly theoretical and practical training for crew is assessed as the most important control measure mcss of incorrect screw and incompatible arm hose be57 be59 and missing bolt nut and incompatible arm hose be58 be59 which are linked to the main branch of connection error intermediate event have the lowest priority it is noteworthy that be of incompatible arm hose be59 is present in both mcss it is thought that the aforementioned mcss are obtained as the least effective ones due to sufficient manifold connection and control standards and properly applied procedures for the purpose of validation by employing online interviews with each expert independently all the obtained results were examined one by one within the framework of practical logical approach consequently they are assessed to be valid realistic and appropriate to the real case the most prior three mcss were shared with consultant experts and eight of them confirmed that the obtained order fits their expectations two of them expressed that the most prior three mcss met their expectations but the order of them was different however they expressed the obtained order is found acceptable depending on their field expertise due to the movement of ship at berth intermediate event it is understood that the probability of the top event increases significantly in general it is obvious that throughout the operation frequent and efficient controlling the status of the rope windlass and hydraulic motors of windlass by the watch keeper on deck who is well informed and has no fatigue will be very effective in reducing the occurrence probability of ammonia cargo leakage from manifold 5 conclusion as a result of the detailed examination of the literature it has been observed that there is no study that clearly describes the health hazards of ammonia cargo by revealing the root causes of the manifold leakage in detail due to the dangers of such cargo a detailed fault tree analysis has been presented that can reveal the root causes in detail and meet the demands for both the maritime transportation industry and other related industries to identify the hazards of manifold leakage fuzzy extension of fta is employed for the purpose of obtaining failure probabilities of bes fuzzy integrated fta may have some disadvantages and limitations depending on human knowledge and expertise may constitute major weaknesses of fuzzy connected fta due to improper selection of the consulted experts and improper conducted expert consultation process could lead to obtain inconsistent and unrealistic results therefore ffta application requires careful and sensitive effort for expert selection weighting of experts and expert consultation processes as a result of careful expert consultancy crisp be values are able to be calculated and obtaining the occurrence probability of ammonia cargo leakage from manifold is achieved in addition the courtesy of fta method mcss that affect the top event is revealed with their priority thus an appropriate management tool is proposed to identify root causes and mitigate the cargo manifold leakage risk by reducing the occurrence probabilities of the root causes and mcss according to findings be38 be47 be37 be47 be40 be47 be43 be47 be39 be47 and be42 be47 are found the most prior mcss it is remarkable that the aforementioned bes linked to draught change be47 are basically depends on human element therefore human element directly or indirectly is found as main and the most effective root cause for this study theoretical and practical trainings is assessed as the most prominent mitigating action beyond the standard tanker operations training the continuous training and evaluation programs are to be implemented for the crew involved in the cargo handling operations would be an effective measure in reducing the risk of ammonia cargo leakage from manifold moreover it is assessed that the required competence for the relevant operations may not be achieved with only theoretical or computer based simulator trainings instead conducting applied training in environments where the real operational environment is better simulated would support much more effective results it is necessary to systematically assess and evaluate the practical training and practical capabilities of the crew in the process of being employed as trainees and to proactively understand the results as a future research the obtained results will be compared with results of ammonia cargo manifold leakage incident analysed by bayesian network approach which is another widely employed method that represents the occurrence of certain events together with their causality relations by a graphical representation also based on moderators practical knowledge and field expertise it is planned to extent the study for preventing controlling and mitigating the leakage risk through development of a logical relationship between the bes mcss and risk impacts by employing fuzzy bow tie approach credit authorship contribution statement ali cem kuzu investigation resources data curation writing review editing yunus emre senol investigation
