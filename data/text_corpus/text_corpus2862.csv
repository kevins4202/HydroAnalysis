14310,microalgae are a source of high valuable products covering a wide range of applications however costs incurred by cultivating them make it an expensive process the combination of wastewater treatment and microalgae cultivation is a viable option to reduce expenses related to cultivation however municipal wastewater from the centralized brazilian sanitation system is highly diluted and it is technically and economically impractical to use it for microalgae cultivation as an alternative diluted effluent can be mixed with a different kind of wastewater aiming to increase the nutrient concentration carbon nitrogen and phosphorus for microalgae cultivation in this study microalgae cultivation and wastewater mixture municipal and piggery wastewater treatment were monitored for four weeks the pilot treatment system consisted of uasb as pre treatment and chlorella sorokiniana cultivation in three flat panel photobioreactors high uasb efficiency was obtained in organic matter removal 90 even with a large variability of initial mixture characteristics c sorokiniana production reached about 1 g l 1 with an average removal of dissolved inorganic carbon orthophosphate and ammonia around 46 to 56 40 to 60 and 100 respectively possible solutions to improve the microalgae growth and the system treatment are discussed keywords microalgae cultivation nutrient recovery wastewater treatment piggery wastewater uasb reactor 1 introduction the combination of microalgae growth and wastewater treatment is a promising solution to overcome the current high costs incurred by microalgae cultivation 1 a cost reduction higher than 50 has been estimated when low cost sources are used to obtain nutrients carbon supply and fresh water 2 microalgae cultivation coupled with wastewater treatment provides a biomass production with high economic value and also ensures wastewater safe disposal removing inorganic nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus for the microalgae growth these nutrients may cause severe problems in aquatic environments such as eutrophication phenomenon affecting recreational activities and human health 3 in current wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide a large volume of sludge is produced as a by product requiring expensive treatment and final disposal 4 in this context microalgae bacteria consortium as an engineered system makes the wastewater treatment more environmentally and economically sustainable producing highly valuable biomass instead of sludge 5 however it is estimated that the brazilian sanitation system uses approximately 6 to 20 liters of fresh water per flush promoting affluent dilution considering this essential nutrient amounts required for microalgae cultivation are scarcely found approximately 40 and 10 mg l 1 of total nitrogen and phosphorus respectively 6 making it impracticable from the economic practical and sustainable point of view 7 as a potential solution a municipal effluent can be nutritionally enriched by mixing another kind of wastewater with high nutrient concentrations 8 recently brazil has occupied fourth place in pork production and exportation in the world producing 3731 thousand tonnes in 2016 9 effluents from pig farming contain high concentrations of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus 10 making piggery wastewater easily applicable to microalgae cultivation this large amount of piggery wastewater production has been an environmental problem for water bodies aiming to complete the nutrient cycle and provide appropriate disposal various researchers have used piggery wastewater for microalgae cultivation 8 10 12 however using it in a concentrated form is not recommended as its dark color interferes in the light penetration and biomass productivity 13 and there is a high concentration of toxic ammonia for microalgae 12 therefore pre treatment is required to reduce the organic load dissolved and suspended solids before applying it to the microalgae cultivation such as sedimentation 14 centrifugation 15 and adding fresh water or culture medium to dilute the wastewater 16 however using these processes on a large scale may increase the cost of microalgae cultivation even more for these reasons pig farming effluent applied to microalgae cultivation can be mixed with diluted municipal wastewater as an economic solution in addition especially in regions with hot climates treatment by uasb can be a classical and low cost anaerobic solution to reduce the influent organic loading and convert organic nutrients to inorganic ones at the same time uasb is not efficient in nutrient removal 17 and therefore it can be considered an appropriate treatment before microalgae cultivation in this paper the pilot treatment of wastewater mixture municipal and piggery wastewater by anaerobic treatment uasb followed by three flat panel photobioreactors pbrs was monitored over four weeks the stabilized uasb efficiency on removing the organic load c sorokiniana production and nutrient uptake were investigated aiming at a complete characterization of the system during the variation of both the physical and chemical wastewater quality parameters possible solutions to improve the microalgae growth and system treatment efficiency are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection municipal wastewater samples were taken from the full scale wwtp in são carlos são paulo state brazil this wwtp serves a population of approximately 200 000 inhabitants and treats around 20 million m³ of wastewater per year the population is served by a separate sanitary sewer system municipal wastewater was collected after the preliminary treatment screening and grit removal and pumped to the wastewater mixing reservoir piggery wastewater was collected from the santo ignácio de loyola farm located in the city of brotas são paulo state brazil 22 14 12 0 s 47 58 06 3 w this farm has around 23 000 pigs producing around 250 m³ of effluent per day 2 2 experimental unit in a laboratory situated within the wwtp fig 1 the wastewater mixture was prepared weekly using 400 l of piggery wastewater and 1200 l of municipal wastewater from wwtp an anaerobic reactor was used as pre treatment for microalgae cultivation aiming to reduce the presence of solids convert organic nitrogen to ammonia and organic phosphorus to orthophosphate inorganic phosphorus 18 the wastewater mixture was pre treated in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor 4 m high and 450 mm diameter operating with a treatment capacity of 0 65 m³ and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days it was operated in a flow of 150 ml min 1 and the 120 l of effluent which was the amount required to inoculate the pbrs was collected over 13 h the uasb reactor had been in continuous operation for ten months when this work was done which promoted well stabilized anaerobic organic matter inside the reactor then uasb effluent was collected and used to feed three flat panel pbrs operating under batch conditions as replicates each pbr had a capacity of 50 l a light path of 100 mm and a total illuminated area of 0 72 m2 on both sides the microalgae cultivation was carried out over 4 weeks with an average light intensity of 196 μmol m2 s 1 aeration rate of 0 6 vvm 10 l of microalgae acclimated in wastewater as inoculum in each cultivation cycle a photoperiod of 16 8 day night 30 c of temperature and an incubation time of 7 days the microalgae c sorokiniana 211 8k was selected as the model microalgae because the genus chlorella is predominant in cultivation systems using wastewater as a culture medium 19 20 moreover it is resilience to extreme alkaline ph conditions 21 the microalgae were previously acclimated to the effluent to be used as inoculum for this research 2 3 analytical methods an overview of the analysis used in this study is shown in table 1 the methods were carried out in two parts evaluating the uasb treatment in organic matter removal and microalgae production coupled with nutrient removal from wastewater mixture all the analyses were performed in triplicate in order to check uasb efficiency as a pre treatment wastewater mixture and uasb effluent were monitored weekly using the following parameters alkalinity bod5 cod ph scod ss ts and tvs pbr effluent was collected daily at the end of the light period aiming to determine the dissolved parameters samples were centrifuged 1200 rpm 10 min and supernatant was filtered in 0 45 μm glass microfibre filters gf 5 macherey nagel then it was used to monitor the water quality considering the following analysis cod dic nh3 no2 no3 tkn and po4 3 biomass concentration of the culture medium was monitored daily by optical density od and dry weight dw od was measured at 530 and 680 nm using dr 500 hach usa dw was determined gravimetrically filtering a defined volume of microalgae culture into a 0 45 μm glass microfibre gf 5 macherey nagel the samples were dried for 24 h under a temperature of 60 c and weighed again after they were cooled down to room temperature furthermore the pbr effluent was characterized by alkalinity cod ph and tss 2 4 calculations the dw values obtained were used to calculate the biomass productivity pr g l 1 d 1 and specific growth rate μ d 1 according to eqs 1 and 2 respectively 24 1 p r x 2 x 1 t 2 t 1 2 μ l n x 2 l n x 1 t 2 t 1 where x 1 and x 2 represent the dw values at days t 1 and t 2 respectively the dic is available in water in three forms carbon dioxide co2 bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 their availability in the medium depends on ph values and temperature the bicarbonate concentration is estimated for fresh water according to eq 3 25 3 h c o 3 d i c h k 1 h 2 h k 1 k 1 k 2 where h 10 ph k1 4 45 10 7 m and k2 4 70 10 11 m the total ammonia is the sum of free nh3 and ionized nh 4 forms in aqueous medium these forms are in equilibrium and their concentration is strongly affected by the ph and temperature to theoretically quantify the nh3 concentration which was stripped volatilized nh3 percentage was calculated according to eq 4 26 4 n h 3 100 1 10 0 09018 2729 92 t p h where ph is the ph value of the pbr sample and t is the temperature of cultivation in kelvin 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater mixture characterization and uasb treatment the organic matter characterization of wastewater mixture and uasb effluent is shown in table 2 the wastewater mixture showed a large variability of the characteristics during the four weeks monitored this may have occurred mainly due to the wwtp effluent and the variation of its quality is dependent on weather conditions daily patterns and eventual industrial wastewater discharge 27 swine waste is characterized by the high concentrations of organic matter and due to that piggery wastewater treatment by uasb is highly dependent on the hrt in terms of cod removal efficiencies higher than 73 and 85 were reached at tdh of 4 and 8 days respectively 28 on the other hand for domestic wastewater treatment by uasb cod removal higher than 70 and 80 were reached at hrt of 3 and 9 h respectively 29 in this paper using hrt of 3 days the uasb treatment showed efficacy in removing organic matter cod and bod5 higher than 90 the results are higher than those reported by the literature in which the maximum removal using this treatment in brazil is about 85 17 the possible overestimation may be caused by a high range of 25 140 ml l 1 of ss even using an automatic agitator system the treatment efficiency may be influenced by the sedimentation of solids during the reactor operation as reported the ss concentration may rise in the wastewater mixture during the time in the reservoir due to degradation of solid particle which occurs during the storage 10 3 2 c sorokiniana production fig 2 shows the microalgae production after 7 days of cultivation measured by dw and the classical wastewater tests cod and sst as previously discussed the uasb effluent showed a large range of organic matter concentration and regardless of its initial characteristics the final dw was around 1 g l 1 besides that different methodologies were used to quantify the microalgae growth with all applied tests showing a similar tendency to dw during the biomass growth the absence of co2 injection was not a limiting factor to c sorokiniana growth unlike what had previously been reported 30 the average biomass production during the cultivation period was 90 130 130 100 mg l 1 d 1 with an average specific growth rate μ of 0 11 0 28 0 18 0 15 d 1 for weeks 1 2 3 and 4 respectively during the cultivation ph values were constant with a range of 8 8 9 4 similar to other cultivation with no artificial ph control by chemical products or with the co2 application 31 despite this the results obtained are according to biomass production of some chlorella species cultivated in a neutral ph system in different systems and operation conditions 21 the biomass concentration was monitored daily by measuring od at 680 nm during cultivation fig 3 the ratio between od680 and od530 is used amply as an indicator of the amount of chlorophyll per cell in which values below 1 0 suggest inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis by microalgae cells 32 except in the first two days this ratio was above one indicating that the cells were healthy during most of the cultivation period this may have occurred due to the microalgae adaptation in the new medium on the initial days and the different light irradiation available per cell the uasb effluent color checked by od at 680 nm presented a variation from 0 4 to 0 6 which was not affected the microalgae growth due to the limited light penetration as previously reported 13 besides that we also suggest that the color is an intrinsic parameter as its intensification is correlated to the nutrient amounts available in the medium as piggery wastewater is very concentrated 7000 mg l 1 of ts and nutritionally rich 300 mg l 1 of n and 400 mg l 1 of p 28 a higher volume in the wastewater mixture might affect the nutrient concentration also increasing its color 3 3 nutrient removal nitrogen concentration during the four cycles of cultivation is shown in fig 4 a during the mixture treatment a low nitrification process was observed as reported nitrification is a ph dependent parameter that can even promote the complete inhibition of the process 33 no2 and no3 had a similar concentration at the initial and end for each cultivation cycle with a similar range obtained from c vulgaris n oleoabundans and mixed indigenous microalgae cultivated in different kinds of wastewater 34 for all cultivation cycles the nh3 concentration decrease was evident with 100 depleted after 4 days however a different variation of nh3 amount was reported for chlorella 6 20 which suggests that the nh3 was also removed by air stripping this process leads to an additional investigation addressed in another section section 3 5 substantial efficiency of 40 60 in po4 3 removal from wastewater mixture was obtained by c sorokiniana fig 4b as previously reported in the literature the curve of po4 3 concentration suggests some release of phosphorus from the suspended solids in the uasb effluent 35 high percentage of phosphorus is associated with suspended solids in uasb effluent and it can be released to the medium by organic matter degradation during the cultivation 36 the organic matter degradation can be observed by the average scod removal during the cultivation which was 53 15 38 120 mg o2 l 1 and the average efficiency was 16 4 4 22 2 and 34 1 for weeks 1 2 3 and 4 respectively furthermore it could be observed that in the week with less solid degradation week 2 and lower phosphorus release only a decrease curve for the po4 3 concentration was obtained the n p ratio available in the medium affects the biomass production and nutrient preference uptake by microalgae due to these reasons many researchers aim to find the optimal relation nutrient replete and growth conditions for phytoplankton 37 however few studies on n p ratio for microalgae cultivation in wastewater can be found in the literature choi lee 38 investigated the effect of the initial n p ratios on the c vulgaris production cultivated in the municipal wastewater their results showed the maximum of biomass productivity when an n p ratio of 1 10 was applied with removal efficiencies higher than 75 of these nutrients in this work the wastewater mixture showed an initial n p ratio of 2 1 5 0 and a final one of 0 2 0 5 the initial n p ratio is within the optimal biomass productivity range 38 but the po4 3 is available in excess when compared to nitrogen in the n p final range it suggests a nitrogen limitation in the wastewater mixture to reach a higher microalgae growth and po4 3 removal even with a low nitrogen concentration available the phosphorus uptake curve had a considerable decrease probably due to the microalgae capacity of storing orthophosphate from the medium 39 3 4 alkalinity and dic alkalinity and dic were quantified during the cultivation as shown in fig 5 according to the ph values obtained during the cultivation 8 8 to 9 4 dic concentration is the total value of hco3 and co3 2 species while co2 concentration is negligible 25 the estimated hco3 concentration represents more than 90 of all dic concentration throughout the whole cultivation period equation 3 opportunely c sorokiniana can adapt in alkaline medium and utilize hco3 as the inorganic carbon source for photosynthesis 21 and it is converted to co2 mainly by intracellular carbonic anhydrase enzymes in the cell 40 usually a ph increment is expected from the photosynthesis process as the cultivation time passes 31 nonetheless it was not observed due to the inoculum acclimatization by the effluent replacement promoting the ph stability during the whole cultivation alkalinity is based on the sum of oh hco3 and co3 2 concentrations therefore similar behavior is expected for the alkalinity and dic curves in alkaline cultivation a variation on the alkalinity and dic tendencies was observed during the cultivation decreasing to the minimum value in the 0 to 5 days with a tendency to increase from the sixth day this behavior was reported for chlorella sp cultivated in wastewater 31 but it has never been reported for dic concentration before these concentrations may have increased from day 6 because adding inorganic carbon applied to promote aeration was greater than hco3 uptake by microalgae which may be explained by the low n p ratio in the last days of cultivation during the whole cultivation period the average alkalinity removal was 62 1 59 2 56 4 and 67 with an average dic removal of 54 9 46 1 48 1 and 56 2 for weeks 1 2 3 and 4 respectively 3 5 ammonia volatilization due to the energetic demand nh3 is the most preferred inorganic nitrogen species to be incorporated by the microalgae this form is prioritized during the microalgae assimilation and converted into organic nitrogen compounds 41 based on that hypothetically a conversion was expected of the dissolved nh3 removed from wastewater mixture in the organic nitrogen into the c sorokiniana cells or its oxidation to no2 and no3 however due to physical conditions such as high ph range 9 10 and aeration it might also promote nh3 removal by air stripping 42 therefore an investigation of the nh3 removal by air stripping was carried out during the cultivation the tkn concentration nh3 organic nitrogen of filtered and raw pbr effluent was monitored for two weeks fig 6a a similar tendency may be observed on the curves with a great decay between 0 4 days after reaching a stabilization concentration this behaviour presented a similar tendency to the nh3 and the volatilizated nh3 estimated by the eq 4 fig 6b indicating that pbr was losing nitrogen in the form of nh3 by air stripping 16 the maximum nh3 removal during the cultivation period was 164 8 85 3 131 3 144 mg n l 1 d 1 for weeks 1 2 3 and 4 respectively we verified here that nh3 stripping was the main problem to reach a higher microalgae production coupled with wastewater mixture treatment the n p ratio reduction during the cultivation did not reach a high microalgae concentration and nutrient uptake dic and po4 3 besides that aiming at a scale up of the studied system the nh3 volatilization can cause a high risk to operator health such as nose and respiratory tract irritation 43 to reduce the nh3 volatilization in the cultivation without ph control and co2 application the system aeration rate optimization or the application of a system with no aeration such as raceway ponds are required 21 even in raceway ponds operating at extreme ph conditions the nh3 is rapidly oxidized nitrification process preventing its volatilization 44 as exhaustively reported as a disadvantage the area necessary for construction of this cultivation system is not a problem for a country the size of brazil and most production costs are associated with the operation 2 fig 6 4 conclusions wastewater mixture containing piggery and municipal wastewater applied to microalgae cultivation showed an excellent solution to overcome the wastewater dilution from centralized wastewater treatment the uasb reactor showed high efficiency in organic matter removal 90 even with a large variability of initial mixture characteristics the c sorokiniana production reached around 1 g l 1 with dic po4 3 and nh3 average removal from 46 to 56 40 to 60 and 100 respectively the results show a relevant nh3 removal by air stripping reducing the n p ratio during the cultivation and consequently affecting the biomass productivity and nutrient uptake further research is recommended to reduce the nh3 stripping thereby improving algae growth and the treatment system declarations of

wastewater mixture and uasb effluent is shown in table 2 the wastewater mixture showed a large variability of the characteristics during the four weeks monitored this may have occurred mainly due to the wwtp effluent and the variation of its quality is dependent on weather conditions daily patterns and eventual industrial wastewater discharge 27 swine waste is characterized by the high concentrations of organic matter and due to that piggery wastewater treatment by uasb is highly dependent on the hrt in terms of cod removal efficiencies higher than 73 and 85 were reached at tdh of 4 and 8 days respectively 28 on the other hand for domestic wastewater treatment by uasb cod removal higher than 70 and 80 were reached at hrt of 3 and 9 h respectively 29 in this paper using hrt of 3 days the uasb treatment showed efficacy in removing organic matter cod and bod5 higher than 90 the results are higher than those reported by the literature in which the maximum removal using this treatment in brazil is about 85 17 the possible overestimation may be caused by a high range of 25 140 ml l 1 of ss even using an automatic agitator system the treatment efficiency may be influenced by the sedimentation of solids during the reactor operation as reported the ss concentration may rise in the wastewater mixture during the time in the reservoir due to degradation of solid particle which occurs during the storage 10 3 2 c sorokiniana production fig 2 shows the microalgae production after 7 days of cultivation measured by dw and the classical wastewater tests cod and sst as previously discussed the uasb effluent showed a large range of organic matter concentration and regardless of its initial characteristics the final dw was around 1 g l 1 besides that different methodologies were used to quantify the microalgae growth with all applied tests showing a similar tendency to dw during the biomass growth the absence of co2 injection was not a limiting factor to c sorokiniana growth unlike what had previously been reported 30 the average biomass production during the cultivation period was 90 130 130 100 mg l 1 d 1 with an average specific growth rate μ of 0 11 0 28 0 18 0 15 d 1 for weeks 1 2 3 and 4 respectively during the cultivation ph values were constant with a range of 8 8 9 4 similar to other cultivation with no artificial ph control by chemical products or with the co2 application 31 despite this the results obtained are according to biomass production of some chlorella species cultivated in a neutral ph system in different systems and operation conditions 21 the biomass concentration was monitored daily by measuring od at 680 nm during cultivation fig 3 the ratio between od680 and od530 is used amply as an indicator of the amount of chlorophyll per cell in which values below 1 0 suggest inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis by microalgae cells 32 except in the first two days this ratio was above one indicating that the cells were healthy during most of the cultivation period this may have occurred due to the microalgae adaptation in the new medium on the initial days and the different light irradiation available per cell the uasb effluent color checked by od at 680 nm presented a variation from 0 4 to 0 6 which was not affected the microalgae growth due to the limited light penetration as previously reported 13 besides that we also suggest that the color is an intrinsic parameter as its intensification is correlated to the nutrient amounts available in the medium as piggery wastewater is very concentrated 7000 mg l 1 of ts and nutritionally rich 300 mg l 1 of n and 400 mg l 1 of p 28 a higher volume in the wastewater mixture might affect the nutrient concentration also increasing its color 3 3 nutrient removal nitrogen concentration during the four cycles of cultivation is shown in fig 4 a during the mixture treatment a low nitrification process was observed as reported nitrification is a ph dependent parameter that can even promote the complete inhibition of the process 33 no2 and no3 had a similar concentration at the initial and end for each cultivation cycle with a similar range obtained from c vulgaris n oleoabundans and mixed indigenous microalgae cultivated in different kinds of wastewater 34 for all cultivation cycles the nh3 concentration decrease was evident with 100 depleted after 4 days however a different variation of nh3 amount was reported for chlorella 6 20 which suggests that the nh3 was also removed by air stripping this process leads to an additional investigation addressed in another section section 3 5 substantial efficiency of 40 60 in po4 3 removal from wastewater mixture was obtained by c sorokiniana fig 4b as previously reported in the literature the curve of po4 3 concentration suggests some release of phosphorus from the suspended solids in the uasb effluent 35 high percentage of phosphorus is associated with suspended solids in uasb effluent and it can be released to the medium by organic matter degradation during the cultivation 36 the organic matter degradation can be observed by the average scod removal during the cultivation which was 53 15 38 120 mg o2 l 1 and the average efficiency was 16 4 4 22 2 and 34 1 for weeks 1 2 3 and 4 respectively furthermore it could be observed that in the week with less solid degradation week 2 and lower phosphorus release only a decrease curve for the po4 3 concentration was obtained the n p ratio available in the medium affects the biomass production and nutrient preference uptake by microalgae due to these reasons many researchers aim to find the optimal relation nutrient replete and growth conditions for phytoplankton 37 however few studies on n p ratio for microalgae cultivation in wastewater can be found in the literature choi lee 38 investigated the effect of the initial n p ratios on the c vulgaris production cultivated in the municipal wastewater their results showed the maximum of biomass productivity when an n p ratio of 1 10 was applied with removal efficiencies higher than 75 of these nutrients in this work the wastewater mixture showed an initial n p ratio of 2 1 5 0 and a final one of 0 2 0 5 the initial n p ratio is within the optimal biomass productivity range 38 but the po4 3 is available in excess when compared to nitrogen in the n p final range it suggests a nitrogen limitation in the wastewater mixture to reach a higher microalgae growth and po4 3 removal even with a low nitrogen concentration available the phosphorus uptake curve had a considerable decrease probably due to the microalgae capacity of storing orthophosphate from the medium 39 3 4 alkalinity and dic alkalinity and dic were quantified during the cultivation as shown in fig 5 according to the ph values obtained during the cultivation 8 8 to 9 4 dic concentration is the total value of hco3 and co3 2 species while co2 concentration is negligible 25 the estimated hco3 concentration represents more than 90 of all dic concentration throughout the whole cultivation period equation 3 opportunely c sorokiniana can adapt in alkaline medium and utilize hco3 as the inorganic carbon source for photosynthesis 21 and it is converted to co2 mainly by intracellular carbonic anhydrase enzymes in the cell 40 usually a ph increment is expected from the photosynthesis process as the cultivation time passes 31 nonetheless it was not observed due to the inoculum acclimatization by the effluent replacement promoting the ph stability during the whole cultivation alkalinity is based on the sum of oh hco3 and co3 2 concentrations therefore similar behavior is expected for the alkalinity and dic curves in alkaline cultivation a variation on the alkalinity and dic tendencies was observed during the cultivation decreasing to the minimum value in the 0 to 5 days with a tendency to increase from the sixth day this behavior was reported for chlorella sp cultivated in wastewater 31 but it has never been reported for dic concentration before these concentrations may have increased from day 6 because adding inorganic carbon applied to promote aeration was greater than hco3 uptake by microalgae which may be explained by the low n p ratio in the last days of cultivation during the whole cultivation period the average alkalinity removal was 62 1 59 2 56 4 and 67 with an average dic removal of 54 9 46 1 48 1 and 56 2 for weeks 1 2 3 and 4 respectively 3 5 ammonia volatilization due to the energetic demand nh3 is the most preferred inorganic nitrogen species to be incorporated by the microalgae this form is prioritized during the microalgae assimilation and converted into organic nitrogen compounds 41 based on that hypothetically a conversion was expected of the dissolved nh3 removed from wastewater mixture in the organic nitrogen into the c sorokiniana cells or its oxidation to no2 and no3 however due to physical conditions such as high ph range 9 10 and aeration it might also promote nh3 removal by air stripping 42 therefore an investigation of the nh3 removal by air stripping was carried out during the cultivation the tkn concentration nh3 organic nitrogen of filtered and raw pbr effluent was monitored for two weeks fig 6a a similar tendency may be observed on the curves with a great decay between 0 4 days after reaching a stabilization concentration this behaviour presented a similar tendency to the nh3 and the volatilizated nh3 estimated by the eq 4 fig 6b indicating that pbr was losing nitrogen in the form of nh3 by air stripping 16 the maximum nh3 removal during the cultivation period was 164 8 85 3 131 3 144 mg n l 1 d 1 for weeks 1 2 3 and 4 respectively we verified here that nh3 stripping was the main problem to reach a higher microalgae production coupled with wastewater mixture treatment the n p ratio reduction during the cultivation did not reach a high microalgae concentration and nutrient uptake dic and po4 3 besides that aiming at a scale up of the studied system the nh3 volatilization can cause a high risk to operator health such as nose and respiratory tract irritation 43 to reduce the nh3 volatilization in the cultivation without ph control and co2 application the system aeration rate optimization or the application of a system with no aeration such as raceway ponds are required 21 even in raceway ponds operating at extreme ph conditions the nh3 is rapidly oxidized nitrification process preventing its volatilization 44 as exhaustively reported as a disadvantage the area necessary for construction of this cultivation system is not a problem for a country the size of brazil and most production costs are associated with the operation 2 fig 6 4 conclusions wastewater mixture containing piggery and municipal wastewater applied to microalgae cultivation showed an excellent solution to overcome the wastewater dilution from centralized wastewater treatment the uasb reactor showed high efficiency in organic matter removal 90 even with a large variability of initial mixture characteristics the c sorokiniana production reached around 1 g l 1 with dic po4 3 and nh3 average removal from 46 to 56 40 to 60 and 100 respectively the results show a relevant nh3 removal by air stripping reducing the n p ratio during the cultivation and consequently affecting the biomass productivity and nutrient uptake further research is recommended to reduce the nh3 stripping thereby improving algae growth and the treatment system declarations of

modeling practice protocol where design reports effluent analysis and historical data have been collected along with various site visits and a detailed sampling campaign the collected data was used to acquire the necessary analysis for wastewater characterization and model calibration the wastewater has been characterized and the model has been calibrated according to stowa protocol for calibration then the model has been dynamically validated using the analysis acquired over an entire year the model s accuracy was acceptable and therefore was created to perform optimization studies multiple operational scenarios were simulated to achieve the highest effluent quality with nitrogen removal as the plant currently is not able to perform nitrification denitrification different do concentrations ras flows srts and consequently was flows were varied to optimize the nitrogen removal it was found that nitrification and denitrification percentages of 94 and 62 4 respectively could be achieved easily without modifying the wwtp s configuration or unit capacities this was achieved by increasing the srt from 2 7 to 7 days while converting some compartments of the aeration tank from aerobic to anoxic sludge and water lines were both included in to assess the effect of any change in the operating conditions on all components of the plant including sludge units keywords mathematical modeling wastewater treatment plant wide simulation biowin optimization 1 introduction wastewater contains many water pollutants and must be treated prior to being discharged into the

plants 2 the various biological treatment processes used to treat wastewater can be described by using mathematical equations and models 3 different mathematical models for biological wastewater treatment have evolved in recent decades among them activated sludge models asms are those used most often in optimization studies for municipal and industrial wwtps 4 asm is a representation of

energy savings use of the biowin general model is expected to reduce the time and complexity of plant wide modeling especially huge and multi process modeling so in this study biowin s asdm model was used to optimize the case study of gabal el asfar wwtp operated by degrémont which is a mega wwtp and the largest in middle east it treats wastewater with an activated sludge process and has anaerobic sludge digesters for sludge treatment the effluent is discharged into a nearby agricultural canal yet the effluent eventually reaches el manzala lake through the bahr el baqar agricultural drain which is already suffering from environmental problems operational decisions for such huge plants should not be taken lightly since they directly impact the receiving bodies of water to the best of our knowledge plant wide modelling studies for mega wwtps wwtp are rare in this paper different operational routines were investigated and multiple optimization alternatives were proposed with the purpose of achieving better effluent quality for gabal el asfar wwtp 2 material and methods for the purposes of gabal el asfar modeling good modeling practice gmp protocol is followed to show clear and organized steps historical data and design reports have been collected and 11 site visits have been made in addition to a sampling campaign for performing important analyses that are not included in the plant s routine analyses for proper wastewater characterization and a successful model calibration according to gmp protocol requirements 2 1 wwtp process description gabal el asfar has different stages where gabal el asfar contract 19 the case study of this paper has a design capacity of 500 000 m3 day gabal el asfar contract 19 has six circular primary settling tanks pst each with a diameter of 53 m and a water depth of 3 2 m and eight biological aeration tanks at with a total volume 109 840 m3 as shown in fig 1 at has a special configuration where its three zoned circular aeration tanks include a central circular zone divided into two subzones zone 1 and 2 and an external plug flow ring zone zone 3 zone 1 and 2 represent one third of the at s volume receive half of the aeration capacity and are constantly aerated to eliminate between 70 and 80 of the biodegradable organic pollutants after that the flow is directed to zone 3 which represents the remaining two thirds of the at s total volume and receives the other half of the aeration capacity to biodegrade the rest of organic pollutants and stimulate the nitrification process fig 1 shows a schematic of the at and its current aeration routine moreover it has six secondary clarifiers fst that each has a diameter of 52 m and water depth of 3 9 m gabal el asfar contract 19 is equipped with a sludge thickening system composed of gravity thickeners stt and dissolved air floatation daf for thickening of primary and secondary sludge respectively then the thickened sludge is digested in eight primary anaerobic digesters pd each with a volume of 9760 m3 plus two secondary digesters sd each having a volume of 8753 m3 finally the digested sludge is dewatered in a mechanical dewatering house mdh using a belt press system 2 2 historical analysis and sampling campaign in gabal el asfar contract 19 wwtp the flow oxygen concentration and ph are measured online while most of the other parameters are measured in the lab these are composite samples that are collected daily from different sampling points throughout the treatment process as per the calibration protocol a sampling campaign was performed to verify the historical data to complete the plant s routine data to measure the mass balance requirements such as flow data sludge production and srt to calculate the key conversions of n and cod to measure the influent characterization including raw and settled influent to measure the effluent characterization and to set up a good base for model calibration the sampling program was executed in five days 24 hour composite samples were used for raw water influent pst effluent and fst treated effluent while the rest of the measurements were performed using four grab samples due to insufficient tools and resources sludge analysis was also performed for the thickeners influent effluent daf influent daf effluent primary and secondary digesters and finally at the mechanical dewatering houses during the sampling program the weather was favourable there was no rainfall and the plant operated through dry weather conditions at an average air temperature of 24 c wastewater measurements were performed following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 12 the influent and effluent wastewater characteristics obtained from the sampling campaign are summarized in table 1 generally gabal el asfar has a high effluent quality in terms of bod cod and tss removal and the influent wastewater is very stable in terms of flow and pollutants also the pst and fst are operated with high solids removal efficiency 2 3 biowin plant wide model biowin 5 3 software is used to create a plant wide model for the wwtp the plant wide model simulates the primary settlers biological aeration tanks final clarifiers gravity thickener dissolved air floatation anaerobic digesters and the mechanical de watering of gabal el asfar contract 19 fig 2 shows the biowin 5 3 platform layout for the plant wide model to model the aeration tank shown in fig 1 in biowin seven bioreactors were used for the two compartments zone 1 and 2 in the central part of the aeration tank each one is half circle in shape and a completely mixed tank so two in series complete mix reactors were used to simulate these two compartments as shown in fig 2 the external plug flow zone of the aeration tanks zone 3 is similar to oxidation ditches in shape so five complete mix reactors in series subzones with flow recirculation were used to simulate this external zone as recommended by 8 for oxidation ditches recirculation of water inside zone 3 was modelled by assuming that 1 15 of the flow of the aeration tank goes to the final clarifiers whereas the other flow was recirculated this ratio has been assessed by measuring water velocity inside zone 3 which founds to be 0 3 m sec 2 4 wastewater characterization the resulting sampling campaign data was used in wastewater characterization raw wastewater characterization was performed according to the stowa protocol for wastewater characterization 13 the calibrated parameters used in the biowin plant wide model are shown in table 2 2 5 model calibration and validation the stoichiometric and kinetic parameters were mainly calibrated according to stowa protocol for calibration 13 the model was dynamically validated using the data acquired for a whole year from may to june of the following year the calibrated model was used to perform optimization studies to achieve complete nitrogen removal in the effluent and to reduce the operational costs optimization was completed by running multiple simulations on different operational routines such as changing the waste sludge was and the return sludge ras flow rates and trying different aeration routines in the aeration tanks including creating anoxic zones to perform nitrification denitrification etc 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the default values of stoichiometric and kinetic parameters in biowin were used for the first run of the model then organic nitrogen factors were adjusted to match the measured influent tkn and nh4 n values the inert particulate cod was then adjusted to match the model predicted sludge production vss tss of the aeration tanks and the effluent soluble inert cod finally the parameters shown in table 2 were adjusted with the aid of the sensitivity analysis study performed by 6 the model calibration was performed according to the sequence advised by stowa protocol for calibration the nitrification process was calibrated to match the measured effluent ammonia by increasing the decay of autotrophic bacteria from its default value of 0 17 to 0 33 d 1 for ammonia oxidizing bacteria this is in agreement with 14 who increased it to 0 3 d 1 and also 5 who increased it to 0 23 d 1 the substrate nh4 half saturation parameter was increased from its default value of 0 7 1 20 mg n l which is in agreement with 14 who increased it to 1 3 mg n l the maximum specific growth rate of ammonia oxidizing bacteria was reduced from its default value of 0 9 to be 0 8 d 1 different researchers modified this parameter in their simulation studies as 10 who reduced it from 1 0 to 0 46 d 1 in asm adm integrated model the denitrification process was calibrated to match the measured effluent nitrate by adjusting the anoxic growth factor from the biowin default of 0 5 to 0 4 srt was calculated based on the model predicted values the cod effluent was calibrated by adjusting the maximum specific growth rate aerobic decay rate and substrate cod half saturation table 2 the maximum specific growth rate was adjusted from 3 2 to 2 5 d 1 this also accords with 15 who reduced this parameter to 2 d 1 also according to 9 this parameter ranged widely from 1 to 8 in the literature moreover 16 estimated this parameter using respirometric tests to be between 0 25 and 0 52 d 1 in different wwtps the aerobic decay rate was increased from 0 62 to 0 9 d 1 as suggested by 7 according to 13 it can be ranged widely from 0 05 to 1 6 d 1 the substrate cod half saturation was adjusted from 5 to 10 mgcod l this is in agreement with those obtained by 7 who increased this parameter to be 15 mgcod l and 13 who showed that the range of this parameter was from 3 to 13 mgcod l in another study by 16 the substrate cod half saturation was estimated using respirometric tests to be between 0 23 and 10 7 mgcod l in different wwtps the model predictions of mlvss were achieved in biowin by modifying the ratio of cod to vss the particulate substrate and inert cod vss ratios was adjusted from their default values of 1 6 to 1 41 mgcod mgvss whereas they were adjusted by 3 to 1 48 and by 8 to 1 42 3 2 model validation the calibrated model was dynamically validated using the historical data for one year as the temperature in cairo is always warm inlet wastewater temperature varied between a minimum value of 19 c in winter to a maximum value of 32 c in the summer during the validation period the operator ran the wwtp at srts between two during summer and four days during winter to sustain the mlss in the aeration tank in the range between 1000 and 1500 mg l the daily values of temperature and srt over the whole year were entered into the software fig 3 shows the comparison between the measured and simulated values of effluent cod bod nh4 and tkn the measured and simulated values of effluent characteristics were compared and the average relative deviation ard was calculated for the whole year by using the simulated data and the measured data as a simple check for the accuracy of the model as described by 7 the model showed a good representation of the measured data for cod bod tss nh4 and tkn the average relative deviation between the simulated data and the measured data for the whole year was calculated where ard values were 19 1 18 3 16 7 18 7 and 17 8 for bod cod tss and tkn and nh4 respectively ard values were less than 20 and were considered acceptable according to 7 ard in the range of 20 was considered good as the values for effluent measurements are usually low considering the error in analytical measurements moreover the operational conditions vary throughout the year in terms of incoming wastewater characterization primary sludge flow variations were not taken into consideration during the study also the removal efficiency of pst and fst in the model was considered constant over the year but in reality it was variable and dependent on the incoming flow s variation the model also showed a good prediction for mlss and mlvss fig 4 and biogas production fig 5 with ard values of 8 5 10 4 and 20 8 respectively 3 3 optimization of nitrification and denitrification process generally gabal el asfar had a high effluent quality in terms of bod cod and tss removal yet it was not operated for nitrification and denitrification even though the plant had the potential to perform nitrification and denitrification without the deterioration of the quality in terms of bod cod and tss thus a step wise optimization was conducted on the validated model to maximize the utilization of the wwtp with minimal changes in operating costs the optimization study was carried for the wwtp situation on november where the detailed sampling campaign was conducted in this month the ras and was flow rates were 77 of the influent flow and 17 000 m3 day respectively and temperature was 24 c the aeration regime that all compartments in the aeration tank fig 1 were aerated at constant dissolved oxygen do concentrations in the various aeration tank s compartments which are 1 6 1 2 and 0 8 mg l in zones 1 2 and 3 of the aeration tanks respectively table 3 shows multiple operational scenarios and the results of these routines which are discussed below 3 3 1 optimization of nitrification process the first aim of the optimization study was to reach values near to 95 of nitrification the current nitrification is 56 8 table 3 the ammonia uptake occurred due to first the nitrogen required for bacterial growth which represents about 12 of bacterial cell mass and second due to the conversion of ammonia to nitrate through nitrification process by the action of nitrifying bacteria nitrifiers different important factors affect the growth of nitrifiers such as temperature available do ras ratio of influent flow and sludge age 1 although the temperature of 24 c in the current situation is preferable for nitrification it seems that nitrifiers growth is not enough it was noticed that mlss and mlvss in the aeration tanks are a bit low which could be increased by increasing the ras rate the capacity of the installed ras pumps is 100 of the average flow 500 000 m3 d so for scenario no 1 of optimization table 3 final clarifiers underflow rate was increased from the 424 062 m3 d ras 77 of influent flow to 500 000 m3 d ras 91 of current influent flow this step was successful in increasing the mlss the srt was increased a bit to 2 9 days and consequently nitrification was increased from 56 8 75 6 for scenario no 2 the aeration was increased to study its effect on the nitrification process where do was increased in zone 3 from 0 8 to 2 mg l table 3 the maximum aeration capacity of the plant 141 000 m3 hr was considered so that large changes in the blowers capacity could be avoided as this would mean a need for new blowers and consequently additional costs no significant enhancement was noticed thus we considered that do in the aeration tank was not the limiting factor for the nitrification process for scenarios 3 and 4 the srt was gradually increased by reducing the was flow rate which was successful in achieving high ammonia removal the required 95 nitrification was achieved at srt of 5 days the required air flow was 92 201 m3 hr which was below the maximum blowers capacity the mlss and mlvss increased from its current values of 1 34 and 0 94 g l to 1 85 and 1 27 g l respectively table 3 sludge age is an important factor for nitrifiers growth as at low sludge ages nitrifiers are washed out of the system as in low sludge ages the nitrifiers growth rate is slower than the disposal rate of the nitrifiers through the waste sludge 1 3 3 2 optimization of denitrification process the second aim of the optimization was to reduce nitrate in the effluent by converting it to nitrogen gas through the biological denitrification process the results of this step are summarized in table 3 for operational scenarios 5 through 18 for the current situation it was noted that nitrates with a value of 7 5 mg n l were disposed of with the effluent water this value was increased to 18 3 mg n l after performing the optimization of nitrification process in scenario 5 and the denitrification efficiency was 32 9 the nitrates in the effluent were the result of the conversion of ammonia by nitrifiers for scenarios 5 11 different do concentrations were simulated in the different aeration tank zones while keeping was flow rates constant some of this nitrate was disposed with effluent water and the rest was recirculated with ras to zone 1 of the aeration tank this nitrate can be removed by improving the denitrification process in the system moreover improving the denitrification process will help reduce the aeration costs as in the denitrification process nitrate can be the electron acceptor for denitrifying bacteria subsequently cod is removed as one gram of nitrate nitrogen is equivalent to 2 86 g of oxygen in removing cod 2 in scenario 5 the do concentrations were reduced to 0 8 mg l in all compartments of zone 3 which improved the denitrification to 48 3 more improvement can be done by removing the recirculated nitrate with ras which has been done in scenarios 6 through 11 table 3 where the first part of zone 3 was converted to anoxic zone by turning the aeration off meanwhile different do concentrations were simulated in the different aeration tank zones in these scenarios denitrification of 53 4 was obtained in scenario 11 however nitrification was reduced to 83 8 in scenarios 12 through 18 srt was increased gradually in order to improve the nitrification process and therefore convert more ammonia to nitrate to be available for denitrification meanwhile different do concentrations were experienced in the different zones of the aeration tanks in scenarios 13 and 14 a different approach was tried where zone 1 was kept aerated to convert more slowly biodegradable to readily biodegradable cod while converting zone 2 to anoxic zone to remove this cod portion and available nitrate by denitrifying bacteria the best performance was obtained in scenario 18 where ammonia decreased to 2 mg n l with nitrification and denitrification efficiencies of 94 and 62 4 respectively the required air flow was 94 284 m3 hr which was below the maximum blowers capacity a small increase in the effluent cod was noticed while bod was decreased a bit which is attributed to the increase in soluble unbiodegradable products from the endogenous respiration of bacteria although a considerable amount of nitrogen still exists in the effluent however this was the best denitrification efficiency that can be achieved considering the existing plant s configuration and reactors volumes further improvement for tn removal could be achieved by increasing the volume of pre anoxic reactor zone 1 which is not applicable and at the same time recycling the effluent flow which contains nitrate to zone 1 the other option will be adding a post denitrification step and inject methanol as a carbon source both options will require modification the reactors configuration and adding new equipment which was not the objective of this study 4 conclusion in this study successful plant wide modelling was performed for the largest wwtp in egypt gabal el asfar wwtp stowa protocol was used for characterization of wastewater and biowin s asdm model was used and calibrated according to stowa protocol with some adjustment of the model s stoichiometric and kinetic parameters the model was dynamically validated using the data acquired for a whole year ard values from throughout the whole year between the simulated data and the measured data were less than 20 this confirms the good calibration of the model a step wise optimization was conducted on the validated model to maximize the utilization of the wwtp with minimal changes in operating costs different do concentrations ras flows srts and consequently was flows were varied to optimize the nitrogen removal it was found that nitrification and denitrification percentages of 94 and 62 4 respectively could be achieved easily with the same wwtp s configuration this was achieved by increasing the srt from 2 7 to 7 days while converting some compartments of the aeration tank from aerobic to anoxic bio win s asdm model was effective and was able to predict the dynamic behaviour of wwtp plant wide modelling was a useful tool that allowed us to predict the performance of the plant under different operating conditions without the need to apply the suggested changes to the full scale wwtp thus affecting the normal operation of the plant this case study can be used in the future as a guide for performing plant wide modelling and optimization for similar wwtps this study was limited by the absence of historical measurements for phosphorus further work needs to be done to validate the model in phosphorus removal

include a central circular zone divided into two subzones zone 1 and 2 and an external plug flow ring zone zone 3 zone 1 and 2 represent one third of the at s volume receive half of the aeration capacity and are constantly aerated to eliminate between 70 and 80 of the biodegradable organic pollutants after that the flow is directed to zone 3 which represents the remaining two thirds of the at s total volume and receives the other half of the aeration capacity to biodegrade the rest of organic pollutants and stimulate the nitrification process fig 1 shows a schematic of the at and its current aeration routine moreover it has six secondary clarifiers fst that each has a diameter of 52 m and water depth of 3 9 m gabal el asfar contract 19 is equipped with a sludge thickening system composed of gravity thickeners stt and dissolved air floatation daf for thickening of primary and secondary sludge respectively then the thickened sludge is digested in eight primary anaerobic digesters pd each with a volume of 9760 m3 plus two secondary digesters sd each having a volume of 8753 m3 finally the digested sludge is dewatered in a mechanical dewatering house mdh using a belt press system 2 2 historical analysis and sampling campaign in gabal el asfar contract 19 wwtp the flow oxygen concentration and ph are measured online while most of the other parameters are measured in the lab these are composite samples that are collected daily from different sampling points throughout the treatment process as per the calibration protocol a sampling campaign was performed to verify the historical data to complete the plant s routine data to measure the mass balance requirements such as flow data sludge production and srt to calculate the key conversions of n and cod to measure the influent characterization including raw and settled influent to measure the effluent characterization and to set up a good base for model calibration the sampling program was executed in five days 24 hour composite samples were used for raw water influent pst effluent and fst treated effluent while the rest of the measurements were performed using four grab samples due to insufficient tools and resources sludge analysis was also performed for the thickeners influent effluent daf influent daf effluent primary and secondary digesters and finally at the mechanical dewatering houses during the sampling program the weather was favourable there was no rainfall and the plant operated through dry weather conditions at an average air temperature of 24 c wastewater measurements were performed following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 12 the influent and effluent wastewater characteristics obtained from the sampling campaign are summarized in table 1 generally gabal el asfar has a high effluent quality in terms of bod cod and tss removal and the influent wastewater is very stable in terms of flow and pollutants also the pst and fst are operated with high solids removal efficiency 2 3 biowin plant wide model biowin 5 3 software is used to create a plant wide model for the wwtp the plant wide model simulates the primary settlers biological aeration tanks final clarifiers gravity thickener dissolved air floatation anaerobic digesters and the mechanical de watering of gabal el asfar contract 19 fig 2 shows the biowin 5 3 platform layout for the plant wide model to model the aeration tank shown in fig 1 in biowin seven bioreactors were used for the two compartments zone 1 and 2 in the central part of the aeration tank each one is half circle in shape and a completely mixed tank so two in series complete mix reactors were used to simulate these two compartments as shown in fig 2 the external plug flow zone of the aeration tanks zone 3 is similar to oxidation ditches in shape so five complete mix reactors in series subzones with flow recirculation were used to simulate this external zone as recommended by 8 for oxidation ditches recirculation of water inside zone 3 was modelled by assuming that 1 15 of the flow of the aeration tank goes to the final clarifiers whereas the other flow was recirculated this ratio has been assessed by measuring water velocity inside zone 3 which founds to be 0 3 m sec 2 4 wastewater characterization the resulting sampling campaign data was used in wastewater characterization raw wastewater characterization was performed according to the stowa protocol for wastewater characterization 13 the calibrated parameters used in the biowin plant wide model are shown in table 2 2 5 model calibration and validation the stoichiometric and kinetic parameters were mainly calibrated according to stowa protocol for calibration 13 the model was dynamically validated using the data acquired for a whole year from may to june of the following year the calibrated model was used to perform optimization studies to achieve complete nitrogen removal in the effluent and to reduce the operational costs optimization was completed by running multiple simulations on different operational routines such as changing the waste sludge was and the return sludge ras flow rates and trying different aeration routines in the aeration tanks including creating anoxic zones to perform nitrification denitrification etc 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the default values of stoichiometric and kinetic parameters in biowin were used for the first run of the model then organic nitrogen factors were adjusted to match the measured influent tkn and nh4 n values the inert particulate cod was then adjusted to match the model predicted sludge production vss tss of the aeration tanks and the effluent soluble inert cod finally the parameters shown in table 2 were adjusted with the aid of the sensitivity analysis study performed by 6 the model calibration was performed according to the sequence advised by stowa protocol for calibration the nitrification process was calibrated to match the measured effluent ammonia by increasing the decay of autotrophic bacteria from its default value of 0 17 to 0 33 d 1 for ammonia oxidizing bacteria this is in agreement with 14 who increased it to 0 3 d 1 and also 5 who increased it to 0 23 d 1 the substrate nh4 half saturation parameter was increased from its default value of 0 7 1 20 mg n l which is in agreement with 14 who increased it to 1 3 mg n l the maximum specific growth rate of ammonia oxidizing bacteria was reduced from its default value of 0 9 to be 0 8 d 1 different researchers modified this parameter in their simulation studies as 10 who reduced it from 1 0 to 0 46 d 1 in asm adm integrated model the denitrification process was calibrated to match the measured effluent nitrate by adjusting the anoxic growth factor from the biowin default of 0 5 to 0 4 srt was calculated based on the model predicted values the cod effluent was calibrated by adjusting the maximum specific growth rate aerobic decay rate and substrate cod half saturation table 2 the maximum specific growth rate was adjusted from 3 2 to 2 5 d 1 this also accords with 15 who reduced this parameter to 2 d 1 also according to 9 this parameter ranged widely from 1 to 8 in the literature moreover 16 estimated this parameter using respirometric tests to be between 0 25 and 0 52 d 1 in different wwtps the aerobic decay rate was increased from 0 62 to 0 9 d 1 as suggested by 7 according to 13 it can be ranged widely from 0 05 to 1 6 d 1 the substrate cod half saturation was adjusted from 5 to 10 mgcod l this is in agreement with those obtained by 7 who increased this parameter to be 15 mgcod l and 13 who showed that the range of this parameter was from 3 to 13 mgcod l in another study by 16 the substrate cod half saturation was estimated using respirometric tests to be between 0 23 and 10 7 mgcod l in different wwtps the model predictions of mlvss were achieved in biowin by modifying the ratio of cod to vss the particulate substrate and inert cod vss ratios was adjusted from their default values of 1 6 to 1 41 mgcod mgvss whereas they were adjusted by 3 to 1 48 and by 8 to 1 42 3 2 model validation the calibrated model was dynamically validated using the historical data for one year as the temperature in cairo is always warm inlet wastewater temperature varied between a minimum value of 19 c in winter to a maximum value of 32 c in the summer during the validation period the operator ran the wwtp at srts between two during summer and four days during winter to sustain the mlss in the aeration tank in the range between 1000 and 1500 mg l the daily values of temperature and srt over the whole year were entered into the software fig 3 shows the comparison between the measured and simulated values of effluent cod bod nh4 and tkn the measured and simulated values of effluent characteristics were compared and the average relative deviation ard was calculated for the whole year by using the simulated data and the measured data as a simple check for the accuracy of the model as described by 7 the model showed a good representation of the measured data for cod bod tss nh4 and tkn the average relative deviation between the simulated data and the measured data for the whole year was calculated where ard values were 19 1 18 3 16 7 18 7 and 17 8 for bod cod tss and tkn and nh4 respectively ard values were less than 20 and were considered acceptable according to 7 ard in the range of 20 was considered good as the values for effluent measurements are usually low considering the error in analytical measurements moreover the operational conditions vary throughout the year in terms of incoming wastewater characterization primary sludge flow variations were not taken into consideration during the study also the removal efficiency of pst and fst in the model was considered constant over the year but in reality it was variable and dependent on the incoming flow s variation the model also showed a good prediction for mlss and mlvss fig 4 and biogas production fig 5 with ard values of 8 5 10 4 and 20 8 respectively 3 3 optimization of nitrification and denitrification process generally gabal el asfar had a high effluent quality in terms of bod cod and tss removal yet it was not operated for nitrification and denitrification even though the plant had the potential to perform nitrification and denitrification without the deterioration of the quality in terms of bod cod and tss thus a step wise optimization was conducted on the validated model to maximize the utilization of the wwtp with minimal changes in operating costs the optimization study was carried for the wwtp situation on november where the detailed sampling campaign was conducted in this month the ras and was flow rates were 77 of the influent flow and 17 000 m3 day respectively and temperature was 24 c the aeration regime that all compartments in the aeration tank fig 1 were aerated at constant dissolved oxygen do concentrations in the various aeration tank s compartments which are 1 6 1 2 and 0 8 mg l in zones 1 2 and 3 of the aeration tanks respectively table 3 shows multiple operational scenarios and the results of these routines which are discussed below 3 3 1 optimization of nitrification process the first aim of the optimization study was to reach values near to 95 of nitrification the current nitrification is 56 8 table 3 the ammonia uptake occurred due to first the nitrogen required for bacterial growth which represents about 12 of bacterial cell mass and second due to the conversion of ammonia to nitrate through nitrification process by the action of nitrifying bacteria nitrifiers different important factors affect the growth of nitrifiers such as temperature available do ras ratio of influent flow and sludge age 1 although the temperature of 24 c in the current situation is preferable for nitrification it seems that nitrifiers growth is not enough it was noticed that mlss and mlvss in the aeration tanks are a bit low which could be increased by increasing the ras rate the capacity of the installed ras pumps is 100 of the average flow 500 000 m3 d so for scenario no 1 of optimization table 3 final clarifiers underflow rate was increased from the 424 062 m3 d ras 77 of influent flow to 500 000 m3 d ras 91 of current influent flow this step was successful in increasing the mlss the srt was increased a bit to 2 9 days and consequently nitrification was increased from 56 8 75 6 for scenario no 2 the aeration was increased to study its effect on the nitrification process where do was increased in zone 3 from 0 8 to 2 mg l table 3 the maximum aeration capacity of the plant 141 000 m3 hr was considered so that large changes in the blowers capacity could be avoided as this would mean a need for new blowers and consequently additional costs no significant enhancement was noticed thus we considered that do in the aeration tank was not the limiting factor for the nitrification process for scenarios 3 and 4 the srt was gradually increased by reducing the was flow rate which was successful in achieving high ammonia removal the required 95 nitrification was achieved at srt of 5 days the required air flow was 92 201 m3 hr which was below the maximum blowers capacity the mlss and mlvss increased from its current values of 1 34 and 0 94 g l to 1 85 and 1 27 g l respectively table 3 sludge age is an important factor for nitrifiers growth as at low sludge ages nitrifiers are washed out of the system as in low sludge ages the nitrifiers growth rate is slower than the disposal rate of the nitrifiers through the waste sludge 1 3 3 2 optimization of denitrification process the second aim of the optimization was to reduce nitrate in the effluent by converting it to nitrogen gas through the biological denitrification process the results of this step are summarized in table 3 for operational scenarios 5 through 18 for the current situation it was noted that nitrates with a value of 7 5 mg n l were disposed of with the effluent water this value was increased to 18 3 mg n l after performing the optimization of nitrification process in scenario 5 and the denitrification efficiency was 32 9 the nitrates in the effluent were the result of the conversion of ammonia by nitrifiers for scenarios 5 11 different do concentrations were simulated in the different aeration tank zones while keeping was flow rates constant some of this nitrate was disposed with effluent water and the rest was recirculated with ras to zone 1 of the aeration tank this nitrate can be removed by improving the denitrification process in the system moreover improving the denitrification process will help reduce the aeration costs as in the denitrification process nitrate can be the electron acceptor for denitrifying bacteria subsequently cod is removed as one gram of nitrate nitrogen is equivalent to 2 86 g of oxygen in removing cod 2 in scenario 5 the do concentrations were reduced to 0 8 mg l in all compartments of zone 3 which improved the denitrification to 48 3 more improvement can be done by removing the recirculated nitrate with ras which has been done in scenarios 6 through 11 table 3 where the first part of zone 3 was converted to anoxic zone by turning the aeration off meanwhile different do concentrations were simulated in the different aeration tank zones in these scenarios denitrification of 53 4 was obtained in scenario 11 however nitrification was reduced to 83 8 in scenarios 12 through 18 srt was increased gradually in order to improve the nitrification process and therefore convert more ammonia to nitrate to be available for denitrification meanwhile different do concentrations were experienced in the different zones of the aeration tanks in scenarios 13 and 14 a different approach was tried where zone 1 was kept aerated to convert more slowly biodegradable to readily biodegradable cod while converting zone 2 to anoxic zone to remove this cod portion and available nitrate by denitrifying bacteria the best performance was obtained in scenario 18 where ammonia decreased to 2 mg n l with nitrification and denitrification efficiencies of 94 and 62 4 respectively the required air flow was 94 284 m3 hr which was below the maximum blowers capacity a small increase in the effluent cod was noticed while bod was decreased a bit which is attributed to the increase in soluble unbiodegradable products from the endogenous respiration of bacteria although a considerable amount of nitrogen still exists in the effluent however this was the best denitrification efficiency that can be achieved considering the existing plant s configuration and reactors volumes further improvement for tn removal could be achieved by increasing the volume of pre anoxic reactor zone 1 which is not applicable and at the same time recycling the effluent flow which contains nitrate to zone 1 the other option will be adding a post denitrification step and inject methanol as a carbon source both options will require modification the reactors configuration and adding new equipment which was not the objective of this study 4 conclusion in this study successful plant wide modelling was performed for the largest wwtp in egypt gabal el asfar wwtp stowa protocol was used for characterization of wastewater and biowin s asdm model was used and calibrated according to stowa protocol with some adjustment of the model s stoichiometric and kinetic parameters the model was dynamically validated using the data acquired for a whole year ard values from throughout the whole year between the simulated data and the measured data were less than 20 this confirms the good calibration of the model a step wise optimization was conducted on the validated model to maximize the utilization of the wwtp with minimal changes in operating costs different do concentrations ras flows srts and consequently was flows were varied to optimize the nitrogen removal it was found that nitrification and denitrification percentages of 94 and 62 4 respectively could be achieved easily with the same wwtp s configuration this was achieved by increasing the srt from 2 7 to 7 days while converting some compartments of the aeration tank from aerobic to anoxic bio win s asdm model was effective and was able to predict the dynamic behaviour of wwtp plant wide modelling was a useful tool that allowed us to predict the performance of the plant under different operating conditions without the need to apply the suggested changes to the full scale wwtp thus affecting the normal operation of the plant this case study can be used in the future as a guide for performing plant wide modelling and optimization for similar wwtps this study was limited by the absence of historical measurements for phosphorus further work needs to be done to validate the model in phosphorus removal

14312,feed spacer orientation affects the velocity pattern and pressure drop of spacer filled channels such as those encountered in spiral wound membrane swm modules of reverse osmosis ro however there are only limited numbers of experimental studies on this topic this study sets out to reveal more detailed information on the pressure drop and velocity patterns of spacer filled channels particle image velocimetry piv is used to provide high resolution velocity maps for three commercial feed spacers of different thicknesses at a flow attack angle of 45 and 90 the pressure drop is measured for the applied operational conditions re 250 results showed higher pressure losses a better mixing of flow a lower variation of temporal velocity and a smaller variation of velocity over the channel height in the orientation with a flow attack angle of 45 as compared to 90 the results presented here can be used to validate numerical studies determine the fouling sensitive regions in a

around the world for production of highly purified water 1 the coming decades are likely to witness an even greater use of ro for purification of fresh surface water as a consequence of the emergence of new types of micropollutants such as drug residues in fresh water which cannot be removed with conventional treatment plants for instance wong et al 2 3 reported that certain species are in danger of extinction in almost half of european and north american rivers and lakes because of the pollution of these ecosystems 4 the spiral wound membrane swm configuration is the most common configuration applied in nanofiltration nf and ro because it offers a good balance between ease of operation fouling control permeation rate and packing density 5 8 however a wider and more efficient application of swm configuration requires further improvements of the module s components such as the feed spacer 3 9 12 the feed spacer works as a supporting net and keeps two adjacent envelopes apart 13 14 it thereby provides a passing channel for feed water to move tangentially over the active layer of membrane sheets 15 in addition the feed spacer determines the hydraulic conditions of the feed channel such as the pressure drop and the time and location of initiation of the fouling thus any alteration in geometrical characteristics of the feed spacer results in the changing of hydraulic conditions of the swm module a slight increase in the thickness of the feed spacer from 28 to 34 mils is one of the few changes that feed spacers have undergone since the first design of swm modules of ro this improvement led to the manufacturing of low pressure ro modules at a constant production rate low pressure modules have a lower fouling tendency and pressure drop 16 and consequently consume less energy compared to modules composed of 28 mils 0 7 mm spacers such improvements are particularly attractive when fresh water is used as the feed for swm modules of ro because of a higher ratio of pressure losses to applied pressure in fresh water this higher ratio can be explained by the fact that the applied pressure in fresh water is lower than brackish water and seawater due to its lower osmotic pressure but the pressure drop along a clean swm module is the same for all types of water due to constant geometrical characteristics of the feed spacer and feed channel in commercial modules considering the amount of water produced by ro plants worldwide and high energy costs even a small improvement in the efficiency of the feed spacer can be translated into large savings or increased water output 17 therefore it is crucial to understand the effects of geometric modification of the feed spacer on hydraulic conditions of the feed channel such as the pressure drop and the velocity pattern while many studies have investigated the effect of feed spacer geometry on the energy losses and the hydrodynamics inside the feed channel only a few have addressed the effects of orientation the orientation of a feed spacer is determined by the flow attack angle α which is defined as the angle between the flow and hydrodynamic angle β of the spacer fig 1 the hydrodynamic angle is the interior angle relative to feed flow at the intersection of longitudinal and transverse filaments zimmere and kottke 15 studied effects of the flow attack angle α and the ratio of filaments length to channel height lm hch on the pressure drop mass transfer and mixing behavior of flow by physiochemical principles using ammonia in addition they used a tracer of ammonia for visualization of the flow and of the mass transfer inhomogeneity in the feed channel they concluded that a proper choice of the lm hch ratio and the flow attack angle orientation of the feed spacer results in overlapping of two basic flow types channel flow and corkscrew flow and creation of mixing by which a homogeneous mass transfer combined with a good residence time behavior at acceptable energy costs could be achieved geraldes et al 18 investigated the effect of lm hch ratio in a ladder type feed spacer and found that the value of the reynolds number at which the flow becomes unstable decreases due to the increase of inter filament distance between two transverse filaments santos et al 19 used experimental and numerical studies to determine the shear stress and the mass transfer at the membrane wall for ladder oriented spacers they introduced a modified friction factor and found that it is linearly related to the sherwood number based on this linear relation they suggested that the modified friction factor may be used for selecting the best spacers in terms of mass transfer efficiency additionally they showed that the flow structure is mainly affected by transverse filaments and that effects of longitudinal filaments are marginal li et al 20 used a cfd simulation to calculate the mass transfer and power consumption of non woven spacers at different lm hch ratio flow attack angle and hydrodynamic angle they concluded that there should be an optimum value for the lm hch ratio the hydrodynamic angle and the flow attack angle koutsou et al 21 performed experimental and numerical simulation at a typical reynolds number for ro 50 re 200 they investigated the effect of both reynolds re and schmidt sc numbers on the sherwood sh number in spacer filled channels by changing the lm hch ratio the flow attack angle and the hydrodynamic angle of spacers they demonstrated that the local mass transfer was lower in sparser spacer geometries but increased by increasing the hydrodynamic angle additionally they showed that the distribution of average mass transfer was similar to the corresponding distribution of shear stress at the channel walls while the previously mentioned researchers used spacers with a simplified cross section for numerical simulations more recent numerical studies e g studies done by bucs et al 22 and radu et al 23 have started to use spacers with closer geometrical similarities to those of commercial ones however it remains a challenge in numerical methods to use spacers with a geometry that exactly matches the geometry of commercial spacers and therefore the use of feed spacers with detailed geometry such as the commercial feed spacers remains limited to experimental methods schock and miquel 24 used various commercial spacers to measure the mass transfer and pressure drop they showed that spacer filled channels have higher mass transfer compared to empty channels over the same range of reynolds numbers albeit at the increased pressure drop da costa et al 25 studied the effect of spacer filament orientation on the flux enhancement in ultrafiltration membranes they found a maximum flux for a flow attack angle of 40 45 in another study 26 they used dye injection and microbubbles to visualize the effects of the spacer s configuration on the flow pattern of spacer filled channels they showed that in spacers with a smaller flow attack angle the flow is more widely spread in the xy plane fig 1 neal et al 5 investigated the orientation effects of commercial feed spacers on particle deposition they used a spacer with a geometry similar to the standard 28 mil feed spacer used in most swm modules of ro albeit in combination with a microfiltration membrane they 5 linked the deposition patterns of particles to the orientation of feed spacer and the non uniform shape of the filaments in commercial spacers while numerical studies enhance our understanding of hydraulic conditions of spacer filled channels at relatively low costs and risks compared to experimental methods they may be associated with challenges such as matching the geometry of the modeled feed spacer with commercial ones and an accurate verification and validation of numerical modules as a result it is recommended 27 28 to use direct non invasive high resolution experimental methods such as particle image velocimetry piv gimmelshtein and semiat 29 used piv for investigation of the liquid flow in the spacer filled channel in the velocity ranges from 0 06 to 1 3 m s they showed that the bulk of fluid flows in a straight line from inlet to outlet with only small deviations near the filaments willems et al 28 investigated the fluid velocity profiles of water and water air mixture in spacer filled channels they found that liquid flows mainly parallel to the spacers filaments and therefore the direction of flow changed 90 over the height of the channel the disagreement of their results with results of gimmelshtein and semiat 29 was due to the fact that the latter researchers used a spacer which was 20 thinner than the channel height and thus created an empty space in the channel height additionally the piv results obtained by gimmelshtein and semiat indicate that they may have measured the velocity only in the empty part of the channel haidari et al 11 compared the flow pattern of an empty channel with a spacer filled channel using piv they showed that the flow in the empty channel was in a straight line from inlet to outlet and in the spacer filled channel which was in agreement with the results of willems et al 28 in addition they showed that the low velocity regions were in agreement with the fouling sites detected by other researchers the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of orientation of commercial feed spacers on the fluid flow and the pressure drop three different spacers were considered each at two orientations normal orientation and ladder orientation fig 1 the effect of orientation on the pressure drop of the same spacers was investigated a short description of the piv technique is given in the experimental part of this article the detailed description of the technique is provided by adrian et al 30 the effect of the spacers orientation on the spatial and temporal velocity variations was studied at three heights of the feed channel finally the flow patterns were compared with fouling sites mentioned by previous studies with the objective of linking the flow pattern with the fouling 2 experimental the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 a suspension with fluorescent particles 02 flows through a pump 03 and a mass flow meter 04 to the flow cells 05 the pressure drop over the flow cell is measured by means of a differential pressure transducer 06 the values from the pressure transmitter and from the mass flow meter are used to determine the friction factor simultaneously velocities are measured as the laser 08 emits two light pulses that illuminate a well defined plane and have a short time interval synchronized with a high speed camera 09 that takes two images 11 the captured frames are used to determine the variations of temporal and spatial velocity inside the channel using commercial software davis 7 2 a detailed description of the setup can be found in a previous study 11 the curvature effects of swm modules on the flow can be neglected because of the small channel height in these modules 18 19 in comparison with the radius therefore it is a common practice to use flat flow cells to study hydraulic conditions of thin spacer filled channels such as those of swm modules of ro the flow cell used in this study l 260 mm w 85 mm h 55 mm included an embedded flow channel l 200 mm and w 40 mm for the membrane coupon trisep amc1 and a spacer the height of the flow channel is changed according to the spacer thickness by using plastic shims the experiments were conducted without the permeate production as the ratio of permeate in ro is small compared to the cross flow velocity the non woven commercial feed spacers delstar technologies inc in this study were made of polypropylene without any further modifications the geometric specifications of these spacers are given in table 1 values of the porosity and hydraulic diameter are respectively calculated by using eq 1 26 and eq 2 26 27 1 ε 1 π d f 2 2 l m h s p sin β 2 d h 4 ε 2 h c h 1 ε s v s p sv sp represents the specific surface of the feed spacer that can be calculated by dividing the feed spacer surface to volume the definition of other parameters and symbols is mentioned in the beginning of this article the same spacer is used at two different orientations the orientation with the flow attack angle of 45 which is common in swm modules of ro and here referred to as the normal orientation and the orientation with the flow attack angle of 90 which is not usual in swm modules of ro and will be referred to as the ladder orientation experiments are done at constant temperature 1 errors from the average temperature oc and different flow rates different flow rates were required to determine the dependency of the friction factor ctd on the reynolds number eq 3 3 c t d 2 ρ u a v e 2 δ p l d h a r e h n the dependency of the friction factor on the reynolds number can be used to determine the flow conditions of the channel determining the power n of the reynolds number in the definition of the friction factor in eq 3 gives a better understanding of the flow conditions in the feed channel a lower value of n indicates a higher state of flow disturbance in the channel da costa et al 26 achieved n values between 0 16 0 34 for different spacers at velocities that varied between 0 27 2 91 m s a is a constant which is determined by geometry of the spacer and the channel the definition used for the reynolds number here is equivalent to the one used by schock and miquel 24 and fimbres weihs and wiley 27 31 eq 4 4 r e h ρ u a v e d h μ the hydraulic reynolds number is determined as a function of average velocity of the spacer filled channel eq 5 and the channel height hch 5 u a v e q a e f f q a ε q w h c h ε u s u p ε other typical definitions for the reynolds number used in the literature are the channel reynolds number 32 and the cylinder reynolds number 8 the channel and cylinder reynolds number make use of the average velocity in the empty channel usup in eq 5 respectively in combination with channel height and filament diameter the calculation of average velocity eq 5 is done with a single average filament thickness value while the thickness of a manufactured filament in commercial spacers varies over its length the state of flow can also be determined by defining the relation between the pressure drop and the power of average velocity in the main direction of flow m eq 6 6 δ p k u a v e m it was suggested 33 34 that m should be around one for laminar flow and around 1 75 for turbulent however in turbulent flow the reynolds number re is far above the reynolds number occurring in the swm modules of ro therefore as it has been suggested 27 35 it is better to talk about the disturbance inside the flow as eddies rather than turbulence the velocity in the piv experiments is determined by capturing two frames that are taken at about 100 mm from the inlet and 15 mm from each edge of the cell in order to limit the effects of boundaries entrance edges and exit on the flow and to ensure a fully developed flow the flow along the channel is traced by using fluorescent particles with a mean diameter of 10 μm and a density of 1 19 g cm3 the calculated stokes number of particles was around 5 10 3 for the thinnest spacer used 28 mil spacer 0 71 mm spacer and thus tracing accuracy errors were below 1 36 fluorescence was used in combination with an optical filter to improve the quality of images the time interval between two pulses two frames was adjusted to the particles displacement in order to reduce loss of particle images within the interrogation window from the first frame to the second frame 11 an interrogation window or a sub window is an area smaller than the area of a captured frame here 7 4 7 4 μm2 from which information is obtained related to the most probable displacement of the particle pattern in a short time interval the piv measurements were performed at three different heights in the feed channel separately close to the camera z3 in the middle of the channel z2 and far from the camera or close to the membrane sheet at the bottom of the feed channel z1 the whole depth of the channel was illuminated because the thickness of the laser sheet light 2 mm was greater than the thickness of the feed channel 0 7 mm that is a common situation in μpiv 28 and can be solved by fixing the focus of the camera at a specific distance from the lens and moving the object 28 37 in this study moving the flow cell was not an option and therefore the camera was moved on a translation stage 50 μm in each step the camera was initially placed such that particles in the middle of the channel and close to the membrane were barely in focus z3 in fig 3 then the camera was moved to the subsequent positions z1 z2 in fig 3 with a translating stage the camera s depth of field in this setup was about 0 14 mm at each depth 50 pairs of images 100 frames were taken for a specific flow a instantaneous velocity map is calculated for each pair of frames these 50 instantaneous velocity maps are used to compare the velocities inside the feed channels over time temporal velocity an average is calculated from these 50 instantaneous velocity maps averaged spatial velocity profile and is used to study the spatial variations of the velocity inside the feed channel 11 3 results and discussions 3 1 pressure drop and friction losses fig 4 illustrates the dependency of pressure drop δp on average velocity uave and dependency of friction factor ctd on hydraulic reynolds number reh in parallel to piv measurements each point in fig 4 represents an average of at least 450 measurements the same feed flow range 1 4 16 0 l h was applied to the spacers and therefore each feed spacer is operated at a slightly different average velocity range the range of average velocity in spacers c was slightly lower than values commonly used in experimental studies for ro however these values are interesting for low salinity water purification in which water permeation could be relatively significant as shown in fig 4a the pressure drop over the feed channel is expressed in bars m while the spacers used in the experiments were only 20 cm long the conversion from 20 cm to one meter is done linearly as it often happens in the practice and it is intentionally expressed in bars m to be able to compare the achieved results with results from practice for instance the pressure drop in an ro pressure vessel is calculated by multiplying the number of elements in a pressure vessel by 0 2 bars which is the pressure drop over one element drives with an average velocity of 0 1 m s it is worth mentioning that common spiral wound ro elements are typically one meter long and include spacers with characteristics the same as spacer anormal the common average velocity in these elements is about 0 1 0 3 m s comparing the results from fig 4a with the practical results and results from literature 38 shows that the measured pressure drop represents the actual values in the practice fig 4a shows that for the experimental conditions in this study the pressure drop differs notably only in two orientations of the spacer a and as expected the pressure drop is lower with the ladder orientation additionally fig 4a shows that apparently the pressure drop decreases with increasing spacer thickness however it is difficult to draw such a conclusion based only on the presented data because the spacers do not change merely in thickness but also in geometric characterizations such as mesh length hydraulic diameter and porosity the best fitted values for dependency of the velocity on pressure drop are illustrated in table 2 considering only the m values the flow is more similar to a stokes flow in the ladder orientation than in the normal orientation in addition the flow with spacer c is more similar to a stokes flow than other spacers the n values which are obtained from the best fitted data of fig 4b do not match the flow conditions between the two orientations as mentioned earlier however the n values confirm the fact that the flow with spacer c appears more stokesian than with the two other spacers 3 2 the actual velocity fields determined by piv this section presents the spatial and temporal velocity maps obtained by piv in contrast to the average velocity eq 5 which is normally expressed as a single value the piv results are shown in the form of velocity fields or velocity maps piv provides information about the velocity development at a particular point in time temporal velocity a instantaneous spatial velocity profile is created by measuring the velocity of all the points in the camera s field of view at a particular time step averaging all instantaneous spatial velocity profiles results in the averaged spatial velocity profile following the line of former studies the term average velocity refers to the theoretically inferred velocity at the feed channel inlet eq 5 and without considering whether the value is fully developed the flow becomes fully developed at some distance downstream of the inlet which is called the entrance length the entrance length in empty rectangular channels depends on the aspect ratio defined as the ratio of the channel height to the channel width 39 and is rather small for the setup used in this study about 2 17 mm it is however challenging to calculate the entrance length in spacer filled channels piv measurements are performed at some distance from the inlet to avoid effects of the entrance length figs 5 7 illustrate averaged spatial velocity patterns of the ladder and normal orientation in the middle of the channel for an average velocity of 0 1 m s with spacers a and b and 0 08 m s with spacer c fig 8 illustrates instantaneous variations of the velocity at a particular point inside a mesh 3 2 1 spatial velocity patterns 3 2 1 1 velocity at the middle of the channel height fig 5 shows averaged spatial velocity profiles for two examined orientations of each spacer at the middle of the channel z2 in fig 3 the zones with velocity close to zero above the filaments can be used as an indication that the images are taken at the middle part of the channel however there is a slightly different scenario in c1 and c2 respectively the ladder orientation and normal orientation of spacer c long arrows which indicate high velocity regions appear on top of the filaments mainly close to the nodes of the spacer on the right side of the meshes this is the result of the non uniform shape of filaments over their length in the commercial feed spacer which is slightly thinner at the places with higher velocity than other parts at the thinner part the filament is slightly out of the camera s focus and therefore does not measure the velocity exactly on the filament s surface this shows that the enhanced geometric characterizations introduced to the numerical studies done by bucs et al 22 and radu et al 23 is very close to the actual flow behavior as it occurs in a feed channel filled with commercial feed spacers additionally fig 5 shows that the flow in the ladder orientation type 1 is in a straight line from the inlet to the outlet while in the normal orientation the bulk flows along the filaments close to it local averaged spatial velocities change from very low values up to more than two times the average velocity in some areas the difference between the low and high velocity regions is greater in the ladder orientation than in the normal orientation comparing different spacers velocity values with spacer b1 are highest reaching almost 0 26 m s in some places in the ladder orientation a low velocity region is formed downstream of the filaments this region differs slightly from the particle deposition area interpreted as a region with low velocity described by neal et al 5 but it was in close agreement with the results of particle deposition achieved by radu et al 23 fig 08 in their work neal et al 5 used a spacer with the same geometric characteristics as spacer a and observed that particles were deposited on the microfiltration membrane at some distance from the filaments and not directly at the downstream area this no deposition area directly downstream of the filaments is explained by the work of cao et al 40 who showed that relatively strong eddy currents are present in this area the difference regarding the presence of the no deposition zone directly behind the transverse filament between this study and the study done by neal et al 5 could be explained by the fact that they used higher flow rates re 400 than in this study re 200 notably the velocity magnitude downstream of filaments with the ladder orientation is not uniform along the entire filament s length which is probably the consequence of the filament s cross sectional shape the highest velocity downstream of a filament is observed at locations where filaments bulge toward the flow the acceleration effect was more apparent over the swelled part of transverse filaments in thicker spacers than thinner spacers in the normal orientation water passes over the filaments attached to the membrane and under the filaments attached to the observation window and is mixed in the following mesh this is repeated for every mesh this complex mixing behavior of the flow together with the particular geometry of each spacer thickness and porosity and filaments makes it difficult to give a general prediction of the lowest and highest velocity areas for instance in the channel with spacer a the lowest velocity region is observed in that half of the mesh where the water passes over a filament to enter the mesh and under the adjacent filament to leave the mesh right half of the meshes in fig 5 and the highest velocity is at the other half of the mesh where water passes under a filament to enter the mesh and over a filament to leave the mesh with spacer b the highest velocity occurs directly downstream of the filaments at the entering parts of the mesh and the lowest at the confluence of these streams with spacer c the lowest velocity occurs in the diagonal part of the mesh the upstream node of the mesh where both flows exit the mesh is the only point in all spacers with a similar low velocity region 3 2 1 2 velocity pattern at different channel heights the velocity patterns as described in the previous section fig 5 are only valid for the situation in which the camera is focused on the middle part of the channel z2 in fig 3 fig 6 shows averaged spatial velocity patterns at the membrane side z1 in fig 3 on which the transverse filaments are placed the operational conditions were the same as the operational conditions at the middle of the channel velocity magnitudes of the ladder orientation are significantly lower over the membrane side than the middle part of the channel in addition the velocity decrease in ladder orientation over the membrane compared to the middle of the channel is greater with thicker spacers in the normal orientation the velocity close to the membrane is approximately the same as in the middle of the channel the flow direction on the other hand differs clearly from the flow direction at the middle of the channel in both orientations in the normal orientation the flow is along the direction of attached filaments in the ladder orientation the flow direction close to the membrane side is a function of the spacer thickness for instance the flow direction with spacer a is approximately the same as in the middle of the channel from the inlet to the outlet with the largest deviation downstream of the filaments these areas are referred to as the particle deposition area by neal et al 5 the magnitude of the velocity is respectively 44 and 57 lower for spacer b and c compared to spacer a fig 7 includes the statistical representation of figs 5 and 6 and averaged spatial velocity profile at the front part of the channel z1 in fig 3 i e each box shows the velocity variations over the total field of view at a specific height z1 z2 and z3 from fig 3 the median average and outliers are shown respectively with a straight line empty circle inside the box and filled circles fig 7 shows that the averaged spatial velocity is higher at the side of the channel without the transverse filaments z3 than in the middle of the channel z2 in the ladder orientation for the same conditions the velocity magnitude at the observation window z3 was on average higher from 3 6 in spacer a to 54 in spacer b in ladder orientation than in normal orientation the velocity magnitude at the membrane side z1 was lower from 28 in spacer a to 68 in spacer c in ladder orientation compared to normal orientation at the middle of the channel z2 the velocity magnitude was lower from 5 in spacer a to 27 in spacer c in ladder orientation than in the normal orientation the lower velocity at the membrane side of the ladder orientation can be explained by considering the role of transverse filaments transverse filaments accelerate the flow at the opposite half of the channel as they are narrowing the flow path in the normal orientation both filament layers contribute to flow acceleration i e there are accelerated flows at the top and bottom of the membrane because the flow attack angle is 45 top and bottom flows cross each other and a proper mixing of flow occurs in the feed channel in the ladder orientation where the flow attack angle is 90 only transverse filaments contribute to flow acceleration i e there is no acceleration due to filaments parallel to the flow on the side that transverse filaments are attached to therefore the flow becomes more isolated between two successive filaments and low velocity areas are formed 3 2 2 temporal velocity variation fig 8 shows variations of the velocity in time for the point e in the center of a mesh for three channel heights the median average and outliers are shown respectively with a straight line empty circle inside the box and filled circles in general the velocity variations for the normal orientation are less than with the ladder orientation which resembles the averaged spatial profiles as shown in fig 7 as expected the variation in time is greater than in space since the spatial variations are based on time averaged velocities fig 8 illustrates that the magnitude and variation of the temporal velocity is clearly lower in ladder orientation compared to the normal orientation particularly in spacers b and c remarkably with the ladder orientation the variation of velocity is higher particularly with spacer b and c in the middle of the channel z2 compared to the observation window z3 and at the membrane side z1 this is probably the result of a clear separation in the flow magnitude at the top high velocity and bottom low velocity parts of the flow channel the high velocity variations could be the result of vortex shedding in the lee side of filaments or due to the existence of pulsating flow as the consequence of acceleration and deceleration of flow when moving from one mesh to the other one in either case high velocity variation in time is considered beneficial with respect to fouling prevention and concentration polarization destabilization however the high velocity variations observed with the ladder orientation occur in the middle of the channel while fouling and concentration polarization tend to happen on the membrane sides the benefit could therefore be minimal in this case in the normal orientation the velocity has the same magnitude at the top and bottom parts of the channel because both layers of filaments contribute to the flow acceleration in the channel 4 conclusions in this study the impacts of two orientations of three spacers with different thicknesses are experimentally assessed with regards to the pressure drop and velocity patterns at three heights in the channel close to the membrane z1 in fig 3 close to the observation window z3 in fig 3 and in the middle of the channel z2 in fig 3 the results reveal higher benefits for the ladder orientation compared to the normal orientation only for the case of the thinner spacer the pressure drop with the ladder orientation was 10 and 17 lower compared to the normal orientation respectively for the thickest c and thinnest a spacer the velocity maps in this study obtained using particle image velocimetry piv were in agreement with the particle deposition patterns described by neal et al 5 and radu et al 23 in general there was a distinct difference in velocity magnitude for the ladder orientation at three heights in the feed channel but minor differences with the normal orientation moreover the difference was less evident with the ladder orientation of spacer a than spacers b and c in addition the velocity magnitude was enhanced for spacer a in the ladder orientation over the channel height compared to the normal orientation the same is reported by neal et al 5 which is likely because they used a spacer with a similar geometry as spacer a in the ladder orientation of spacer b and c the lowest velocity was observed at the membrane side with attached transverse filaments and the highest at the membrane side without transverse filaments in addition the velocity magnitude at the membrane side is decreased with the increase in spacer thickness low velocity regions created at the membrane side with transverse filaments could have a high fouling potential because of low shear stresses in these areas on the other hand the high velocity at the membrane side without transverse filaments might not be beneficial because there is an optimal shear required to prevent fouling and values above this value will cause increased pressure drop without a significant effect on the fouling remediation in conclusion the advantage of ladder orientation is obtained when applied with thinner feed spacers rather than thicker ones while our results provide a reasonable estimation of the velocity maps which are taken at three different heights z1 z2 and z3 inside the feed channel at different moments asynchronously further experimental investigations would be required to quantify the effect of velocity in the z direction and associated shear stresses simultaneously with velocity in the x and y direction it would probably be possible to reconstruct 3d maps of mean velocities from the measured 2d values in this study however the reconstructed images would not always be relevant as they have been captured at different time steps the findings from this study can be exploited as a validation tool for numerical studies because of their high resolution 7 4 7 4 μm2 in addition they can be used to design an optimum feed spacer for spiral wound membrane modules of ro acknowledgements this research was made possible by the financial aid of vitens water company the netherlands which we gratefully acknowledge we would also like to thank mr martin verebes from delstar technologies inc for providing us with the required feed spacers we also

14312,feed spacer orientation affects the velocity pattern and pressure drop of spacer filled channels such as those encountered in spiral wound membrane swm modules of reverse osmosis ro however there are only limited numbers of experimental studies on this topic this study sets out to reveal more detailed information on the pressure drop and velocity patterns of spacer filled channels particle image velocimetry piv is used to provide high resolution velocity maps for three commercial feed spacers of different thicknesses at a flow attack angle of 45 and 90 the pressure drop is measured for the applied operational conditions re 250 results showed higher pressure losses a better mixing of flow a lower variation of temporal velocity and a smaller variation of velocity over the channel height in the orientation with a flow attack angle of 45 as compared to 90 the results presented here can be used to validate numerical studies determine the fouling sensitive regions in a

around the world for production of highly purified water 1 the coming decades are likely to witness an even greater use of ro for purification of fresh surface water as a consequence of the emergence of new types of micropollutants such as drug residues in fresh water which cannot be removed with conventional treatment plants for instance wong et al 2 3 reported that certain species are in danger of extinction in almost half of european and north american rivers and lakes because of the pollution of these ecosystems 4 the spiral wound membrane swm configuration is the most common configuration applied in nanofiltration nf and ro because it offers a good balance between ease of operation fouling control permeation rate and packing density 5 8 however a wider and more efficient application of swm configuration requires further improvements of the module s components such as the feed spacer 3 9 12 the feed spacer works as a supporting net and keeps two adjacent envelopes apart 13 14 it thereby provides a passing channel for feed water to move tangentially over the active layer of membrane sheets 15 in addition the feed spacer determines the hydraulic conditions of the feed channel such as the pressure drop and the time and location of initiation of the fouling thus any alteration in geometrical characteristics of the feed spacer results in the changing of hydraulic conditions of the swm module a slight increase in the thickness of the feed spacer from 28 to 34 mils is one of the few changes that feed spacers have undergone since the first design of swm modules of ro this improvement led to the manufacturing of low pressure ro modules at a constant production rate low pressure modules have a lower fouling tendency and pressure drop 16 and consequently consume less energy compared to modules composed of 28 mils 0 7 mm spacers such improvements are particularly attractive when fresh water is used as the feed for swm modules of ro because of a higher ratio of pressure losses to applied pressure in fresh water this higher ratio can be explained by the fact that the applied pressure in fresh water is lower than brackish water and seawater due to its lower osmotic pressure but the pressure drop along a clean swm module is the same for all types of water due to constant geometrical characteristics of the feed spacer and feed channel in commercial modules considering the amount of water produced by ro plants worldwide and high energy costs even a small improvement in the efficiency of the feed spacer can be translated into large savings or increased water output 17 therefore it is crucial to understand the effects of geometric modification of the feed spacer on hydraulic conditions of the feed channel such as the pressure drop and the velocity pattern while many studies have investigated the effect of feed spacer geometry on the energy losses and the hydrodynamics inside the feed channel only a few have addressed the effects of orientation the orientation of a feed spacer is determined by the flow attack angle α which is defined as the angle between the flow and hydrodynamic angle β of the spacer fig 1 the hydrodynamic angle is the interior angle relative to feed flow at the intersection of longitudinal and transverse filaments zimmere and kottke 15 studied effects of the flow attack angle α and the ratio of filaments length to channel height lm hch on the pressure drop mass transfer and mixing behavior of flow by physiochemical principles using ammonia in addition they used a tracer of ammonia for visualization of the flow and of the mass transfer inhomogeneity in the feed channel they concluded that a proper choice of the lm hch ratio and the flow attack angle orientation of the feed spacer results in overlapping of two basic flow types channel flow and corkscrew flow and creation of mixing by which a homogeneous mass transfer combined with a good residence time behavior at acceptable energy costs could be achieved geraldes et al 18 investigated the effect of lm hch ratio in a ladder type feed spacer and found that the value of the reynolds number at which the flow becomes unstable decreases due to the increase of inter filament distance between two transverse filaments santos et al 19 used experimental and numerical studies to determine the shear stress and the mass transfer at the membrane wall for ladder oriented spacers they introduced a modified friction factor and found that it is linearly related to the sherwood number based on this linear relation they suggested that the modified friction factor may be used for selecting the best spacers in terms of mass transfer efficiency additionally they showed that the flow structure is mainly affected by transverse filaments and that effects of longitudinal filaments are marginal li et al 20 used a cfd simulation to calculate the mass transfer and power consumption of non woven spacers at different lm hch ratio flow attack angle and hydrodynamic angle they concluded that there should be an optimum value for the lm hch ratio the hydrodynamic angle and the flow attack angle koutsou et al 21 performed experimental and numerical simulation at a typical reynolds number for ro 50 re 200 they investigated the effect of both reynolds re and schmidt sc numbers on the sherwood sh number in spacer filled channels by changing the lm hch ratio the flow attack angle and the hydrodynamic angle of spacers they demonstrated that the local mass transfer was lower in sparser spacer geometries but increased by increasing the hydrodynamic angle additionally they showed that the distribution of average mass transfer was similar to the corresponding distribution of shear stress at the channel walls while the previously mentioned researchers used spacers with a simplified cross section for numerical simulations more recent numerical studies e g studies done by bucs et al 22 and radu et al 23 have started to use spacers with closer geometrical similarities to those of commercial ones however it remains a challenge in numerical methods to use spacers with a geometry that exactly matches the geometry of commercial spacers and therefore the use of feed spacers with detailed geometry such as the commercial feed spacers remains limited to experimental methods schock and miquel 24 used various commercial spacers to measure the mass transfer and pressure drop they showed that spacer filled channels have higher mass transfer compared to empty channels over the same range of reynolds numbers albeit at the increased pressure drop da costa et al 25 studied the effect of spacer filament orientation on the flux enhancement in ultrafiltration membranes they found a maximum flux for a flow attack angle of 40 45 in another study 26 they used dye injection and microbubbles to visualize the effects of the spacer s configuration on the flow pattern of spacer filled channels they showed that in spacers with a smaller flow attack angle the flow is more widely spread in the xy plane fig 1 neal et al 5 investigated the orientation effects of commercial feed spacers on particle deposition they used a spacer with a geometry similar to the standard 28 mil feed spacer used in most swm modules of ro albeit in combination with a microfiltration membrane they 5 linked the deposition patterns of particles to the orientation of feed spacer and the non uniform shape of the filaments in commercial spacers while numerical studies enhance our understanding of hydraulic conditions of spacer filled channels at relatively low costs and risks compared to experimental methods they may be associated with challenges such as matching the geometry of the modeled feed spacer with commercial ones and an accurate verification and validation of numerical modules as a result it is recommended 27 28 to use direct non invasive high resolution experimental methods such as particle image velocimetry piv gimmelshtein and semiat 29 used piv for investigation of the liquid flow in the spacer filled channel in the velocity ranges from 0 06 to 1 3 m s they showed that the bulk of fluid flows in a straight line from inlet to outlet with only small deviations near the filaments willems et al 28 investigated the fluid velocity profiles of water and water air mixture in spacer filled channels they found that liquid flows mainly parallel to the spacers filaments and therefore the direction of flow changed 90 over the height of the channel the disagreement of their results with results of gimmelshtein and semiat 29 was due to the fact that the latter researchers used a spacer which was 20 thinner than the channel height and thus created an empty space in the channel height additionally the piv results obtained by gimmelshtein and semiat indicate that they may have measured the velocity only in the empty part of the channel haidari et al 11 compared the flow pattern of an empty channel with a spacer filled channel using piv they showed that the flow in the empty channel was in a straight line from inlet to outlet and in the spacer filled channel which was in agreement with the results of willems et al 28 in addition they showed that the low velocity regions were in agreement with the fouling sites detected by other researchers the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of orientation of commercial feed spacers on the fluid flow and the pressure drop three different spacers were considered each at two orientations normal orientation and ladder orientation fig 1 the effect of orientation on the pressure drop of the same spacers was investigated a short description of the piv technique is given in the experimental part of this article the detailed description of the technique is provided by adrian et al 30 the effect of the spacers orientation on the spatial and temporal velocity variations was studied at three heights of the feed channel finally the flow patterns were compared with fouling sites mentioned by previous studies with the objective of linking the flow pattern with the fouling 2 experimental the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 a suspension with fluorescent particles 02 flows through a pump 03 and a mass flow meter 04 to the flow cells 05 the pressure drop over the flow cell is measured by means of a differential pressure transducer 06 the values from the pressure transmitter and from the mass flow meter are used to determine the friction factor simultaneously velocities are measured as the laser 08 emits two light pulses that illuminate a well defined plane and have a short time interval synchronized with a high speed camera 09 that takes two images 11 the captured frames are used to determine the variations of temporal and spatial velocity inside the channel using commercial software davis 7 2 a detailed description of the setup can be found in a previous study 11 the curvature effects of swm modules on the flow can be neglected because of the small channel height in these modules 18 19 in comparison with the radius therefore it is a common practice to use flat flow cells to study hydraulic conditions of thin spacer filled channels such as those of swm modules of ro the flow cell used in this study l 260 mm w 85 mm h 55 mm included an embedded flow channel l 200 mm and w 40 mm for the membrane coupon trisep amc1 and a spacer the height of the flow channel is changed according to the spacer thickness by using plastic shims the experiments were conducted without the permeate production as the ratio of permeate in ro is small compared to the cross flow velocity the non woven commercial feed spacers delstar technologies inc in this study were made of polypropylene without any further modifications the geometric specifications of these spacers are given in table 1 values of the porosity and hydraulic diameter are respectively calculated by using eq 1 26 and eq 2 26 27 1 ε 1 π d f 2 2 l m h s p sin β 2 d h 4 ε 2 h c h 1 ε s v s p sv sp represents the specific surface of the feed spacer that can be calculated by dividing the feed spacer surface to volume the definition of other parameters and symbols is mentioned in the beginning of this article the same spacer is used at two different orientations the orientation with the flow attack angle of 45 which is common in swm modules of ro and here referred to as the normal orientation and the orientation with the flow attack angle of 90 which is not usual in swm modules of ro and will be referred to as the ladder orientation experiments are done at constant temperature 1 errors from the average temperature oc and different flow rates different flow rates were required to determine the dependency of the friction factor ctd on the reynolds number eq 3 3 c t d 2 ρ u a v e 2 δ p l d h a r e h n the dependency of the friction factor on the reynolds number can be used to determine the flow conditions of the channel determining the power n of the reynolds number in the definition of the friction factor in eq 3 gives a better understanding of the flow conditions in the feed channel a lower value of n indicates a higher state of flow disturbance in the channel da costa et al 26 achieved n values between 0 16 0 34 for different spacers at velocities that varied between 0 27 2 91 m s a is a constant which is determined by geometry of the spacer and the channel the definition used for the reynolds number here is equivalent to the one used by schock and miquel 24 and fimbres weihs and wiley 27 31 eq 4 4 r e h ρ u a v e d h μ the hydraulic reynolds number is determined as a function of average velocity of the spacer filled channel eq 5 and the channel height hch 5 u a v e q a e f f q a ε q w h c h ε u s u p ε other typical definitions for the reynolds number used in the literature are the channel reynolds number 32 and the cylinder reynolds number 8 the channel and cylinder reynolds number make use of the average velocity in the empty channel usup in eq 5 respectively in combination with channel height and filament diameter the calculation of average velocity eq 5 is done with a single average filament thickness value while the thickness of a manufactured filament in commercial spacers varies over its length the state of flow can also be determined by defining the relation between the pressure drop and the power of average velocity in the main direction of flow m eq 6 6 δ p k u a v e m it was suggested 33 34 that m should be around one for laminar flow and around 1 75 for turbulent however in turbulent flow the reynolds number re is far above the reynolds number occurring in the swm modules of ro therefore as it has been suggested 27 35 it is better to talk about the disturbance inside the flow as eddies rather than turbulence the velocity in the piv experiments is determined by capturing two frames that are taken at about 100 mm from the inlet and 15 mm from each edge of the cell in order to limit the effects of boundaries entrance edges and exit on the flow and to ensure a fully developed flow the flow along the channel is traced by using fluorescent particles with a mean diameter of 10 μm and a density of 1 19 g cm3 the calculated stokes number of particles was around 5 10 3 for the thinnest spacer used 28 mil spacer 0 71 mm spacer and thus tracing accuracy errors were below 1 36 fluorescence was used in combination with an optical filter to improve the quality of images the time interval between two pulses two frames was adjusted to the particles displacement in order to reduce loss of particle images within the interrogation window from the first frame to the second frame 11 an interrogation window or a sub window is an area smaller than the area of a captured frame here 7 4 7 4 μm2 from which information is obtained related to the most probable displacement of the particle pattern in a short time interval the piv measurements were performed at three different heights in the feed channel separately close to the camera z3 in the middle of the channel z2 and far from the camera or close to the membrane sheet at the bottom of the feed channel z1 the whole depth of the channel was illuminated because the thickness of the laser sheet light 2 mm was greater than the thickness of the feed channel 0 7 mm that is a common situation in μpiv 28 and can be solved by fixing the focus of the camera at a specific distance from the lens and moving the object 28 37 in this study moving the flow cell was not an option and therefore the camera was moved on a translation stage 50 μm in each step the camera was initially placed such that particles in the middle of the channel and close to the membrane were barely in focus z3 in fig 3 then the camera was moved to the subsequent positions z1 z2 in fig 3 with a translating stage the camera s depth of field in this setup was about 0 14 mm at each depth 50 pairs of images 100 frames were taken for a specific flow a instantaneous velocity map is calculated for each pair of frames these 50 instantaneous velocity maps are used to compare the velocities inside the feed channels over time temporal velocity an average is calculated from these 50 instantaneous velocity maps averaged spatial velocity profile and is used to study the spatial variations of the velocity inside the feed channel 11 3 results and discussions 3 1 pressure drop and friction losses fig 4 illustrates the dependency of pressure drop δp on average velocity uave and dependency of friction factor ctd on hydraulic reynolds number reh in parallel to piv measurements each point in fig 4 represents an average of at least 450 measurements the same feed flow range 1 4 16 0 l h was applied to the spacers and therefore each feed spacer is operated at a slightly different average velocity range the range of average velocity in spacers c was slightly lower than values commonly used in experimental studies for ro however these values are interesting for low salinity water purification in which water permeation could be relatively significant as shown in fig 4a the pressure drop over the feed channel is expressed in bars m while the spacers used in the experiments were only 20 cm long the conversion from 20 cm to one meter is done linearly as it often happens in the practice and it is intentionally expressed in bars m to be able to compare the achieved results with results from practice for instance the pressure drop in an ro pressure vessel is calculated by multiplying the number of elements in a pressure vessel by 0 2 bars which is the pressure drop over one element drives with an average velocity of 0 1 m s it is worth mentioning that common spiral wound ro elements are typically one meter long and include spacers with characteristics the same as spacer anormal the common average velocity in these elements is about 0 1 0 3 m s comparing the results from fig 4a with the practical results and results from literature 38 shows that the measured pressure drop represents the actual values in the practice fig 4a shows that for the experimental conditions in this study the pressure drop differs notably only in two orientations of the spacer a and as expected the pressure drop is lower with the ladder orientation additionally fig 4a shows that apparently the pressure drop decreases with increasing spacer thickness however it is difficult to draw such a conclusion based only on the presented data because the spacers do not change merely in thickness but also in geometric characterizations such as mesh length hydraulic diameter and porosity the best fitted values for dependency of the velocity on pressure drop are illustrated in table 2 considering only the m values the flow is more similar to a stokes flow in the ladder orientation than in the normal orientation in addition the flow with spacer c is more similar to a stokes flow than other spacers the n values which are obtained from the best fitted data of fig 4b do not match the flow conditions between the two orientations as mentioned earlier however the n values confirm the fact that the flow with spacer c appears more stokesian than with the two other spacers 3 2 the actual velocity fields determined by piv this section presents the spatial and temporal velocity maps obtained by piv in contrast to the average velocity eq 5 which is normally expressed as a single value the piv results are shown in the form of velocity fields or velocity maps piv provides information about the velocity development at a particular point in time temporal velocity a instantaneous spatial velocity profile is created by measuring the velocity of all the points in the camera s field of view at a particular time step averaging all instantaneous spatial velocity profiles results in the averaged spatial velocity profile following the line of former studies the term average velocity refers to the theoretically inferred velocity at the feed channel inlet eq 5 and without considering whether the value is fully developed the flow becomes fully developed at some distance downstream of the inlet which is called the entrance length the entrance length in empty rectangular channels depends on the aspect ratio defined as the ratio of the channel height to the channel width 39 and is rather small for the setup used in this study about 2 17 mm it is however challenging to calculate the entrance length in spacer filled channels piv measurements are performed at some distance from the inlet to avoid effects of the entrance length figs 5 7 illustrate averaged spatial velocity patterns of the ladder and normal orientation in the middle of the channel for an average velocity of 0 1 m s with spacers a and b and 0 08 m s with spacer c fig 8 illustrates instantaneous variations of the velocity at a particular point inside a mesh 3 2 1 spatial velocity patterns 3 2 1 1 velocity at the middle of the channel height fig 5 shows averaged spatial velocity profiles for two examined orientations of each spacer at the middle of the channel z2 in fig 3 the zones with velocity close to zero above the filaments can be used as an indication that the images are taken at the middle part of the channel however there is a slightly different scenario in c1 and c2 respectively the ladder orientation and normal orientation of spacer c long arrows which indicate high velocity regions appear on top of the filaments mainly close to the nodes of the spacer on the right side of the meshes this is the result of the non uniform shape of filaments over their length in the commercial feed spacer which is slightly thinner at the places with higher velocity than other parts at the thinner part the filament is slightly out of the camera s focus and therefore does not measure the velocity exactly on the filament s surface this shows that the enhanced geometric characterizations introduced to the numerical studies done by bucs et al 22 and radu et al 23 is very close to the actual flow behavior as it occurs in a feed channel filled with commercial feed spacers additionally fig 5 shows that the flow in the ladder orientation type 1 is in a straight line from the inlet to the outlet while in the normal orientation the bulk flows along the filaments close to it local averaged spatial velocities change from very low values up to more than two times the average velocity in some areas the difference between the low and high velocity regions is greater in the ladder orientation than in the normal orientation comparing different spacers velocity values with spacer b1 are highest reaching almost 0 26 m s in some places in the ladder orientation a low velocity region is formed downstream of the filaments this region differs slightly from the particle deposition area interpreted as a region with low velocity described by neal et al 5 but it was in close agreement with the results of particle deposition achieved by radu et al 23 fig 08 in their work neal et al 5 used a spacer with the same geometric characteristics as spacer a and observed that particles were deposited on the microfiltration membrane at some distance from the filaments and not directly at the downstream area this no deposition area directly downstream of the filaments is explained by the work of cao et al 40 who showed that relatively strong eddy currents are present in this area the difference regarding the presence of the no deposition zone directly behind the transverse filament between this study and the study done by neal et al 5 could be explained by the fact that they used higher flow rates re 400 than in this study re 200 notably the velocity magnitude downstream of filaments with the ladder orientation is not uniform along the entire filament s length which is probably the consequence of the filament s cross sectional shape the highest velocity downstream of a filament is observed at locations where filaments bulge toward the flow the acceleration effect was more apparent over the swelled part of transverse filaments in thicker spacers than thinner spacers in the normal orientation water passes over the filaments attached to the membrane and under the filaments attached to the observation window and is mixed in the following mesh this is repeated for every mesh this complex mixing behavior of the flow together with the particular geometry of each spacer thickness and porosity and filaments makes it difficult to give a general prediction of the lowest and highest velocity areas for instance in the channel with spacer a the lowest velocity region is observed in that half of the mesh where the water passes over a filament to enter the mesh and under the adjacent filament to leave the mesh right half of the meshes in fig 5 and the highest velocity is at the other half of the mesh where water passes under a filament to enter the mesh and over a filament to leave the mesh with spacer b the highest velocity occurs directly downstream of the filaments at the entering parts of the mesh and the lowest at the confluence of these streams with spacer c the lowest velocity occurs in the diagonal part of the mesh the upstream node of the mesh where both flows exit the mesh is the only point in all spacers with a similar low velocity region 3 2 1 2 velocity pattern at different channel heights the velocity patterns as described in the previous section fig 5 are only valid for the situation in which the camera is focused on the middle part of the channel z2 in fig 3 fig 6 shows averaged spatial velocity patterns at the membrane side z1 in fig 3 on which the transverse filaments are placed the operational conditions were the same as the operational conditions at the middle of the channel velocity magnitudes of the ladder orientation are significantly lower over the membrane side than the middle part of the channel in addition the velocity decrease in ladder orientation over the membrane compared to the middle of the channel is greater with thicker spacers in the normal orientation the velocity close to the membrane is approximately the same as in the middle of the channel the flow direction on the other hand differs clearly from the flow direction at the middle of the channel in both orientations in the normal orientation the flow is along the direction of attached filaments in the ladder orientation the flow direction close to the membrane side is a function of the spacer thickness for instance the flow direction with spacer a is approximately the same as in the middle of the channel from the inlet to the outlet with the largest deviation downstream of the filaments these areas are referred to as the particle deposition area by neal et al 5 the magnitude of the velocity is respectively 44 and 57 lower for spacer b and c compared to spacer a fig 7 includes the statistical representation of figs 5 and 6 and averaged spatial velocity profile at the front part of the channel z1 in fig 3 i e each box shows the velocity variations over the total field of view at a specific height z1 z2 and z3 from fig 3 the median average and outliers are shown respectively with a straight line empty circle inside the box and filled circles fig 7 shows that the averaged spatial velocity is higher at the side of the channel without the transverse filaments z3 than in the middle of the channel z2 in the ladder orientation for the same conditions the velocity magnitude at the observation window z3 was on average higher from 3 6 in spacer a to 54 in spacer b in ladder orientation than in normal orientation the velocity magnitude at the membrane side z1 was lower from 28 in spacer a to 68 in spacer c in ladder orientation compared to normal orientation at the middle of the channel z2 the velocity magnitude was lower from 5 in spacer a to 27 in spacer c in ladder orientation than in the normal orientation the lower velocity at the membrane side of the ladder orientation can be explained by considering the role of transverse filaments transverse filaments accelerate the flow at the opposite half of the channel as they are narrowing the flow path in the normal orientation both filament layers contribute to flow acceleration i e there are accelerated flows at the top and bottom of the membrane because the flow attack angle is 45 top and bottom flows cross each other and a proper mixing of flow occurs in the feed channel in the ladder orientation where the flow attack angle is 90 only transverse filaments contribute to flow acceleration i e there is no acceleration due to filaments parallel to the flow on the side that transverse filaments are attached to therefore the flow becomes more isolated between two successive filaments and low velocity areas are formed 3 2 2 temporal velocity variation fig 8 shows variations of the velocity in time for the point e in the center of a mesh for three channel heights the median average and outliers are shown respectively with a straight line empty circle inside the box and filled circles in general the velocity variations for the normal orientation are less than with the ladder orientation which resembles the averaged spatial profiles as shown in fig 7 as expected the variation in time is greater than in space since the spatial variations are based on time averaged velocities fig 8 illustrates that the magnitude and variation of the temporal velocity is clearly lower in ladder orientation compared to the normal orientation particularly in spacers b and c remarkably with the ladder orientation the variation of velocity is higher particularly with spacer b and c in the middle of the channel z2 compared to the observation window z3 and at the membrane side z1 this is probably the result of a clear separation in the flow magnitude at the top high velocity and bottom low velocity parts of the flow channel the high velocity variations could be the result of vortex shedding in the lee side of filaments or due to the existence of pulsating flow as the consequence of acceleration and deceleration of flow when moving from one mesh to the other one in either case high velocity variation in time is considered beneficial with respect to fouling prevention and concentration polarization destabilization however the high velocity variations observed with the ladder orientation occur in the middle of the channel while fouling and concentration polarization tend to happen on the membrane sides the benefit could therefore be minimal in this case in the normal orientation the velocity has the same magnitude at the top and bottom parts of the channel because both layers of filaments contribute to the flow acceleration in the channel 4 conclusions in this study the impacts of two orientations of three spacers with different thicknesses are experimentally assessed with regards to the pressure drop and velocity patterns at three heights in the channel close to the membrane z1 in fig 3 close to the observation window z3 in fig 3 and in the middle of the channel z2 in fig 3 the results reveal higher benefits for the ladder orientation compared to the normal orientation only for the case of the thinner spacer the pressure drop with the ladder orientation was 10 and 17 lower compared to the normal orientation respectively for the thickest c and thinnest a spacer the velocity maps in this study obtained using particle image velocimetry piv were in agreement with the particle deposition patterns described by neal et al 5 and radu et al 23 in general there was a distinct difference in velocity magnitude for the ladder orientation at three heights in the feed channel but minor differences with the normal orientation moreover the difference was less evident with the ladder orientation of spacer a than spacers b and c in addition the velocity magnitude was enhanced for spacer a in the ladder orientation over the channel height compared to the normal orientation the same is reported by neal et al 5 which is likely because they used a spacer with a similar geometry as spacer a in the ladder orientation of spacer b and c the lowest velocity was observed at the membrane side with attached transverse filaments and the highest at the membrane side without transverse filaments in addition the velocity magnitude at the membrane side is decreased with the increase in spacer thickness low velocity regions created at the membrane side with transverse filaments could have a high fouling potential because of low shear stresses in these areas on the other hand the high velocity at the membrane side without transverse filaments might not be beneficial because there is an optimal shear required to prevent fouling and values above this value will cause increased pressure drop without a significant effect on the fouling remediation in conclusion the advantage of ladder orientation is obtained when applied with thinner feed spacers rather than thicker ones while our results provide a reasonable estimation of the velocity maps which are taken at three different heights z1 z2 and z3 inside the feed channel at different moments asynchronously further experimental investigations would be required to quantify the effect of velocity in the z direction and associated shear stresses simultaneously with velocity in the x and y direction it would probably be possible to reconstruct 3d maps of mean velocities from the measured 2d values in this study however the reconstructed images would not always be relevant as they have been captured at different time steps the findings from this study can be exploited as a validation tool for numerical studies because of their high resolution 7 4 7 4 μm2 in addition they can be used to design an optimum feed spacer for spiral wound membrane modules of ro acknowledgements this research was made possible by the financial aid of

models have been used to evaluate membrane fouling mechanism 3 6 13 24 in our previous study 26 we researched the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater including etodolac active matter using a hybrid ozonation anmbr system in this study which constitutes the second part of our previous work it was aimed to investigate the effects of membrane modules on the anmbr system performance and membrane fouling by flux modelling and membrane autopsy analysis in detail a laboratory scale anmbr system treating pharmaceutical industry wastewater was operated by using the flat sheet and the hollow fiber membrane the membrane autopsy analyses were also conducted on the membranes surfaces of clean fouled and stripped of cake layer after 557 and 168 days of operation period the membranes were analyzed by sem eds ft ir zeta potential contact angle confocal microscope imaging and optic profilometer measurements the sludge deposited on membrane surface was also analyzed by total organic carbon toc and eps composing of protein and carbohydrate analyses the membrane fouling mechanisms were intensively investigated using the combined adsorption fouling models with sigma plot program unlike resistance in series model 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr system and operation a lab scale anmbr system consisted of a flat sheet and hollow fiber membrane was used in the study figure s1 the sludge feed was obtained from up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb in a brewery factory anmbr has a 4 l volume and was operated with ph 7 temperature 35 c continuous stirred and theoretical infinite sludge age the sludge samples were taken from the reactor only for analysis purposes the pre ozonation step was performed with a lab scale venturi injection system 5 l cylinder made of stainless steel at 35 c ozone was generated by an ozone generator using atmospheric oxygen degremont technologies capable of producing 4 g h ozone 2 g h ozone was applied to the wastewater during 60 min two commercial mf membranes were used in the experiments as fm mp005 flat sheet nadir filtration germany and p5s hollow fiber zena company czech republic the flat sheet membrane was placed to a kestamid frame module and then immersed to reactor after a hollow fiber membrane module was prepared using fibers total 70 having length of 20 cm and radius of 0 155 mm the hollow fiber membranes were converted to hydrophilic from hydrophobic by passing water ethyl alcohol ratio of 1 2 during 20 min it was afterward immersed to the reactor the properties of membranes are given in table 1 in addition cake formation and fouling on the membranes surface was minimized by periodic sparging with nitrogen gas from a nitrogen generator in the same conditions for both membranes uhp nitrogen generator model ng2081 hc nitrogen gas flow rate was set to 800 ml min during to sparging the transmembrane pressure was kept constant at 200 mbar throughout all the experiments the wastewater used in the experiments was supplied from a pharmaceutical factory producing etodolac active matter gebze turkey it contains a total chemical oxygen demand cod of 20000 23000 mg l etodolac of 50 238 mg l so4 2 of 4250 5600

elements were also added to the feed wastewater the anmbr operation was divided in three stages throughout 725 days stage 1 for 390 stage 2 for 167 days and stage 3 for 168 days the main properties of each period are shown fig 1 influent values of wastewater in each stage were calculated according to dilution factor based on the real wastewater the steady state values of total suspended solids tss were as follows in each stage tss values were 20 8 2 50 4 2 6 and 47 7 4 6 g l in the stages 1 2 and 3 respectively total volatile suspended solids tvss values remained stable during the stage 1 and 2 5 7 1 4 and 4 5 1 4 g l respectively and showed a slight decrease at the stage 3 3 2 0 6 g l the corresponding mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mixed liquor suspended solids mlvss mlss ratios at each stages were 63 3 61 6 and 62 2 respectively which was the same range with that of the seed sludge the high difference between ratios tvss tss and mlvss mlss originated from the high concentration

originated from protein or carbohydrate of eps fractions the measurement of eps on the membrane cake layer were performed according to procedure given by imer koseoglu et al 31 the total protein epsp and carbohydrate epsc fractions of the eps were measured using methods suggested by lowry et al 32 and dubois et al 33 respectively proteins and carbohydrates were analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer pg instruments t60u at a wavelength of 750 nm and 480 nm respectively 2 3 instrumental analyses 2 3 1 sem edx the fouling on the membrane surface was evaluated by sem surface

bio cake layer on membrane were examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope nikon c2 japan 2 3 6 contact angle measurement the contact angle values of clean and fouled membranes were determined to estimate the hydrophilicity the measurements of contact angles on membranes were carried out with a goniometer ksv cam 101 finland using the sessile drop method membranes were dried during 24 h in a desiccator before measuring contact angles 2 μl of distilled water was dropped onto a dry membrane surface with a micro syringe the measurements were repeated five times on membranes

the anmbr are shown in fig 2 in the stage 1 which flat sheet membrane was used the flux tended to decrease continuously for first 80 days from 3 1 l m2 h to 1 1 l m2 h then the flux was almost stable and found as 0 9 l m2 h at the end of this stage in the stage 2 the pre ozonation process was applied to wastewater before feeding the anmbr the flat sheet membrane used in the stage 1 was cleaned physically and initial flux increased to 1 8 l m2 h however the flux decreased to 0 8 l m2 h at the end of the stage 2 although the initial flux of the hollow fiber membrane used in the stage 3 was higher than that of the flat sheet membrane a different trend in the flux decrease was observed the flux sharply decreased from 4 4 l m2 h to 2 l m2 h in the first day the flux was found as 0 31 l m2 h at 668th day the flux increased barely to 0 66 l m2 h with physical cleaning besides the flux further decreased to 0 2 l m2 h at the stage 3 the hollow fiber membrane was chemically cleaned using an ultrasound bath with 0 4 hypochlorite acid for 1 h and then washed with distilled water nevertheless the flux did not increase as the hollow fiber membrane irreversibly fouled 3 2 flux modelling the adsorption fouling model results for membranes are given in table 3 and table 4 the adsorption fouling mechanism on the flat sheet membrane occurred simultaneously with cake adsorption intermediate adsorption and complete adsorption table 3 the dominant fouling mechanisms on the flat sheet membrane were determined as intermediate adsorption based on normalized mass transfer coefficients table 3 the dominant mechanism was cake layer formation at a cod concentration of 2500 mg l between days 1 39 and 5000 mg l 39 154 days after the 155th day with 7500 mg l of cod intermediate adsorption was determined as dominant fouling mechanism during the 402 days it can be said that dissolved organics and inorganics for the flat sheet membrane caused to cake layer formation at lower cod values after cod concentration of 5000 mg l foulants on the cake layer clogged membrane pore entrances due to particles bridging the variations in the mfi values also supported the fouling mechanism for different cod values in general mfi is used to evaluate membrane fouling based on cake formation firstly mfi value increased with an increase in cod from 2500 mg l to 5000 mg l then mfi values showed similar trend with normalized cake adsorption mass transfer coefficients and membrane fouling could be occurred with effect of the bridging of cake layer the cake adsorption mechanism for hollow fiber membrane was found as predominant during the first 40 days of operation table 4 then the intermediate adsorption was found as the effective fouling mechanism until the end of 168 days as a result it can be said that the adsorption increased on the hollow fiber membrane surface and the intermediate fouling continued simultaneously as well as the flat sheet membrane a similar trend took placed on the hollow fiber membrane in terms of mfi and the cake adsorption mass transfer coefficients values we think that the pollutants accumulated on surface and the pores of the hollow membrane caused to flux decline dramatically than those of the flat sheet membrane because the flux was almost not obtained although both membranes have same pore diameter the hollow fiber membrane was more fouled relatively than the flat sheet membrane flux was almost not achieved with hollow fiber membrane at the end of stage 3 the mechanism of membrane fouling for both membranes will be clarified in detail in the section 3 3 3 3 membrane fouling characterization in anmbr 3 3 1 sem edx optical profilometer and contact angle analyses the sem images of membranes are shown in fig 3 according to fig 3 the cake layer on the flat sheet membrane was formed much more than that on the hollow fiber membrane after stripping of cake layer from surface of membranes the thickness of cake layer was less observed on the hollow fiber membrane in comparison with flat sheet membrane as we mentioned in the previous study 26 sulfite cl na and ca were high amounts in the wastewater these ions were detected more amounts on fouled hollow fiber membrane surface according to results of performed edx analysis to identify the inorganic scaling on the cake layer figure s2 cl s na ca mg and fe on the flat sheet membrane were removed more effectively with stripping than those on the hollow fiber membrane it can be said that inorganic scaling based on ions precipitates on the membrane surface influenced significantly fouling of the hollow fiber membrane contact angle values of membranes were measured for determination of hydrophilic character of the membrane surface the contact angle values for both clean membranes ө 35 37 were close to each other the contact angle of flat sheet and hollow fiber membrane was increased due to fouling occurred on membrane surface 59 5 for flat sheet membrane and 62 4 for hollow fiber membrane however the hollow fiber membrane was found as more hydrophobic ө 54 4 than the flat sheet membrane ө 44 5 after stripping of cake layer the surface roughness of membranes was determined using optical profilometer optical profilometer images of membranes are shown in fig 4 the surface roughness parameters obtained from images are given in table 5 rrms values of both clean membranes were found to be close to each other 0 369 μm and 0 339 μm however rrms values of the fouled flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes were 5 093 μm and 3 014 μm respectively rrms values for clean and stripped hollow fiber membranes were found as nearly close to each other when we evaluated the results of sem and optical profilometer analyses it is clear that a thicker cake layer was deposited on the flat sheet membrane in considering the anmbr was operated for 557 days increase in cake formation on the flat sheet membrane was normal although the hollow fiber membranes have some advantages such as a high packing density and a large surface area the spaces within the hollow fiber membranes are more clogged because of insufficient hydraulic shear on each fiber 1 cake layer formation on both membrane types was clear according to findings of sem and optical profilometer however intermediate adsorption was found as effective fouling mechanism on both membranes in general the cake formation for both membranes was effective during the first 155 days and 40 days respectively table 3 and table 4 it can be concluded that the pore blockage was due to the cake layer formation for both membranes in addition cake layer occurred on the membrane surface caused increase in hydrophobicity of both membranes 3 3 2 ft ir analyses ft ir images for membranes are given in fig 5 on the clean flat sheet membrane 1577 cm 1 and 1485 cm 1 are aromatic bands for pes membrane in addition the weak bonds between 1407 and 1412 cm 1 are due to the stretching vibration of so2 groups the peaks at 1320 and 1295 and 1150 cm 1 show asymmetric oso bonds and symmetric oso bonds respectively the peaks at 1010 cm 1 and 1100 cm 1 can be attributed to groups of symmetric and asymmetric coc the peaks at 1639 cm 1 and 1400 cm 1 on the fouled flat sheet membrane indicates the proteins that were one of the components of bond eps amide i and amide ii respectively 37 coc stretching carbohydrates and carbohydrates like substances occur at 1000 1200 cm 1 4 11 the peak observed at 1070 cm 1 on the fouled membrane may be an indication of carbohydrates although the peaks at 1639 and 1070 cm 1 were disappeared the peak at 1400 cm 1 indicating the protein secondary structure amides ii was not disappeared with stripping of cake layer in the hollow fiber module the peaks at 2970 2800 cm 1 are characteristic for polypropylene membranes the peaks at 1480 1380 cm 1 can be attributed to groups of symmetric and asymmetric groups of coc 38 as seen in the fig 5 2 the peaks on the fouled and stripped hollow fiber membrane were found almost similar the peak at 1546 and 1651 cm 1 on the fouled membrane may be due to presence of amide ii and amide i respectively 2 the peaks were not disappeared with stripping of cake layer the peak at 1147 cm 1 was disappeared on the spectrum of the stripped membrane this indicates that carbohydrates and carbohydrates like substances were removed with stripping of cake layer as a result while some protein compounds could not be removed with stripping of cake layer carbohydrates were stripped easily from both membranes 3 3 3 clsm images clsm image analysis technique was used to evaluate thickness of the bio cake layer on the fouled membranes fig 6 the biofilm layer reached to 450 μm and around 250 μm on the flat sheet membrane and hollow fiber membrane respectively after stripping the thickness of biofilm layer of fouled membranes decreased to around 150 μm although the biofilm thickness on both stripped membranes was found almost close to each other it can be said that the stripping on the flat sheet membrane was more effective based on the thickness of biofilm layer on the fouled membranes 3 3 4 eps toc and zeta potential analyses the values of eps and toc concentrations on the cake layer of both membranes are given in fig 7 epsp were 52 mg gss and 10 mg gss and epsc were 19 mg gss and 5 mg gss for the flat sheet and the hollow fiber membrane respectively it means the formation of thicker bio cake on the flat sheet membrane because production of extracellular polymeric substances will firmly anchor the cell to the membrane surface and more eps is found in older and thicker biofilms for sludge cake on both membranes proteins were determined as predominant components the ratios of proteins to carbohydrates in eps were 2 7 and 2 for sludge cake on the flat sheet and hollow fiber membrane respectively it is known that proteins and carbohydrates have hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties respectively therefore proteins show more affinity for sludge than carbohydrates due to their hydrophobicity 4 39 in addition positive charges of amino groups in proteins can decrease negative surface charge of sludge the proteins have a strong effect to form cake on the membrane surface depending on hydrophobicity and surface charge in addition toc values of cake layer on both fouled membranes were found as 18 4 mg l and 5 3 mg l respectively as seen from zeta potential results table 6 surface charge of both membranes decreased depending on fouling surface charge for the clean flat sheet membrane increased from 36 8 mv to 39 4 mv depending on fouling effect and it again had a negative charge after stripping of cake layer surface charge of the clean and fouled hollow fiber membranes was found as 75 8 mv and 33 4 mv respectively it can be said that proteins and other organic inorganic matters with positive charge were more effective on fouling of flat sheet membrane to summarize the protein fraction of eps and other organic matters with positive charge were more effective on the formation of cake layer on membrane surface increasing of the zeta potential value of clean membranes supported this idea especially increasing of zeta potential on the flat sheet membrane having higher p c ratio was found higher than the hollow fiber membrane according to the results of sem and optical profilometer thicker cake layer was deposited on the flat sheet membrane than the hollow fiber membrane although both membrane had negative surface charge after stripping of cake layer decreasing in zeta potential was more for the hollow fiber membrane 35 7 mv than the flat sheet membrane 20 4 mv based on the clean membranes in addition the peaks appeared on the ft ir spectra of the both fouled membranes showed amide i and amide ii proteins after stripping of cake layer although the peak indicating amides i was disappeared on the spectrum of flat sheet membrane the peaks indicating amides i and ii were not disappeared on the spectrum of hollow fiber membrane we think that protein fraction of eps was effective on both increasing of contact angle and zeta potential on the hollow fiber membrane as a result the fouling was more serious for hollow fiber membrane than flat sheet membrane this situation might be mainly due to impurities within the hollow fiber membranes pores that could not be removed with gas sparging effectively resulting in pore blocking fouling caused from pore blocking that is mostly irreversible was more effective than cake layer formation on the hollow fiber membrane 4 conclusions this study focused on the membrane fouling mechanisms of the flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes in the anmbr the membrane fouling was deeply evaluated by flux modelling and membrane autopsy studies the results show that flux modelling results were supported by membrane autopsy analyses such as sem optical profilometer and clsm the main findings and conclusions are as follows the cake layer formation and intermediate adsorption were found as effective fouling mechanisms for both membranes according to flux modelling the flux vanished dramatically in the hollow fiber membrane even though membrane was both physical and chemical cleaning although thickness of cake layer on the flat sheet membrane took placed higher than the hollow fiber membrane irreversible fouling was observed on the hollow fiber membrane in addition the clsm results showed that stripping was more effective on the flat sheet membrane based on the thickness of biofilm layer on the fouled membranes through the ft ir results the peaks indicating protein secondary structure amide i and carbohydrates and carbohydrates like substances disappeared on the flat sheet membrane

fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy 3 4 23 24 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm 3 4 23 and eps and smp on the cake sludge 4 22 also real or synthetic domestic wastewater was generally used in the studies given above there are some studies investigating treatment of real high strength industrial wastewaters such as pharmaceutical 25 26 kraft 3 palm oil mill 4 and cheese whey 27 28 in anmbrs in the literature in most of these works limited evaluations have been carried out about membrane fouling in addition only a few studies have conducted the treatment of real chemical synthesis based pharmaceutical wastewater with anmbr in the literature 26 29 ng et al 29 evaluated fouling with eps and smp measurements in an anmbr in some studies given above resistance in series models have been used to evaluate membrane fouling mechanism 3 6 13 24 in our previous study 26 we researched the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater including etodolac active matter using a hybrid ozonation anmbr system in this study which constitutes the second part of our previous work it was aimed to investigate the effects of membrane modules on the anmbr system performance and membrane fouling by flux modelling and membrane autopsy analysis in detail a laboratory scale anmbr system treating pharmaceutical industry wastewater was operated by using the flat sheet and the hollow fiber membrane the membrane autopsy analyses were also conducted on the membranes surfaces of clean fouled and stripped of cake layer after 557 and 168 days of operation period the membranes were analyzed by sem eds ft ir zeta potential contact angle confocal microscope imaging and optic profilometer measurements the sludge deposited on membrane surface was also analyzed by total organic carbon toc and eps composing of protein and carbohydrate analyses the membrane fouling mechanisms were intensively investigated using the combined adsorption fouling models with sigma plot program unlike resistance in series model 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr system and operation a lab scale anmbr system consisted of a flat sheet and hollow fiber membrane was used in the study figure s1 the sludge feed was obtained from up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb in a brewery factory anmbr has a 4 l volume and was operated with ph 7 temperature 35 c continuous stirred and theoretical infinite sludge age the sludge samples were taken from the reactor only for analysis purposes the pre ozonation step was performed with a lab scale venturi injection system 5 l cylinder made of stainless steel at 35 c ozone was generated by an ozone generator using atmospheric oxygen degremont technologies capable of producing 4 g h ozone 2 g h ozone was applied to the wastewater during 60 min two commercial mf membranes were used in the experiments as fm mp005 flat sheet nadir filtration germany and p5s hollow fiber zena company czech republic the flat sheet membrane was placed to a kestamid frame module and then immersed to reactor after a hollow fiber membrane module was prepared using fibers total 70 having length of 20 cm and radius of 0 155 mm the hollow fiber membranes were converted to hydrophilic from hydrophobic by passing water ethyl alcohol ratio of 1 2 during 20 min it was afterward immersed to the reactor the properties of membranes are given in table 1 in addition cake formation and fouling on the membranes surface was minimized by periodic sparging with nitrogen gas from a nitrogen generator in the same conditions for both membranes uhp nitrogen generator model ng2081 hc nitrogen gas flow rate was set to 800 ml min during to sparging the transmembrane pressure was kept constant at 200 mbar throughout all the experiments the wastewater used in the experiments was supplied from a pharmaceutical factory producing etodolac active matter gebze turkey it contains a total chemical oxygen demand cod of 20000 23000 mg l etodolac of 50 238 mg l so4 2 of 4250 5600

elements were also added to the feed wastewater the anmbr operation was divided in three stages throughout 725 days stage 1 for 390 stage 2 for 167 days and stage 3 for 168 days the main properties of each period are shown fig 1 influent values of wastewater in each stage were calculated according to dilution factor based on the real wastewater the steady state values of total suspended solids tss were as follows in each stage tss values were 20 8 2 50 4 2 6 and 47 7 4 6 g l in the stages 1 2 and 3 respectively total volatile suspended solids tvss values remained stable during the stage 1 and 2 5 7 1 4 and 4 5 1 4 g l respectively and showed a slight decrease at the stage 3 3 2 0 6 g l the corresponding mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mixed liquor suspended solids mlvss mlss ratios at each stages were 63 3 61 6 and 62 2 respectively which was the same range with that of the seed sludge the high difference between ratios tvss tss and mlvss mlss originated from the high concentration of cl and na of the raw wastewater the detailed information on the characteristic of raw wastewater and solid deposition in the reactor can be found in our previous paper 24 2 2 chemical analyses cod tss tvss ph so4 2 so3 2 cl tkn and po4 3 p were analyzed periodically in the system according to standard methods 30 etodolac was analyzed by an hplc uv method food gmbh jena analytik and consulting germany in our previous study 26 system performance for removal of etodolac cod so4 2 and so3 2 in anmbr was evaluated in detail the eps analyses were used to determine whether the cake layer fouling originated from protein or carbohydrate of eps fractions the measurement of eps on the membrane cake layer were performed according to procedure given by imer koseoglu et al 31 the total protein epsp and carbohydrate epsc fractions of the eps were measured using methods suggested by lowry et al 32 and dubois et al 33 respectively proteins and carbohydrates were analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer pg instruments t60u at a wavelength of 750 nm and 480 nm respectively 2 3 instrumental analyses 2 3 1 sem edx the fouling on the membrane surface was evaluated by sem surface morphologies of membranes were characterized by a sem equipped with an edx spectrometer fei quanta feg 200 sem usa membranes were coated with palladium gold 3 4 nm thick with quorum sc7620 ion sputtering equipment edx analyses were performed to determine for elements accumulated on cake layer sem images were taken at 10 000 magnifications 2 3 2 optical profilometer increase in surface roughness indicates the surface fouling of membrane surface roughness of membranes was measured using an optical profilometer zygo brand usa 150 μm bipolar downward scan was used and scan of samples

changes the surface functional groups of membranes was characterized using ft ir spectrometer perkin elmer spectrum 100 usa ft ir spectra was depicted at the range of 4000 400 cm 1 2 3 4 zeta potential the zeta potential of membrane surface analysis was used to identify membrane organic and inorganic fouling zeta potential measurements on membranes were performed at ph 7 using an electrokinetic measurement instrument anton paar surpass austria 3 m kcl was used as the electrolyte the value was determined as mv 2 3 5 clsm the biofilm layer thickness and live cell activities of bio cake layer on membrane were examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope nikon c2 japan 2 3 6 contact angle measurement the contact angle values of clean and fouled membranes were determined to estimate the hydrophilicity the measurements of contact angles on membranes were carried out with a goniometer ksv cam 101 finland using the sessile drop method membranes were dried during 24 h in a desiccator before measuring contact angles 2 μl of distilled water was dropped onto a dry membrane surface with a micro syringe the measurements were repeated five times on membranes and the average of the measurements was accepted as the contact angle value 2 3 7 toc in the toc analyses cake layer on the membrane was extracted by icp analyses procudere the measurement was performed using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph n japan 2 4 flux modelling j was modelled using the following eq 1 34 1 j μ r m δ p 2 2 c b α μ δ p t 1 2 eq 1 was expressed as j 1 α b t the regression calculations were performed using the sigma plot 9 01 systat software inc model program r2 and root mean squared error rmse values were used to compare the experimental and model results modified fouling index mfi was determined using eq 2 35 2 t v μ r m δ p c b α μ v 2 δ p a b and mfi were determined using calculation method given by turano et al 34 the combined adsorption fouling model were carried out as described in the study reported by bolton et al 36 the model equations are given in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux evaluation in anmbr system the flux variation in the anmbr are shown in fig 2 in the stage 1 which flat sheet membrane was used the flux tended to decrease continuously for first 80 days from 3 1 l m2 h to 1 1 l m2 h then the flux was almost stable and found as 0 9 l m2 h at the end of this stage in the stage 2 the pre ozonation process was applied to wastewater before feeding the anmbr the flat sheet membrane used in the stage 1 was cleaned physically and initial flux increased to 1 8 l m2 h however the flux decreased to 0 8 l m2 h at the end of the stage 2 although the initial flux of the hollow fiber membrane used in the stage 3 was higher than that of the flat sheet membrane a different trend in the flux decrease was observed the flux sharply decreased from 4 4 l m2 h to 2 l m2 h in the first day the flux was found as 0 31 l m2 h at 668th day the flux increased barely to 0 66 l m2 h with physical cleaning besides the flux further decreased to 0 2 l m2 h at the stage 3 the hollow fiber membrane was chemically cleaned using an ultrasound bath with 0 4 hypochlorite acid for 1 h and then washed with distilled water nevertheless the flux did not increase as the hollow fiber membrane irreversibly fouled 3 2 flux modelling the adsorption fouling model results for membranes are given in table 3 and table 4 the adsorption fouling mechanism on the flat sheet membrane occurred simultaneously with cake adsorption intermediate adsorption and complete adsorption table 3 the dominant fouling mechanisms on the flat sheet membrane were determined as intermediate adsorption based on normalized mass transfer coefficients table 3 the dominant mechanism was cake layer formation at a cod concentration of 2500 mg l between days 1 39 and 5000 mg l 39 154 days after the 155th day with 7500 mg l of cod intermediate adsorption was determined as dominant fouling mechanism during the 402 days it can be said that dissolved organics and inorganics for the flat sheet membrane caused to cake layer formation at lower cod values after cod concentration of 5000 mg l foulants on the cake layer clogged membrane pore entrances due to particles bridging the variations in the mfi values also supported the fouling mechanism for different cod values in general mfi is used to evaluate membrane fouling based on cake formation firstly mfi value increased with an increase in cod from 2500 mg l to 5000 mg l then mfi values showed similar trend with normalized cake adsorption mass transfer coefficients and membrane fouling could be occurred with effect of the bridging of cake layer the cake adsorption mechanism for hollow fiber membrane was found as predominant during the first 40 days of operation table 4 then the intermediate adsorption was found as the effective fouling mechanism until the end of 168 days as a result it can be said that the adsorption increased on the hollow fiber membrane surface and the intermediate fouling continued simultaneously as well as the flat sheet membrane a similar trend took placed on the hollow fiber membrane in terms of mfi and the cake adsorption mass transfer coefficients values we think that the pollutants accumulated on surface and the pores of the hollow membrane caused to flux decline dramatically than those of the flat sheet membrane because the flux was almost not obtained although both membranes have same pore diameter the hollow fiber membrane was more fouled relatively than the flat sheet membrane flux was almost not achieved with hollow fiber membrane at the end of stage 3 the mechanism of membrane fouling for both membranes will be clarified in detail in the section 3 3 3 3 membrane fouling characterization in anmbr 3 3 1 sem edx optical profilometer and contact angle analyses the sem images of membranes are shown in fig 3 according to fig 3 the cake layer on the flat sheet membrane was formed much more than that on the hollow fiber membrane after stripping of cake layer from surface of membranes the thickness of cake layer was less observed on the hollow fiber membrane in comparison with flat sheet membrane as we mentioned in the previous study 26 sulfite cl na and ca were high amounts in the wastewater these ions were detected more amounts on fouled hollow fiber membrane surface according to results of performed edx analysis to identify the inorganic scaling on the cake layer figure s2 cl s na ca mg and fe on the flat sheet membrane were removed more effectively with stripping than those on the hollow fiber membrane it can be said that inorganic scaling based on ions precipitates on the membrane surface influenced significantly fouling of the hollow fiber membrane contact angle values of membranes were measured for determination of hydrophilic character of the membrane surface the contact angle values for both clean membranes ө 35 37 were close to each other the contact angle of flat sheet and hollow fiber membrane was increased due to fouling occurred on membrane surface 59 5 for flat sheet membrane and 62 4 for hollow fiber membrane however the hollow fiber membrane was found as more hydrophobic ө 54 4 than the flat sheet membrane ө 44 5 after stripping of cake layer the surface roughness of membranes was determined using optical profilometer optical profilometer images of membranes are shown in fig 4 the surface roughness parameters obtained from images are given in table 5 rrms values of both clean membranes were found to be close to each other 0 369 μm and 0 339 μm however rrms values of the fouled flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes were 5 093 μm and 3 014 μm respectively rrms values for clean and stripped hollow fiber membranes were found as nearly close to each other when we evaluated the results of sem and optical profilometer analyses it is clear that a thicker cake layer was deposited on the flat sheet membrane in considering the anmbr was operated for 557 days increase in cake formation on the flat sheet membrane was normal although the hollow fiber membranes have some advantages such as a high packing density and a large surface area the spaces within the hollow fiber membranes are more clogged because of insufficient hydraulic shear on each fiber 1 cake layer formation on both membrane types was clear according to findings of sem and optical profilometer however intermediate adsorption was found as effective fouling mechanism on both membranes in general the cake formation for both membranes was effective during the first 155 days and 40 days respectively table 3 and table 4 it can be concluded that the pore blockage was due to the cake layer formation for both membranes in addition cake layer occurred on the membrane surface caused increase in hydrophobicity of both membranes 3 3 2 ft ir analyses ft ir images for membranes are given in fig 5 on the clean flat sheet membrane 1577 cm 1 and 1485 cm 1 are aromatic bands for pes membrane in addition the weak bonds between 1407 and 1412 cm 1 are due to the stretching vibration of so2

stretching carbohydrates and carbohydrates like substances occur at 1000 1200 cm 1 4 11 the peak observed at 1070 cm 1 on the fouled membrane may be an indication of carbohydrates although the peaks at 1639 and 1070 cm 1 were disappeared the peak at 1400 cm 1 indicating the protein secondary structure amides ii was not disappeared with stripping of cake layer in the hollow fiber module the peaks

on the fouled and stripped hollow fiber membrane were found almost similar the peak at 1546 and 1651 cm 1 on the fouled membrane may be due to presence of amide ii and amide i respectively 2 the peaks were not disappeared with stripping of cake layer the peak at 1147 cm 1 was disappeared on the spectrum of the stripped membrane this indicates that carbohydrates and carbohydrates like substances were removed with stripping of cake layer as a result while some protein compounds could not be removed with stripping of cake layer carbohydrates were stripped easily from both membranes 3 3 3 clsm images clsm image analysis technique was used to evaluate thickness of the bio cake layer on the fouled membranes fig 6 the biofilm layer reached to 450 μm and around 250 μm on the flat sheet membrane and hollow fiber membrane respectively after stripping the thickness of biofilm layer of fouled membranes decreased to around 150 μm although the biofilm thickness on both stripped membranes was found almost close to each other it can be said that the stripping on the flat sheet membrane was more effective based on the thickness of biofilm layer on the fouled membranes 3 3 4 eps toc and zeta potential analyses the values of eps and toc concentrations on the cake layer of both membranes are given in fig 7 epsp were 52 mg gss and 10 mg gss and epsc were 19 mg gss and 5 mg gss for the flat sheet and the hollow fiber membrane respectively it means the formation of thicker bio cake on the flat sheet membrane because production of extracellular polymeric substances will firmly anchor the

resulted in a membrane with a permeability of 192 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 changing the additive dosages for 4 5 cn and 5 peo had a synergistic effect resulting in a composite membrane with a permeability of 319 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 in general the use of cn improved membrane thermal mechanical resistance and permeability with minimal loss in rejection membranes molecular weight cut off ranged from 100 kg mol 1 for the membrane with 1 5 weight of cn to more than 203 kg mol 1 for the membrane with 5 weight peo challenging tests with sodium alginate and natural water showed a lower fouling potential and higher flux recovery for the membranes cast with cn overall the cn significantly improved all the evaluated characteristics of the obtained mixed matrix membranes keywords mixed matrix polysulfone clay nanoparticles ultrafiltration membranes 1 introduction low pressure membrane separation processes such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are becoming popular alternatives for water treatment notable factors for the growth and acceptance of mf and uf at water and wastewater treatment facilities are the compact design low operating pressure and in turn energy consumption and effectiveness toward removal of organic matter 1 2 turbidity and pathogens 3 5 the primary performance factors when considering a membrane treatment system are the permeability separation capacity and fouling resistance which directly impact capital and operation maintenance costs common polymers used to synthesize mf and uf membranes are polysulfone ps polyethersulfone pes and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf which are all hydrophobic resulting in a rapid decline in permeate flux over time due to membrane fouling 6 the number of publications related to membrane fouling research over the last six years is roughly equivalent to all prior publications indicating that fouling is currently a major challenge toward the implementation of membrane treatment systems common methods to reduce membrane fouling rate are pre treatment of the feed stream optimization of operational conditions and membrane modification to impart anti fouling properties 2 one approach to modification consists of coating or grafting a hydrophilic surface layer onto the membrane driving formation of a strongly adsorbed water layer that sterically hinders foulant adhesion 7 another common method is to dope the membrane casting solution with hydrophilic particles that will become embedded into and onto the membrane the addition of inorganic or organic components as pore forming agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 8 10 polyethylene glycol peg 11 13 peo glycerol and alcohols or di alcohols 14 to the casting solution influences a range of membrane properties including surface and internal pore structure permeability thermal chemical mechanical resistance rejection capability hydrophilicity and biocompatibility 15 the latter modification method has the advantage of being performed in a single step during membrane production and thus can be easily incorporated into current industrial scale membrane synthesis methods due to recent progress in the field of nanotechnology many current membrane studies have focused on synthesis of composite membranes using nanoparticles nanoparticles such as titanium oxide 16 17 zinc oxide 18 alumina 19 silica 20 21 silver 22 23 and inorganic salts 24 can be incorporated into most available polymeric materials during phase inversion to produce membranes with improved performance as a result of modifications to the surface and internal pore structure cn additives have been a focus of recent research to enhance membrane properties due to the low cost and abundance of clay cn has been previously used to improve ultrafiltration 25 29 gas separation 30 31 fuel cell 32 and distillation 33 membrane properties and performance monticelli et al 25 observed that cn modified ps membranes had a significantly higher rejection 92 vs 2 of dextran 40 kg mol 1 as compared to the unmodified membranes ma et al 34 observed that the addition of cn and peg to ps membranes increased the number of large pores in the skin layer but also decreased the membrane mechanical resistance however there were no samples without peg for performance comparison anadão et al 35 reported that addition of cn to ps membranes increased their hydrophilicity and thermal mechanical stability cn has also been used as a casting solution dopant for pes and pvdf membranes mierzwa et al 26 reported the permeability of 2 cn pes composite membranes increased by 121 as compared to the undoped membrane ghaemi et al 29 reported that cn doped pes membranes had improved permeability due to significant structural changes to the skin layer rajabi et al 28 observed that cn doped membranes had an increased hydrophilicity fouling resistance and macrovoid size lai et al 36 reported cn doped pvdf membranes had improved mechanical strength but reduced water permeability considering there still are too many uncertainties regarding the use of cn for mixed matrix membrane production our research focused on the development of a more comprehensive evaluation of the effect of cn with and without the use a pore former on the morphology and performance of ps based mixed matrix membranes for water treatment here we examined the individual and combined effect of cn and the pore forming agent peo dopants on the performance of ps membranes produced via phase inversion first membranes with individual additives cn or peo at weight percent concentrations of 1 5 to the ps were synthesized and evaluated to determine the optimal additive concentration for cross flow pure water permeability next various combinations of both modifying agents were studied to determine if there was antagonistic synergistic or neutral interactions between the additives on membrane performance finally the control membrane and the membranes with optimal performance compositions of cn and or peo were examined in detail to evaluate internal pore structure thermal mechanical resistance surface charge rejection performance and potential for water treatment applications 2 materials and

the fouling experiments was acquired from the fresh pond reservoir at the cambridge drinking water treatment plant deionized di water 18 mω was produced by a nanopure infinity ultrapure water system barnstead thermolyne 2 2 membrane synthesis the membrane casting solutions were produced by dissolving ps 18 w w in nmp with addition of cn 1 5 w w cn ps and or peo 1 5 w w peo ps when applicable membranes with no cn or peo were used as a control the membrane compositions can be found in table 1 the casting solutions were prepared at room temperature and controlled humidity each dope solution considering the composition indicated in table 1 was prepared by first adding in the specific amount of solvent the peo then cn and finally the polymer peo was stirred for 15 min before the addition of cn and cn was stirred for 15 min before the addition of ps the neat dope solution was prepared by adding only the ps to the solvent to avoid agglomeration of the ps pellets and thus delay of their dissolution the polymer was added gradually a quarter of the total every 45 min the solutions were stirred for 24 h at 120 rpm to ensure the cn was well dispersed and the polymer was dissolved prior to phase inversion the casting solutions were degassed in an ultrasonic bath branson 2100 for 30 min to eliminate air bubbles that could interfere with the final membrane structure after mixing stirring and degassing the solutions were cast into membranes the polymeric solution was carefully applied to a glass plate using an automatic film applicator elcometer 4340 automatic film applicator with a casting bar at a fixed height 100 μm and application speed 1 0 cm s 1 after spreading the casting solution the glass plate was quickly immersed into a coagulation bath containing deionized water at room temperature and the membranes were formed via phase inversion after immersion in the coagulation bath the membranes were placed in a second di water bath at room temperature 24 h to remove any residual solvent for performance evaluation the membranes were kept in a di water bath at room temperature until use for membrane characterization the membranes were kept in isopropyl alcohol for 24 h then covered by absorbent paper towels and left to dry naturally inside a fume hood to prevent pore collapse all the membranes were thoroughly inspected against a light source to verify the presence of pinholes in the surfaces chosen to be tested all the samples tested did not have visible holes or defects that could compromise their characterization 2 3 membrane characterization pure water permeability of cast membranes was determined using the cross flow cell unit viscosity was measured for most casting solution compositions and contact angle was measured for all membranes the control membrane was further compared in detail to the highest permeability membranes with only cn 1 5 only peo 5 1 5 cn and 5 peo combination of optimal individual permeabilities and 4 5 cn and 5 peo optimal combined permeability regarding thickness porosity rejection fouling resistance surface charge and thermal mechanical properties details of all the membrane characterization procedures can be found in the supplementary information file si 3 results and discussion 3 1 casting solution viscosity the casting solution viscosity was measured to evaluate potential viscosity effects on the phase inversion process higher molecular weight additives such as peo are expected to increase solution viscosity and in turn slow the diffusion of solvent out of the film during phase inversion leading to the formation of a denser skin layer 38 the casting solution viscosity for all membranes is displayed in table 2 the addition of cn had negligible effect on solution viscosity the addition of 100 kg mol 1 peo made the solutions more viscous and viscosity increased with increasing peo content however in comparison to sadrzadeh and bhattacharjee s study 38 the difference 10 in casting solution viscosities was not significant enough to affect the phase inversion process for example in their study the viscosity of the pure pes membrane casting solution 0 5 pa s was increased to 12 8 pa s upon addition of 10 wt 1300 kg mol 1 pvp 3 2 cross flow permeability membrane pure water cross flow permeability was used to initially evaluate performance and the results are displayed in fig 1 all doped membranes had an increased permeability as compared to the pure ps control i e statistical analysis of variance anova comparing the undoped membrane and cn and or peo doped membranes had a 95 confidence level of increased permeability table s1 in si membranes with only cn had a similar permeability trend to that reported in previous studies with pes and pvdf 26 27 i e with increasing casting solution dopant the permeability increased to an optimal dopant concentration after which further increase results in permeability decrease the optimal cn concentration range was between 1 5 and 2 cn 56 vs 15 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for the control the optimal peo concentration was 5 peo 237 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 after the individual dopants membrane samples with combined cn c1 5 c3 and c4 5 and peo p1 p3 and p5 dopants were examined for the combined dopants at fixed cn content the permeability increased monotonically with increasing peo content combined doping of the optimal individual dopant weight percentage reduced the membrane permeability 192 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 compared to the p5 one the simultaneous doping of 4 5 cn and 5 peo resulted in membrane with the highest permeability in this study 319 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 these results indicate that the cn has an important role on the modification of membrane s properties and morphology even in smaller concentrations it is important to note that the results of permeability tests should not be evaluated individually because its improvement y could affect other membrane s characteristics and properties the effect of peo on membrane permeability is quite well understood since it works as a pore former decreasing the resistance for water flow and consequently affecting the membrane separation capacity regarding the effect of cn on the increasing of mmm permeability the work developed by mierzwa et al 26 indicates that cn affect the membrane internal pore structure increasing the internal pore interconnectivity which reduces the water flow resistance this effect is examined in the section 3 4 3 3 interfacial properties contact angle surface charge and surface roughness the results for membranes contact angle surface charges and roughness are presented in table 3 and 2 d roughness profiles are presented in figure s3 in the si file for all membranes the average contact angle was not significantly different anova with a 5 significance level confirmed that with cn addition the difference in average contact angle was not significantly different p value 0 19 except for c4 5 which had a lesser contact angle p value 0 002 according to ghaemi et al 1 and monticelli et al 2 cn dopants tend to decrease contact angle by increasing membrane hydrophilicity however that was only observed here for the highest cn content and will be discussed further in the surface roughness section the difference was also not significant for the peo membranes as compared to control p value 0 93 in contrast anova comparison of membranes with similar cn content and increasing peo indicated that there is a significant contact angle increase with increasing peo content for example comparison of c1 5 to c1 5p5 resulted in a p value of 0 0034 and comparison of c4 5 to c4 5p5 resulted in a p value of 0 01 considering the permeability and contact angle results of the control membrane ps0 and the best individual dopants on permeability c1 5 and p5 and their co doped membrane c1 5p5 the best overall membrane permeability c4 5p5 and its corresponding cn control c4 5 were selected for further rejection and performance analysis to examine dopant interaction effects on membrane properties regarding membranes negative surface charge in all cases the addition of peo increased surface charge of the modified membranes as compared to the control peo is soluble in water and thus it is not likely for the peo to remain in the membrane after phase inversion and in turn affect the surface charge one possible explanation is that peo doping may increase surface roughness and the membrane surface area exposed which in turn increased the number of negative surface charges exposed resulting in higher dye adsorption as the cn content increased the superficial charges had decreased as it was previously reported 26 membrane contact angle and root mean square rms surface roughness nm are listed in table 4 and 2 d roughness profiles are presented in figure s3 in the si a positive correlation between the negative surface charge with both roughness and contact angle was observed with the pearson s correlation coefficient being 0 868 and 0 872 respectively the correlation between roughness and contact angle was not as strong 0 636 but it is was significant indicating the influence of membrane roughness on contact angle what was already pointed out in previous work 26 the addition of cn decreased both membrane surface roughness and negative charge whereas the addition of peo increased roughness and charge this behavior can easily be explained since membranes with higher roughness present higher superficial area which means that the charge density will also be higher as it was already pointed out previously vrijenhoek et al 39 reported the rate and extent of colloidal fouling is directly associated with surface roughness even though their study focused on reverse osmosis membranes similarly woo et al 40 reported that surface roughness is correlated to membrane performance i e smooth membranes had a greater flux as compared to rough membranes considering the use of humic acid as the foulant contaminant it is worth of note that the authors prepared their membranes using different procedures which could possibly had affected other membrane properties considering this the peo membrane surface roughness play an important role toward adsorption of toluidine blue during the evaluation of superficial charges as well as the fouling behavior discussed in section 3 7 3 4 membrane porosity thickness and morphology the membrane thickness porosity and permeability are presented in table 4 cn doping had no significant influence on membrane thickness or porosity table s2 on si peo doping resulted in slight increases in membranes thicknesses and porosities regardless the cn concentration in all cases the average post phase inversion membrane shrinkage was 40 considering the casting solutions were spread as 100 μm films and there was no correlation between either thickness porosity or permeability analyzing the data presented in table 4 it is not possible to stablish a direct correlation between membrane permeability with thickness or porosity however as it was demonstrated in previous works there is an optimal concentration of inorganic additives that results in the best membrane permeability beyond this value the permeability starts to decrease or stabilize 18 26 29 the same behavior was observed in our work see fig 1 regarding the use of peo the permeability increasing was already expected since peo works as a pore former however the combined effect of cn and peo on permeability is quite significant indicating a synergetic effect this behavior can be associated with the changes on the final membrane morphology mainly of the internal pores the selected membranes internal pore morphologies are displayed in fig 2 and the cross section s top layer is detailed for the control and ps cn membranes in fig 3 all membranes have an asymmetric structure with a thin separation layer at the surface followed by a sublayer with an initial finger like structure followed by macrovoids increasing cn content resulted in changes on pore morphology and distribution near the membrane surface fig 3 the c1 5 membrane highest permeability among samples with only cn had a near surface finger like structure with slightly wider pores and extended finger like structures as compared to the control membrane for higher concentrations of cn many pores are disconnected and do not have a free path from the top to bottom of the membrane being interrupted by a macrovoid sponge layer peo did not directly affect finger like pore formation near the membrane surface having cross sectional structures like the membranes without peo in contrast peo had a significant influence on the bottom layer for example comparing samples ps 0 and p5 fig 2a b as well as c1 5 and c1 5p5 fig 2c d the membranes without peo display a finger like structure extending across the membrane and gradually transforming into moderately sized macrovoids whereas the membranes with peo display a similar finger like structure that transitions into very large macrovoids the large and wide peo macrovoids would be expected to result in increased permeability and decreased rejection in the case of c4 5p5 the near surface pore structure with wide and continuous pores increased permeability these results indicate that the cn addition can affect the phase inversion process avoiding the formation of large macrovoids at the bottom of the cast membranes 3 5 thermal and mechanical analysis tga was used to evaluate the thermal stability of the membranes as displayed in fig 4 all nanocomposite membranes had improved thermal resistance as compared to the ps0 control membrane there are four stages of degradation in all tga curves the first from 0 to 500 c the second from 500 and 550 c the third from 550 to 660 700 c and the final 700 c where the residual membrane mass remains in the first stage samples with cn displayed better thermal stability with small mass losses compared to peo and control membranes ps0 18 5 p5 14 6 c1 5p5 12 3 c4 5p5 10 2 c1 5 6 9 c4 5 6 5 there is prominent weight loss during the second stage indicated by the steep slope that is roughly similar for all membrane samples ps0 52 c4 5p5 47 c1 5 c1 5p5 c4 5 45 the thermal decomposition slows down slightly at the beginning of the third stage and then becomes nearly as fast as the second stage the final temperature of the third stage temperature range was slightly dependent on the cn content i e membranes with 4 5 cn had a greater final degradation temperature 700 vs 660 c for the other samples peo only had an influence on the first stage of decomposition but afterwards thermal decomposition was similar to the control peo addition also lessened the cn effects on thermal stability for example c4 5p5 had a greater weight loss after the third stage 93 and lower final decomposition temperature 660 as compared to c4 5 84 and 700 c these results are in agreement with anadão et al 35 who reported that increasing clay content hinders oxygen diffusion into the polymeric matrix retarding combustion the residual mass after tga analysis is attributed to the incombustible mostly inorganic components of the membranes i e organic char or residual cn ps0 had a residual mass of 0 5 c1 5 and c1 5p5 had a residual mass of 1 and c4 5 and c4 5p5 had residual masses of 2 8 and 2 5 respectively it is important to note that the residual masses of all the membranes with cn had increased indicating its incorporation on the cast membranes the smaller percentage of residual mass for the cn membranes compared to the cn ps w w ratio in the casting solution can be associated with the equipment precision because of the sample size used in the analysis or some loss of cn during the phase inversion process what should be evaluated after the phase inversion process the membrane mechanical properties are listed in table 5 increasing cn content increased membrane stiffness i e increased young modulus and stress at rupture because of an increased sponge like structure 14 vs 25 μm for ps 0 vs p4 5 and smaller voids p1 5 fig 2 in agreement with previous reports increasing the cn content increased membrane tensile strength 35 36 in contrast to these results ma et al 34 reported that cn weakens membranes mechanical properties due to an increase of membrane porosity from 45 2 48 1 however with exception of the control membrane all membranes in their study were synthesized with cn and peg no pure cn membranes liu et al 41 reported that this unexpected behavior may be caused by poor cn dispersion i e if the cn and polymer are uniformly dispersed the ionic bonds between the polymer and cn will enhance the membrane tensile properties lai et al 36 reported that cn can act as a temporary crosslinker to the polymer chain pvdf in their case providing regions of increased strength they also reported that the presence of macrovoids and wider finger like pores reduce ductility stiffness and toughness here increasing peo content resulted in larger macrovoids as well as decreased stiffness e g p5 young s modulus decreased 34 as compared to ps 0 c1 5p5 by 6 compared to c1 5 and c4 5p5 by 13 compared c4 5 3 6 molecular weight cut off mwco the selected membranes were challenged with peg solutions mw 10 50 90 and 203 kg mol 1 to determine the membrane mwco which is the mw when rejection is higher than 90 the average retention vs peg mw is presented in fig 5 and at least three samples of each membrane were evaluated the c1 5 membrane was the more restrictive with a mwco close to 100 kg mol 1compared to the ps0 110 10 c1 5p5 190 10 and c4 5 p5 c4 5p5 230 kg mol 1 a previous study 26 indicated that cn improved membrane rejection at a concentration close to 1 but increasing the cn concentration resulted in decreased rejection due to changes in internal pore structure in all cases doping with peo significantly increased the mwco as expected since peo is a pore former the simultaneous addition of cn and peo decreased mwco as compared to pure peo of note is that c1 5 had a mwco smaller than the ps0 with a permeability nearly 4 times greater considering the average rejection for peg 203 kg mol 1 and permeability fig 6 presents the correlation between results compared to control all the evaluated membranes had either a better rejection or a better permeability the c1 5 membrane had permeability and rejection increased while its peo counterpart c1 5p5 despite having a slightly lower rejection than control had a much higher permeability 192 37 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and still could reach a mwco smaller than 200 kg mol 1 which was much higher than the rejection obtained with the membrane c4 5p5 as a main observation of using cn on the production of mmm is its capacity of holding the membrane selectivity while it increases the membranes permeability even in the case of using the peo as a pore former as it can be verified by the results presented in figs 5 and 6 3 7 fouling evaluation membranes were challenged by cross flow filtration with a 10 mg l 1 sodium alginate solution to evaluate membrane permeability fouling potential and colloidal natural organic matter nom rejection capacity as presented in table 6 1 h constant p 1 bar at least three different membranes were evaluated and first challenged with di water and then with sodium alginate solution all membranes rejected 90 of the alginate like peg rejection the membranes doped with peo had a statistically significant decrease in rejection performance the average permeability over the course of the alginate filtration experiment was normalized to the initial di water permeability for all membranes the normalized di water permeability was not statistically different the average permeability post alginate filtration decreased indicating all membranes were prone to fouling and again the peo doped membranes were most prone to fouling to examine potential for drinking water treatment cross flow experiments were completed using natural surface water nsw from cambridge s fresh pond reservoir membranes were operated continuously for 8 h and turbidity toc and uv254 of the feed and permeate during the final hour of treatment were measured figure s6 on si for all membranes permeate turbidity was like cambridge effluent levels table 7 uv254 removal varied with peo doped membranes being less efficient and all permeate samples had greater uv254 than cambridge effluent levels toc removal also did not reach cambridge effluent levels for any sample regarding bacterial rejection all membranes had at least a two log 99 rejection of bacteria indicating potential for direct drinking water treatment only after the application of complementary disinfection methods data in si the di normalized permeability after 8 h of nsw filtration and the percent permeability recovery after cleaning is displayed in fig 7 cleaning was completed by first using an alkaline solution at ph 11 and then copious amounts of ultrapure water to eliminate residual alkalinity the values next to the bars refer to the absolute permeability after cleaning the peo doped membranes had a lower permeability recovery as compared to the other membranes achieving at best c1 5p5 65 of the initial flow all the membranes without peo had a high permeability recovery after cleaning ps0 88 c1 5 99 and c4 5 93 versus p5 55 c1 5p5 65 and c4 5p5 49 the di normalized permeability after 8 h of nsw filtration was greater for control and cn doped membranes ps0 55 c1 5 57 and c4 5 47 versus p5 35 c1 5p5 37 and c4 5p5 39 the lower peo membrane permeability post nsw filtration and post cleaning procedure indicates peo doped membranes are more prone to fouling even considering the fouling the absolute permeability of the peo membranes was still greater than membranes without peo after fouling after 8 h of nsw filtration a tan layer was visually observed on a few of the membranes to evaluate the amount of adsorbed carbon 4 cm2 coupons were cut from the membranes and placed in aqueous solutions of ph 2 7 and 11 adjusted with hcl and naoh the vials were kept in a rotating shaker at 75 rpm for 24 h and the toc desorbed from the membranes was quantified fig 8 the organic matter desorbed from the cn membranes was 43 66 lesser than the control while that from the peo membranes increased by 13 addition of peo to the cn membranes increased organic matter adsorption 142 for c1 5p5 versus c1 5 and 26 for c4 5p5 versus c4 5 the amount of organic matter desorbed was linearly correlated to both the surface roughness and negative superficial charge with the latter correlated to the former with pearson correlation coefficients of 0 81 and 0 76 respectively indicating surface roughness is a primary factor influencing membrane adsorption and surface fouling similarly woo et al 40 and vrijenhock et al 39 reported increased surface roughness resulted in foulant accumulation in the pits of the rough surface which in turn resulted in a flux decline 4 conclusion membrane structure modification is an effective approach to obtain membranes with desirable properties for separation in this study the effectiveness of combining two different additives was evaluated in terms of morphological properties and performance of polysulfone membranes focusing on surface fouling by natural organic matter the use of cn by itself resulted in membranes with higher permeability smoother surface and less superficial charges than control as consequence cn membranes were less prone to fouling being able to recover their original permeability better than control membranes membranes made with peo had a higher absolute permeability lower rejection increased thickness and surface roughness in this case peo membranes adsorbed more organic matter on fouling tests and could not recover their permeability after cleaning the same way as cn membranes did the combination of both additives in concentrations that resulted in the best permeability individually 1 5 for cn 5 for peo resulted in an antagonistic effect for permeability compared to a membrane only with peo at the same optimum concentration but the fouling resistance was improved with the addition of cn in terms of physical properties cn increased thermal and mechanical resistance whereas peo made membranes more fragile the combination of additives resulted in intermediate results which means cn helped to counterbalance the fragility caused by the peo as a main conclusion for this work cn are an effective additive to be used for membrane modification because it is capable increasing membrane s permeability and rejection capacity

14314,we studied the effect of clay nanoparticles cn with and without the use of polyethylene oxide peo as the pore former on the structure and performance of mixed matrix polysulfone ultrafiltration membranes the pure water permeability of the neat ps membrane was 15 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the optimal dosage of the individually doped membranes was 1 5 weight cn to ps and 5 weight peo to ps resulting in permeabilities of 56 and 237 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively additional experiments were completed comparing the control membrane to the membranes with 1 5 and 4 5 cn 5 peo 1 5 cn 5 peo and 4 5 cn 5 peo to determine dopants effects on pore microstructure superficial charge separation performance and fouling susceptibility simultaneous doping of the optimal individual dosages of both additives resulted in a membrane with a permeability of 192 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 changing the additive dosages for 4 5 cn and 5 peo had a synergistic effect resulting in a composite membrane with a permeability of 319 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 in general the use of cn improved membrane thermal mechanical resistance and permeability with minimal loss in rejection membranes molecular weight cut off ranged from 100 kg mol 1 for the membrane with 1 5 weight of cn to more than 203 kg mol 1 for the membrane with 5 weight peo challenging tests with sodium alginate and natural water showed a lower fouling potential and higher flux recovery for the membranes cast with cn overall the cn significantly improved all the evaluated characteristics of the obtained mixed matrix membranes keywords mixed matrix polysulfone clay nanoparticles ultrafiltration membranes 1 introduction low pressure membrane separation processes such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are becoming popular alternatives for water treatment notable factors for the growth and acceptance of mf and uf at water and wastewater treatment facilities are the compact design low operating pressure and in turn energy consumption and effectiveness toward removal of organic matter 1 2 turbidity and pathogens 3 5 the primary performance factors when considering a membrane treatment system are the permeability separation capacity and fouling resistance which directly impact capital and operation maintenance costs common polymers used to synthesize mf and uf membranes are polysulfone ps polyethersulfone pes and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf which are all hydrophobic resulting in a rapid decline in permeate flux over time due to membrane fouling 6 the number of publications related to membrane fouling research over the last six years is roughly equivalent to all prior publications indicating that fouling is currently a major challenge toward the implementation of membrane treatment systems common methods to reduce membrane fouling rate are pre treatment of the feed stream optimization of operational conditions and membrane modification to impart anti fouling properties 2 one approach to modification consists of coating or grafting a hydrophilic surface layer onto the membrane driving formation of a strongly adsorbed water layer that sterically hinders foulant adhesion 7 another common method is to dope the membrane casting solution with hydrophilic particles that will become embedded into and onto the membrane the addition of inorganic or organic components as pore forming agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 8 10 polyethylene glycol peg 11 13 peo glycerol and alcohols or di alcohols 14 to the casting solution influences a range of membrane properties including surface and internal pore structure permeability thermal chemical mechanical resistance rejection capability hydrophilicity and biocompatibility 15 the latter modification method has the advantage of being performed in a single step during membrane production and thus can be easily incorporated into current industrial scale membrane synthesis methods due to recent progress in the field of nanotechnology many current membrane studies have focused on synthesis of composite membranes using nanoparticles nanoparticles such as titanium oxide 16 17 zinc oxide 18 alumina 19 silica 20 21 silver 22 23 and inorganic salts 24 can be incorporated into most available polymeric materials during phase inversion to produce membranes with improved performance as a result of modifications to the surface and internal pore structure cn additives have been a focus of recent research to enhance membrane properties due to the low cost and abundance of clay cn has been previously used to improve ultrafiltration 25 29 gas separation 30 31 fuel cell 32 and distillation 33 membrane properties and performance monticelli et al 25 observed that cn modified ps membranes had a significantly higher rejection 92 vs 2 of dextran 40 kg mol 1 as compared to the unmodified membranes ma et al 34 observed that the addition of cn and peg to ps membranes increased the number of large pores in the skin layer but also decreased the membrane mechanical resistance however there were no samples without peg for performance comparison anadão et al 35 reported that addition of cn to ps membranes increased their hydrophilicity and thermal mechanical stability cn has also been used as a casting solution dopant for pes and pvdf membranes mierzwa et al 26 reported the permeability of 2 cn pes composite membranes increased by 121 as compared to the undoped membrane ghaemi et al 29 reported that cn doped pes membranes had improved permeability due to significant structural changes to the skin layer rajabi et al 28 observed that cn doped membranes had an increased hydrophilicity fouling resistance and macrovoid size lai et al 36 reported cn doped pvdf membranes had improved mechanical strength but reduced water permeability considering there still are too many uncertainties regarding the use of cn for mixed matrix membrane production our research focused on the development of a more comprehensive evaluation of the effect of cn with and without the use a pore former on the morphology and performance of ps based mixed matrix membranes for water treatment here we examined the individual and combined effect of cn and the pore forming agent peo dopants on the performance of ps membranes produced via phase inversion first membranes with individual additives cn or peo at weight percent concentrations of 1 5 to the ps were synthesized and evaluated to determine the optimal additive concentration for cross flow pure water permeability next various combinations of both modifying agents were studied to determine if there was antagonistic synergistic or neutral interactions between the additives on membrane performance finally the control membrane and the membranes with optimal performance compositions of cn and or peo were examined in detail to evaluate internal pore structure thermal mechanical resistance surface charge rejection performance and potential for water treatment applications 2 materials and

the fouling experiments was acquired from the fresh pond reservoir at the cambridge drinking water treatment plant deionized di water 18 mω was produced by a nanopure infinity ultrapure water system barnstead thermolyne 2 2 membrane synthesis the membrane casting solutions were produced by dissolving ps 18 w w in nmp with addition of cn 1 5 w w cn ps and or peo 1 5 w w peo ps when applicable membranes with no cn or peo were used as a control the membrane compositions can be found in table 1 the casting solutions were prepared at room temperature and controlled humidity each dope solution considering the composition indicated in table 1 was prepared by first adding in the specific amount of solvent the peo then cn and finally the polymer peo was stirred for 15 min before the addition of cn and cn was stirred for 15 min before the addition of ps the neat dope solution was prepared by adding only the ps to the solvent to avoid agglomeration of the ps pellets and thus delay of their dissolution the polymer was added gradually a quarter of the total every 45 min the solutions were stirred for 24 h at 120 rpm to ensure the cn was well dispersed and the polymer was dissolved prior to phase inversion the casting solutions were degassed in an ultrasonic bath branson 2100 for 30 min to eliminate air bubbles that could interfere with the final membrane structure after mixing stirring and degassing the solutions were cast into membranes the polymeric solution was carefully applied to a glass plate using an automatic film applicator elcometer 4340 automatic film applicator with a casting bar at a fixed height 100 μm and application speed 1 0 cm s 1 after spreading the casting solution the glass plate was quickly immersed into a coagulation bath containing deionized water at room temperature and the membranes were formed via phase inversion after immersion in the coagulation bath the membranes were placed in a second di water bath at room temperature 24 h to remove any residual solvent for performance evaluation the membranes were kept in a di water bath at room temperature until use for membrane characterization the membranes were kept in isopropyl alcohol for 24 h then covered by absorbent paper towels and left to dry naturally inside a fume hood to prevent pore collapse all the membranes were thoroughly inspected against a light source to verify the presence of pinholes in the surfaces chosen to be tested all the samples tested did not have visible holes or defects that could compromise their characterization 2 3 membrane characterization pure water permeability of cast membranes was determined using the cross flow cell unit viscosity was measured for most casting solution compositions and contact angle was measured for all membranes the control membrane was further compared in detail to the highest permeability membranes with only cn 1 5 only peo 5 1 5 cn and 5 peo combination of optimal individual permeabilities and 4 5 cn and 5 peo optimal combined permeability regarding thickness porosity rejection fouling resistance surface charge and thermal mechanical properties details of all the membrane characterization procedures can be found in the supplementary information file si 3 results and discussion 3 1 casting solution viscosity the casting solution viscosity was measured to evaluate potential viscosity effects on the phase inversion process higher molecular weight additives such as peo are expected to increase solution viscosity and in turn slow the diffusion of solvent out of the film during phase inversion leading to the formation of a denser skin layer 38 the casting solution viscosity for all membranes is displayed in table 2 the addition of cn had negligible effect on solution viscosity the addition of 100 kg mol 1 peo made the solutions more viscous and viscosity increased with increasing peo content however in comparison to sadrzadeh and bhattacharjee s study 38 the difference 10 in casting solution viscosities was not significant enough to affect the phase inversion process for example in their study the viscosity of the pure pes membrane casting solution 0 5 pa s was increased to 12 8 pa s upon addition of 10 wt 1300 kg mol 1 pvp 3 2 cross flow permeability membrane pure water cross flow permeability was used to initially evaluate performance and the results are displayed in fig 1 all doped membranes had an increased permeability as compared to the pure ps control i e statistical analysis of variance anova comparing the undoped membrane and cn and or peo doped membranes had a 95 confidence level of increased permeability table s1 in si membranes with only cn had a similar permeability trend to that reported in previous studies with pes and pvdf 26 27 i e with increasing casting solution dopant the permeability increased to an optimal dopant concentration after which further increase results in permeability decrease the optimal cn concentration range was between 1 5 and 2 cn 56 vs 15 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for the control the optimal peo concentration was 5 peo 237 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 after the individual dopants membrane samples with combined cn c1 5 c3 and c4 5 and peo p1 p3 and p5 dopants were examined for the combined dopants at fixed cn content the permeability increased monotonically with increasing peo content combined doping of the optimal individual dopant weight percentage reduced the membrane permeability 192 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 compared to the p5 one the simultaneous doping of 4 5 cn and 5 peo resulted in membrane with the highest permeability in this study 319 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 these results indicate that the cn has an important role on the modification of membrane s properties and morphology even in smaller concentrations it is important to note that the results of permeability tests should not be evaluated individually because its improvement y could affect other membrane s characteristics and properties the effect of peo on membrane permeability is quite well understood since it works as a pore former decreasing the resistance for water flow and consequently affecting the membrane separation capacity regarding the effect of cn on the increasing of mmm permeability the work developed by mierzwa et al 26 indicates that cn affect the membrane internal pore structure increasing the internal pore interconnectivity which reduces the water flow resistance this effect is examined in the section 3 4 3 3 interfacial properties contact angle surface charge and surface roughness the results for membranes contact angle surface charges and roughness are presented in table 3 and 2 d roughness profiles are presented in figure s3 in the si file for all membranes the average contact angle was not significantly different anova with a 5 significance level confirmed that with cn addition the difference in average contact angle was not significantly different p value 0 19 except for c4 5 which had a lesser contact angle p value 0 002 according to ghaemi et al 1 and monticelli et al 2 cn dopants tend to decrease contact angle by increasing membrane hydrophilicity however that was only observed here for the highest cn content and will be discussed further in the surface roughness section the difference was also not significant for the peo membranes as compared to control p value 0 93 in contrast anova comparison of membranes with similar cn content and increasing peo indicated that there is a significant contact angle increase with increasing peo content for example comparison of c1 5 to c1 5p5 resulted in a p value of 0 0034 and comparison of c4 5 to c4 5p5 resulted in a p value of 0 01 considering the permeability and contact angle results of the control membrane ps0 and the best individual dopants on permeability c1 5 and p5 and their co doped membrane c1 5p5 the best overall membrane permeability c4 5p5 and its corresponding cn control c4 5 were selected for further rejection and performance analysis to examine dopant interaction effects on membrane properties regarding membranes negative surface charge in all cases the addition of peo increased surface charge of the modified membranes as compared to the control peo is soluble in water and thus it is not likely for the peo to remain in the membrane after phase inversion and in turn affect the surface charge one possible explanation is that peo doping may increase surface roughness and the membrane surface area exposed which in turn increased the number of negative surface charges exposed resulting in higher dye adsorption as the cn content increased the superficial charges had decreased as it was previously reported 26 membrane contact angle and root mean square rms surface roughness nm are listed in table 4 and 2 d roughness profiles are presented in figure s3 in the si a positive correlation between the negative surface charge with both roughness and contact angle was observed with the pearson s correlation coefficient being 0 868 and 0 872 respectively the correlation between roughness and contact angle was not as strong 0 636 but it is was significant indicating the influence of membrane roughness on contact angle what was already pointed out in previous work 26 the addition of cn decreased both membrane surface roughness and negative charge whereas the addition of peo increased roughness and charge this behavior can easily be explained since membranes with higher roughness present higher superficial area which means that the charge density will also be higher as it was already pointed out previously vrijenhoek et al 39 reported the rate and extent of colloidal fouling is directly associated with surface roughness even though their study focused on reverse osmosis membranes similarly woo et al 40 reported that surface roughness is correlated to membrane performance i e smooth membranes had a greater flux as compared to rough membranes considering the use of humic acid as the foulant contaminant it is worth of note that the authors prepared their membranes using different procedures which could possibly had affected other membrane properties considering this the peo membrane surface roughness play an important role toward adsorption of toluidine blue during the evaluation of superficial charges as well as the fouling behavior discussed in section 3 7 3 4 membrane porosity thickness and morphology the membrane thickness porosity and permeability are presented in table 4 cn doping had no significant influence on membrane thickness or porosity table s2 on si peo doping resulted in slight increases in membranes thicknesses and porosities regardless the cn concentration in all cases the average post phase inversion membrane shrinkage was 40 considering the casting solutions were spread as 100 μm films and there was no correlation between either thickness porosity or permeability analyzing the data presented in table 4 it is not possible to stablish a direct correlation between membrane permeability with thickness or porosity however as it was demonstrated in previous works there is an optimal concentration of inorganic additives that results in the best membrane permeability beyond this value the permeability starts to decrease or stabilize 18 26 29 the same behavior was observed in our work see fig 1 regarding the use of peo the permeability increasing was already expected since peo works as a pore former however the combined effect of cn and peo on permeability is quite significant indicating a synergetic effect this behavior can be associated with the changes on the final membrane morphology mainly of the internal pores the selected membranes internal pore morphologies are displayed in fig 2 and the cross section s top layer is detailed for the control and ps cn membranes in fig 3 all membranes have an asymmetric structure with a thin separation layer at the surface followed by a sublayer with an initial finger like structure followed by macrovoids increasing cn content resulted in changes on pore morphology and distribution near the membrane surface fig 3 the c1 5 membrane highest permeability among samples with only cn had a near surface finger like structure with slightly wider pores and extended finger like structures as compared to the control membrane for higher concentrations of cn many pores are disconnected and do not have a free path from the top to bottom of the membrane being interrupted by a macrovoid sponge layer peo did not directly affect finger like pore formation near the membrane surface having cross sectional structures like the membranes without peo in contrast peo had a significant influence on the bottom layer for example comparing samples ps 0 and p5 fig 2a b as well as c1 5 and c1 5p5 fig 2c d the membranes without peo display a finger like structure extending across the membrane and gradually transforming into moderately sized macrovoids whereas the membranes with peo display a similar finger like structure that transitions into very large macrovoids the large and wide peo macrovoids would be expected to result in increased permeability and decreased rejection in the case of c4 5p5 the near surface pore structure with wide and continuous pores increased permeability these results indicate that the cn addition can affect the phase inversion process avoiding the formation of large macrovoids at the bottom of the cast membranes 3 5 thermal and mechanical analysis tga was used to evaluate the thermal stability of the membranes as displayed in fig 4 all nanocomposite membranes had improved thermal resistance as compared to the ps0 control membrane there are four stages of degradation in all tga curves the first from 0 to 500 c the second from 500 and 550 c the third from 550 to 660 700 c and the final 700 c where the residual membrane mass remains in the first stage samples with cn displayed better thermal stability with small mass losses compared to peo and control membranes ps0 18 5 p5 14 6 c1 5p5 12 3 c4 5p5 10 2 c1 5 6 9 c4 5 6 5 there is prominent weight loss during the second stage indicated by the steep slope that is roughly similar for all membrane samples ps0 52 c4 5p5 47 c1 5 c1 5p5 c4 5 45 the thermal decomposition slows down slightly at the beginning of the third stage and then becomes nearly as fast as the second stage the final temperature of the third stage temperature range was slightly dependent on the cn content i e membranes with 4 5 cn had a greater final degradation temperature 700 vs 660 c for the other samples peo only had an influence on the first stage of decomposition but afterwards thermal decomposition was similar to the control peo addition also lessened the cn effects on thermal stability for example c4 5p5 had a greater weight loss after the third stage 93 and lower final decomposition temperature 660 as compared to c4 5 84 and 700 c these results are in agreement with anadão et al 35 who reported that increasing clay content hinders oxygen diffusion into the polymeric matrix retarding combustion the residual mass after tga analysis is attributed to the incombustible mostly inorganic components of the membranes i e organic char or residual cn ps0 had a residual mass of 0 5 c1 5 and c1 5p5 had a residual mass of 1 and c4 5 and c4 5p5 had residual masses of 2 8 and 2 5 respectively it is important to note that the residual masses of all the membranes with cn had increased indicating its incorporation on the cast membranes the smaller percentage of residual mass for the cn membranes compared to the cn ps w w ratio in the casting solution can be associated with the equipment precision because of the sample size used in the analysis or some loss of cn during the phase inversion process what should be evaluated after the phase inversion process the membrane mechanical properties are listed in table 5 increasing cn content increased membrane stiffness i e increased young modulus and stress at rupture because of an increased sponge like structure 14 vs 25 μm for ps 0 vs p4 5 and smaller voids p1 5 fig 2 in agreement with previous reports increasing the cn content increased membrane tensile strength 35 36 in contrast to these results ma et al 34 reported that cn weakens membranes mechanical properties due to an increase of membrane porosity from 45 2 48 1 however with exception of the control membrane all membranes in their study were synthesized with cn and peg no pure cn membranes liu et al 41 reported that this unexpected behavior may be caused by poor cn dispersion i e if the cn and polymer are uniformly dispersed the ionic bonds between the polymer and cn will enhance the membrane tensile properties lai et al 36 reported that cn can act as a temporary crosslinker to the polymer chain pvdf in their case providing regions of increased strength they also reported that the presence of macrovoids and wider finger like pores reduce ductility stiffness and toughness here increasing peo content resulted in larger macrovoids as well as decreased stiffness e g p5 young s modulus decreased 34 as compared to ps 0 c1 5p5 by 6 compared to c1 5 and c4 5p5 by 13 compared c4 5 3 6 molecular weight cut off mwco the selected membranes were challenged with peg solutions mw 10 50 90 and 203 kg mol 1 to determine the membrane mwco which is the mw when rejection is higher than 90 the average retention vs peg mw is presented in fig 5 and at least three samples of each membrane were evaluated the c1 5 membrane was the more restrictive with a mwco close to 100 kg mol 1compared to the ps0 110 10 c1 5p5 190 10 and c4 5 p5 c4 5p5 230 kg mol 1 a previous study 26 indicated that cn improved membrane rejection at a concentration close to 1 but increasing the cn concentration resulted in decreased rejection due to changes in internal pore structure in all cases doping with peo significantly increased the mwco as expected since peo is a pore former the simultaneous addition of cn and peo decreased mwco as compared to pure peo of note is that c1 5 had a mwco smaller than the ps0 with a permeability nearly 4 times greater considering the average rejection for peg 203 kg mol 1 and permeability fig 6 presents the correlation between results compared to control all the evaluated membranes had either a better rejection or a better permeability the c1 5 membrane had permeability and rejection increased while its peo counterpart c1 5p5 despite having a slightly lower rejection than control had a much higher permeability 192 37 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and still could reach a mwco smaller than 200 kg mol 1 which was much higher than the rejection obtained with the membrane c4 5p5 as a main observation of using cn on the production of mmm is its capacity of holding the membrane selectivity while it increases the membranes permeability even in the case of using the peo as a pore former as it can be verified by the results presented in figs 5 and 6 3 7 fouling evaluation membranes were challenged by cross flow filtration with a 10 mg l 1 sodium alginate solution to evaluate membrane permeability fouling potential and colloidal natural organic matter nom rejection capacity as presented in table 6 1 h constant p 1 bar at least three different membranes were evaluated and first challenged with di water and then with sodium alginate solution all membranes rejected 90 of the alginate like peg rejection the membranes doped with peo had a statistically significant decrease in rejection performance the average permeability over the course of the alginate filtration experiment was normalized to the initial di water permeability for all membranes the normalized di water permeability was not statistically different the average permeability post alginate filtration decreased indicating all membranes were prone to fouling and again the peo doped membranes were most prone to fouling to examine potential for drinking water treatment cross flow experiments were completed using natural surface water nsw from cambridge s fresh pond reservoir membranes were operated continuously for 8 h and turbidity toc and uv254 of the feed and permeate during the final hour of treatment were measured figure s6 on si for all membranes permeate turbidity was like cambridge effluent levels table 7 uv254 removal varied with peo doped membranes being less efficient and all permeate samples had greater uv254 than cambridge effluent levels toc removal also did not reach cambridge effluent levels for any sample regarding bacterial rejection all membranes had at least a two log 99 rejection of bacteria indicating potential for direct drinking water treatment only after the application of complementary disinfection methods data in si the di normalized permeability after 8 h of nsw filtration and the percent permeability recovery after cleaning is displayed in fig 7 cleaning was completed by first using an alkaline solution at ph 11 and then copious amounts of ultrapure water to eliminate residual alkalinity the values next to the bars refer to the absolute permeability after cleaning the peo doped membranes had a lower permeability recovery as compared to the other membranes achieving at best c1 5p5 65 of the initial flow all the membranes without peo had a high permeability recovery after cleaning ps0 88 c1 5 99 and c4 5 93 versus p5 55 c1 5p5 65 and c4 5p5 49 the di normalized permeability after 8 h of nsw filtration was greater for control and cn doped membranes ps0 55 c1 5 57 and c4 5 47 versus p5 35 c1 5p5 37 and c4 5p5 39 the lower peo membrane permeability post nsw filtration and post cleaning procedure indicates peo doped membranes are more prone to fouling even considering the fouling the absolute permeability of the peo membranes was still greater than membranes without peo after fouling after 8 h of nsw filtration a tan layer was visually observed on a few of the membranes to evaluate the amount of adsorbed carbon 4 cm2 coupons were cut from the membranes and placed in aqueous solutions of ph 2 7 and 11 adjusted with hcl and naoh the vials were kept in a rotating shaker at 75 rpm for 24 h and the toc desorbed from the membranes was quantified fig 8 the organic matter desorbed from the cn membranes was 43 66 lesser than the control while that from the peo membranes increased by 13 addition of peo to the cn membranes increased organic matter adsorption 142 for c1 5p5 versus c1 5 and 26 for c4 5p5 versus c4 5 the amount of organic matter desorbed was linearly correlated to both the surface roughness and negative superficial charge with the latter correlated to the former with pearson correlation coefficients of 0 81 and 0 76 respectively indicating surface roughness is a primary factor influencing membrane adsorption and surface fouling similarly woo et al 40 and vrijenhock et al 39 reported increased surface roughness resulted in foulant accumulation in the pits of the rough surface which in turn resulted in a flux decline 4 conclusion membrane structure modification is an effective approach to obtain membranes with desirable properties for separation in this study the effectiveness of combining two different additives was evaluated in terms of morphological properties and performance of polysulfone membranes focusing on surface fouling by natural organic matter the use of cn by itself resulted in membranes with higher permeability smoother surface and less superficial charges than control as consequence cn membranes were less prone to fouling being able to recover their original permeability better than control membranes membranes made with peo had a higher absolute permeability lower rejection increased thickness and surface roughness in this case peo membranes adsorbed more organic matter on fouling tests and could not recover their permeability after cleaning the same way as cn membranes did the combination of both additives in concentrations that resulted in the best permeability individually 1 5 for cn 5 for peo resulted in an antagonistic effect for permeability compared to a membrane only with peo at the same optimum concentration but the fouling resistance was improved with the addition of cn in terms of physical properties cn increased thermal and mechanical resistance whereas peo made membranes more fragile the combination of additives resulted in intermediate results which means cn helped to counterbalance the fragility caused by the peo as a main conclusion for this work cn are an effective additive to be used for membrane modification because it is capable increasing membrane s permeability and rejection capacity
