6810,recent significant channel evolution in the jingjiang reach has raised much attention particularly the remarkable bank erosion a coupled model for simulating bed deformation and bank erosion has been proposed in this study which focuses on the erosion of the bank with a composite structure in the lower jingjiang reach in order to cover three contributing processes that may interact with each other the proposed model integrates a one dimensional morphodynamic module with a two dimensional module of ground water flow and a bank erosion module for the cantilever failure of a composite riverbank model performance was evaluated through a detailed simulation of channel evolution along a 150 8 km subreach in the jingjiang reach over the 2005 hydrological year satisfying results were obtained from the simulation showing relatively close agreement between the calculations and measurements in terms of hydrological data at the outlet section bank erosion sites longitudinal channel profile and typical cross sectional profiles in addition investigations into temporal changes in bank soil properties and critical overhanging width at cantilever failure demonstrate that there was a seasonal variation in the volumetric water content of bank soil which increased during the rising and flood periods and then decreased during the recession period showing an impact on the occurrence timing of cantilever failures the tensile strength and critical overhanging width had an inverse relationship with the water content whereas the critical width sharply increased and then decreased during high flows affected by a rapid change in river stage the temporal distribution of cantilever failure events indicates that cantilever failure primarily occurred in the flood and recession periods the effects of bed roughness water content variation and secondary flow on bank erosion were also discussed keywords coupled model bed deformation bank erosion ground water flow cantilever failure jingjiang reach 1 introduction upstream dam construction usually causes significant downstream channel evolution including remarkable bed incision and bank erosion one or two dimensional 2d numerical hydro and sediment dynamic models are widely used to investigate channel evolution in alluvial rivers darby et al 2002 cantelli et al 2007 fang et al 2008 abderrezzak and paquier 2009 di cristo et al 2016 karmaker and dutta 2016 with three dimensional 3d models also being developed fischer antze et al 2009 jia et al 2010 mosselman 2010 however the 2d or 3d models are usually applied to relatively short term simulations in specified local alluvial reaches in practical engineering applications with a requirement of detailed topographic and hydrological datasets and are generally harder to be incorporated with other modules of non fluvial processes by contrast one dimensional 1d models can t provide detailed results of flow conditions and bed evolutions such as the lateral distributions of velocity and bed deformation but it is generally applicable to long term simulations in long reaches and is more easily implemented when other complex non fluvial processes are introduced bank erosion in an alluvial river downstream of a dam has received much attention in recent years because of its importance to channel stability and flood control management xia et al 2014a konsuer et al 2016 bank erosion involves a combination of several interacting processes covering fluvial erosion ground water flow and mass failure etc and much progress has been made in understanding and quantifying the respective effects of these processes rinaldi et al 2008 however most studies focus on a single set of these processes with few attempts being made to quantify their combined effects rinaldi et al 2008 rinaldi and nardi 2013 and thus an integrated investigation is required to get deeper insight into bank erosion among these factors fluvial erosion has been regarded as the most critical controlling factor of bank erosion in many cases nardi et al 2013 kimiaghalam et al 2015 however two difficulties have been recognized in quantifying the rate of fluvial erosion characterization of near bank shear stress and determination of erodibility parameters rinaldi and nardi 2013 the characterization of near bank shear stress can be addressed through the application of analytical models of near bank shear stress or numerical hydrodynamic models rinaldi and nardi 2013 nardi et al 2013 kimiaghalam et al 2015 and progress in determination of erodibility parameters has been made through the development of in situ devices of jest testing rinaldi and nardi 2013 however erodibility parameters exhibit temporal and spatial variability influenced by other soil properties such as water content making the determination remain complex knapen et al 2007 in addition to erodbility parameters tensile strength and shear strength of riverbank soil are also related to water content that is associated with the change in pore water pressure due to ground water flow xia et al 2014a in fact ground water flow has been recognized recently as one of the most important controlling processes which can contribute significantly to bank erosion through the development of pore water pressure acting as a destabilizing force and influencing the soil properties and seepage erosion darby et al 2007 rinaldi et al 2008 lindow et al 2009 fox and wilson 2010 karmaker and dutta 2013 for example fox and wilson 2010 highlighted the mechanisms and importance of ground water flow process in erosion associated with hillslopes and stream banks lindow et al 2009 conducted experiments to investigate the effects of seepage erosion and pore water pressure on bank stability some studies focused on the interactions between the fluvial erosion ground water flow the development of pore water pressure and mass failure with representative cases being conducted by darby et al 2007 and rinaldi et al 2008 darby et al 2007 coupled a fluvial erosion module with a seepage analysis module and a bank stability module seeking to isolate the feedbacks between fluvial erosion mass wasting and the evolving pore water pressure field rinaldi et al 2008 further incorporated a hydrodynamic model into the framework of darby et al 2007 with two mechanisms being identified that explain how most bank retreat usually occurs after rather than during flood peaks however the manual manipulation for bank deformation in their research is a major limitation for model implementation in practice rinaldi and nardi 2013 in addition the ignorance of bed deformation may be another limitation to model application in some contexts given the fact that bed deformation and bank erosion usually occur simultaneously in alluvial rivers and significant bed incision may greatly reduce bank stability owing to an increase in bank height some researchers have devoted to the simultaneous modeling of both bed deformation and bank erosion langendoen 2000 darby et al 2002 cantelli et al 2007 langendoen and simon 2008 wang et al 2008 jia et al 2010 for example langendoen 2000 developed the conservational channel evolution and pollutant transport system to simulate the channel evolution process and langendoen and simon 2008 tested and enhanced this model however few of these studies considered the influence of ground water flow on bank erosion therefore a coupled model was proposed herein to simulate the whole process of channel evolution including both bed deformation and bank erosion this model comprises three modules to calculate the morphodynamic process ground water flow and mass failure without requiring manual manipulation the process of seepage erosion was seldom reported and considered to be insignificant as compared with the intensive fluvial erosion in the study reach and thus this process was not included in the proposed model the major objectives of this study are to i develop a coupled model to simulate both bed deformation and bank erosion ii evaluate the performance of the proposed model through a comparison between the calculated and measured data iii identify the temporal changes in bank soil properties due to ground water flow and the temporal distribution of mass failure events during different phases and iv investigate the impacts of different factors on bank erosion process in the study reach 2 study area the yangtze river is the longest river in china with a total length of 6300 km originating from the qinghai tibet plateau and extending eastward to the northern east china sea it is usually divided into the upper middle and lower reaches on the basis of different geographical and hydrological characteristics xia et al 2014a the three gorges project tgp is located at the end of the upper yangtze river as shown in fig 1 a the jingjiang reach is located in the middle yangtze river fig 1a about 102 km downstream of the three gorges dam tgd it has a length of 347 km and is also divided into the upper jingjiang reach ujr and lower jingjiang reach ljr with a boundary near the diversion inlet of ouchikou fig 1b based on differences in channel patterns and bed and bank materials the ujr has a bifurcated and slightly curved channel pattern with a length of 172 km however the channel in the ljr is typically meandering with a length of 175 km consisting of several sharply curved bends since the operation of the tgp in 2003 the average suspended sediment concentration at the hydrometric station of jianli in the jingjiang reach has dramatically reduced from 0 84 kg m3 in 1990 2002 to 0 21 kg m3 in 2003 2015 with a slight decrease in water discharge and a negligible amount of bed load transport accounting for less than 4 of the suspended load although many bank protection works have been constructed along the reach the significantly altered flow and sediment conditions have led to continuous channel degradation in the whole reach and remarkable bank retreat processes in some local regions especially in the ljr the mean bed levels in the ujr and ljr respectively incised by about 1 8 m and 1 0 m in 2003 2015 with a maximum cumulative bank retreat width of exceeding 300 m in the shishou bend of the ljr fig 1b the study reach covers the region between the shashi station and the jianli station with a total length of 150 8 km as shown in fig 1b the upper part of the study reach stretching from the shashi station to the section jing82 fig 1b is located in the ujr with a length of 83 8 km banks in this subreach are mostly characterized by a composite structure with a thick cohesive upper layer of 8 16 m and a thin non cohesive lower layer xia and zong 2015 the bed material in this region is composed of medium and fine sand with a median diameter of 0 20 0 27 mm xia et al 2016 the channel regime in this region is relatively stable after the tgp operation characterizing by obvious bed incision but a relatively slight process of bank erosion due to the specific bank soil composition and the effective bank protection works by contrast the lower region of the study reach in the ljr has a sharply curved bend at shishou fig 1b with an unstable channel regime owing to significant bank erosion after the tgp operation the majority of the banks in this subreach also have a composite structure but with a thin cohesive upper layer and a thick non cohesive lower layer the upper layer usually consists of clay or silty clay with a plasticity index ranging from 15 to 18 4 and a clay content from 15 4 to 30 3 xia and zong 2015 the thickness of the upper layer varies between 1 m and 4 m jia et al 2010 the lower layer comprises fine sand with a thickness up to 10 m xia and zong 2015 bed material in this subreach also comprises medium and fine sand but is generally finer than that in the ujr with an average median diameter of 0 16 0 21 mm jia et al 2010 xia et al 2016 in addition the difference between bank soil compositions in the ujr and ljr leads to different bank failure mechanics in these two reaches with planar or rotational failure being frequently observed in the ujr and cantilever failure being observed in the ljr xia et al 2014a b jia et al 2010 it should be noted that the current simulation of channel evolution covers the whole study reach however modeling of bank erosion is only limited to the lower region of the study reach based on the fact that inappreciable bank erosion occurred in the upper region of the study reach this particular study reach was selected for two major reasons i the occurrence of significant bed incision in the whole reach and remarkable bank erosion in the lower region after the tgp fig 1b and ii the hydrometric stations of shashi and jianli are located respectively at the inlet and outlet boundaries of the study reach ensuring the availability of required hydrological and sediment data for model calibration in addition the process of channel evolution in 2005 hydrological year was investigated in this study because bank erosion in this year was distributed along the lower part of the study reach which was more useful to assess model performance such as a comparison between the calculated and measured bank erosion locations 3 coupled modeling of bed deformation and bank erosion the mathematical model of bed deformation and bank erosion in this study couples the morphodynamic module with the ground water flow and mass failure modules as stated previously rinaldi et al 2008 integrated the hydrodynamic model with the ground water flow and bank stability analysis to investigate their interactions the proposed model herein differs from the model of rinaldi et al 2008 in that i the current model allows a simultaneous modeling of bed deformation and bank retreat processes ii a one dimensional morphodynamic model was employed due to its advantages in simulating long term flow and sediment transport processes in a long reach the flow chart fig 2 shows how these modules are integrated and sequenced in this study the flow and sediment factors and the magnitude of bed deformation at each section are first determined from the morphodynamic module with the calculated flow conditions ground water flow is simulated using the two dimensional governing equation it is then followed by the mass failure module which is parameterized by the output from the former two modules the mass failure module includes two components i to calculate the overhanging width of the cohesive upper layer based on the calculation of lateral fluvial erosion and ii to determine the occurrence of cantilever failure for the overhanging block using the bank stability analysis both the ground water flow and mass failure calculations are implemented at each section 3 1 model assumptions the coupled model was proposed on the basis of several assumptions which are necessary to be clarified first as follows 1 bank erosion process is dominantly controlled by the average flow characteristics in a relatively long term sense 2 seepage erosion is insignificant as compared with the intensive fluvial erosion 3 bank erosion processes wouldn t lead to a rapid and significant change in channel width 4 the lower sandy layer of riverbank is effectively cohesionless with its loss being due completely to the fluvial erosion 5 about half of the failed soil debris would be transported by near bank flow in the form of suspended load with the remaining part depositing evenly in the bank toe region note that above assumptions were further illustrated in the following relevant sections along with the reasonability of the adoption of these assumptions for the study reach 3 2 morphodynamic module in this study the processes of flow and sediment transport are simulated using one dimensional 1d governing equations for shallow waters despite of some limitations such as the disability to present detailed distributions of velocity and shear stress the 1d representation is more cost effective for long term simulations in a long reach as compared with the more complex 2d and 3d models especially when coupled with a 2d simulation of ground water flow at each section the main objectives of this study are to simulate a long term bank erosion process in a relatively long reach and to investigate the soil property change and its influence on bank erosion therefore the 1d model was regarded as a more effective way to achieve these objectives in this study additionally many researchers reported relatively good empirical relationships between bank erosion degree and fluvial factors such as effective stream power annual mean discharge or bankfull discharge larsen et al 2006 henshaw et al 2013 xia et al 2014b these studies implied that in a long term sense bank erosion degree is mainly controlled by average flow characteristics in some alluvial rivers which makes the adoption of 1d model reasonable in this study considering the effect of tributary flow the 1d governing equations of water flow are written as xia et al 2015 1 q x b z t q l 2 q t g a α f b q 2 a 2 z x 2 α f q a q x q 2 a 2 a x z g a j f j l ρ l q l u l ρ m where q is the water discharge m3 s z is the cross averaged river stage m a b are respectively the wetted cross sectional area m2 and water surface width m αf is the correction coefficient of momentum ρ m is the density of mud water kg m3 u l is the longitudinal component of tributary flow velocity m s q l and ρ l are respectively the unit length water discharge m2 s and mud water density kg m3 of the tributary j f is the friction slope calculated by j f q a 2 n 2 h 4 3 where h is the cross averaged water depth m n is the manning roughness coefficient jl is the additional resistance caused by the expansion or contraction of cross sectional area g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 x is the longitudinal coordinate m and t is the time s the velocity uj at each topographic node is calculated by u j h j 2 3 n j f hj is the water depth m at the jth node and the flow shear stress τj n m2 is calculated by τ j γ h j j f because the transport rate of bed load in the jingjiang reach is negligible only suspended sediment transport is considered herein the non equilibrium transport of suspended sediment and the corresponding bed deformation can be described by these two equations xia et al 2015 3 t a s k x a u s k b ω k α k s k s k s lk q l q sk b 4 ρ a 0 t k 1 n b ω k α k s k s k where a0 is the area of bed deformation m2 u is the cross averaged velocity m s sk and s k are respectively the suspended sediment concentration kg m3 and transport capacity kg m3 for the kth fraction of non uniform sediment ωk is the sediment

concentration of the tributary kg m3 q sk b is the additional sediment source for the kth fraction due to bank erosion kg m s n is the number of the fractions for non uniform sediment and ρ is the dry density of bed material kg m3 s k is determined using the formula proposed by zhang 1998 which is written as 5 s k p k κ u 3 gh ω s m where p k is the percentage of transport capacity for the kth fraction ωs is the mean settling velocity of non uniform suspended sediment m s κ and m are empirical coefficients zhang 1998 3 3 module of ground water flow ground water flow is recognized as an important factor controlling the onset and the timing of bank failure darby et al 2007 rinaldi and nardi 2013 despite of acting as a destabilizing force an increase in the pore water pressure due to ground water flow can also cause the variation in bank soil properties covering an increase in unit weight and a reduction in shear and tensile strengths in addition ground water flow contributes to an additional erosion mechanism seepage erosion which is crucial for banks with some weak soil layers however this kind of erosion is not included in this study because it s seldom reported in the study reach as compared with the intensive fluvial erosion to the sandy lower layer of bank soil the emphasis is mainly placed on how the ground water flow induces changes in the soil properties in the ljr and thus influences the degree of bank stability the dynamic process of ground water flow is governed by the combined equation of darcy s law and mass conservation in a form extended to unsaturated conditions rinaldi et al 2008 which can be written as 6 x k x h g x y k y h g y q g θ t where hg is the total head m qg is the unit flux m3 s m3 θ is the volumetric water content m3 m3 and kx ky are respectively hydraulic conductivities in the x and y directions m s in this study bank soil was assumed to be isotropic in each layer which defines kx ky kh the governing equation was solved using the alternating direction implicit method adi with a rectangular mesh being adopted considering that bank is fairly steep in the ljr as shown in fig 1 a the mesh comprises 200 20 cells with the spatial interval δx being 0 30 m and δy ranging from 0 35 m to 0 65 m to successfully perform calculations of ground water flow it is important to parameterize the hydraulic and physical properties of bank soil and to set appropriate boundary conditions the parameterization mainly involves the determination of hydraulic conductivity kh and water content θ that would change with the varying pore water pressure for 100 saturated soil kh and θ are almost constant whereas the value of kh for unsaturated soil is highly dependent on θ that is in turn associated with the matric suction s the difference between pore air pressure ua and pore water pressure uw and moisture retention characteristic of the bank soil ng and shi 1998 empirical curves of conductivity kh s and volumetric water content θ s are always used to characterize the correlations stated above in this study due to the lack of direct measurements these curves were obtained from previous studies that reported similar soil properties for the cohesive layer the curves constructed by zhang et al 2014 were adopted fig 3 with a saturate conductivity of 1 00 10 7m s approximately equaling the measurement of 0 97 10 7 m s in the ljr for the non cohesive layer the curves of silty fine sand used by darby et al 2007 were employed fig 3 with the saturate conductivity 1 30 10 6 m s being slightly smaller than the measured value 2 04 10 6 m s in the ljr boundary conditions were setup in this study as follows i a total head versus time function was used on the basis of the stage hydrograph along the bank profile fig 4 ii a zero flux was assigned along the lower horizontal and left vertical boundaries fig 4 and iii two types of boundary conditions were adopted at the bank top fig 4 when the river stage was lower than the bank top a zero flux was defined without considering the effect of rainfall and evaporation however if the river stage overtopped the bank a total head versus time function was employed another key aspect of modeling ground water flow is related to mesh adaption in contrast to previous studies darby et al 2007 rinaldi et al 2008 luppi et al 2009 where the mesh was adjusted manually at each time step a fixed mesh was used in this study as the bank was eroded due to fluvial erosion and cantilever failure bank profile nodes bfn would be adjusted automatically on the basis of the original mesh and the eroded cell would be assigned to a specified head hs for easily distinguishing from other cells as shown in fig 4 in addition the boundary conditions would be applied to the new bank profile nodes to perform next calculation it should be noted that this method is not able to deal with the situation where the magnitude of fluvial erosion is less than the width of the boundary cell that is only a part of the boundary cell is eroded however this shortcoming can partially be compensated by using finer meshes with an acceptable computational penalty 3 4 module of mass failure the occurrence of cantilever failure includes two phases the formation of an overhanging cohesive upper block after the loss of the non cohesive lower soil due to intensive fluvial erosion and the collapse of the overhanging upper block under the combined actions of gravity and pore water pressure the detailed calculation procedure of fluvial erosion and bank stability degree for cantilever failure is described as follows 3 4 1 fluvial erosion at bank toe the fluvial erosion rate at bank toe is usually expressed as an empirical function of excess flow shear stress which can be written as darby et al 2007 7 ξ k d τ f τ c α where ξ is the fluvial erosion rate m s τf is the flow shear stress n m2 τc is the critical shear stress of the sandy bank soil n m2 kd is the erodibility coefficient m3 n s and α is an empirically derived exponent generally assumed to be 1 0 critical shear stress τc was obtained from the research of xia and zong 2015 which conducted a series of erosion testing in a glass flume to measure the incipient velocity and the critical shear stress of the soil samples collected in the jingjiang reach their research indicated that τc for the non cohesive layer has a range of 0 30 0 52 n m2 and it mostly varies from 0 26 to 1 18 n m2 for the cohesive layer however due to insufficient measurements spatial and temporal variations in τc were not available to be characterized in this study and the erodibility coefficient kd was calculated by the formula proposed by karmaker and dutta 2015 which gives k d 3 16 10 6 τ c 0 185 two corrections are made to include the effect of flow perturbation in a curved channel and to calculate the effective boundary shear stress the effective boundary shear stress skin drag component can be computed by τ g τ f n g n 2 where ng 0 0417 d50 1 6 chow 1959 with d50 being the median diameter of bank material m to include the effect of perturbations of velocity and depth due to the geometric curvature on the near bank shear stress two simplified formulas proposed by crosato 2007 were used to calculate an increase in the concave bank velocity ua m s and the super elevation of water surface ha m which are written as follows 8 u a λ 1 2 λ u h h a 2 δ 2 λ ub 2 r c 9 h a λ s 2 α κ 2 1 g κ c h 2 π 2 2 b r c where λ is the flow adaptation length given by λ c 2 h 2 g in which c is the chézy coefficient δ is a calibration parameter having a value of 0 2 crosato 2007 rc is the curvature radius of the channel centerline m α is a calibration coefficient κ is the von kármán constant 0 408 λs is the bed adaptation length m given by λ s 1 π 2 h b h 0 85 e θ s with e being a calibration coefficient and θ s being the shields parameter the boundary shear stress against the bank can be then calculated by τ f γ n 2 u toe f u a 2 r 1 3 where u toe is the velocity at bank toe m s and f equals 1 0 near the outer bank and 1 0 near the inner bank according to the measurements in the river bend of laijiapu in the ljr in 1964 before the cutoff the lateral slope of water surface ranged from 0 006 to 0 057 under a discharge of 11500 m3 s qian 1987 the longitudinal water surface slopes at the apex of bend were 0 085 0 204 the corresponding maximum difference was 0 04 m between the water surfaces near both banks qian 1987 with rc being about 1500 m in this bend wang 2014 therefore the coefficients in eq 9 were then calibrated by these measurements with δ 2 0 3 4 2 bank stability analysis bank stability analysis for cantilever failure of the upper soil layer was performed using an improved version of the method proposed by xia et al 2014a the method of xia et al 2014a adopted the critical overhanging width as the criterion for the occurrence of cantilever failure and accounted for the presence of bank top tension crack and the triangular distributions of tensile and compressive stresses this method was further improved here to include the hydrostatic confining force p and pore water pressure uw with the temporal changes in soil properties also being considered fig 5 it should be noted that the lower sandy layer was assumed to be effectively cohesionless with its loss being due completely to the fluvial erosion calculated by eq 7 this assumption is reasonable given the fact that bank profile in the ljr is fairly steep as shown in fig 1b so that the lower sandy layer cannot keep stable even under a low degree of fluvial erosion the distributions of the stresses acting on the potential failure block are shown in fig 5 at an equilibrium state the driving moment is just balanced by the resisting moment acting on the overhanging block which gives 10 w b c 2 m u h 1 h t 2 3 1 β 2 σ t β 2 h 1 h t 2 3 1 β 2 σ c m p where bc is the critical overhanging width m w is the weight of overhanging soil block kn m and w bch1γb h1 is the height of the overhanging block m ht is the tension crack depth m σt is the tensile strength kn m2 β is the ratio of tensile to compressive strength σc generally assumed to be 0 1 γb is the unit weight of the upper soil kn m3 mu is the moment of pore water pressure kn m m and m p is the moment of hydrostatic confining force kn m m eq 10 can be solved to obtain the critical overhanging width bc which gives 11 b c 2 σ t h 1 1 h t h 1 2 3 1 β γ b 2 m p m u h 1 γ b both the tensile strength σt and the unit weight γb would change with the volumetric water content θ during a hydrological year after obtaining the value of θ from the ground water flow module γb can be directly given by γb γd γwθ rinaldi et al 2008 where γd is the unit soil weight under completely dry conditions kn m3 γw is the unit water weight kn m3 based on the research of xia and zong 2015 σt of the cohesive upper bank soil in the jingjiang reach would generally decrease with an increase in mass water content ω θ γw γd and a linear relationship between σt and ω was established as shown in fig 6 3 4 3 lateral sediment source due to bank erosion according to the previous laboratory experiments xia and zong 2015 about 50 of the failed bank material would be transported by the near bank flow in the form of suspended load and the remaining would deposit in the bank toe region therefore 50 of the failed bank material was treated in this study as a lateral sediment source with an additional source term q sk b being introduced into the governing equation of suspended sediment transport eq 3 with two assumptions that failed bank material is evenly distributed within a spatial interval δxi and bank erosion rate is constant during the time interval δt q sk b can be calculated by 12 q sk b 0 5 p k b ρ b δ v δ t where δ v r v δ v i δ v i 1 2 with δ v i and δ v i 1 being respectively the unit length volume of bank erosion at the i and i 1 sections m3 m rv is assumed to be the ratio of the eroded bank line length to the total length within the sub reach of δxi p k b is the percentage of bank soil composition for the kth size fraction and ρ b is the dry density of bank soil kg m3 the remaining 50 of the failed bank material was assumed to be evenly deposited in the region between the thalweg and the bank toe point which would lead to a small increase of riverbed level in this region 4 model application the proposed model was used to simulate the processes of bed deformation and bank erosion in the study reach in 2005 hydrological year to assess model performance with the ground water flow module being first validated separately with an analytical solution for a simple steady state case 4 1 modeling of ground water flow in a steady state an analytical steady state solution presented by hou et al 2015 was used to evaluate the performance of ground water flow module a 10 m 10 m rectangular domain with homogenous hydraulic conductivity kh 1 m s was employed with constant total heads of 2 m and 10 m along the left and right vertical boundaries respectively as shown in fig 7 under these conditions the steady state solution of hou et al 2015 can be expressed by 13 z g 100 7 964 10 x where zg is the phreatic surface level m in terms of numerical solution of eq 6 a zero flux was defined on the top and bottom horizontal boundaries for this case the steady state solution was obtained through running the program until the relative difference between the total heads at two consecutive time steps was less than 1 in addition the phreatic surface was calculated on the basis that the pressure head on the phreatic surface should be equal to zero the calculated and analytical phreatic surfaces were compared in fig 7 with an average relative discrepancy of 7 being observed within 1 m distance from the left boundary within the remaining zone the calculated phreatic surface agreed relatively well with the analytical solution therefore the ground water flow module was considered to be able to produce solutions with enough accuracy however field or experimental data are still required to conduct further validation in future studies because hydraulic conductivity was constant herein whereas it would change with the matrix suction for unsaturated soil and the analytical steady state solution is not enough to characterize the complex transient nature of ground water flow 4 2 modeling of channel evolution in the jingjiang reach 4 2 1 model setup the hydrological year of 2005 in the yangtze river is conventionally defined as the period from october 2004 to october 2005 the required hydrological and sediment data topography and bed material composition at specified sections were obtained from the changjiang water resources committee cwrc the cross sectional profiles measured in october 2004 was adopted as the initial channel boundary condition with the bed material composition in 2003 being used due to lack of that in 2004 in the study reach totally 84 cross sectional profiles were used with 43 sections in the ujr and 41 sections in the ljr the spacing between two consecutive sections has an average value of 1 82 km with a maximum value of 4 66 km in a relatively straight sub reach and a minimum value of 0 48 km in a river bend owing to the absence of a hydrometric station at the entrance of the ljr at the section of jing82 in fig 1b the morphodynamic calculation was thus extended upstream to the shashi station in the ujr in fig 1b this means that the upstream boundary condition for the morphodynamic module was represented by the measured daily mean discharge and sediment concentration at shashi with the downstream boundary condition being characterized by the stage hydrograph at the jianli station however the ground water flow and mass failure modules can t be applied directly to the ujr because the bank soil composition and mass failure mechanisms in this reach significantly differ from that in the ljr and more details can refer to xia et al 2014b and xia and zong 2015 fortunately bank erosion in the extended part in the ujr was insignificant in the 2005 hydrological year due to the specific bank soil composition and the effective bank protection works with relatively obvious bank erosion occurring at only four sections out of 43 fixed sections in total therefore ignoring the process of bank erosion in this part would just slightly influence the calculated results of the study reach the discharge and graded suspended sediment concentrations in the tributary of ouchikou in the 2005 hydrological year were also collected from the cwrc and adopted as a lateral input of the morphodynamic module this tributary was dry during the period from december 2004 to june 2005 and diverted water from the main stream during the remaining months the maximum discharge of this tributary was 2922 m3 s carrying a maximum suspended sediment concentration of 1 43 kg m3 4 2 2 calculated hydrographs of water discharge and sediment concentration fig 8 a and b respectively show the comparisons between the calculated and measured discharge and suspended sediment concentration ssc at jianli in 2005 both the calculated hydrographs of discharge and sediment concentration closely agreed with the measurements with a root mean square error rmse of 589 m3 s and 0 05 kg m3 respectively the mean discharge at jianli was about 12 904 m3 s carrying a mean sediment concentration of 0 23 kg m3 therefore the value of rmse was one to two orders of magnitude less than the corresponding mean value in addition the calculated maximum discharge was 35 550 m3 s which was very close to the measured value of 35 700 m3 s the calculated highest ssc was about 1 40 kg m3 slightly lower than the measured ssc of 1 42 kg m3 the calculated river stage hydrographs also show close agreement with the measurements at different stage gauge stations the rmse and the correlation coefficient r between them at these stations are shown in table 1 along with the difference δz between the calculated and measured maximum river stages as illustrated in table 1 the rmse was enough small ranging from 0 24 m to 0 32 m as compared with the variation range of exceeding 10 m the value of r at each station was approximately equal to 1 0 and the maximum value of δz was just 0 31 m at tiaoguan based on these statistical parameters it can be concluded that the proposed model can reproduce the hydrographs of discharge sediment concentration and river stage with satisfying accuracy 4 2 3 calculated longitudinal channel profile the longitudinal channel profile is usually represented by the connection curve of mean main channel level at each section as demonstrated in fig 9 the calculated change in the longitudinal channel profile in the ljr generally agrees with the measurement the calculated reach averaged depth of bed incision was about 0 14 m in the ljr approximately equaling the measured value of 0 11 m the maximum discrepancy between the calculated and measured changes in the average bed level occurred at the section of shi3 with the calculated channel aggradation thickness of 1 85 m while the measurement showing a significant incision depth 3 31 m except for the section of shi3 the rsme was about 0 69 m between the calculated and measured changes in the average bed level at the remaining sections as compared with the variation range of 1 44 m to 1 95 m at these sections the value of rsme was generally acceptable therefore it can be concluded that the one dimensional morphodynamic module can predict the general trend of bed deformation in the study reach but may be not enough to correctly reproduce a rapid bed deformation at a specified section 4 2 4 calculated distribution of bank erosion sites although some researchers conducted various simulations of bank retreat processes in alluvial rivers darby et al 2002 rinaldi et al 2008 luppi et al 2009 they seldom presented a comparison between the predicted and measured bank erosion sites along a study reach which may be an important index for assessing model performance in this study the total retreat width wt at the bank top was adopted to represent the extent of bank erosion because of the convenience to directly calculate wt from the measured cross sectional profiles fig 10 a and b respectively show comparisons between the calculated and measured retreat widths along the left and the right banks in the lower part of the study reach in the ljr as shown in fig 10 the model prediction reflected the main distribution of bank erosion sites which could be described as follows i the calculation successfully captured the sites with the severest bank erosion wt 20 m which were located along the right banks from jing96 to jing99 in the shishou bend fig 10b and ii there were totally 12 sections with relatively higher bank erosion degrees wt 10 m and 7 of these sections were predicted by the proposed model however it should be noted that there were also discrepancies between the calculation and measurement at a few sections it was not predicted by the proposed model that the severe bank erosion wt 31 0 m at the left bank of shi3 and the erosion 20 m wt 11 m at the right banks of jing119 and shi7 the fundamental causes for these discrepancies may be i the insufficiency of relevant data to characterize the spatial variability in bank soil properties and ii the limitation of the 1d morphodynamic module in reflecting the shifting of main flow that may cause significant erosion at the convex bank such as the left bank at shi3 4 2 5 calculated variation in cross sectional profile at typical sections as described previously the severest bank erosion occurred along the right banks from jing96 to jing99 fig 11 where the main flow approached or impinged on with insufficient bank protection works this region suffered serious bank erosion after the operation of the tgp the changes in the cross sectional profile at these four typical sections are shown in fig 11a d respectively the calculated cross sectional profiles at jing97 and jing98 agreed well with the measurements whereas there were some obvious differences at other sections the bank tops at jing97 and jing99 was calculated to retreat respectively by 25 2 m and 27 7 m which were close to the measured values of 23 8 m and 23 7 m however the calculated retreat width 15 2 m at jing96 was smaller than the measured value by 7 0 m and the calculated value 33 3 m at jing98 was 10 8 m greater than the measured value 5 discussion this section is devoted to provide further insights into the seasonal variations in bank soil properties critical overhanging width of cohesive upper soil and temporal distribution of cantilever failure events it was also investigated that the effects of roughness coefficient varying water content transport ratio of failed debris and secondary flow on bank erosion 5 1 change in bank soil properties the emphasis was placed on the variations in the volumetric water content and tensile strength of the cohesive upper bank soil in the study reach fig 12 a b show respectively these variations at the right banks of the sections of jing95 and jing98 these two sections were selected because they represented two distinct cases without and with cantilever failures which allowed for the investigation into how cantilever failure would influence the change in soil properties besides levels of the bank top at these two sections were both equal to 35 0 m with a slight difference in river stage as illustrated in fig 12a the volumetric water content θ exhibited a seasonal variation tendency similar to the river stage during the dry period the value of θ was not influenced by the river stage keeping a constant level of 16 it started to increase in the rising period when the river stage approached the upper cohesive layer in the flood period the average value of θ was about 35 at jing95 and 24 at jing98 approximately 1 2 and 0 5 times larger than the initial value 16 during the drawdown of the river stage the value of θ gradually decreased to 30 and 18 at jing95 and jing98 respectively in addition the volumetric water content at jing95 was obviously higher than that at jing98 and decreased more slowly in the recession period this was attributed to a series of cantilever failure events at jing98 which caused the bank face to retreat into inner dry region and thus induced lower water contents near the bank face this phenomenon was similar to the findings of darby et al 2007 which indicated that the pore water pressure near the bank face would decrease as the bank face retreats into the inner dry region the tensile strength σt followed an inverse trend of the water content decreasing in the rising and flood periods and thereafter increasing in the recession period σt had a minimum value of 8 11 n m2 at jing95 and 8 88 n m2 at jing98 in the flood period that were respectively 63 and 69 of the initial value fig 12b although the tensile strength showed a recovery in the recession period it was generally still lower than the initial value incorporating with the removal of hydrostatic confining force the reduced tensile strength would have an unfavorable impact on bank stability during the recession period 5 2 change in critical overhanging width the temporal changes in the critical overhanging width bc at jing98 calculated by eq 11 and by the formula of xia et al 2014a are illustrated in fig 13 in general the values of bc calculated by these two methods both decreased during the rising period and then increased during the recession period however the temporal trends of bc calculated by these methods were different during high flood flows this difference gives an insight into how the hydrostatic confining force and pore water pressure influence the critical overhanging width the critical width calculated by the formula of xia et al 2014a ignoring the hydrostatic confining force and pore water pressure showed a decrease in the flood period this change trend arose from the variation in the tensile strength described previously and the unit weight of bank soil in addition it was also in accordance with the finding of darby et al 2007 on the change trend of the safety factor for shear type cantilever failure which also neglected the influence of hydrostatic confining force by contrast the overhanging widths calculated by eq 11 showed sharp gradients and much higher values during the high flood flows the reasons for these characteristics may be explained further as follows i during the dry period and the late recession period the river stage and ground water level were both too low to directly influence the upper cohesive soil through exerting hydraulic confining force and pore water pressure on bank soil there was no difference between these two equations as the values of both mp and mu were equal to zero in eq 11 ii during the rising period even though the river stage was slightly higher than the contact of two soil layers it only insignificantly influenced the upper soil layer leading to a small value of mp mu in eq 11 iii during the flood period the flow was characterized by a high and rapidly changing river stage which could influence almost the whole bank thus a high confining force was exerted on the upper bank soil with a relatively lower pore water pressure due to the rapid change in river stage and the lower permeability of the upper cohesive soil causing a larger value of mp mu in eq 11 it should be noted that during the rapid decrease of river stage in the flood period the critical width also sharply decreased in addition to the intensive fluvial erosion in this period this may cause a higher occurrence frequency of cantilever failure additionally it can be inferred that the hydrostatic confining force can have a great influence on the critical overhanging width of cantilever failure in the ljr but only during the high flows 5 3 temporal distribution of cantilever failure events fig 14 gives the temporal change in the cumulative frequency of cantilever failure events the ratio of the cumulative number of cantilever failure events at a point in time to the total number in the end of the right bank at jing98 as shown in fig 14 cantilever failure events predominantly occurred in the flood period accounting for 68 the total failure events primarily due to the intensive fluvial erosion in this period as compared with the rising period the occurrence of cantilever failure in the recession period was more frequent with a cumulative frequency of 21 it s worth noting that the obtained results herein was slightly different from that obtained by rinaldi et al 2008 which concluded that the most unstable conditions occurred during the period between the drawdown phase of a peak flow event and the initial rising phase of a subsequent peak flow event this difference could partially be attributed to the differences between the morphological and hydrological conditions in the current study reach and the study reach of rinaldi et al 2008 furthermore in their research the shifting of main flow toward the convex bank reduced the boundary shear stress acting on the concave bank during the high flows which caused a lower fluvial erosion degree and a relatively higher degree of bank stability however the shifting of the main flow cannot be correctly predicted by the 1d morphdynamic model therefore further studies are required to clarify the effect of main flow shifting on bank stability in the current study reach 5 4 effects of bed roughness coefficient the above simulation is herein referred to as case i with case ii being set up to demonstrate the effect of roughness coefficient on bank erosion the retreat widths along the study reach were recalculated in case ii where the roughness coefficient was increased by 0 005 on the basis of the correctly calibrated values in case i table 2 fig 15 shows the comparison between the calculated river stage in case ii and the measurement at shishou it can be seen that there was a big difference between the calculation and measurement with the rsme being 0 50 m as compared with the value of 0 24 m in case i however there were only insignificant changes in water discharge and sediment concentration with the values of rsme being 615 m3 s and around 0 05 kg m3 at the hydrometric station of jianli respectively therefore it can be concluded that the impacts of roughness coefficient on flow and sediment conditions are mainly represented by that on river stage fig 16 shows the comparison between the bank retreat widths under these two cases as indicated in fig 16 the calculated retreat width in case ii was slightly smaller than that case i with the average retreat width at four typical sections jing96 jing99 being reduced by 1 5 m in case ii this is because i a higher river stage fig 15 under the same discharge led to a lower velocity and a lower shear stress τf and ii the effective flow shear stress τg is inversely proportional to the square of n and thus the value of τg would decrease with an increase in n both would cause a lower degree of fluvial erosion and thus a smaller bank retreat width 5 5 effect of varying water content on bank erosion fig 17 shows the occurrence timing and cumulative number of cantilever failures at the right bank of jing98 in two cases of constant 16 and varying water contents obtained by eq 6 in the case of constant water content the ground water flow was not considered with the groundwater table being assumed to equal the bank toe level the total bank retreat widths under these two scenarios had an insignificant difference with the retreat width in the case of varying water content being just 0 47 m greater than that in the first case this was because the presence of upper overhanging block was caused by the loss of the lower non cohesive soil and thus the total retreat width was mainly determined by the lateral fluvial erosion to the lower non cohesive layer furthermore the occurrence of cantilever failure at jing98 actually in turn reduced the impact of water content to some extent fig 12 the influence of varying water content on bank erosion process was mainly represented by its impact on the occurrence timing of cantilever failure events indicated by the triangles and dots in fig 17 additionally the varying water content caused a larger total number 37 of cantilever failure events as compared with the value of 35 in the first case 5 6 effects of other factors the effects of flow perturbation secondary flow and transport ratio of the failed debris were discussed herein the bank retreat width along the study reach was recalculated in case iii without the correction for flow perturbation the calculated results show there was an insignificant difference between the calculated results in case i and case iii therefore the perturbations in the water depth and stream wise primary velocity seem to not play an important role in bank erosion processes in the ljr three test runs were conducted to illustrate the effects of the transport ratio of failed block on ssc and on bank erosion with three ratios of 100 50 and 0 being used the calculated results show that both bank retreat width and ssc had just relatively insignificant differences between these test runs the maximum difference of daily averaged ssc between these runs was just 0 053 kg m3 at the outlet station of jianli which accounted for 23 of the annual average value of ssc the maximum difference of sediment amount was less than 0 6 of the measured amount at jianli besides the difference of retreat width at jing98 was negligible between these test runs in terms of secondary flow jansen et al 1979 proposed a formula for calculating the transverse component of boundary shear stress τ t which gives τ t 2 ρ h u 2 r c g 1 2 κ c 2 g 1 2 κ c 3 with ρ being the water density kg m3 on the basis of this formula τ t accounted for less than 17 of the corresponding streamwise shear stress in the study reach with the minimum value of rc being about 1200 m therefore bank erosion in the study reach seems dominantly controlled by the primary flow conditions however secondary flow also shows a relatively significant effect on the bank erosion in a sharply curved bend this reveals the limitation of the proposed 1d model that it is not enough to correctly characterize the near bank complex flow conditions and cannot account for the effect of secondary flow on bank erosion in a sharply curved river bend 6 conclusions a coupled model for bed deformation and bank erosion was proposed in this study with the interactions between three distinct contributing processes being considered the model integrated the morphodynamic module with the ground water flow and mass failure modules with its performance being assessed through comparing the calculated results with the corresponding measurements in the jingjiang reach in addition the temporal change in soil properties and the temporal distribution of cantilever failure events were investigated following conclusions can be drawn from this study i the calculated results showed relatively close agreement with the measurements in terms of water discharge and sediment concentration at the outlet section river stage hydrographs at different water gauge stations bank erosion sites longitudinal channel profile and typical cross sectional profiles ii the volumetric water content and tensile strength of the upper cohesive bank soil exhibited a seasonal variation due to the ground water flow the volumetric water content increased in the rising and flood periods and thereafter slowly decreased in the recession period the tensile strength showed an inverse trend of the water content however a full recovery to the initial value usually could not be attained for both of them iii the critical overhanging width of cantilever failure was generally lowered in the rising and recession periods because of the reduced tensile strength and the increased unit weight of bank soil however during high flood flows a rapid change in river stage caused a sharp increase and then a decrease in the critical width iv the temporal distribution of cantilever failure events indicated a dominant role of fluvial erosion in triggering cantilever failure with almost 68 the total cantilever failure events occurring during the flood period with the most intensive fluvial erosion the effect of secondary flow on bank erosion was relatively significant in a sharply curved river bend in the ljr the influence of varying water content on bank erosion process was mainly represented by its impact on the occurrence timing of cantilever failure events the limitations of the proposed model lie in that 1 the 1d representation of morphodynamic module was not enough to characterize the near bank complex flow condition in local regions and the rapid bed deformation at a specified section 2 the deposition break up and transport processes of failed soil debris were not considered in detail along with the effect of failed debris on subsequent mass failure and 3 the detailed deformation of lower non cohesive layer was not included instead an average erosion rate was calculated therefore in future studies a multi dimensional representation of morphodynamic processes along with improved modules for failed debris break up and transport and for detailed bank slope deformation can be adopted to better characterize the complex processes of bed deformation

6810,recent significant channel evolution in the jingjiang reach has raised much attention particularly the remarkable bank erosion a coupled model for simulating bed deformation and bank erosion has been proposed in this study which focuses on the erosion of the bank with a composite structure in the lower jingjiang reach in order to cover three contributing processes that may interact with each other the proposed model integrates a one dimensional morphodynamic module with a two dimensional module of ground water flow and a bank erosion module for the cantilever failure of a composite riverbank model performance was evaluated through a detailed simulation of channel evolution along a 150 8 km subreach in the jingjiang reach over the 2005 hydrological year satisfying results were obtained from the simulation showing relatively close agreement between the calculations and measurements in terms of hydrological data at the outlet section bank erosion sites longitudinal channel profile and typical cross sectional profiles in addition investigations into temporal changes in bank soil properties and critical overhanging width at cantilever failure demonstrate that there was a seasonal variation in the volumetric water content of bank soil which increased during the rising and flood periods and then decreased during the recession period showing an impact on the occurrence timing of cantilever failures the tensile strength and critical overhanging width had an inverse relationship with the water content whereas the critical width sharply increased and then decreased during high flows affected by a rapid change in river stage the temporal distribution of cantilever failure events indicates that cantilever failure primarily occurred in the flood and recession periods the effects of bed roughness water content variation and secondary flow on bank erosion were also discussed keywords coupled model bed deformation bank erosion ground water flow cantilever failure jingjiang reach 1 introduction upstream dam construction usually causes significant downstream channel evolution including remarkable bed incision and bank erosion one or two dimensional 2d numerical hydro and sediment dynamic models are widely used to investigate channel evolution in alluvial rivers darby et al 2002 cantelli et al 2007 fang et al 2008 abderrezzak and paquier 2009 di cristo et al 2016 karmaker and dutta 2016 with three dimensional 3d models also being developed fischer antze et al 2009 jia et al 2010 mosselman 2010 however the 2d or 3d models are usually applied to relatively short term simulations in specified local alluvial reaches in practical engineering applications with a requirement of detailed topographic and hydrological datasets and are generally harder to be incorporated with other modules of non fluvial processes by contrast one dimensional 1d models can t provide detailed results of flow conditions and bed evolutions such as the lateral distributions of velocity and bed deformation but it is generally applicable to long term simulations in long reaches and is more easily implemented when other complex non fluvial processes are introduced bank erosion in an alluvial river downstream of a dam has received much attention in recent years because of its importance to channel stability and flood control management xia et al 2014a konsuer et al 2016 bank erosion involves a combination of several interacting processes covering fluvial erosion ground water flow and mass failure etc and much progress has been made in understanding and quantifying the respective effects of these processes rinaldi et al 2008 however most studies focus on a single set of these processes with few attempts being made to quantify their combined effects rinaldi et al 2008 rinaldi and nardi 2013 and thus an integrated investigation is required to get deeper insight into bank erosion among these factors fluvial erosion has been regarded as the most critical controlling factor of bank erosion in many cases nardi et al 2013 kimiaghalam et al 2015 however two difficulties have been recognized in quantifying the rate of fluvial erosion characterization of near bank shear stress and determination of erodibility parameters rinaldi and nardi 2013 the characterization of near bank shear stress can be addressed through the application of analytical models of near bank shear stress or numerical hydrodynamic models rinaldi and nardi 2013 nardi et al 2013 kimiaghalam et al 2015 and progress in determination of erodibility parameters has been made through the development of in situ devices of jest testing rinaldi and nardi 2013 however erodibility parameters exhibit temporal and spatial variability influenced by other soil properties such as water content making the determination remain complex knapen et al 2007 in addition to erodbility parameters tensile strength and shear strength of riverbank soil are also related to water content that is associated with the change in pore water pressure due to ground water flow xia et al 2014a in fact ground water flow has been recognized recently as one of the most important controlling processes which can contribute significantly to bank erosion through the development of pore water pressure acting as a destabilizing force and influencing the soil properties and seepage erosion darby et al 2007 rinaldi et al 2008 lindow et al 2009 fox and wilson 2010 karmaker and dutta 2013 for example fox and wilson 2010 highlighted the mechanisms and importance of ground water flow process in erosion associated with hillslopes and stream banks lindow et al 2009 conducted experiments to investigate the effects of seepage erosion and pore water pressure on bank stability some studies focused on the interactions between the fluvial erosion ground water flow the development of pore water pressure and mass failure with representative cases being conducted by darby et al 2007 and rinaldi et al 2008 darby et al 2007 coupled a fluvial erosion module with a seepage analysis module and a bank stability module seeking to isolate the feedbacks between fluvial erosion mass wasting and the evolving pore water pressure field rinaldi et al 2008 further incorporated a hydrodynamic model into the framework of darby et al 2007 with two mechanisms being identified that explain how most bank retreat usually occurs after rather than during flood peaks however the manual manipulation for bank deformation in their research is a major limitation for model implementation in practice rinaldi and nardi 2013 in addition the ignorance of bed deformation may be another limitation to model application in some contexts given the fact that bed deformation and bank erosion usually occur simultaneously in alluvial rivers and significant bed incision may greatly reduce bank stability owing to an increase in bank height some researchers have devoted to the simultaneous modeling of both bed deformation and bank erosion langendoen 2000 darby et al 2002 cantelli et al 2007 langendoen and simon 2008 wang et al 2008 jia et al 2010 for example langendoen 2000 developed the conservational channel evolution and pollutant transport system to simulate the channel evolution process and langendoen and simon 2008 tested and enhanced this model however few of these studies considered the influence of ground water flow on bank erosion therefore a coupled model was proposed herein to simulate the whole process of channel evolution including both bed deformation and bank erosion this model comprises three modules to calculate the morphodynamic process ground water flow and mass failure without requiring manual manipulation the process of seepage erosion was seldom reported and considered to be insignificant as compared with the intensive fluvial erosion in the study reach and thus this process was not included in the proposed model the major objectives of this study are to i develop a coupled model to simulate both bed deformation and bank erosion ii evaluate the performance of the proposed model through a comparison between the calculated and measured data iii identify the temporal changes in bank soil properties due to ground water flow and the temporal distribution of mass failure events during different phases and iv investigate the impacts of different factors on bank erosion process in the study reach 2 study area the yangtze river is the longest river in china with a total length of 6300 km originating from the qinghai tibet plateau and extending eastward to the northern east china sea it is usually divided into the upper middle and lower reaches on the basis of different geographical and hydrological characteristics xia et al 2014a the three gorges project tgp is located at the end of the upper yangtze river as shown in fig 1 a the jingjiang reach is located in the middle yangtze river fig 1a about 102 km downstream of the three gorges dam tgd it has a length of 347 km and is also divided into the upper jingjiang reach ujr and lower jingjiang reach ljr with a boundary near the diversion inlet of ouchikou fig 1b based on differences in channel patterns and bed and bank materials the ujr has a bifurcated and slightly curved channel pattern with a length of 172 km however the channel in the ljr is typically meandering with a length of 175 km consisting of several sharply curved bends since the operation of the tgp in 2003 the average suspended sediment concentration at the hydrometric station of jianli in the jingjiang reach has dramatically reduced from 0 84 kg m3 in 1990 2002 to 0 21 kg m3 in 2003 2015 with a slight decrease in water discharge and a negligible amount of bed load transport accounting for less than 4 of the suspended load although many bank protection works have been constructed along the reach the significantly altered flow and sediment conditions have led to continuous channel degradation in the whole reach and remarkable bank retreat processes in some local regions especially in the ljr the mean bed levels in the ujr and ljr respectively incised by about 1 8 m and 1 0 m in 2003 2015 with a maximum cumulative bank retreat width of exceeding 300 m in the shishou bend of the ljr fig 1b the study reach covers the region between the shashi station and the jianli station with a total length of 150 8 km as shown in fig 1b the upper part of the study reach stretching from the shashi station to the section jing82 fig 1b is located in the ujr with a length of 83 8 km banks in this subreach are mostly characterized by a composite structure with a thick cohesive upper layer of 8 16 m and a thin non cohesive lower layer xia and zong 2015 the bed material in this region is composed of medium and fine sand with a median diameter of 0 20 0 27 mm xia et al 2016 the channel regime in this region is relatively stable after the tgp operation characterizing by obvious bed incision but a relatively slight process of bank erosion due to the specific bank soil composition and the effective bank protection works by contrast the lower region of the study reach in the ljr has a sharply curved bend at shishou fig 1b with an unstable channel regime owing to significant bank erosion after the tgp operation the majority of the banks in this subreach also have a composite structure but with a thin cohesive upper layer and a thick non cohesive lower layer the upper layer usually consists of clay or silty clay with a plasticity index ranging from 15 to 18 4 and a clay content from 15 4 to 30 3 xia and zong 2015 the thickness of the upper layer varies between 1 m and 4 m jia et al 2010 the lower layer comprises fine sand with a thickness up to 10 m xia and zong 2015 bed material in this subreach also comprises medium and fine sand but is generally finer than that in the ujr with an average median diameter of 0 16 0 21 mm jia et al 2010 xia et al 2016 in addition the difference between bank soil compositions in the ujr and ljr leads to different bank failure mechanics in these two reaches with planar or rotational failure being frequently observed in the ujr and cantilever failure being observed in the ljr xia et al 2014a b jia et al 2010 it should be noted that the current simulation of channel evolution covers the whole study reach however modeling of bank erosion is only limited to the lower region of the study reach based on the fact that inappreciable bank erosion occurred in the upper region of the study reach this particular study reach was selected for two major reasons i the occurrence of significant bed incision in the whole reach and remarkable bank erosion in the lower region after the tgp fig 1b and ii the hydrometric stations of shashi and jianli are located respectively at the inlet and outlet boundaries of the study reach ensuring the availability of required hydrological and sediment data for model calibration in addition the process of channel evolution in 2005 hydrological year was investigated in this study because bank erosion in this year was distributed along the lower part of the study reach which was more useful to assess model performance such as a comparison between the calculated and measured bank erosion locations 3 coupled modeling of bed deformation and bank erosion the mathematical model of bed deformation and bank erosion in this study couples the morphodynamic module with the ground water flow and mass failure modules as stated previously rinaldi et al 2008 integrated the hydrodynamic model with the ground water flow and bank stability analysis to investigate their interactions the proposed model herein differs from the model of rinaldi et al 2008 in that i the current model allows a simultaneous modeling of bed deformation and bank retreat processes ii a one dimensional morphodynamic model was employed due to its advantages in simulating long term flow and sediment transport processes in a long reach the flow chart fig 2 shows how these modules are integrated and sequenced in this study the flow and sediment factors and the magnitude of bed deformation at each section are first determined from the morphodynamic module with the calculated flow conditions ground water flow is simulated using the two dimensional governing equation it is then followed by the mass failure module which is parameterized by the output from the former two modules the mass failure module includes two components i to calculate the overhanging width of the cohesive upper layer based on the calculation of lateral fluvial erosion and ii to determine the occurrence of cantilever failure for the overhanging block using the bank stability analysis both the ground water flow and mass failure calculations are implemented at each section 3 1 model assumptions the coupled model was proposed on the basis of several assumptions which are necessary to be clarified first as follows 1 bank erosion process is dominantly controlled by the average flow characteristics in a relatively long term sense 2 seepage erosion is insignificant as compared with the intensive fluvial erosion 3 bank erosion processes wouldn t lead to a rapid and significant change in channel width 4 the lower sandy layer of riverbank is effectively cohesionless with its loss being due completely to the fluvial erosion 5 about half of the failed soil debris would be transported by near bank flow in the form of suspended load with the remaining part depositing evenly in the bank toe region note that above assumptions were further illustrated in the following relevant sections along with the reasonability of the adoption of these assumptions for the study reach 3 2 morphodynamic module in this study the processes of flow and sediment transport are simulated using one dimensional 1d governing equations for shallow waters despite of some limitations such as the disability to present detailed distributions of velocity and shear stress the 1d representation is more cost effective for long term simulations in a long reach as compared with the more complex 2d and 3d models especially when coupled with a 2d simulation of ground water flow at each section the main objectives of this study are to simulate a long term bank erosion process in a relatively long reach and to investigate the soil property change and its influence on bank erosion therefore the 1d model was regarded as a more effective way to achieve these objectives in this study additionally many researchers reported relatively good empirical relationships between bank erosion degree and fluvial factors such as effective stream power annual mean discharge or bankfull discharge larsen et al 2006 henshaw et al 2013 xia et al 2014b these studies implied that in a long term sense bank erosion degree is mainly controlled by average flow characteristics in some alluvial rivers which makes the adoption of 1d model reasonable in this study considering the effect of tributary flow the 1d governing equations of water flow are written as xia et al 2015 1 q x b z t q l 2 q t g a α f b q 2 a 2 z x 2 α f q a q x q 2 a

important factor controlling the onset and the timing of bank failure darby et al 2007 rinaldi and nardi 2013 despite of acting as a destabilizing force an increase in the pore water pressure due to ground water flow can also cause the variation in bank soil properties covering an increase in unit weight and a reduction in shear and tensile strengths in addition ground water flow contributes to an additional erosion mechanism seepage erosion which is crucial for banks with some weak soil layers however this kind of erosion is not included in this study because it s seldom reported in the study reach as compared with the intensive fluvial erosion to the sandy lower layer of bank soil the emphasis is mainly placed on how the ground water flow induces changes in the soil properties in the ljr and thus influences the degree of bank stability the dynamic process of ground water flow is governed by the combined equation of darcy s law and mass conservation in a form extended to unsaturated conditions rinaldi et al 2008 which can be written as 6 x k x h g x y k y h g y q g θ t where hg is the total head m qg is the unit flux m3 s m3 θ is the volumetric water content m3 m3 and kx ky are respectively hydraulic conductivities in the x and y directions m s in this study bank soil was assumed to be isotropic in each layer which defines kx ky kh the governing equation was solved using the alternating direction implicit method adi with a rectangular mesh being adopted considering that bank is fairly steep in the ljr as shown in fig 1 a the mesh comprises 200 20 cells with the spatial interval δx being 0 30 m and δy ranging from 0 35 m to 0 65 m to successfully perform calculations of ground water flow it is important to parameterize the hydraulic and physical properties of bank soil and to set appropriate boundary conditions the parameterization mainly involves the determination of hydraulic conductivity kh and water content θ that would change with the varying pore water pressure for 100 saturated soil kh and θ are almost constant whereas the value of kh for unsaturated soil is highly dependent on θ that is in turn associated with the matric suction s the difference between pore air pressure ua and pore water pressure uw and moisture retention characteristic of the bank soil ng and shi 1998 empirical curves of conductivity kh s and volumetric water content θ s are always used to characterize the correlations stated above in this study due to the lack of direct measurements these curves were obtained from previous studies that reported similar soil properties for the cohesive layer the curves constructed by zhang et al 2014 were adopted fig 3 with a saturate conductivity of 1 00 10 7m s approximately equaling the measurement of 0 97 10 7 m s in the ljr for the non cohesive layer the curves of silty fine sand used by darby et al 2007 were employed fig 3 with the saturate conductivity 1 30 10 6 m s being slightly smaller than the measured value 2 04 10 6 m s in the ljr boundary conditions were setup in this study as follows i a total head versus time function was used on the basis of the stage hydrograph along the bank profile fig 4 ii a zero flux was assigned along the lower horizontal and left vertical boundaries fig 4 and iii two types of boundary conditions were adopted at the bank top fig 4 when the river stage was lower than the bank top a zero flux was defined without considering the effect of rainfall and evaporation however if the river stage overtopped the bank a total head versus time function was employed another key aspect of modeling ground water flow is related to mesh adaption in contrast to previous studies darby et al 2007 rinaldi et al 2008 luppi et al 2009 where the mesh was adjusted manually at each time step a fixed mesh was used in this study as the bank was eroded due to fluvial erosion and cantilever failure bank profile nodes bfn would be adjusted automatically on the basis of the original mesh and the eroded cell would be assigned to a specified head hs for easily distinguishing from other cells as shown in fig 4 in addition the boundary conditions would be applied to the new bank profile nodes to perform next calculation it should be noted that this method is not able to deal with the situation where the magnitude of fluvial erosion is less than the width of the boundary cell that is only a part of the boundary cell is eroded however this shortcoming can partially be compensated by using finer meshes with an acceptable computational penalty 3 4 module of mass failure the occurrence of cantilever failure includes two phases the formation of an overhanging cohesive upper block after the loss of the non cohesive lower soil due to intensive fluvial erosion and the collapse of the overhanging upper block under the combined actions of gravity and pore water pressure the detailed calculation procedure of fluvial erosion and bank stability degree for cantilever failure is described as follows 3 4 1 fluvial erosion at bank toe the fluvial erosion rate at bank toe is usually expressed as an empirical function of excess flow shear stress which can be written as darby et al 2007 7 ξ k d τ f τ c α where ξ is the fluvial erosion rate m s τf is the flow shear stress n m2 τc is the critical shear stress of the sandy bank soil n m2 kd is the erodibility coefficient m3 n s and α is an empirically derived exponent generally assumed to be 1 0 critical shear stress τc was obtained from the research of xia and zong 2015 which conducted a series of erosion testing in a glass flume to measure the incipient velocity and the critical shear stress of the soil samples collected in the jingjiang reach their research indicated that τc for the non cohesive layer has a range of 0 30 0 52 n m2 and it mostly varies from 0 26 to 1 18 n m2 for the cohesive layer however due to insufficient measurements spatial and temporal variations in τc were not available to be characterized in this study and the erodibility coefficient kd was calculated by the formula proposed by karmaker and dutta 2015 which gives k d 3 16 10 6 τ c 0 185 two corrections are made to include the effect of flow perturbation in a curved channel and to calculate the effective boundary shear stress the effective boundary shear stress skin drag component can be computed by τ g τ f n g n 2 where ng 0 0417 d50 1 6 chow 1959 with d50 being the median diameter of bank material m to include the effect of perturbations of velocity and depth due to the geometric curvature on the near bank shear stress two simplified formulas proposed by crosato 2007 were used to calculate an increase in the concave bank velocity ua m s and the super elevation of water surface ha m which are written as follows 8 u a λ 1 2 λ u h h a 2 δ 2 λ ub 2 r c 9 h a λ s 2 α κ 2 1 g κ c h 2 π 2 2 b r c where λ is the flow adaptation length given by λ c 2 h 2 g in which c is the chézy coefficient δ is a calibration parameter having a value of 0 2 crosato 2007 rc is the curvature radius of the channel centerline m α is a calibration coefficient κ is the von kármán constant 0 408 λs is the bed adaptation length m given by λ s 1 π 2 h b h 0 85 e θ s with e being a calibration coefficient and θ s being the shields parameter the boundary shear stress against the bank can be then calculated by τ f γ n 2 u toe f u a 2 r 1 3 where u toe is the velocity at bank toe m s and f equals 1 0 near the outer bank and 1 0 near the inner bank according to the measurements in the river bend of laijiapu in the ljr in 1964 before the cutoff the lateral slope of water surface ranged from 0 006 to 0 057 under a discharge of 11500 m3 s qian 1987 the longitudinal water surface slopes at the apex of bend were 0 085 0 204 the corresponding maximum difference was 0 04 m between the water surfaces near both banks qian 1987 with rc being about 1500 m in this bend wang 2014 therefore the coefficients in eq 9 were then calibrated by these measurements with δ 2 0 3 4 2 bank stability analysis bank stability analysis for cantilever failure of the upper soil layer was performed using an improved version of the method proposed by xia et al 2014a the method of xia et al 2014a adopted the critical overhanging width as the criterion for the occurrence of cantilever failure and accounted for the presence of bank top tension crack and the triangular distributions of tensile and compressive stresses this method was further improved here to include the hydrostatic confining force p and pore water pressure uw with the temporal changes in soil properties also being considered fig 5 it should be noted that the lower sandy layer was assumed to be effectively cohesionless with its loss being due completely to the fluvial erosion calculated by eq 7 this assumption is reasonable given the fact that bank profile in the ljr is fairly steep as shown in fig 1b so that the lower sandy layer cannot keep stable even under a low degree of fluvial erosion the distributions of the stresses acting on the potential failure block are shown in fig 5 at an equilibrium state the driving moment is just balanced by the resisting moment acting on the overhanging block which gives 10 w b c 2 m u h 1 h t 2 3 1 β 2 σ t β 2 h 1 h t 2 3 1 β 2 σ c m p where bc is the critical overhanging width m w is the weight of overhanging soil block kn m and w bch1γb h1 is the height of the overhanging block m ht is the tension crack depth m σt is the tensile strength kn m2 β is the ratio of tensile to compressive strength σc generally assumed to be 0 1 γb is the unit weight of the upper soil kn m3 mu is the moment of pore water pressure kn m m and m p is the moment of hydrostatic confining force kn m m eq 10 can be solved to obtain the critical overhanging width bc which gives 11 b c 2 σ t h 1 1 h t h 1 2 3 1 β γ b 2 m p m u h 1 γ b both the tensile strength σt and the unit weight γb would change with the volumetric water content θ during a hydrological year after obtaining the value of θ from the ground water flow module γb can be directly given by γb γd γwθ rinaldi et al 2008 where γd is the unit soil weight under completely dry conditions kn m3 γw is the unit water weight kn m3 based on the research of xia and zong 2015 σt of the cohesive upper bank soil in the jingjiang reach would generally decrease with an increase in mass water content ω θ γw γd and a linear relationship between σt and ω was established as shown in fig 6 3 4 3 lateral sediment source due to bank erosion according to the previous laboratory experiments xia and zong 2015 about 50 of the failed bank material would be transported by the near bank flow in the form of suspended load and the remaining would deposit in the bank toe region therefore 50 of the failed bank material was treated in this study as a lateral sediment source with an additional source term q sk b being introduced into the governing equation of suspended sediment transport eq 3 with two assumptions that failed bank material is evenly distributed within a spatial interval δxi and bank erosion rate is constant during the time interval δt q sk b can be calculated by 12 q sk b 0 5 p k b ρ b δ v δ t where δ v r v δ v i δ v i 1 2 with δ v i and δ v i 1 being respectively the unit length volume of bank erosion at the i and i 1 sections m3 m rv is assumed to be the ratio of the eroded bank line length to the total length within the sub reach of δxi p k b is the percentage of bank soil composition for the kth size fraction and ρ b is the dry density of bank soil kg m3 the remaining 50 of the failed bank material was assumed to be evenly deposited in the region between the thalweg and the bank toe point which would lead to a small increase of riverbed level in this region 4 model application the proposed model was used to simulate the processes of bed deformation and bank erosion in the study reach in 2005 hydrological year to assess model performance with the ground water flow module being first validated separately with an analytical solution for a simple steady state case 4 1 modeling of ground water flow in a steady state an analytical steady state solution presented by hou et al 2015 was used to evaluate the performance of ground water flow module a 10 m 10 m rectangular domain with homogenous hydraulic conductivity kh 1 m s was employed with constant total heads of 2 m and 10 m along the left and right vertical boundaries respectively as shown in fig 7 under these conditions the steady state solution of hou et al 2015 can be expressed by 13 z g 100 7 964 10 x where zg is the phreatic surface level m in terms of numerical solution of eq 6 a zero flux was defined on the top and bottom horizontal boundaries for this case the steady state solution was obtained through running the program until the relative difference between the total heads at two consecutive time steps was less than 1 in addition the phreatic surface was calculated on the basis that the pressure head on the phreatic surface should be equal to zero the calculated and analytical phreatic surfaces were compared in fig 7 with an average relative discrepancy of 7 being observed within 1 m distance from the left boundary within the remaining zone the calculated phreatic surface agreed relatively well with the analytical solution therefore the ground water flow module was considered to be able to produce solutions with enough accuracy however field or experimental data are still required to conduct further validation in future studies because hydraulic conductivity was constant herein whereas it would change with the matrix suction for unsaturated soil and the analytical steady state solution is not enough to characterize the complex transient nature of ground water flow 4 2 modeling of channel evolution in the jingjiang reach 4 2 1 model setup the hydrological year of 2005 in the yangtze river is conventionally defined as the period from october 2004 to october 2005 the required hydrological and sediment data topography and bed material composition at specified sections were obtained from the changjiang water resources committee cwrc the cross sectional profiles measured in october 2004 was adopted as the initial channel boundary condition with the bed material composition in 2003 being used due to lack of that in 2004 in the study reach totally 84 cross sectional profiles were used with 43 sections in the ujr and 41 sections in the ljr the spacing between two consecutive sections has an average value of 1 82 km with a maximum value of 4 66 km in a relatively straight sub reach and a minimum value of 0 48 km in a river bend owing to the absence of a hydrometric station at the entrance of the ljr at the section of jing82 in fig 1b the morphodynamic calculation was thus extended upstream to the shashi station in the ujr in fig 1b this means that the upstream boundary condition for the morphodynamic module was represented by the measured daily mean discharge and sediment concentration at shashi with the downstream boundary condition being characterized by the stage hydrograph at the jianli station however the ground water flow and mass failure modules can t be applied directly to the ujr because the bank soil composition and mass failure mechanisms in this reach significantly differ from that in the ljr and more details can refer to xia et al 2014b and xia and zong 2015 fortunately bank erosion in the extended part in the ujr was insignificant in the 2005 hydrological year due to the specific bank soil composition and the effective bank protection works with relatively obvious bank erosion occurring at only four sections out of 43 fixed sections in total therefore ignoring the process of bank erosion in this part would just slightly influence the calculated results of the study reach the discharge and graded suspended sediment concentrations in the tributary of ouchikou in the 2005 hydrological year were also collected from the cwrc and adopted as a lateral input of the morphodynamic module this tributary was dry during the period from december 2004 to june 2005 and diverted water from the main stream during the remaining months the maximum discharge of this tributary was 2922 m3 s carrying a maximum suspended sediment concentration of 1 43 kg m3 4 2 2 calculated hydrographs of water discharge and sediment concentration fig 8 a and b respectively show the comparisons between the calculated and measured discharge and suspended sediment concentration ssc at jianli in 2005 both the calculated hydrographs of discharge and sediment concentration closely agreed with the measurements with a root mean square error rmse of 589 m3 s and 0 05 kg m3 respectively the mean discharge at jianli was about 12 904 m3 s carrying a mean sediment concentration of 0 23 kg m3 therefore the value of rmse was one to two orders of magnitude less than the corresponding mean value in addition the calculated maximum discharge was 35 550 m3 s which was very close to the measured value of 35 700 m3 s the calculated highest ssc was about 1 40 kg m3 slightly lower than the measured ssc of 1 42 kg m3 the calculated river stage hydrographs also show close agreement with the measurements at different stage gauge stations the rmse and the correlation coefficient r between them at these stations are shown in table 1 along with the difference δz between the calculated and measured maximum river stages as illustrated in table 1 the rmse was enough small ranging from 0 24 m to 0 32 m as compared with the variation range of exceeding 10 m the value of r at each station was approximately equal to 1 0 and the maximum value of δz was just 0 31 m at tiaoguan based on these statistical parameters it can be concluded that the proposed model can reproduce the hydrographs of discharge sediment concentration and river stage with satisfying accuracy 4 2 3 calculated longitudinal channel profile the longitudinal channel profile is usually represented by the connection curve of mean main channel level at each section as demonstrated in fig 9 the calculated change in the longitudinal channel profile in the ljr generally agrees with the measurement the calculated reach averaged depth of bed incision was about 0 14 m in the ljr approximately equaling the measured value of 0 11 m the maximum discrepancy between the calculated and measured changes in the average bed level occurred at the section of shi3 with the calculated channel aggradation thickness of 1 85 m while the measurement showing a significant incision depth 3 31 m except for the section of shi3 the rsme was about 0 69 m between the calculated and measured changes in the average bed level at the remaining sections as compared with the variation range of 1 44 m to 1 95 m at these sections the value of rsme was generally acceptable therefore it can be concluded that the one dimensional morphodynamic module can predict the general trend of bed deformation in the study reach but may be not enough to correctly reproduce a rapid bed deformation at a specified section 4 2 4 calculated distribution of bank erosion sites although some researchers conducted various simulations of bank retreat processes in alluvial rivers darby et al 2002 rinaldi et al 2008 luppi et al 2009 they seldom presented a comparison between the predicted and measured bank erosion sites along a study reach which may be an important index for assessing model performance in this study the total retreat width wt at the bank top was adopted to represent the extent of bank erosion because of the convenience to directly calculate wt from the measured cross sectional profiles fig 10 a and b respectively show comparisons between the calculated and measured retreat widths along the left and the right banks in the lower part of the study reach in the ljr as shown in fig 10 the model prediction reflected the main distribution of bank erosion sites which could be described as follows i the calculation successfully captured the sites with the severest bank erosion wt 20 m which were located along the right banks from jing96 to jing99 in the shishou bend fig 10b and ii there were totally 12 sections with relatively higher bank erosion degrees wt 10 m and 7 of these sections were predicted by the proposed model however it should be noted that there were also discrepancies between the calculation and measurement at a few sections it was not predicted by the proposed model that the severe bank erosion wt 31 0 m at the left bank of shi3 and the erosion 20 m wt 11 m at the right banks of jing119 and shi7 the fundamental causes for these discrepancies may be i the insufficiency of relevant data to characterize the spatial variability in bank soil properties and ii the limitation of the 1d morphodynamic module in reflecting the shifting of main flow that may cause significant erosion at the convex bank such as the left bank at shi3 4 2 5 calculated variation in cross sectional profile at typical sections as described previously the severest bank erosion occurred along the right banks from jing96 to jing99 fig 11 where the main flow approached or impinged on with insufficient bank protection works this region suffered serious bank erosion after the operation of the tgp the changes in the cross sectional profile at these four typical sections are shown in fig 11a d respectively the calculated cross sectional profiles at jing97 and jing98 agreed well with the measurements whereas there were some obvious differences at other sections the bank tops at jing97 and jing99 was calculated to retreat respectively by 25 2 m and 27 7 m which were close to the measured values of 23 8 m and 23 7 m however the calculated retreat width 15 2 m at jing96 was smaller than the measured value by 7 0 m and the calculated value 33 3 m at jing98 was 10 8 m greater than the measured value 5 discussion this section is devoted to provide further insights into the seasonal variations in bank soil properties critical overhanging width of cohesive upper soil and temporal distribution of cantilever failure events it was also investigated that the effects of roughness coefficient varying water content transport ratio of failed debris and secondary flow on bank erosion 5 1 change in bank soil properties the emphasis was placed on the variations in the volumetric water content and tensile strength of the cohesive upper bank soil in the study reach fig 12 a b show respectively these variations at the right banks of the sections of jing95 and jing98 these two sections were selected because they represented two distinct cases without and with cantilever failures which allowed for the investigation into how cantilever failure would influence the change in soil properties besides levels of the bank top at these two sections were both equal to 35 0 m with a slight difference in river stage as illustrated in fig 12a the volumetric water content θ exhibited a seasonal variation tendency similar to the river stage during the dry period the value of θ was not influenced by the river stage keeping a constant level of 16 it started to increase in the rising period when the river stage approached the upper cohesive layer in the flood period the average value of θ was about 35 at jing95 and 24 at jing98 approximately 1 2 and 0 5 times larger than the initial value 16 during the drawdown of the river stage the value of θ gradually decreased to 30 and 18 at jing95 and jing98 respectively in addition the volumetric water content at jing95 was obviously higher than that at jing98 and decreased more slowly in the recession period this was attributed to a series of cantilever failure events at jing98 which caused the bank face to retreat into inner dry region and thus induced lower water contents near the bank face this phenomenon was similar to the findings of darby et al 2007 which indicated that the pore water pressure near the bank face would decrease as the bank face retreats into the inner dry region the tensile strength σt followed an inverse trend of the water content decreasing in the rising and flood periods and thereafter increasing in the recession period σt had a minimum value of 8 11 n m2 at jing95 and 8 88 n m2 at jing98 in the flood period that were respectively 63 and 69 of the initial value fig 12b although the tensile strength showed a recovery in the recession period it was generally still lower than the initial value incorporating with the removal of hydrostatic confining force the reduced tensile strength would have an unfavorable impact on bank stability during the recession period 5 2 change in critical overhanging width the temporal changes in the critical overhanging width bc at jing98 calculated by eq 11 and by the formula of xia et al 2014a are illustrated in fig 13 in general the values of bc calculated by these two methods both decreased during the rising period and then increased during the recession period however the temporal trends of bc calculated by these methods were different during high flood flows this difference gives an insight into how the hydrostatic confining force and pore water pressure influence the critical overhanging width the critical width calculated by the formula of xia et al 2014a ignoring the hydrostatic confining force and pore water pressure showed a decrease in the flood period this change trend arose from the variation in the tensile strength described previously and the unit weight of bank soil in addition it was also in accordance with the finding of darby et al 2007 on the change trend of the safety factor for shear type cantilever failure which also neglected the influence of hydrostatic confining force by contrast the overhanging widths calculated by eq 11 showed sharp gradients and much higher values during the high flood flows the reasons for these characteristics may be explained further as follows i during the dry period and the late recession period the river stage and ground water level were both too low to directly influence the upper cohesive soil through exerting hydraulic confining force and pore water pressure on bank soil there was no difference between these two equations as the values of both mp and mu were equal to zero in eq 11 ii during the rising period even though the river stage was slightly higher than the contact of two soil layers it only insignificantly influenced the upper soil layer leading to a small value of mp mu in eq 11 iii during the flood period the flow was characterized by a high and rapidly changing river stage which could influence almost the whole bank thus a high confining force was exerted on the upper bank soil with a relatively lower pore water pressure due to the rapid change in river stage and the lower permeability of the upper cohesive soil causing a larger value of mp mu in eq 11 it should be noted that during the rapid decrease of river stage in the flood period the critical width also sharply decreased in addition to the intensive fluvial erosion in this period this may cause a higher occurrence frequency of cantilever failure additionally it can be inferred that the hydrostatic confining force can have a great influence on the critical overhanging width of cantilever failure in the ljr but only during the high flows 5 3 temporal distribution of cantilever failure events fig 14 gives the temporal change in the cumulative frequency of cantilever failure events the ratio of the cumulative number of cantilever failure events at a point in time to the total number in the end of the right bank at jing98 as shown in fig 14 cantilever failure events predominantly occurred in the flood period accounting for 68 the total failure events primarily due to the intensive fluvial erosion in this period as compared with the rising period the occurrence of cantilever failure in the recession period was more frequent with a cumulative frequency of 21 it s worth noting that the obtained results herein was slightly different from that obtained by rinaldi et al 2008 which concluded that the most unstable conditions occurred during the period between the drawdown phase of a peak flow event and the initial rising phase of a subsequent peak flow event this difference could partially be attributed to the differences between the morphological and hydrological conditions in the current study reach and the study reach of rinaldi et al 2008 furthermore in their research the shifting of main flow toward the convex bank reduced the boundary shear stress acting on the concave bank during the high flows which caused a lower fluvial erosion degree and a relatively higher degree of bank stability however the shifting of the main flow cannot be correctly predicted by the 1d morphdynamic model therefore further studies are required to clarify the effect of main flow shifting on bank stability in the current study reach 5 4 effects of bed roughness coefficient the above simulation is herein referred to as case i with case ii being set up to demonstrate the effect of roughness coefficient on bank erosion the retreat widths along the study reach were recalculated in case ii where the roughness coefficient was increased by 0 005 on the basis of the correctly calibrated values in case i table 2 fig 15 shows the comparison between the calculated river stage in case ii and the measurement at shishou it can be seen that there was a big difference between the calculation and measurement with the rsme being 0 50 m as compared with the value of 0 24 m in case i however there were only insignificant changes in water discharge and sediment concentration with the values of rsme being 615 m3 s and around 0 05 kg m3 at the hydrometric station of jianli respectively therefore it can be concluded that the impacts of roughness coefficient on flow and sediment conditions are mainly represented by that on river stage fig 16 shows the comparison between the bank retreat widths under these two cases as indicated in fig 16 the calculated retreat width in case ii was slightly smaller than that case i with the average retreat width at four typical sections jing96 jing99 being reduced by 1 5 m in case ii this is because i a higher river stage fig 15 under the same discharge led to a lower velocity and a lower shear stress τf and ii the effective flow shear stress τg is inversely proportional to the square of n and thus the value of τg would decrease with an increase in n both would cause a lower degree of fluvial erosion and thus a smaller bank retreat width 5 5 effect of varying water content on bank erosion fig 17 shows the occurrence timing and cumulative number of cantilever failures at the right bank of jing98 in two cases of constant 16 and varying water contents obtained by eq 6 in the case of constant water content the ground water flow was not considered with the groundwater table being assumed to equal the bank toe level the total bank retreat widths under these two scenarios had an insignificant difference with the retreat width in the case of varying water content being just 0 47 m greater than that in the first case this was because the presence of upper overhanging block was caused by the loss of the lower non cohesive soil and thus the total retreat width was mainly determined by the lateral fluvial erosion to the lower non cohesive layer furthermore the occurrence of cantilever failure at jing98 actually in turn reduced the impact of water content to some extent fig 12 the influence of varying water content on bank erosion process was mainly represented by its impact on the occurrence timing of cantilever failure events indicated by the triangles and dots in fig 17 additionally the varying water content caused a larger total number 37 of cantilever failure events as compared with the value of 35 in the first case 5 6 effects of other factors the effects of flow perturbation secondary flow and transport ratio of the failed debris were discussed herein the bank retreat width along the study reach was recalculated in case iii without the correction for flow perturbation the calculated results show there was an insignificant difference between the calculated results in case i and case iii therefore the perturbations in the water depth and stream wise primary velocity seem to not play an important role in bank erosion processes in the ljr three test runs were conducted to illustrate the effects of the transport ratio of failed block on ssc and on bank erosion with three ratios of 100 50 and 0 being used the calculated results show that both bank retreat width and ssc had just relatively insignificant differences between these test runs the maximum difference of daily averaged ssc between these runs was just 0 053 kg m3 at the outlet station of jianli which accounted for 23 of the annual average value of ssc the maximum difference of sediment amount was less than 0 6 of the measured amount at jianli besides the difference of retreat width at jing98 was negligible between these test runs in terms of secondary flow jansen et al 1979 proposed a formula for calculating the transverse component of boundary shear stress τ t which gives τ t 2 ρ h u 2 r c g 1 2 κ c 2 g 1 2 κ c 3 with ρ being the water density kg m3 on the basis of this formula τ t accounted for less than 17 of the corresponding streamwise shear stress in the study reach with the minimum value of rc being about 1200 m therefore bank erosion in the study reach seems dominantly controlled by the primary flow conditions however secondary flow also shows a relatively significant effect on the bank erosion in a sharply curved bend this reveals the limitation of the proposed 1d model that it is not enough to correctly characterize the near bank complex flow conditions and cannot account for the effect of secondary flow on bank erosion in a sharply curved river bend 6 conclusions a coupled model for bed deformation and bank erosion was proposed in this study with the interactions between three distinct contributing processes being considered the model integrated the morphodynamic module with the ground water flow and mass failure modules with its performance being assessed through comparing the calculated results with the corresponding measurements in the jingjiang reach in addition the temporal change in soil properties and the temporal distribution of cantilever failure events were investigated following conclusions can be drawn from this study i the calculated results showed relatively close agreement with the measurements in terms of water discharge and sediment concentration at the outlet section river stage hydrographs at different water gauge stations bank erosion sites longitudinal channel profile and typical cross sectional profiles ii the volumetric water content and tensile strength of the upper cohesive bank soil exhibited a seasonal variation due to the ground water flow the volumetric water content increased in the rising and flood periods and thereafter slowly decreased in the recession period the tensile strength showed an inverse trend of the water content however a full recovery to the initial value usually could not be attained for both of them iii the critical overhanging width of cantilever failure was generally lowered in the rising and recession periods because of the reduced tensile strength and the increased unit weight of bank soil however during high flood flows a rapid change in river stage caused a sharp increase and then a decrease in the critical width iv the temporal distribution of cantilever failure events indicated a dominant role of fluvial erosion in triggering cantilever failure with almost 68 the total cantilever failure events occurring during the flood period with the most intensive fluvial erosion the effect of secondary flow on bank erosion was relatively significant in a sharply curved river bend in the ljr the influence of varying water content on bank erosion process was mainly represented by its impact on the occurrence timing of cantilever failure events the limitations of the proposed model lie in that 1 the 1d representation of morphodynamic module was not enough to characterize the near bank complex flow condition in local regions and the rapid bed deformation at a specified section 2 the deposition break up and transport processes of failed soil debris were not considered in detail along with the effect of failed debris on subsequent mass failure and 3 the detailed deformation of lower non cohesive layer was not included instead an average erosion rate was calculated therefore in future studies a multi dimensional representation of morphodynamic processes along with improved modules for failed debris break up and transport and for detailed bank slope deformation can be adopted to better characterize the complex processes of bed deformation

6811,assessing flood frequency is pivotal for hydrology with implications for many fields ranging from river science to the insurance industry reservoir regulation may alter the characteristics of the flood frequency distribution function this paper incorporates reservoir impacts as an inherent variable to derive an analytical solution of outflow peaks and proposes new flood frequency distributions steps are as follows 1 the original flood without reservoir impacts is assumed to follow a pearson type iii distribution 2 linear and nonlinear reservoir models including numerical integration and triangular area calculation methods are proposed to simulate the relationships between inflow and outflow peaks and 3 the flood frequency distributions resulting from reservoir impacts are derived derived equations are applied to the shuibuya and wuqiangxi reservoirs in china results show that 1 although the numerical integration method with the nonlinear model is comparable with the reservoir flood routing the triangle area calculation method with the nonlinear model is recommended for its accuracy and simplicity 2 the reservoir regulation changes the flood frequency distribution function entirely in the nonlinear reservoir model while only change the parameter in the linear reservoir model and 3 downstream flood s cv can be increased or decreased which depends on the reservoir regulating capacity it is indicated that altering the parameters of the flood frequency distribution is not sufficient to characterize watershed under reservoir control this paper proposes the analytical solution about inflow and outflow peaks which can point out the possible changes in the watershed with reservoir construction in plan keywords flood frequency distribution reservoir models outflow inflow relationships 1 introduction floods are one of the most destructive natural hazards resulting in economic damages and deaths it is crucial for water managers to characterize the flood frequency lópez and francés 2013 flood frequency analysis which estimates the probability of extreme flooding events based on a mathematical frequency distribution is a key tool to characterize flood risk and predict flood events set insurance rates basso et al 2015 blöschl and sivapalan 1997 brath et al 2006 yin et al 2018b traditional flood frequency analysis is based on the statistics of historical flows spence and brown 2016 xu et al 2016 yoon et al 2016 derived flood frequency functions can reflect catchment characteristics eagleson 1972 moore 1997 flood events result from three processes precipitation runoff generation and concentration and river routing three steps are essential to derive the flood frequency function including a rainfall model runoff model and transformation between them botter et al 2009 sivapalan et al 2005 derived a quasi analytical flood frequency model to illustrate the effects of seasonality showing that the seasonality and variability of storm characteristics directly impact the flood frequency distribution in addition the seasonality of rainfall and evapotranspiration has an indirect impact on the magnitudes of the flood peaks blöschl and sivapalan 1997 basso et al 2016 also proposed a novel physically based approach to estimate the flood frequency function the formulation incorporates the climate and landscape conditions of the contributing catchment spence and brown 2016 with the increasing demand on water resources caused by the development of human society human activities have substantially altered natural hydrologic cycles botter et al 2013 gao et al 2017 hounkpè et al 2015 yin et al 2018a the construction of reservoirs not only changes the partitioning of water storage but also alters the flood routing processes ayalew et al 2013 deng et al 2015a feng et al 2016 ming et al 2018 the regulation rules have been adopted as one of the most useful tools in preventing floods and operating seasonal streamflow maoyuan et al 2017 ming et al 2017 yang et al 2018 therefore recent flood frequency analysis tends to combine conventional statistical methods with increased consideration of reservoir regulation impacts deng et al 2015b guo et al 2013 hounkpè et al 2015 reservoirs have significant impacts on hydrological characteristics especially the temporal variation of maximum flows liebe et al 2009 ming et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2011 studies comparing rivers before and after reservoir construction show decreases in flood peak discharges and inter annual variability during the regulation period batalla et al 2004 lajoie et al 2007 magilligan and nislow 2005 however traditional frequency analysis is less sensitive to reservoir impacts and there is no analytical solution to predict reservoir impacts in the flood frequency distribution function hejazi et al 2008 lópez and francés 2013 wolski and murray hudson 2008 this paper attempts to illustrate reservoir impacts on flood frequency distributions by deriving flood frequency equations under linear and nonlinear reservoir models two methods numerical integration and triangular area are used to calculate flood magnitudes the analytical solutions about inflow and outflow peaks are proposed in this paper which can illustrate the possible changes in flood magnitudes resulting from reservoirs the shuibuya sby and wuqiangxi wqx reservoirs in china are selected for case studies 2 methodology the derived flood frequency distribution functions are based on the assumptions that the flood events are independent and the distribution parameters are constant in the derivation processes the inflow discharge is assumed to be triangular throughout the paper while the outflow discharge is based on either linear or nonlinear models as shown in fig 1 the steps for the derivation are as follows 1 without reservoir impacts the original flood is assumed to follow a pearson type iii distribution 1 f q β α γ α q δ α 1 e β q δ α 0 β 0 q δ where q is the annual maximum flow and β α and δ are scale shape and location parameters respectively note that the pearson type iii distribution has been widely used in statistical hydrology as a model of both original and logarithmically transformed streamflow sequences koutrouvelis and canavos 1999 the pearson type iii distribution was recommended as the national standard distribution for flood frequency analysis by the ministry of water resources of china wang et al 2015 2 as indicated in fig 2 the inflow discharge can be simplified into two stages first a monotonically increasing linear function then a monotonically decreasing function the resulting piecewise inflow discharge function is as follows 2 i t at 0 t t 1 bt a t 1 b t 1 t t 1 where i t is the reservoir inflow discharge at time t since the start of the flood event a and b are parameters to simulate the linear inflow process and t1 is the time of the inflow peak 3 the relationships between inflow and outflow peaks are based on linear and nonlinear reservoir models numerical integration and triangle area methods are proposed for both models the derived equations between inflow and outflow peaks are then verified using observed flood discharge data specifically in order to describe the reservoir flood routing regulation rules of a typical overflow spillway can be simplified into three stages a when flood discharge is lower than an inflow threshold the discharge is acceptable and safe for the downstream watershed no regulation is needed and the outflow discharge will be equal to the inflow discharge b when streamflow is above the threshold the reservoir regulates the flood and the outflow discharge is smaller than the inflow discharge c when flood discharge exceeds the maximum threshold of the reservoir the outflow discharge will also be released as uncontrolled free overflow and equal to the inflow discharge even for multiple purposed reservoirs the flood control is the most importance and should be priority 4 the four equations between inflow and outflow peaks are substituted into the pearson type iii distribution and the flood frequency distribution equations resulting from reservoir impacts are derived the following sections consist of four methods numerical integration method in the linear reservoir model method 1 triangular area calculation method in the linear reservoir model method 2 numerical integration method in the nonlinear reservoir model method 3 triangular area calculation method in the nonlinear reservoir model method 4 2 1 linear reservoir model reservoir routing can be simulated using a linear reservoir model tallaksen 1995 in which it is assumed that reservoir storage has a linear relationship with outflow discharge 3 v t k o t where v t is the reservoir storage at time t o t is the total outflow discharge at time t including discharge for hydropower generation and discharge from spillways and k is a reservoir storage coefficient when the inflow discharge for a single flood event is simplified into a piecewise linear model the inflow discharge is given by eq 2 the reservoir water balance assuming the evapotranspiration is negligible suggests that inflow and outflow are related to storage by horton 1938 4 i t o t dv t dt 2 1 1 method 1 numerical integration method as shown in fig 2 when the inflow discharge is larger than the outflow discharge the reservoir storage will be increased the maximum reservoir control for flood storage occurs when the outflow discharge equals to the inflow discharge which is also when the outflow discharge reaches its peak combining the eqs 2 to 4 and solving the linear differential equation the outflow discharge throughout the flood event can be written as follows 5 o t ak e t k a t a k 0 t t 1 λ e t k b t b k a t 1 b t 1 t t 1 where λ is a parameter to simulate the outflow process in order to build the relationship between inflow and outflow peaks the time of the outflow peak is derived and substituted into the eq 5 the combination results in the first order nonhomogeneous linear differential equations and the detailed derivation procedures are shown in appendix a taking the reservoir regulation rules into consideration the equation for the outflow flood peak can be written as follows 6 o m i m 0 i m i s b ln bk λ i m b t 1 i s i m i v i m i m i v where im is the inflow flood peak om is the outflow flood peak is is the inflow threshold iv is the maximum regulated inflow which is related to the maximum reservoir storage for flood control the iv has different relationships with the maximum reservoir control for flood storage in different methods in the method 1 the relationship can be shown as follows 7 i v v m k b ln bk λ b t 1 where vm is the maximum reservoir control for flood storage to determine flood frequency of downstream of a reservoir the relationships between inflow and outflow peaks can be substituted into the original frequency distribution equation influenced by the reservoir regulation rules the frequency distribution equation should be divided into three stages the modified flood frequency distribution is as follows 8 f o m β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ 0 i m i s β α γ α b ln bk λ i m b t 1 δ α 1 e β b ln bk λ i m b t 1 δ i s i m i v β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ i m i v comparing the modified eq 8 with the original eq 1 the reservoir impacts are considered as the inherent parameters in the derived equation the eq 8 is a piecewise function influenced by the reservoir regulation rules the frequency distribution still follows the pearson type iii distribution while the inherent variable has been changed by the partial derivative of outflow discharges in the second stage 2 1 2 method 2 triangular area calculation method this research presents a simple second method to determine the flood routing processes by approximating the inflow as a triangle which avoids complex subsection derivation procedures zhang 2017 the maximum reservoir storage for flood control occurs at the time when the inflow and outflow hydrographs intersect which is when i t o t and therefore dv dt 0 the inflow discharges are induced by the reservoir regulations which result in the change in reservoir storage the total flood water stored in the reservoir at this time is equal to the area of triangle abd as shown in fig 2 the area of triangle abd is the difference between triangle abc which is the total inflow and triangle bcd which is the total outflow the maximum flood storage can therefore be calculated as follows 9 v m 1 2 t w i m 1 2 t w o m where tw is the flood routing time interval to derive the equation of outflow peaks during reservoir regulation eqs 3 and 9 can be combined because the maximum outflow occurs at the same time as the maximum reservoir control for flood storage the relationship between im and om can be written as follows 10 o m i m 0 i m i s t w t w 2 k i m i s i m i v i m i m i v substituting the relationship between the inflow and outflow peaks into the original frequency distribution the flood frequency distribution under reservoir impacts can be shown as follows 11 f o m β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ 0 i m i s t w t w 2 k β α γ α t w t w 2 k o m α 1 e β t w t w 2 k o m δ i s i m i v β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ i m i v the equation about the iv in the method 2 can be expressed as follows 12 i v t w 2 k k t w v m like for the numerical integration method section 2 1 1 the frequency distribution still follows the pearson type iii distribution in the first and third stages in accordance with the numerical integration method the frequency distribution resulting from the triangle method retains a pearson type iii distribution in the second stage however the probability density function has a reservoir related coefficient in the second stage reflecting peak flow attenuation influenced by the reservoir 2 2 nonlinear reservoir model the linear reservoir model is widespread but it has limited applicability in practice benettin et al 2015 deng et al 2015b within a geomorphologically homogeneous region there is frequently a power law relationship between surface area and storage cheng et al 2014 kuria and vogel 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 van bemmelen et al 2016 combining the relationships between reservoir storage and area outflow discharge and water level the result is a nonlinear reservoir model that can be formulated as follows the detailed derivation is shown in appendix b 13 v t c o 2 t where c is a reservoir parameter this section explores flood frequencies resulting from a nonlinear reservoir specifically this section assumes a nonlinear relationship between reservoir storage and outflow discharge but still simplifies reservoir inflow processes into a piecewise linear model 2 2 1 method 3 numerical integration method same as in section 2 1 for linear reservoirs the rate of storage change is equal to inflow discharge minus outflow discharge eq 4 which can be expressed as follows for a nonlinear reservoir 14 i t 1 c v t 0 5 dv t dt the analytical solution of the above differential equation is as follow the following equation also assume triangular inflow and the detailed derivation is shown in appendix c 15 1 2 ln 2 v t t v t 1 2 ct σ 1 σ 2 1 4 c 2 arctan v t 1 2 t 1 4 c σ 2 1 4 c 2 c ln t where c is the integration constant and σ is the inflow supply rate the above implicit function cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions instead the newton raphson method is used to calculate the numerical solution of reservoir storage v t and outflow discharge o t for the duration of the storm event substituting the resulting equation into the original frequency distribution the flood frequency distribution function is as follows 16 f o m β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ 0 i m i s o m β α γ α o m δ α 1 e β o m δ i s i m i v β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ i m i v where o t is the partial derivative of o t which was obtained numerically the iv in the method 3 cannot be expressed by the analytical equation which is also estimated by a numerical method comparing eq 16 with the eq 1 the frequency distribution downstream of a nonlinear reservoir depends on reservoir characteristics during the second stage corresponding to active reservoir regulation in addition the value of the maximum regulated inflow has changed the numerical solution for the nonlinear reservoir model is complicated to apply however this equation can be used to evaluate the error of the triangular area calculation method section 2 1 2 2 2 2 method 4 triangular area calculation method an alternative and simpler solution can be obtained if it is assumed that the inflow and outflow can be approximated as triangles then as discussed in the section 2 1 2 there is a simple equation for maximum reservoir control for flood storage eq 9 to derive the equation of outflow peaks affected by nonlinear reservoir regulation combine eqs 9 and 13 using the quadratic equation the resulting relationship between inflow and outflow peaks can be demonstrated to be 17 o m i m 0 i m i s t w i m 2 c t w 2 16 c 2 0 5 t w 4 c i s i m i v i m i m i v substituting eq 17 into the original frequency distribution eq 1 the flood frequency distribution under reservoir impacts can be shown to be 18 f o m β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ 0 i m i s t 4 a t w i m 2 c t w 2 16 c 2 0 5 t w 4 c 0 5 β α γ α t w i m 2 c t w 2 16 c 2 0 5 t w 4 c δ α 1 e β t w i m 2 c t w 2 16 c 2 0 5 t w 4 c δ i s i m i v β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ i m i v the equation about the iv in the method 4 can be expressed as follows 19 i v 2 v m t w v m 0 5 comparing eq 19 with eq 1 it is clear that the reservoir impacts the flood frequency distribution during the second stage the nonlinear regulated frequency distribution still reserves the scale shape and location parameters of the original pearson type iii distribution however the equation has been altered by the partial derivative of outflow discharges in short the flood frequency distribution no longer follows the pearson type iii distribution 3 case study to validate the derived flood frequency distribution functions resulting from reservoir regulations the shuibuya sby and wuqiangxi wqx reservoirs located in china are used for case studies as shown in fig 3 the sby reservoir is on the qingjiang river the sby reservoir is the first cascade hydropower project on the qingjiang main stem and the operated in concert with the adjacent geheyan and gaobazhou reservoirs it is approximately 117 km upstream of the city of enshi and 92 km upstream of the geheyan hydropower project approximately 300 000 people live downstream of the sby reservoir liu et al 2011b yu et al 2014 the sby reservoir has a total storage volume of 15 64 106 m3 the sby reservoir s normal water level is 400 m above sea level which is the initial storage water level jiang et al 2017 liu et al 2011a zhou et al 2014 the sby reservoir s maximum reservoir control for flood storage is approximately 4 594 109 m3 the 0 1 probability design flood has a discharge of 17 600 m3 s the construction of sby reservoir began in october 2002 construction finished in 2006 and the reservoir was filled from 2006 to 2007 the reservoir operation period is 2007 2009 the project was fully completed in 2009 and the reservoir has been operational since as shown in fig 4 the wqx reservoir is on the main stem of the yuan river the wqx reservoir was constructed to provide flood control hydroelectric power generation and navigation approximately 115 800 people live downstream of the wqx reservoir du et al 2013 liu et al 2004 the reservoir supports a 1200 wm power station along with a three stage ship lock initial construction on the dam began in 1986 and construction on the dam s hydroelectric generators began in 1989 all five generators were operational by 1996 the wqx reservoir s normal water level is 108 m and the corresponding reservoir capacity is 2 99 billion m3 the wqx reservoir s maximum reservoir control for flood storage is 4 29 109 m3 the regulated reservoir capacity is 2 02 109 m3 the 0 1 probability design flood has a discharge of 49 320 m3 s 3 1 estimation of distribution parameters to produce independent events the annual maximum streamflow was calculated for each of the sby and wqx daily streamflow records the coefficient of variation cv and the deviation coefficient cs were estimated to characterize the shape of the frequency distributions the cv is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean in addition the annual maximum streamflow values were ranked in descending order to calculate the empirical flood frequency for the sby reservoir the watershed parameters are assumed to be constant over the period from 1951 to 2013 62 years the parameters of the pearson type iii distribution are calculated by the linear moment method hosking 1990 wang et al 2015 the parameters of sby reservoir construction period is also used in the verification of derived equations liu et al 2011b the pearson type iii distribution was used in the design process of sby reservoir table 1 the cv is 0 48 the cs is 1 14 for the wqx reservoir the reservoir inflow and outflow data are recorded from 1995 to 2016 the distribution parameters for inflows are also estimated by the linear moment method table 2 hosking 1990 the cv is estimated as 0 4 the cs is calculated as 0 17 and the watershed parameters are assumed to be constant over a short time period 22 years 3 2 application to the sby reservoir the linear reservoir model simplifies the practical regulation process into a linear process while the nonlinear reservoir models are related to the practical reservoir regulation rules the results consist of two parts 1 the inflow and outflow relationship curves based on the four derived methods and 2 a comparison between the four derived flood frequency distributions and the observed flows 3 2 1 the inflow outflow relationship curves of the four methods the sby reservoir outflow discharges were calculated using flood routing functions based on the sby reservoir design data to ensure the safety of downstream areas the sby flood routing rules are as follows 1 if the flood return period is less than 20 years the reservoir water level is limited to less than 397 m 2 when the inflow discharge is greater than the regulating threshold but less than the reservoir flood discharge capacity the outflow discharge is set to be equal to the inflow discharge 3 when the inflow discharge is greater than the reservoir capacity the outflow discharge is set to be equal to the maximum discharge capacity of the reservoir feng et al 2017 liu et al 2011a liu et al 2011b the inflow observations and outflow estimates are compared in the inflow outflow relationship curves fig 5 the derived equations have an average error of less than 0 05 which can be used in estimation the outflow discharges from methods 1 and 2 linear reservoir model are larger than those from methods 3 and 4 nonlinear reservoir model method 3 has a relative error with a value of 0 04 which is less than the value of relative error using method 4 the linear reservoir model simplifies the irregular outflow process into a straight linear process which results in the enlargement of the outflow discharges the nonlinear reservoir model can simulate the processes of reservoir regulation more practical suggesting that the numerical integration method is more accurate than the triangular area calculation method in conclusion the methods 3 and 4 have smaller discharges than methods 1 and 2 when the exceedance probability is less than 5 method 4 3 2 2 the frequency curves of the four methods the original unregulated and derived regulated frequency distributions were calculated from the inflow observations and outflow estimates by ranking in order to calculate the exceedance probability for large flood discharges the reservoir reduces the discharge significantly for discharges less than the minimum regulated inflow threshold the reservoir outflow will be equal to the inflow as a consequence the outflow observations are distinctly smaller than the inflow observations at large flood discharges while equal to the inflow observations at small flood discharges comparing the four derived equations for the outflow with the pearson type iii distribution for the inflow the derived flood frequency distributions of two reservoir models have shown clear differences in shape and location thus the reservoir has altered the original distribution substantially the frequency curves of methods 1 and 2 have larger discharges than methods 3 and 4 when the exceedance probability is less than 5 which validates the inflow outflow relationship curves the frequency curves fig 6 also shows that the linear reservoir model predicts higher discharges than the flood routing outflow estimates and nonlinear reservoir model predictions in addition as a result of the sby reservoir regulation rules the four derived outflow frequency equations have a boundary that is influenced by the storage capacity and regulation rules of the reservoir because the inflow threshold is in the sby reservoir is 5960 m3 s the derived methods are acceptable based on the upper and lower boundary discharges see fig 6 3 3 application to the wqx reservoir the derived inflow outflow relationships and flood frequency equations are also applied to the wqx reservoir the results can be divided into two parts 1 the inflow outflow relationships based on the four derived methods and 2 a comparison between the flood frequency curves of the derived distributions and the observed distribution 3 3 1 the inflow outflow relationship curves of the four methods flood observations for the wqx reservoir for 22 years are compared with the four derived methods the four methods have an average error less than 0 1 which is acceptable for frequency analysis method 3 has a relative error with a value of 0 08 which is less than the value of relative error in method 4 the outflow discharge observations in the wqx reservoir have higher dispersion degree than that of the sby reservoir which results in larger relative errors it is shown that methods 3 and 4 nonlinear reservoir model predict higher outflow peaks than methods 1 and 2 linear reservoir model when the inflow peak is small and this situation is reversed when the inflow peak is large note that the growth rate of methods 3 and 4 is slower under a higher inflow discharge as a consequence of the linear reservoir model methods 1 and 2 retain their uniform monotonicity whereas methods 3 and 4 based on the nonlinear reservoir model are monotonically nonuniform see fig 7 3 3 2 the frequency curves of the four methods the derived and original frequency distributions are compared in fig 8 the inflow and outflow observations are ranked in order to calculate the exceedance probability fig 8 shows that the derived frequency curves have different shapes and locations compared with the original frequency curve the pearson type iii distribution is used to fit the inflow discharges whereas the four derived distributions are used to fit the outflow discharges under various reservoir impacts the frequency curves of methods 3 and 4 have smaller discharges than methods 1 and 2 when the exceedance probability is less than 5 which validates the inflow outflow relationship curves according to the wqx reservoir regulation rules the flood discharge will not be decreased under a certain discharge threshold is 8000 m3 s the four derived equations are applied to the flood frequency curve based on the upper and lower boundary discharges 4 discussion 4 1 flood event with two peaks the assumption in the derivation processes are based on the flood events with one peak which does not cover the practical situations completely for simplicity the flood event with two peaks is used to clarify this issue according to the flood design calculation criteria the main peak flood will be delayed and considered as a dominant event the regulation rules for flood events with two peaks can be categorized as follows 1 if the reservoir water level is lower than the flood control level and the first flood discharge is small this inflow discharge does not impact on the assumptions and derivations the flood is initially released by the reservoir at a fixed volume of discharge as the water level in the reservoir increases the volume of outflow will be enlarged by the reservoir a schematic diagram is shown in the fig 9 the reservoir starts to regulate the inflow floods at point b in the figure the shape of the outflow discharge is determined by the regulation rules which can be simulated by a single triangle in this case the first flood peak will not influence the current capacity of reservoir vm and so the method proposed in the manuscript can be applied 2 when the first flood event is smaller than the second flood event and they are regulated by the reservoir twice two triangles can be simulated to calculate the outflow discharge to determine the impacts of two flood peaks on the derivation method the flood events in the sby reservoirs were investigated fig 10 is based on data from sby reservoir in 1997 which include flood event with two peaks the outflow discharges are calculated by the flood routing functions the inflow discharges are regulated by the sby reservoir twice and so two triangles are elaborated to simulate this process under the assumption of a linear reservoir the following equations can be formed 20 v m 1 2 t x i x o x 1 2 t w i m o m where tx is the time interval of first flood event ix is the smaller inflow peak of flood event ox is the outflow peak of first flood event as a result the relationship between inflow and outflow peaks can be derived as 21 o m t x i x o x 2 k t w t w 2 k t w i m this derived eq 21 is based on the double triangular area calculation method it is uniform with eq 10 and both equations have a scale factor in front of im in the second regulated stage it is clear that the starting condition of relationship between inflow and outflow peaks has been changed as a consequence the maximum outflow discharge will be enlarged by the influence of the first flood peak the 1997 year s flood event in sby reservoir is adopted as a case study to verify the derived equation see fig 11 note that the triangular area calculation method has a relative error of 0 11 whereas the double triangular area calculation method has a relative error of 0 047 in conclusion the flood events with two peaks can be approximately derived based on the assumption of one triangle 3 when the first flood event is bigger than the second flood event and reservoir is not full after the first flood event the situation is shown in the fig 12 the maximum extreme values of outflow discharges are points b and f which are on the inflow discharge curve the peak outflow discharge occurs at point f and its corresponding reservoir storage is vm the area difference between inflow triangles oac deg and outflow triangles obc dfg is calculated as reservoir storage using the triangular area calculation method based on the linear reservoir model the equation can be formulated as follows 22 k o m 1 2 t x i m o x 1 2 t w i x o m as a result the relationship between inflow and outflow peaks can be derived as o m t x i m o x 2 k t w t w 2 k t w i x it is indicated in the above equation that the outflow discharge peak is influenced both by the first and second flood events compared the above equation with the original equation o m t w 2 k t w i m it is clear that the second flood event has changed the outflow peak 4 when the first flood event is bigger than the second flood event and the reservoir is full after the first flood event the situation is shown in the fig 13 the outflow reaches its maximum flood control discharge at point b as the reservoir is full the second flood event will be released as uncontrolled free overflow based on the regulation rules the area of curve oab is equal to maximum reservoir control for flood storage as a consequence the outflow discharge will be equal to the inflow discharge after point b which is the three stage in the piecewise functions and the outflow peak will equal to the second inflow flood peak in this situation 4 2 the reservoir impacts on cv a reservoir impact index rii is defended as follows lópez and francés 2013 23 rii j 1 m s j ams t y where m is the number of the reservoirs ty is the time of one year ams is the annual average streamflow sj is the maximum storage capacity of reservoir j recently wang et al 2017 showed that cv increases with rii until a threshold value beyond which cv decreases with rii the values of cv in both linear and nonlinear models were calculated and verified the triangular area calculation methods in both models were adopted the wqx and sby reservoirs are selected for a case study and the results were as follows 4 2 1 linear reservoir model as shown in method 2 the flood frequency distribution eq 10 still follows a pearson type iii distribution during regulation by a linear reservoir moreover the cv maintains the same value in both the pre dam and post dam periods 4 2 2 nonlinear reservoir model on the other hand the flood frequency distributions during regulation by a nonlinear reservoir does not follow a pearson type iii distribution any more the maximum reservoir control for flood storage vm is related to the reservoir regulating capacity which is positively correlated with the rii the relationship between vm and cv is plotted in fig 14 these findings in fig 14 are consistent with the conclusion drawn by wang et al 2017 even though they used numerical analysis rather than continuous derived functions the equation about cv can be formulated by calculating the mean value and standard deviation of outflow peaks 24 cv n 1 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 i m i 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 i m i i 1 n 1 i m i n 2 1 n 2 i 1 n 2 o m i 1 n 2 i 1 n 2 o m i i 1 n 2 o m i n 3 1 n 3 i 1 n 3 i m i 1 n 3 i 1 n 3 i m i i 1 n 3 i m i where i represents the order of discharge in the data n1 is the number of the inflow discharges between 0 and is n2 is the number of the inflow discharges between is and iv n3 is the number of the inflow discharges which is larger than iv the derived frequency distribution is a piecewise function the regulation stages can be divided into three parts as follows 1 when the maximum reservoir control for flood storage is relatively small the flood discharge is not influenced so the value of cv remains constant and the same as the cv of the inflow 2 when the maximum reservoir control for flood storage increases but is smaller than the maximum regulated discharge some of the outflow peaks exceed the minimum regulated inflow so are calculated using equation for the second stage and larger inflow peaks have not been induced which increases the dispersion degree so the value of cv increases 3 finally the maximum reservoir control for flood storage is large enough all the inflow peaks are regulated and calculated by the equation for the second stage thus the value of cv also decreases 5 conclusions flood generation consists of three processes precipitation runoff generation and concentration and river routing reservoir construction changes the runoff generation and river routing processes this paper considers the impacts of reservoir regulation on flood frequency distribution functions for the first time equations are developed for flood frequency distribution resulting from reservoir regulation of a realistic yet simple piecewise linear inflow specially triangular area and numerical integration methods both linear and nonlinear reservoir models are introduced in this paper the numerical integration methods for both linear and nonlinear reservoir models are theoretical precise yet complicated thus more suitable for estimating calculation errors associated with the simpler triangular area calculation method the triangular area calculation method for estimating outflow peaks for the linear reservoir model is less accurate than that for the nonlinear reservoir model thus method 4 is recommended to estimate the flood frequency distribution in a watershed experiencing reservoir regulation the case study of sby and wqx reservoirs confirms that reservoirs have remarkable influence on the flood frequency distribution in particular reducing flood peaks and altering the form and parameters of the distribution of floods that exceed a minimum regulated inflow equations are derived that can be used to predict the changes of flood discharge and frequency considering reservoir impacts in addition flood events with two peaks are also taken into consideration the derived equations in this paper can be applied to flood frequency analysis resulting from reservoir regulation finally it should be noted that the estimation of reservoir impacts still has some uncertainty further study is needed to provide a comprehensive consideration of reservoir impacts on flood frequency analysis acknowledgments this study was supported by the national key research and

6811,assessing flood frequency is pivotal for hydrology with implications for many fields ranging from river science to the insurance industry reservoir regulation may alter the characteristics of the flood frequency distribution function this paper incorporates reservoir impacts as an inherent variable to derive an analytical solution of outflow peaks and proposes new flood frequency distributions steps are as follows 1 the original flood without reservoir impacts is assumed to follow a pearson type iii distribution 2 linear and nonlinear reservoir models including numerical integration and triangular area calculation methods are proposed to simulate the relationships between inflow and outflow peaks and 3 the flood frequency distributions resulting from reservoir impacts are derived derived equations are applied to the shuibuya and wuqiangxi reservoirs in china results show that 1 although the numerical integration method with the nonlinear model is comparable with the reservoir flood routing the triangle area calculation method with the nonlinear model is recommended for its accuracy and simplicity 2 the reservoir regulation changes the flood frequency distribution function entirely in the nonlinear reservoir model while only change the parameter in the linear reservoir model and 3 downstream flood s cv can be increased or decreased which depends on the reservoir regulating capacity it is indicated that altering the parameters of the flood frequency distribution is not sufficient to characterize watershed under reservoir control this paper proposes the analytical solution about inflow and outflow peaks which can point out the possible changes in the watershed with reservoir construction in plan keywords flood frequency distribution reservoir models outflow inflow relationships 1 introduction floods are one of the most destructive natural hazards resulting in economic damages and deaths it is crucial for water managers to characterize the flood frequency lópez and francés 2013 flood frequency analysis which estimates the probability of extreme flooding events based on a mathematical frequency distribution is a key tool to characterize flood risk and predict flood events set insurance rates basso et al 2015 blöschl and sivapalan 1997 brath et al 2006 yin et al 2018b traditional flood frequency analysis is based on the statistics of historical flows spence and brown 2016 xu et al 2016 yoon et al 2016 derived flood frequency functions can reflect catchment characteristics eagleson 1972 moore 1997 flood events result from three processes precipitation runoff generation and concentration and river routing three steps are essential to derive the flood frequency function including a rainfall model runoff model and transformation between them botter et al 2009 sivapalan et al 2005 derived a quasi analytical flood frequency model to illustrate the effects of seasonality showing that the seasonality and variability of storm characteristics directly impact the flood frequency distribution in addition the seasonality of rainfall and evapotranspiration has an indirect impact on the magnitudes of the flood peaks blöschl and sivapalan 1997 basso et al 2016 also proposed a novel physically based approach to estimate the flood frequency function the formulation incorporates the climate and landscape conditions of the contributing catchment spence and brown 2016 with the increasing demand on water resources caused by the development of human society human activities have substantially altered natural hydrologic cycles botter et al 2013 gao et al 2017 hounkpè et al 2015 yin et al 2018a the construction of reservoirs not only changes the partitioning of water storage but also alters the flood routing processes ayalew et al 2013 deng et al 2015a feng et al 2016 ming et al 2018 the regulation rules have been adopted as one of the most useful tools in preventing floods and operating seasonal streamflow maoyuan et al 2017 ming et al 2017 yang et al 2018 therefore recent flood frequency analysis tends to combine conventional statistical methods with increased consideration of reservoir regulation impacts deng et al 2015b guo et al 2013 hounkpè et al 2015 reservoirs have significant impacts on hydrological characteristics especially the temporal variation of maximum flows liebe et al 2009 ming et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2011 studies comparing rivers before and after reservoir construction show decreases in flood peak discharges and inter annual variability during the regulation period batalla et al 2004 lajoie et al 2007 magilligan and nislow 2005 however traditional frequency analysis is less sensitive to reservoir impacts and there is no analytical solution to predict reservoir impacts in the flood frequency distribution function hejazi et al 2008 lópez and francés 2013 wolski and murray hudson 2008 this paper attempts to illustrate reservoir impacts on flood frequency distributions by deriving flood frequency equations under linear and nonlinear reservoir models two methods numerical integration and triangular area are used to calculate flood magnitudes the analytical solutions about inflow and outflow peaks are proposed in this paper which can illustrate the possible changes in flood magnitudes resulting from reservoirs the shuibuya sby and wuqiangxi wqx reservoirs in china are selected for case studies 2 methodology the derived flood frequency distribution functions are based on the assumptions that the flood events are independent and the distribution parameters are constant in the derivation processes the inflow discharge is assumed to be triangular throughout the paper while the outflow discharge is based on either linear or nonlinear models as shown in fig 1 the steps for the derivation are as follows 1 without reservoir impacts the original flood is assumed to follow a pearson type iii distribution 1 f q β α γ α q δ α 1 e β q δ α 0 β 0 q δ where q is the annual maximum flow and β α and δ are scale shape and location parameters respectively note that the pearson type iii distribution has been widely used in statistical hydrology as a model of both original and logarithmically transformed streamflow sequences koutrouvelis and canavos 1999 the pearson type iii distribution was recommended as the national standard distribution for flood frequency analysis by the ministry of water resources of china wang et al 2015 2 as indicated in fig 2 the inflow discharge can be simplified into two stages first a monotonically increasing linear function then a monotonically decreasing function the resulting piecewise inflow discharge function is as follows 2 i t at 0 t t 1 bt a t 1 b t 1 t t 1 where i t is the reservoir inflow discharge at time t since the start of the flood event a and b are parameters to simulate the linear inflow process and t1 is the time of the inflow peak 3 the relationships between inflow and outflow peaks are based on linear and nonlinear reservoir models numerical integration and triangle area methods are proposed for both models the derived equations between inflow and outflow peaks are then verified using observed flood discharge data specifically in order to describe the reservoir flood routing regulation rules of a typical overflow spillway can be simplified into three stages a when flood discharge is lower than an inflow threshold the discharge is acceptable and safe for the downstream watershed no regulation is needed and the outflow discharge will be equal to the inflow discharge b when streamflow is above the threshold the reservoir regulates the flood and the outflow discharge is smaller than the inflow discharge c when flood discharge exceeds the maximum threshold of the reservoir the outflow discharge will also be released as uncontrolled free overflow and equal to the inflow discharge even for multiple purposed reservoirs the flood control is the most importance and should be priority 4 the four equations between inflow and outflow peaks are substituted into the pearson type iii distribution and the flood frequency distribution equations resulting from reservoir impacts are derived the following sections consist of four methods numerical integration method in the linear reservoir model method 1 triangular area calculation method in the linear reservoir model method 2 numerical integration method in the nonlinear reservoir model method 3 triangular area calculation method in the nonlinear reservoir model method 4 2 1 linear reservoir model reservoir routing can be simulated using a linear reservoir model tallaksen 1995 in which it is assumed that reservoir storage has a linear relationship with outflow discharge 3 v t k o t where v t is the reservoir storage at time t o t is the total outflow discharge at time t including discharge for hydropower generation and discharge from spillways and k is a reservoir storage coefficient when the inflow discharge for a single flood event is simplified into a piecewise linear model the inflow discharge is given by eq 2 the reservoir water balance assuming the evapotranspiration is negligible suggests that inflow and outflow are related to storage by horton 1938 4 i t o t dv t dt 2 1 1 method 1 numerical integration method as shown in fig 2 when the inflow discharge is larger than the outflow discharge the reservoir storage will be increased the maximum reservoir control for flood storage occurs when the outflow discharge equals to the inflow discharge which is also when the outflow discharge reaches its peak combining the eqs 2 to 4 and solving the linear differential equation the outflow discharge throughout the flood event can be written as follows 5 o t ak e t k a t a k 0 t t 1 λ e t k b t b k a t 1 b t 1 t t 1 where λ is a parameter to simulate the outflow process in order to build the relationship between inflow and outflow peaks the time of the outflow peak is derived and substituted into the eq 5 the combination results in the first order nonhomogeneous linear differential equations and the detailed derivation procedures are shown in appendix a taking the reservoir regulation rules into consideration the equation for the outflow flood peak can be written as follows 6 o m i m 0 i m i s b ln bk λ i m b t 1 i s i m i v i m i m i v where im is the inflow flood peak om is the outflow flood peak is is the inflow threshold iv is the maximum regulated inflow which is related to the maximum reservoir storage for flood control the iv has different relationships with the maximum reservoir control for flood storage in different methods in the method 1 the relationship can be shown as follows 7 i v v m k b ln bk λ b t 1 where vm is the maximum reservoir control for flood storage to determine flood frequency of downstream of a reservoir the relationships between inflow and outflow peaks can be substituted into the original frequency distribution equation influenced by the reservoir regulation rules the frequency distribution equation should be divided into three stages the modified flood frequency distribution is as follows 8 f o m β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ 0 i m i s β α γ α b ln bk λ i m b t 1 δ α 1 e β b ln bk λ i m b t 1 δ i s i m i v β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ i m i v comparing the modified eq 8 with the original eq 1 the reservoir impacts are considered as the inherent parameters in the derived equation the eq 8 is a piecewise function influenced by the reservoir regulation rules the frequency distribution still follows the pearson type iii distribution while the inherent variable has been changed by the partial derivative of outflow discharges in the second stage 2 1 2 method 2 triangular area calculation method this research presents a simple second method to determine the flood routing processes by approximating the inflow as a triangle which avoids complex subsection derivation procedures zhang 2017 the maximum reservoir storage for flood control occurs at the time when the inflow and outflow hydrographs intersect which is when i t o t and therefore dv dt 0 the inflow discharges are induced by the reservoir regulations which result in the change in reservoir storage the total flood water stored in the reservoir at this time is equal to the area of triangle abd as shown in fig 2 the area of triangle abd is the difference between triangle abc which is the total inflow and triangle bcd which is the total outflow the maximum flood storage can therefore be calculated as follows 9 v m 1 2 t w i m 1 2 t w o m where tw is the flood routing time interval to derive the equation of outflow peaks during reservoir regulation eqs 3 and 9 can be combined because the maximum outflow occurs at the same time as the maximum reservoir control for flood storage the relationship between im and om can be written as follows 10 o m i m 0 i m i s t w t w 2 k i m i s i m i v i m i m i v substituting the relationship between the inflow and outflow peaks into the original frequency distribution the flood frequency distribution under reservoir impacts can be shown as follows 11 f o m β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ 0 i m i s t w t w 2 k β α γ α t w t w 2 k o m α 1 e β t w t w 2 k o m δ i s i m i v β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ i m i v the equation about the iv in the method 2 can be expressed as follows 12 i v t w 2 k k t w v m like for the numerical integration method section 2 1 1 the frequency distribution still follows the pearson type iii distribution in the first and third stages in accordance with the numerical integration method the frequency distribution resulting from the triangle method retains a pearson type iii distribution in the second stage however the probability density function has a reservoir related coefficient in the second stage reflecting peak flow attenuation influenced by the reservoir 2 2 nonlinear reservoir model the linear reservoir model is widespread but it has limited applicability in practice benettin et al 2015 deng et al 2015b within a geomorphologically homogeneous region there is frequently a power law relationship between surface area and storage cheng et al 2014 kuria and vogel 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 van bemmelen et al 2016 combining the relationships between reservoir storage and area outflow discharge and water level the result is a nonlinear reservoir model that can be formulated as follows the detailed derivation is shown in appendix b 13 v t c o 2 t where c is a reservoir parameter this section explores flood frequencies resulting from a nonlinear reservoir specifically this section assumes a nonlinear relationship between reservoir storage and outflow discharge but still simplifies reservoir inflow processes into a piecewise linear model 2 2 1 method 3 numerical integration method same as in section 2 1 for linear reservoirs the rate of storage change is equal to inflow discharge minus outflow discharge eq 4 which can be expressed as follows for a nonlinear reservoir 14 i t 1 c v t 0 5 dv t dt the analytical solution of the above differential equation is as follow the following equation also assume triangular inflow and the detailed derivation is shown in appendix c 15 1 2 ln 2 v t t v t 1 2 ct σ 1 σ 2 1 4 c 2 arctan v t 1 2 t 1 4 c σ 2 1 4 c 2 c ln t where c is the integration constant and σ is the inflow supply rate the above implicit function cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions instead the newton raphson method is used to calculate the numerical solution of reservoir storage v t and outflow discharge o t for the duration of the storm event substituting the resulting equation into the original frequency distribution the flood frequency distribution function is as follows 16 f o m β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ 0 i m i s o m β α γ α o m δ α 1 e β o m δ i s i m i v β α γ α i m δ α 1 e β i m δ i m i v where o t is the partial derivative of o t which was obtained numerically the iv in the method 3 cannot be expressed by the analytical equation which is also estimated by a numerical method comparing eq 16 with the eq 1 the frequency distribution downstream of a nonlinear reservoir depends on reservoir characteristics during the second stage corresponding to active reservoir regulation in addition the value of the maximum regulated inflow has changed the numerical solution for the nonlinear reservoir model is complicated to apply however this equation can be used to evaluate the error of the triangular area calculation method section 2 1 2 2 2 2 method 4 triangular area calculation method an alternative and simpler solution can be obtained if it is assumed that the inflow and outflow can be approximated as triangles then as discussed in the section 2 1 2 there is a simple equation for maximum reservoir control for flood storage eq 9 to derive the equation of outflow peaks affected by nonlinear reservoir regulation combine eqs 9 and 13 using the quadratic equation the resulting relationship between inflow and outflow peaks can be demonstrated to be 17 o m i m 0 i m i s t w i m 2 c t w 2 16 c 2 0 5 t w 4 c i s i m i v i m i m i v substituting eq 17 into the original frequency distribution eq 1 the flood frequency distribution under reservoir impacts can be shown to be 18 f o m β α γ α i m

i m δ i m i v the equation about the iv in the method 4 can be expressed as follows 19 i v 2 v m t w v m 0 5 comparing eq 19 with eq 1 it is clear that the reservoir impacts the flood frequency distribution during the second stage the nonlinear regulated frequency distribution still reserves the scale shape and location parameters of the original pearson type iii distribution however the equation has been altered by the partial derivative of outflow discharges in short the flood frequency distribution no longer follows the pearson type iii distribution 3 case study to validate the derived flood frequency distribution functions resulting from reservoir regulations the shuibuya sby and wuqiangxi wqx reservoirs located in china are used for case studies as shown in fig 3 the sby reservoir is on the qingjiang river the sby reservoir is the first cascade hydropower project on the qingjiang main stem and the operated in concert with the adjacent geheyan and gaobazhou reservoirs it is approximately 117 km upstream of the city of enshi and 92 km upstream of the geheyan hydropower project approximately 300 000 people live downstream of the sby reservoir liu et al 2011b yu et al 2014 the sby reservoir has a total storage volume of 15 64 106 m3 the sby reservoir s normal water level is 400 m above sea level which is the initial storage water level jiang et al 2017 liu et al 2011a zhou et al 2014 the sby reservoir s maximum reservoir control for flood storage is approximately 4 594 109 m3 the 0 1 probability design flood has a discharge of 17 600 m3 s the construction of sby reservoir began in october 2002 construction finished in 2006 and the reservoir was filled from 2006 to 2007 the reservoir operation period is 2007 2009 the project was fully completed in 2009 and the reservoir has been operational since as shown in fig 4 the wqx reservoir is on the main stem of the yuan river the wqx reservoir was constructed to provide flood control hydroelectric power generation and navigation approximately 115 800 people live downstream of the wqx reservoir du et al 2013 liu et al 2004 the reservoir supports a 1200 wm power station along with a three stage ship lock initial construction on the dam began in 1986 and construction on the dam s hydroelectric generators began in 1989 all five generators were operational by 1996 the wqx reservoir s normal water level is 108 m and the corresponding reservoir capacity is 2 99 billion m3 the wqx reservoir s maximum reservoir control for flood storage is 4 29 109 m3 the regulated reservoir capacity is 2 02 109 m3 the 0 1 probability design flood has a discharge of 49 320 m3 s 3 1 estimation of distribution parameters to produce independent events the annual maximum streamflow was calculated for each of the sby and wqx daily streamflow records the coefficient of variation cv and the deviation coefficient cs were estimated to characterize the shape of the frequency distributions the cv is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean in addition the annual maximum streamflow values were ranked in descending order to calculate the empirical flood frequency for the sby reservoir the watershed parameters are assumed to be constant over the period from 1951 to 2013 62 years the parameters of the pearson type iii distribution are calculated by the linear moment method hosking 1990 wang et al 2015 the parameters of sby reservoir construction period is also used in the verification of derived equations liu et al 2011b the pearson type iii distribution was used in the design process of sby reservoir table 1 the cv is 0 48 the cs is 1 14 for the wqx reservoir the reservoir inflow and outflow data are recorded from 1995 to 2016 the distribution parameters for inflows are also estimated by the linear moment method table 2 hosking 1990 the cv is estimated as 0 4 the cs is calculated as 0 17 and the watershed parameters are assumed to be constant over a short time period 22 years 3 2 application to the sby reservoir the linear reservoir model simplifies the practical regulation process into a linear process while the nonlinear reservoir models are related to the practical reservoir regulation rules the results consist of two parts 1 the inflow and outflow relationship curves based on the four derived methods and 2 a comparison between the four derived flood frequency distributions and the observed flows 3 2 1 the inflow outflow relationship curves of the four methods the sby reservoir outflow discharges were calculated using flood routing functions based on the sby reservoir design data to ensure the safety of downstream areas the sby flood routing rules are as follows 1 if the flood return period is less than 20 years the reservoir water level is limited to less than 397 m 2 when the inflow discharge is greater than the regulating threshold but less than the reservoir flood discharge capacity the outflow discharge is set to be equal to the inflow discharge 3 when the inflow discharge is greater than the reservoir capacity the outflow discharge is set to be equal to the maximum discharge capacity of the reservoir feng et al 2017 liu et al 2011a liu et al 2011b the inflow observations and outflow estimates are compared in the inflow outflow relationship curves fig 5 the derived equations have an average error of less than 0 05 which can be used in estimation the outflow discharges from methods 1 and 2 linear reservoir model are larger than those from methods 3 and 4 nonlinear reservoir model method 3 has a relative error with a value of 0 04 which is less than the value of relative error using method 4 the linear reservoir model simplifies the irregular outflow process into a straight linear process which results in the enlargement of the outflow discharges the nonlinear reservoir model can simulate the processes of reservoir regulation more practical suggesting that the numerical integration method is more accurate than the triangular area calculation method in conclusion the methods 3 and 4 have smaller discharges than methods 1 and 2 when the exceedance probability is less than 5 method 4 3 2 2 the frequency curves of the four methods the original unregulated and derived regulated frequency distributions were calculated from the inflow observations and outflow estimates by ranking in order to calculate the exceedance probability for large flood discharges the reservoir reduces the discharge significantly for discharges less than the minimum regulated inflow threshold the reservoir outflow will be equal to the inflow as a consequence the outflow observations are distinctly smaller than the inflow observations at large flood discharges while equal to the inflow observations at small flood discharges comparing the four derived equations for the outflow with the pearson type iii distribution for the inflow the derived flood frequency distributions of two reservoir models have shown clear differences in shape and location thus the reservoir has altered the original distribution substantially the frequency curves of methods 1 and 2 have larger discharges than methods 3 and 4 when the exceedance probability is less than 5 which validates the inflow outflow relationship curves the frequency curves fig 6 also shows that the linear reservoir model predicts higher discharges than the flood routing outflow estimates and nonlinear reservoir model predictions in addition as a result of the sby reservoir regulation rules the four derived outflow frequency equations have a boundary that is influenced by the storage capacity and regulation rules of the reservoir because the inflow threshold is in the sby reservoir is 5960 m3 s the derived methods are acceptable based on the upper and lower boundary discharges see fig 6 3 3 application to the wqx reservoir the derived inflow outflow relationships and flood frequency equations are also applied to the wqx reservoir the results can be divided into two parts 1 the inflow outflow relationships based on the four derived methods and 2 a comparison between the flood frequency curves of the derived distributions and the observed distribution 3 3 1 the inflow outflow relationship curves of the four methods flood observations for the wqx reservoir for 22 years are compared with the four derived methods the four methods have an average error less than 0 1 which is acceptable for frequency analysis method 3 has a relative error with a value of 0 08 which is less than the value of relative error in method 4 the outflow discharge observations in the wqx reservoir have higher dispersion degree than that of the sby reservoir which results in larger relative errors it is shown that methods 3 and 4 nonlinear reservoir model predict higher outflow peaks than methods 1 and 2 linear reservoir model when the inflow peak is small and this situation is reversed when the inflow peak is large note that the growth rate of methods 3 and 4 is slower under a higher inflow discharge as a consequence of the linear reservoir model methods 1 and 2 retain their uniform monotonicity whereas methods 3 and 4 based on the nonlinear reservoir model are monotonically nonuniform see fig 7 3 3 2 the frequency curves of the four methods the derived and original frequency distributions are compared in fig 8 the inflow and outflow observations are ranked in order to calculate the exceedance probability fig 8 shows that the derived frequency curves have different shapes and locations compared with the original frequency curve the pearson type iii distribution is used to fit the inflow discharges whereas the four derived distributions are used to fit the outflow discharges under various reservoir impacts the frequency curves of methods 3 and 4 have smaller discharges than methods 1 and 2 when the exceedance probability is less than 5 which validates the inflow outflow relationship curves according to the wqx reservoir regulation rules the flood discharge will not be decreased under a certain discharge threshold is 8000 m3 s the four derived equations are applied to the flood frequency curve based on the upper and lower boundary discharges 4 discussion 4 1 flood event with two peaks the assumption in the derivation processes are based on the flood events with one peak which does not cover the practical situations completely for simplicity the flood event with two peaks is used to clarify this issue according to the flood design calculation criteria the main peak flood will be delayed and considered as a dominant event the regulation rules for flood events with two peaks can be categorized as follows 1 if the reservoir water level is lower than the flood control level and the first flood discharge is small this inflow discharge does not impact on the assumptions and derivations the flood is initially released by the reservoir at a fixed volume of discharge as the water level in the reservoir increases the volume of outflow will be enlarged by the reservoir a schematic diagram is shown in the fig 9 the reservoir starts to regulate the inflow floods at point b in the figure the shape of the outflow discharge is determined by the regulation rules which can be simulated by a single triangle in this case the first flood peak will not influence the current capacity of reservoir vm and so the method proposed in the manuscript can be applied 2 when the first flood event is smaller than the second flood event and they are regulated by the reservoir twice two triangles can be simulated to calculate the outflow discharge to determine the impacts of two flood peaks on the derivation method the flood events in the sby reservoirs were investigated fig 10 is based on data from sby reservoir in 1997 which include flood event with two peaks the outflow discharges are calculated by the flood routing functions the inflow discharges are regulated by the sby reservoir twice and so two triangles are elaborated to simulate this process under the assumption of a linear reservoir the following equations can be formed 20 v m 1 2 t x i x o x 1 2 t w i m o m where tx is the time interval of first flood event ix is the smaller inflow peak of flood event ox is the outflow peak of first flood event as a result the relationship between inflow and outflow peaks can be derived as 21 o m t x i x o x 2 k t w t w 2 k t w i m this derived eq 21 is based on the double triangular area calculation method it is uniform with eq 10 and both equations have a scale factor in front of im in the second regulated stage it is clear that the starting condition of relationship between inflow and outflow peaks has been changed as a consequence the maximum outflow discharge will be enlarged by the influence of the first flood peak the 1997 year s flood event in sby reservoir is adopted as a case study to verify the derived equation see fig 11 note that the triangular area calculation method has a relative error of 0 11 whereas the double triangular area calculation method has a relative error of 0 047 in conclusion the flood events with two peaks can be approximately derived based on the assumption of one triangle 3 when the first flood event is bigger than the second flood event and reservoir is not full after the first flood event the situation is shown in the fig 12 the maximum extreme values of outflow discharges are points b and f which are on the inflow discharge curve the peak outflow discharge occurs at point f and its corresponding reservoir storage is vm the area difference between inflow triangles oac deg and outflow triangles obc dfg is calculated as reservoir storage using the triangular area calculation method based on the linear reservoir model the equation can be formulated as follows 22 k o m 1 2 t x i m o x 1 2 t w i x o m as a result the relationship between inflow and outflow peaks can be derived as o m t x i m o x 2 k t w t w 2 k t w i x it is indicated in the above equation that the outflow discharge peak is influenced both by the first and second flood events compared the above equation with the original equation o m t w 2 k t w i m it is clear that the second flood event has changed the outflow peak 4 when the first flood event is bigger than the second flood event and the reservoir is full after the first flood event the situation is shown in the fig 13 the outflow reaches its maximum flood control discharge at point b as the reservoir is full the second flood event will be released as uncontrolled free overflow based on the regulation rules the area of curve oab is equal to maximum reservoir control for flood storage as a consequence the outflow discharge will be equal to the inflow discharge after point b which is the three stage in the piecewise functions and the outflow peak will equal to the second inflow flood peak in this situation 4 2 the reservoir impacts on cv a reservoir impact index rii is defended as follows lópez and francés 2013 23 rii j 1 m s j ams t y where m is the number of the reservoirs ty is the time of one year ams is the annual average streamflow sj is the maximum storage capacity of reservoir j recently wang et al 2017 showed that cv increases with rii until a threshold value beyond which cv decreases with rii the values of cv in both linear and nonlinear models were calculated and verified the triangular area calculation methods in both models were adopted the wqx and sby reservoirs are selected for a case study and the results were as follows 4 2 1 linear reservoir model as shown in method 2 the flood frequency distribution eq 10 still follows a pearson type iii distribution during regulation by a linear reservoir moreover the cv maintains the same value in both the pre dam and post dam periods 4 2 2 nonlinear reservoir model on the other hand the flood frequency distributions during regulation by a nonlinear reservoir does not follow a pearson type iii distribution any more the maximum reservoir control for flood storage vm is related to the reservoir regulating capacity which is positively correlated with the rii the relationship between vm and cv is plotted in fig 14 these findings in fig 14 are consistent with the conclusion drawn by wang et al 2017 even though they used numerical analysis rather than continuous derived functions the equation about cv can be formulated by calculating the mean value and standard deviation of outflow peaks 24 cv n 1 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 i m i 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 i m i i 1 n 1 i m i n 2 1 n 2 i 1 n 2 o m i 1 n 2 i 1 n 2 o m i i 1 n 2 o m i n 3 1 n 3 i 1 n 3 i m i 1 n 3 i 1 n 3 i m i i 1 n 3 i m i where i represents the order of discharge in the data n1 is the number of the inflow discharges between 0 and is n2 is the number of the inflow discharges between is and iv n3 is the number of the inflow discharges which is larger than iv the derived frequency distribution is a piecewise function the regulation stages can be divided into three parts as follows 1 when the maximum reservoir control for flood storage is relatively small the flood discharge is not influenced so the value of cv remains constant and the same as the cv of the inflow 2 when the maximum reservoir control for flood storage increases but is smaller than the maximum regulated discharge some of the outflow peaks exceed the minimum regulated inflow so are calculated using equation for the second stage and larger inflow peaks have not been induced which increases the dispersion degree so the value of cv increases 3 finally the maximum reservoir control for flood storage is large enough all the inflow peaks are regulated and calculated by the equation for the second stage thus the value of cv also decreases 5 conclusions flood generation consists of three processes precipitation runoff generation and concentration and river routing reservoir construction changes the runoff generation and river routing processes this paper considers the impacts of reservoir regulation on flood frequency distribution functions for the first time equations are developed for flood frequency distribution resulting from reservoir regulation of a realistic yet simple piecewise linear inflow specially triangular area and numerical integration methods both linear and nonlinear reservoir models are introduced in this paper the numerical integration methods for both linear and nonlinear reservoir models are theoretical precise yet complicated thus more suitable for estimating calculation errors associated with the simpler triangular area calculation method the triangular area calculation method for estimating outflow peaks for the linear reservoir model is less accurate than that for the nonlinear reservoir model thus method 4 is recommended to estimate the flood frequency distribution in a watershed experiencing reservoir regulation the case study of sby and wqx reservoirs confirms that reservoirs have remarkable influence on the flood frequency distribution in particular reducing flood peaks and altering the form and parameters of the distribution of floods that exceed a minimum regulated inflow equations are derived that can be used to predict the changes of flood discharge and frequency considering reservoir impacts in addition flood events with two peaks are also taken into consideration the derived equations in this paper can be applied to flood frequency analysis resulting from reservoir regulation finally it should be noted that the estimation of reservoir impacts still has some uncertainty further study is needed to provide a comprehensive consideration of reservoir impacts on flood frequency analysis acknowledgments this study was supported by the national key research and

6812,diffusion is the dominating process in the migration of contaminants through landfill liners below which the soils are generally unsaturated analytical method is often considered as a preferred approach over numerical method to solve diffusion problems in this study a one dimensional diffusion model of contaminants is firstly developed to account for unsaturated properties of the soils beneath landfill barriers based on an assumption of linear water pressure distribution the nonlinear governing equation in the diffusion model is transformed into a linear equation using an exponential expression of soil water retention curve and a linear model of unsaturated diffusion coefficient subsequently the corresponding analytical solution is obtained and the solution is then applied to investigate the effects of soil type water pressure condition and groundwater depth on the diffusion of contaminants the analytical results show that groundwater depth has the most influential effect on the steady flux rate of contaminants furthermore the obtained steady flux rates in soil layers with high desaturation rate are negligible when the groundwater depth exceeds 3 m and 2 m the results also indicate that a thicker soil layer with high desaturation rate is recommended to be an effective diffusion barrier to mitigate the pollution of the underlying soils and groundwater keywords analytical solution landfill liner unsaturated diffusion groundwater 1 introduction landfilling has been the main way to deal with solid wastes all over the world during the last few decades a common practice is to build a barrier system at the bottom of the landfill to isolate the landfill from the underlying soil mass however previous studies have shown that the barrier system cannot completely prevent the transport of contaminants although the geomembranes used in the system have a very low hydraulic conductivity this observation is related to the complex flow behavior of the contaminants in the barriers and the underlying soil mass foose 2002 leij et al 1993 han et al 2016 rowe 2005 liang et al 2016 samadder et al 2017 thus it is crucial to understand the migration characteristics of contaminants in the barrier system and the underlying soil mass in order to assess and control the level of contaminations it is generally accepted that due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the barrier system molecular diffusion dominates the migration of contaminants in the landfill barriers rowe et al 1988 johnson 1989 liu and ball 1998 it is well known that water content in unsaturated soils determines the coefficient of diffusion and thus the leakage rate in the barrier systems however the analytical solution regarding the unsaturated diffusion problem has rarely been developed due to the difficulty caused by the nonlinear distribution of soil water content with depth this results in a non linear variation of the unsaturated diffusion coefficient and hence a nonlinear governing equation for the unsaturated diffusion problem which cannot be easily solved through common mathematical methods therefore many researchers generally have chosen numerical methods to solve the problem of contaminant diffusion in unsaturated soils such as liu and hu 2014 however numerical method inherently has the disadvantage in analyzing multiple parameters in the analysis as the numerical model needs to be reconstructed for each case when dealing with a parametric study and the difficulty in dealing with the numerical dispersions and related truncation errors zheng and bennett 2002 due to the disadvantage of the numerical methods in solving the contaminants diffusion problem analytical method has been generally used since it can readily analyze the sensitivity of each single parameter in question suk 2013 2016 2017 by developing an analytical solution for one dimensional 1d contaminant diffusion through multi layered landfill barrier system chen et al 2009 investigated the effects of the half life of contaminants on the solute flux of benzene diffused into the underlying aquifer considering the arbitrary initial conditions in their diffusion model the media was assumed to be saturated as such many previous analytical studies regarding the diffusion of contaminants in the barriers have adopted the assumption that the soils beneath the barrier system are fully saturated li and cleall 2010 xie et al 2013 zhao and burns 2013 however in reality the soils beneath the landfill barrier systems are usually unsaturated king et al 1993 moreover it has been found that the assumption of saturated soils leads to an inaccurate prediction on the contaminant leakage rate at the bottom of the barrier system due to the lack of consideration of unsaturated properties of the underlying soil celik et al 2009 fityus et al 1999 investigated 1d contaminant migration from a landfill through an unsaturated landfill liner using a semi analytical approach however the effects of the groundwater depth i e thickness of unsaturated zone beneath landfill barriers and water pressure distribution in unsaturated soils which are key factors in the design of landfill barriers are not considered in their study to the best of the authors knowledge there are no analytical studies available which consider the unsaturated properties of the soils underlying the landfill barriers regarding identifying effects of soil water pressure distribution and groundwater depth on contaminant diffusion this is likely due to the difficulty in solving the nonlinear governing equation in the unsaturated diffusion models janavičius 1997 zhang et al 2012 in this study a 1d diffusion model of contaminants which considers the unsaturated behavior of soils beneath the landfill liners is firstly developed based on the assumption of linear water pressure distribution in soils the nonlinear governing equation in the diffusion model is transformed into a linear equation using an exponential expression of soil water retention curve swrc and a linear model of unsaturated diffusion coefficient subsequently the corresponding analytical solution is obtained by laplace transformation method based on the developed diffusion model and the analytical solution the effects of soil type water pressure distribution and groundwater level on the diffusion of contaminants are then analyzed 2 material and methods 2 1 mathematical modelling generally landfill barriers are very thin as compared with the thickness of the underlying soil mass therefore they are usually regarded as an integral layer in order to facilitate the analysis in this study the geomembrane gm barrier is taken as an example to establish the 1d diffusion model of contaminants in unsaturated soils beneath landfill liners the schematic diagram of 1d diffusion through the gm and the underlying soil is shown in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate system is set at the interface between the gm and the underlying soil the positive z axis is defined to be downward diffusion in a gm can be described by the fick s second law foose 2002 1 c g z t t d g 2 c g z t z 2 l g z 0 where cg is the concentration of contaminant in the gm dg is the diffusion coefficient of contaminant in the gm and lg is the thickness of the gm t is time z is depth a constant concentration of contaminant of leachate is often assumed since this leads to a conservative result shackelford 1990 the constant concentration at the top of the gm can be described as rowe 2005 2 c g l g t s gl c 0 where c0 is contaminant concentration in the leachate and sgl is the contaminant partition coefficient between the gm and the leachate and in principle is a constant for a given fluid gm and temperature of interest it is assumed that continuity of contaminant mass flux exists at the interface between the gm and the underlying soil and it can be described using the fick s first law 3 d g c g z z 0 d u c s z z 0 where du is defined as the diffusion coefficient of the unsaturated soil and cs is the contaminant concentration in the pore water of the soil the boundary condition of contaminant concentration at the interface between the gm and the underlying soil can be described by foose 2002 kalbe et al 2002 4 c g 0 t s gs c s 0 t where sgs is the contaminant partition coefficient between the gm and the soil sangam and rowe 2001 since chemical transport process is attributed to fick pure diffusion process sorption is normally assumed to be negligible in the soil liu and hu 2014 therefore for simplicity the sorption of chemical on soil was not considered in this study the diffusion of the contaminant through soil can be described by the fick s second law 5 c s z t θ z t z d u z c s z t z 0 z l s where θ is the volumetric water content csθ is the amount of contaminants per unit soil volume and ls is the groundwater depth initially the gm and underlying soil are assumed to be free of contaminants 6 c g z 0 0 l g z 0 7 c s z 0 0 0 z l s under the unsaturated soil layer the horizontal flow velocity in groundwater is assumed to be infinite that once the contaminants drain out of the unsaturated soil layer they would be instantaneously flushed away along the movement of the groundwater chen et al 2009 therefore the concentration at the lower boundary of the unsaturated soil can be assumed to be zero i e drichlet boundary condition 8 c s l s t 0 when the horizontal flow velocity in groundwater is not great but very slow the neuman boundary condition might be favored as follows 8 b d u c s z z l s 0 the volumetric water content θ of soil between gm and groundwater level is described as follows leong and rahardjo 1997 9 θ n e α h where h is the pore water pressure head n is the porosity and α is the desaturation coefficient fityus et al 1999 found that for a relatively thin unsaturated soil layer i e ls 5 m the transient moisture change has a negligible influence on contaminant transport through the barrier therefore it is assumed that soil suction decreases with depth to a value of zero at the groundwater level fredlund and rahardjo 1993 the suction is designated as a ratio of the water pressure to the hydrostatic pressure condition using the factor f under the hydrostatic condition the assumption of linear water pressure distribution is rational for the proposed analytical solution this is because that the hydrostatic condition represents an equilibrium condition corresponding to zero moisture flux at the soil surface which inherently indicates a linear water pressure distribution along the soil depth furthermore many researchers have adopted the assumption of linear water pressure distribution when considering the working conditions at which the water table is determined at a certain depth under the soil layer with a low coefficient of water permeability i e geomembrane or confined aquifer soil layer fredlund et al 2012 ran et al 2015 furthermore the effect of evaporation or water infiltration on contaminant mass flux is limited during the working life of landfill liners since both the diffusion coefficient and the coefficient of water permeability of the hydraulic barrier i e geomembrane in this study are generally very low around 10 13 m2 s and 10 15 m s respectively manan et al 2015 rowe 2005 therefore under this circumstance the assumption of linear water pressure distribution is more appropriate for this study in this study the pore water pressure head h in soil can be expressed as a function of depth z 10 h f z l s when dealing with contaminant transport process in unsaturated soils the unsaturated diffusion coefficient du can be described as follows penman 1940 11 d u τ θ d 0 where d 0 is

therefore a solution for saturated conditions from chen et al 2009 is used to validate the newly developed analytical solution when the soil is saturated the water pressure ratio f 0 thus the

of contaminant concentration distribution between the results obtained from chen et al 2009 and the present study it can be seen from the figure that the two solutions agree well validating the developed analytical solution 2 4 comparison of the analytical solution against numerical solution generally the newly proposed analytical solution requires the verification of the accuracy through either previously published analytical solutions or numerical analysis suk 2013 2016 2017 in this study the performance of the developed analytical solution under constant water pressure condition was evaluated by a comparison with results computed using hydrus 1d a case under hydrostatic conditions i e f 1 0 in the analytical solution was selected for the comparison between the analytical solution and numerical simulation by hydrus 1d parameters used in the analytical solution for this case are shown in table 2 sgl 1 0 and sgs 1 0 was considered in the analytical solution since contaminant partition effect at the interfaces of gm is not considered by hydrus 1d the exponential hydraulic model in the analytical solution i e eq 9 is not provided in hydrus 1d thus the option of look up tables in hydrus 1d has been chosen to realize the analogy regarding hydraulic model of soil underlying the gm as shown in fig 3 a the data of water retention properties used in look up tables in hydrus 1d for the underlying soil were sampled from the exponential curve using the parameters in the analytical solution since hydraulic conductivity properties are required by hydrus 1d the data used in look up tables for the underlying soil were sampled from the exponential curve expressed by k w k s e 2 α h as shown in fig 3b please note that the input of hydraulic conductivity properties would not influence the simulated results under hydrostatic condition since there was no water flow under this circumstance for the input hydraulic properties of the gm since the gm is assumed to be saturated in the analytical solution then volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity are kept constant at different pressure heads therefore the data used in look up tables for the gm were sampled from two horizontal lines as shown in fig 3b the hydraulic conductivity of the gm is generally low assuming there is no any defected holes available in the gm hence ks 1 0 10 5 mm year is used in hydrus 1d the input volumetric water content of the gm in hydrus 1d is obtained through eq 11 qs dg τd0 6 10 13 3 4 10 10 0 0017647 to ensure that the same value of dg is used in both hydrus 1d and analytical solution the geometric model in hydrus 1d was set up to make the thicknesses of the gm and the underlying soil as 0 0015 m and 0 6 m respectively initial hydrostatic conditions were applied by setting the pressure heads as increasing values linearly from 0 6015 m at the top of the gm to 0 m at the bottom of the underlying soil initial contaminant concentrations in the gm and the underlying soil were set as zero which was identical to that for analytical solution during the simulation lasting for 50 years the pressure heads at the boundaries of the numerical model were set as constant and the contaminant concentration at the upper boundary of the gm was set to be c0 100 μg l in addition contaminant concentration at the lower boundary of the underlying soil was set to be zero which was identical to that for analytical solution the detailed input parameters for hydrus 1d were summarized in table 3 fig 4 shows the obtained pressure head distribution with depth in the numerical simulation the linear pressure head profile confirmed that hydrus 1d solved contaminant transport was under hydrostatic condition in the simulation fig 5 shows the comparison of the variation of contaminant concentration c c0 with time for the proposed analytical solution and the numerical solution obtained with hydrus 1d under hydrostatic condition four observation points were selected at four depths z 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 4 m and 0 5 m to demonstrate the results regarding the comparison of analytical solution and numerical solution as shown in the figure the proposed analytical solution has an excellent agreement with the numerical solution obtained with hydrus 1d under hydrostatic condition indicating that the accuracy of the analytical solution is satisfied furthermore the results of another numerical simulation case considering variations of pressure head are also shown in this figure to demonstrate the influence of transient moisture changes on contaminant transport this numerical analysis under transient water flow condition was the same as that employed in the numerical analysis under hydrostatic condition except changing the upper and lower boundary conditions for water flow from constant pressure head into variable pressure head boundary condition the annual variation of pressure head at the upper and lower boundary followed a sinusoidal pattern as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 5 periodic variations in the concentrations were observed at the four depths under transient water flow condition due to the periodic variations of pressure head only slight difference was observed at upper depth i e z 0 1 m and 0 2 m when comparing the average values of concentration under transient water flow condition and the results under hydrostatic condition however the difference between the values of concentration under transient water flow condition and the results under hydrostatic condition was increasing as the soil depth increased indicating relatively great influence of transient case on contaminant concentration at deeper soil depth i e z 0 4 m and 0 5 m under the imposed transient water flow condition in this study furthermore the fluctuation of contaminant concentration with time followed a similar trend with sinusoidal variation of pressure head on the upper and lower boundary as shown in the figure the contaminant concentration obtained by numerical solution is larger than that calculated by analytical solution as the pressure head at the upper and lower boundary increases in contrast the contaminant concentration obtained by numerical solution is smaller than that calculated by analytical solution as the pressure head at the upper and lower boundary decreases the highest value of contaminant concentration as shown in fig 5 is corresponding to the peak value of pressure head imposed on the bottom of the underlying soil and on the top of the gm this also suggests that the developed analytical solution based on the assumption of steady state is not adequate to reflect the transient flow case in which the pressure head at the bottom of the underlying soil is not constant it should be noted that the influence of variations of pressure head on the flux of contaminants would be affected by soil type soil parameter unsaturated layer thickness and others 3 results and discussion according to eqs 9 11 desaturation coefficient α water pressure ratio f and groundwater depth ls are the key factors influencing the change of soil water content therefore the effects of these three key factors on the diffusion of contaminants in the soil underneath the landfill barrier are investigated in this section all the soil material parameters used in this section are shown in table 1 3 1 effect of desaturation coefficient α according to eq 9 the desaturation coefficient α governs the rate of decrease in water content with an increasing suction or decreasing pore water pressure in swrc since α is closely related to the particle size distribution of the soil to a certain extent changes of α can reflect the effects of soil type on the diffusion of contaminants in this analysis four values of α i e 0 2 m 1 0 m 3 0 m and 5 0 m the normal range is 0 2 m 5 0 m as suggested by philip 2006 are considered furthermore fixed values of f i e f 1 and ls i e ls 0 6 m are used in this analysis to investigate the effects of α on diffusion process of contaminants in the unsaturated soils underneath the barrier fig 7 shows the profile of amount of contaminants in the soil with depth at 50 years with different values of α the horizontal axis represents the amount of contaminants per soil volume csθ the vertical axis is the depth z which represents the depth below the interface between the gm and the underlying soil as shown in fig 1 the embedded small chart demonstrates the water content θ distribution with depth z for different values of α it can be seen from the figure after 50 years of diffusion at the same depth the amount of contaminants decreases as α increases this is because soil with a lower desaturation rate generally has a larger water holding capacity than those of soils with a higher desaturation rate when α increases i e soil desaturation rate increases the water holding capacity of the soil is decreasing resulting in a lower amount of contaminants in the soil chen and ng 2013 chen et al 2018 zhou and ng 2014 after 50 years of diffusion the amount of contaminants at the soil surface i e z 0 for four values of α i e 0 2 m 1 0 m 3 0 m and 5 0 m are 1 35 μg l 1 07 μg l 0 61 μg l and 0 35 μg l respectively in other words the amount of contaminants at the soil surface i e z 0 decreases by 74 as the soil desaturation rate increases α increases from 0 2 m to 5 0 m this is because that the soil with higher desaturation rate i e α 0 2 m has a much higher water content than that of soil with a higher desaturation rate i e α 5 0 m at the soil surface see the small chart embedded in fig 7 this is in accordance with the numerical results from liu and hu 2014 fig 8 shows the variation of the contaminant mass flux rate with time at the bottom of gm for different values of α it can be observed from the figure that for all the four values of α the mass flux rate firstly increases and then decreases to a certain value at a certain time after which the mass flux rate starts to keep an almost stable value for the sake of simplicity the development of mass flux rate of contaminants at the bottom of gm is divided into three stages ascending stage descending stage and stable stage as shown in fig 8 for all the four cases of α the duration of the period in the ascending stage is almost equal the presence of the descent stage is ascribed to the change of the concentration gradient of contaminants at the bottom of gm on the one hand contaminants would diffuse into the underlying soil after they break through the barrier leading to an increase in the concentration of contaminants at the bottom of the gm on the other hand the concentration of contaminants in the leachate is assumed to be unchanged thus the concentration gradient of the contaminants in the barrier decreases causing a decreasing mass flux rate at the bottom of gm after reaching a certain time the mass flux rate seems to approach a steady mass flux rate this is because the concentration at the bottom of the gm is close to a stable value at this moment resulting in a constant concentration gradient it can be observed that the steady mass flux rate is 0 260 g ha year in the soil with α 0 2 m which is higher than that in the soil with α 1 0 m 0 255 g ha year soil with α 3 0 m 0 235 g ha year and soil with α 5 0 m 0 197 g ha year this is due to the higher water content of the soil with lower desaturation rate than those of soils with higher desaturation rate as shown in embedded small chart in fig 7 which results in a higher diffusion coefficient according to eq 11 and hence a larger steady flux rate 3 2 effect of water pressure condition the water pressure ratio f is used to describe water pressure condition when soil water content is stable in particular f 1 represents the hydrostatic pressure condition in this analysis three values of f i e 0 1 and 0 5 are considered to represent saturated condition hydrostatic pressure condition and a certain condition in between the saturated and hydrostatic pressure condition respectively fixed values of α i e α 1 0 m and ls i e ls 0 6 m are used in this analysis in order to study the effects of f on diffusion of contaminants in the soils underneath the barriers fig 9 shows the profile of amount of contaminants in the soil at 50 years with different values of f the embedded small chart illustrates the relationship between water content θ and depth z for different values of f when the soil state changes from saturated to unsaturated i e f increases from 0 to a positive value at the same depth the amount of contaminants gradually decreases this agrees with the profile of water content for different values of f as shown in the embedded small chart in fig 9 water content decreases at a certain depth when the soil state changes from saturated condition i e f 0 to unsaturated condition i e f 0 furthermore it can be seen from the figure that when the soil is saturated i e f 0 the amount of contaminants is almost linearly distributed with depth z as expected this is explained later for results in fig 10 fig 10 shows the development of mass flux rate with time at the bottom of gm with different values of f it can be seen that variations of mass flux rate for all the three cases have a similar trend the flux rate at hydrostatic pressure condition i e f 1 is slightly smaller than those at other two conditions when the steady state condition is reached the steady mass flux rate is 0 261 g ha year for saturated condition i e f 0 which is higher than that in a certain condition in between the saturated and hydrostatic pressure condition 0 258 g ha year i e f 0 5 and hydrostatic pressure condition 0 255 g ha year i e f 1 this is because that the soil water content at saturated condition is larger than that at hydrostatic pressure condition resulting in a higher diffusion coefficient at saturated condition compared with that at hydrostatic pressure condition as shown in the figure after 50 years of diffusion the mass flux rate has almost reached the steady state condition therefore according to eq 11 the concentration gradient under the steady state condition is constant since the diffusion coefficient is constant for saturated soil i e f 0 based on the fick s first law this can explain the linear distribution of the amount of contaminants with depth at the condition of f 0 as shown in fig 9 3 3 effect of groundwater depth ls the groundwater depth ls represents the thickness of the unsaturated zone and the distance between the bottom of landfill barrier and groundwater level six values of ls i e 0 m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m and 5 m and fixed values of α i e α 1 0 m and f i e f 1 are considered in this section to analyze the effects of groundwater depth on the diffusion process of contaminants fig 11 shows the profile of the amount of contaminants in the soil at 50 years with different values of ls the embedded small chart illustrates the relationship between water content θ and depth z for different values of ls with respect to ls 0 the amount of contaminants is zero as shown in the figure this is because that contaminants would directly diffuse into the groundwater once the breakthrough occurs at the bottom of the barriers as ls increases from 1 m to 5 m it can be seen from the figure that after 50 years of diffusion the amount of contaminants at soil surface i e z 0 gradually reduces this is because that water content reduces at soil surface when ls increases from 1 m to 5 m see the embedded small chart shown in fig 11 however the amount of contaminants for ls 1 m is not always larger than that for ls 2 m below the soil surface i e in the entire unsaturated zone z as such comparison of the amount of contaminants for all five cases of ls depends on the depth z this is due to the assumption of zero concentration at the groundwater level fig 12 gives the mass flux rate with time at the bottom of gm with different values of ls after the mass flux rate reaches the maximum value the mass flux rate for the case of ls 0 does not decline with time this is because the concentration gradient for this case almost reaches a constant value when ls increases from 1 m to 5 m a decreasing steady flux rate can be observed from the figure this is because that more contaminants would be retained in the soil as the unsaturated zones are enlarged i e ls increases which results in a decrease of the concentration gradient and hence a decrease in flux rate the larger the thickness of the unsaturated zones the greater the amount of contaminants can be retained by the soil and hence the smaller the flux rate compared with the effects of soil desaturation rate on the steady flux rate as shown in fig 8 when α varies from α 1 0 m to α 5 0 m at ls 0 6 m the steady flux rate decreased by 22 7 0 255 g ha year to 0 197 g ha year whereas when ls varies from ls 0 6 m to ls 5 m at α 1 0 m the steady flux rate decreased by 93 5 0 255 g ha year to 0 0165 g ha year this clearly indicates that the diffusion of contaminants is more sensitive to ls as compared with the effects of α on the steady flux rate therefore the groundwater depth ls should be particularly assessed in the design of landfill barriers in order to minimize the pollution of the underlying soils and hence the groundwater 3 4 effect of partition coefficient sgs and sgl on mass flux rate j the partition coefficient is defined as a particular ratio of the concentrations of a solute between the two solvents at equilibrium fig 13 shows the variation of the mass flux rate at the bottom of gm at different values of sgs which represents the contaminant partition coefficient between the gm and the soil three values of sgs i e 0 0032 0 032 0 32 and fixed values of α i e α 1 0 m f i e f 1 ls i e ls 0 6 m and sgl i e 0 022 are considered in this section to analyze the effects of the contaminant partition coefficient sgs on the diffusion process of contaminants as shown in the figure the mass flux rate j increases with time and reaches their peak values at the time of 0 1 year for all three values of sgs the peak value decreases with the increase of sgs after that j gradually decreases and finally reaches a steady value for all three values of sgs the steady value increases with the decrease of sgs and it is almost close to the peak value when sgs 0 0032 this indicates that the mass flux rate j is more sensitive to sgs when the value of sgs is higher a relatively higher value of sgs is recommended to be utilized in landfill liner in order to reduce the mass flux rate j this is because that when sgs is lower the contaminant concentration in gm is lower compared with the contaminant concentration in the underlying soil resulting in a higher mass flux rate at the bottom of gm fig 14 shows the variation of the mass flux rate at the bottom of gm at different values of sgl which represents the contaminant partition coefficient between the gm and the leachate and in principle is a constant for a given fluid gm and temperature of interest three values of sgl i e 0 0022 0 022 0 22 and fixed values of α i e α 1 0 m f i e f 1 ls i e ls 0 6 m and sgs i e 0 032 are considered in this section to analyze the sensitivity of the contaminant partition coefficient sgl on the mass flux rate j as shown in the figure the mass flux rate j increases as sgl increases from 0 0022 to 0 22 with time as sgl increases the mass flux rate j increases firstly and then gradually reaches a steady value for all three values of sgl this agrees with eq 25a where a linear positive correlation between the mass flux rate j and sgl is presented 3 5 coupled effects of α f and ls on steady flux rate jm as mentioned previously the steady flux rate jm is the flux rate at the depth z 0 when the steady state is reached it is an important indicator to assess the performance of the landfill barrier system a lower jm is preferable for the landfill barrier system since a lower jm corresponds to a lower concentration of contamination it can be known from the eq 25b the desaturation coefficient α and the water pressure ratio f present in the form of product therefore the product αf can be regarded as a single parameter in order to facilitate the analysis five cases for αf i e 0 e g α 1 0 m f 0 0 2 m e g α 0 2 m f 1 1 0 m e g α 1 0 m f 1 3 0 m e g α 3 0 m f 1 and 5 0 m e g α 5 0 m f 1 and the range of ls from 0 m to 5 m are considered in this analysis to investigate the combined effects of α f and ls on the steady flux rate jm fig 15 shows the variation of the steady flux rate of contaminants with groundwater depth for different values of αf it can be seen from the figure that when ls is 0 the steady flux rates for all these five cases are equal this is because that as ls 0 the contaminants would directly diffuse into the groundwater once the breakthrough occurs at the bottom of the barriers resulting in an equal steady flux rate for different cases of αf when ls increases i e ls 0 jm for the case of αf 0 is higher than those for other four cases of αf at a certain ls as f 1 the steady flux rates for the soils with α 0 2 m and α 1 0 m decrease almost linearly with the increase of groundwater depth with respect to the cases for the soils with α 3 0 m and α 5 0 the steady flux rates for the soil with α 3 0 m and the soil with α 5 0 m decrease exponentially with the increase of groundwater depth this is because the diffusion coefficient of the soils decreases exponentially with the increase of groundwater depth as shown in the diffusion model according to eqs 9 11 in addition jm and ls would approach a linear relationship when the value of αf is relatively small i e αf 0 2 m and 1 0 m it should be noted that the steady flux rates of the soil with α 3 0 m f 1 and the soil with α 5 0 m f 1 are negligible when the groundwater depth exceeds 3 m and 2 m respectively this suggests that when the depth of the groundwater is large enough i e 3 m and the contaminants would be difficult to break through the underlying soil layers with high desaturation rate below the landfill barriers and to reach the groundwater therefore a thicker soil layer with high desaturation rate is recommended to be an effective diffusion barrier in the design of landfill barrier systems in order to mitigate the pollution of the underlying soils and groundwater 4 conclusions the main conclusions obtained from the present study are listed as follows 1 an analytical one dimensional diffusion model of contaminants which can account for unsaturated behavior of the soils beneath the landfill barriers is developed 2 compared with the relative effects of groundwater depth water pressure condition and the type of underlying soil beneath landfill barriers on the diffusion of contaminants groundwater depth has the most influential effect on the steady flux rate of contaminants and followed by the soil type this is mainly due to their different impacts on the soil water content and thus on the diffusion coefficient of the soil therefore the groundwater depth is particularly important to be assessed in the design of landfill barrier systems in order to effectively control the steady flux rate of contaminants 3 the steady flux rate of contaminants decreases almost linearly for the soils with α 0 2 m and α 1 0 m and exponentially for the soils with α 3 0 m and α 5 0 m as the groundwater depth increases this is because the diffusion coefficient of the soils decreases exponentially with the increase of groundwater depth based on the developed diffusion model considering the magnitude of value of αf 4 in this study the obtained steady flux rates in the soil layers with higher desaturation rate are negligible when the groundwater depth exceeds 3 m and 2 m this suggests that when the groundwater is deep enough i e 3 m and the contaminants would be difficult to break through the underlying soil layers with higher desaturation rate below the landfill barriers to reach the groundwater therefore a thicker soil layers with higher desaturation rate is recommended to be an effective diffusion barrier in the design of landfill barrier systems in order to mitigate the pollution of the underlying soils and groundwater it should be noted that the sorption of chemical on soil was not considered in this developed model for simplicity however it is important for assessing chemical transfer in liners therefore the model can be further improved by incorporating the effects of sorption of chemical on contamination migration acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grants no 51578196

6812,diffusion is the dominating process in the migration of contaminants through landfill liners below which the soils are generally unsaturated analytical method is often considered as a preferred approach over numerical method to solve diffusion problems in this study a one dimensional diffusion model of contaminants is firstly developed to account for unsaturated properties of the soils beneath landfill barriers based on an assumption of linear water pressure distribution the nonlinear governing equation in the diffusion model is transformed into a linear equation using an exponential expression of soil water retention curve and a linear model of unsaturated diffusion coefficient subsequently the corresponding analytical solution is obtained and the solution is then applied to investigate the effects of soil type water pressure condition and groundwater depth on the diffusion of contaminants the analytical results show that groundwater depth has the most influential effect on the steady flux rate of contaminants furthermore the obtained steady flux rates in soil layers with high desaturation rate are negligible when the groundwater depth exceeds 3 m and 2 m the results also indicate that a thicker soil layer with high desaturation rate is recommended to be an effective diffusion barrier to mitigate the pollution of the underlying soils and groundwater keywords analytical solution landfill liner unsaturated diffusion groundwater 1 introduction landfilling has been the main way to deal with solid wastes all over the world during the last few decades a common practice is to build a barrier system at the bottom of the landfill to isolate the landfill from the underlying soil mass however previous studies have shown that the barrier system cannot completely prevent the transport of contaminants although the geomembranes used in the system have a very low hydraulic conductivity this observation is related to the complex flow behavior of the contaminants in the barriers and the underlying soil mass foose 2002 leij et al 1993 han et al 2016 rowe 2005 liang et al 2016 samadder et al 2017 thus it is crucial to understand the migration characteristics of contaminants in the barrier system and the underlying soil mass in order to assess and control the level of contaminations it is generally accepted that due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the barrier system molecular diffusion dominates the migration of contaminants in the landfill barriers rowe et al 1988 johnson 1989 liu and ball 1998 it is well known that water content in unsaturated soils determines the coefficient of diffusion and thus the leakage rate in the barrier systems however the analytical solution regarding the unsaturated diffusion problem has rarely been developed due to the difficulty caused by the nonlinear distribution of soil water content with depth this results in a non linear variation of the unsaturated diffusion coefficient and hence a nonlinear governing equation for the unsaturated diffusion problem which cannot be easily solved through common mathematical methods therefore many researchers generally have chosen numerical methods to solve the problem of contaminant diffusion in unsaturated soils such as liu and hu 2014 however numerical method inherently has the disadvantage in analyzing multiple parameters in the analysis as the numerical model needs to be reconstructed for each case when dealing with a parametric study and the difficulty in dealing with the numerical dispersions and related truncation errors zheng and bennett 2002 due to the disadvantage of the numerical methods in solving the contaminants diffusion problem analytical method has been generally used since it can readily analyze the sensitivity of each single parameter in question suk 2013 2016 2017 by developing an analytical solution for one dimensional 1d contaminant diffusion through multi layered landfill barrier system chen et al 2009 investigated the effects of the half life of contaminants on the solute flux of benzene diffused into the underlying aquifer considering the arbitrary initial conditions in their diffusion model the media was assumed to be saturated as such many previous analytical studies regarding the diffusion of contaminants in the barriers have adopted the assumption that the soils beneath the barrier system are fully saturated li and cleall 2010 xie et al 2013 zhao and burns 2013 however in reality the soils beneath the landfill barrier systems are usually unsaturated king et al 1993 moreover it has been found that the assumption of saturated soils leads to an inaccurate prediction on the contaminant leakage rate at the bottom of the barrier system due to the lack of consideration of unsaturated properties of the underlying soil celik et al 2009 fityus et al 1999 investigated 1d contaminant migration from a landfill through an unsaturated landfill liner using a semi analytical approach however the effects of the groundwater depth i e thickness of unsaturated zone beneath landfill barriers and water pressure distribution in unsaturated soils which are key factors in the design of landfill barriers are not considered in their study to the best of the authors knowledge there are no analytical studies available which consider the unsaturated properties of the soils underlying the landfill barriers regarding identifying effects of soil water pressure distribution and groundwater depth on contaminant diffusion this is likely due to the difficulty in solving the nonlinear governing equation in the unsaturated diffusion models janavičius 1997 zhang et al 2012 in this study a 1d diffusion model of contaminants which considers the unsaturated behavior of soils beneath the landfill liners is firstly developed based on the assumption of linear water pressure distribution in soils the nonlinear governing equation in the diffusion model is transformed into a linear equation using an exponential expression of soil water retention curve swrc and a linear model of unsaturated diffusion coefficient subsequently the corresponding analytical solution is obtained by laplace transformation method based on the developed diffusion model and the analytical solution the effects of soil type water pressure distribution and groundwater level on the diffusion of contaminants are then analyzed 2 material and methods 2 1 mathematical modelling generally landfill barriers are very thin as compared with the thickness of the underlying soil mass therefore they are usually regarded as an integral layer in order to facilitate the analysis in this study the geomembrane gm barrier is taken as an example to establish the 1d diffusion model of contaminants in unsaturated soils beneath landfill liners the schematic diagram of 1d diffusion through the gm and the underlying soil is shown in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate system is set at the interface between the gm and the underlying soil the positive z axis is defined to be downward diffusion in a gm can be described by the fick s second law foose 2002 1 c g z t t d g 2 c g z t z 2 l g z 0 where cg is the concentration of contaminant in the gm dg is the diffusion coefficient of contaminant in the gm and lg is the thickness of the gm t is time z is depth a constant concentration of contaminant of leachate is often assumed since this leads to a conservative result shackelford 1990 the constant concentration at the top of the gm can be described as rowe 2005 2 c g l g t s gl c 0 where c0 is contaminant concentration in the leachate and sgl is the contaminant partition coefficient between the gm and the leachate and in principle is a constant for a given fluid gm and temperature of interest it is assumed that continuity of contaminant mass flux exists at the interface between the gm and the underlying soil and it can be described using the fick s first law 3 d g c g z z 0 d u c s z z 0 where du is defined as the diffusion coefficient of the unsaturated soil and cs is the contaminant concentration in the pore water of the soil the boundary condition of contaminant concentration at the interface between the gm and the underlying soil can be described by foose 2002 kalbe et al 2002 4 c g 0 t s gs c s 0 t where sgs is the contaminant partition coefficient between the gm and the soil sangam and rowe 2001 since chemical transport process is attributed to fick pure diffusion process sorption is normally assumed to be negligible in the soil liu and hu 2014 therefore for simplicity the sorption of chemical on soil was not considered in this study the diffusion of the contaminant through soil can be described by the fick s second law 5 c s z t θ z t z d u z c s z t z 0 z l s where θ is the volumetric water content csθ is the amount of contaminants per unit soil volume and ls is the groundwater depth initially the gm and underlying soil are assumed to be free of contaminants 6 c g z 0 0 l g z 0 7 c s z 0 0 0 z l s under the unsaturated soil layer the horizontal flow velocity in groundwater is assumed to be infinite that once the contaminants drain out of the unsaturated soil layer they would be instantaneously flushed away along the movement of the groundwater chen et al 2009 therefore the concentration at the lower boundary of the unsaturated soil can be assumed to be zero i e drichlet boundary condition 8 c s l s t 0 when the horizontal flow velocity in groundwater is not great but very slow the neuman boundary condition might be favored as follows 8 b d u c s z z l s 0 the volumetric water content θ of soil between gm and groundwater level is described as follows leong and rahardjo 1997 9 θ n e α h where h is the pore water pressure head n is the porosity and α is the desaturation coefficient fityus et al 1999 found that for a relatively thin unsaturated soil layer i e ls 5 m the transient moisture change has a negligible influence on contaminant transport through the barrier therefore it is assumed that soil suction decreases with depth to a value of zero at the groundwater level fredlund and rahardjo 1993 the suction is designated as a ratio of the water pressure to the hydrostatic pressure condition using the factor f under the hydrostatic condition the assumption of linear water pressure distribution is rational for the proposed analytical solution this is because that the hydrostatic condition represents an equilibrium condition corresponding to zero moisture flux at the soil surface which inherently indicates a linear water pressure distribution along the soil depth furthermore many researchers have adopted the assumption of linear water pressure distribution when considering the working conditions at which the water table is determined at a certain depth under the soil layer with a low coefficient of water permeability i e geomembrane or confined aquifer soil layer fredlund et al 2012 ran et al 2015 furthermore the effect of evaporation or water infiltration on contaminant mass flux is limited during the working life of landfill liners since both the diffusion coefficient and the coefficient of water permeability of the hydraulic barrier i e geomembrane in this study are generally very low around 10 13 m2 s and 10 15 m s respectively manan et al 2015 rowe 2005 therefore under this circumstance the assumption of linear water pressure distribution is more appropriate for this study in this study the pore water pressure head h in soil can be expressed as a function of

therefore a solution for saturated conditions from chen et al 2009 is used to validate the newly developed analytical solution when the soil is saturated the water pressure ratio f 0 thus the

of contaminant concentration distribution between the results obtained from chen et al 2009 and the present study it can be seen from the figure that the two solutions agree well validating the developed analytical solution 2 4 comparison of the analytical solution against numerical solution generally the newly proposed analytical solution requires the verification of the accuracy through either previously published analytical solutions or numerical analysis suk 2013 2016 2017 in this study the performance of the developed analytical solution under constant water pressure condition was evaluated by a comparison with results computed using hydrus 1d a case under hydrostatic conditions i e f 1 0 in the analytical solution was selected for the comparison between the analytical solution and numerical simulation by hydrus 1d parameters used in the analytical solution for this case are shown in table 2 sgl 1 0 and sgs 1 0 was considered in the analytical solution since contaminant partition effect at the interfaces of gm is not considered by hydrus 1d the exponential hydraulic model in the analytical solution i e eq 9 is not provided in hydrus 1d thus the option of look up tables in hydrus 1d has been chosen to realize the analogy regarding hydraulic model of soil underlying the gm as shown in fig 3 a the data of water retention properties used in look up tables in hydrus 1d for the underlying soil were sampled from the exponential curve using the parameters in the analytical solution since hydraulic conductivity properties are required by hydrus 1d the data used in look up tables for the underlying soil were sampled from the exponential curve expressed by k w k s e 2 α h as shown in fig 3b please note that the input of hydraulic conductivity properties would not influence the simulated results under hydrostatic condition since there was no water flow under this circumstance for the input hydraulic properties of the gm since the gm is assumed to be saturated in the analytical solution then volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity are kept constant at different pressure heads therefore the data used in look up tables for the gm were sampled from two horizontal lines as shown in fig 3b the hydraulic conductivity of the gm is generally low assuming there is no any defected holes available in the gm hence ks 1 0 10 5 mm year is used in hydrus 1d the input volumetric water content of the gm in hydrus 1d is obtained through eq 11 qs dg τd0 6 10 13 3 4 10 10 0 0017647 to ensure that the same value of dg is used in both hydrus 1d and analytical solution the geometric model in hydrus 1d was set up to make the thicknesses of the gm and the underlying soil as 0 0015 m and 0 6 m respectively initial hydrostatic conditions were applied by setting the pressure heads as increasing values linearly from 0 6015 m at the top of the gm to 0 m at the bottom of the underlying soil initial contaminant concentrations in the gm and the underlying soil were set as zero which was identical to that for analytical solution during the simulation lasting for 50 years the pressure heads at the boundaries of the numerical model were set as constant and the contaminant concentration at the upper boundary of the gm was set to be c0 100 μg l in addition contaminant concentration at the lower boundary of the underlying soil was set to be zero which was identical to that for analytical solution the detailed input parameters for hydrus 1d were summarized in table 3 fig 4 shows the obtained pressure head distribution with depth in the numerical simulation the linear pressure head profile confirmed that hydrus 1d solved contaminant transport was under hydrostatic condition in the simulation fig 5 shows the comparison of the variation of contaminant concentration c c0 with time for the proposed analytical solution and the numerical solution obtained with hydrus 1d under hydrostatic condition four observation points were selected at four depths z 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 4 m and 0 5 m to demonstrate the results regarding the comparison of analytical solution and numerical solution as shown in the figure the proposed analytical solution has an excellent agreement with the numerical solution obtained with hydrus 1d under hydrostatic condition indicating that the accuracy of the analytical solution is satisfied furthermore the results of another numerical simulation case considering variations of pressure head are also shown in this figure to demonstrate the influence of transient moisture changes on contaminant transport this numerical analysis under transient water flow condition was the same as that employed in the numerical analysis under hydrostatic condition except changing the upper and lower boundary conditions for water flow from constant pressure head into variable pressure head boundary condition the annual variation of pressure head at the upper and lower boundary followed a sinusoidal pattern as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 5 periodic variations in the concentrations were observed at the four depths under transient water flow condition due to the periodic variations of pressure head only slight difference was observed at upper depth i e z 0 1 m and 0 2 m when comparing the average values of concentration under transient water flow condition and the results under hydrostatic condition however the difference between the values of concentration under transient water flow condition and the results under hydrostatic condition was increasing as the soil depth increased indicating relatively great influence of transient case on contaminant concentration at deeper soil depth i e z 0 4 m and 0 5 m under the imposed transient water flow condition in this study furthermore the fluctuation of contaminant concentration with time followed a similar trend with sinusoidal variation of pressure head on the upper and lower boundary as shown in the figure the contaminant concentration obtained by numerical solution is larger than that calculated by analytical solution as the pressure head at the upper and lower boundary increases in contrast the contaminant concentration obtained by numerical solution is smaller than that calculated by analytical solution as the pressure head at the upper and lower boundary decreases the highest value of contaminant concentration as shown in fig 5 is corresponding to the peak value of pressure head imposed on the bottom of the underlying soil and on the top of the gm this also suggests that the developed analytical solution based on the assumption of steady state is not adequate to reflect the transient flow case in which the pressure head at the bottom of the underlying soil is not constant it should be noted that the influence of variations of pressure head on the flux of contaminants would be affected by soil type soil parameter unsaturated layer thickness and others 3 results and discussion according to eqs 9 11 desaturation coefficient α water pressure ratio f and groundwater depth ls are the key factors influencing the change of soil water content therefore the effects of these three key factors on the diffusion of contaminants in the soil underneath the landfill barrier are investigated in this section all the soil material parameters used in this section are shown in table 1 3 1 effect of desaturation coefficient α according to eq 9 the desaturation coefficient α governs the rate of decrease in water content with an increasing suction or decreasing pore water pressure in swrc since α is closely related to the particle size distribution of the soil to a certain extent changes of α can reflect the effects of soil type on the diffusion of contaminants in this analysis four values of α i e 0 2 m 1 0 m 3 0 m and 5 0 m the normal range is 0 2 m 5 0 m as suggested by philip 2006 are considered furthermore fixed values of f i e f 1 and ls i e ls 0 6 m are used in this analysis to investigate the effects of α on diffusion process of contaminants in the unsaturated soils underneath the barrier fig 7 shows the profile of amount of contaminants in the soil with depth at 50 years with different values of α the horizontal axis represents the amount of contaminants per soil volume csθ the vertical axis is the depth z which represents the depth below the interface between the gm and the underlying soil as shown in fig 1 the embedded small chart demonstrates the water content θ distribution with depth z for different values of α it can be seen from the figure after 50 years of diffusion at the same depth the amount of contaminants decreases as α increases this is because soil with a lower desaturation rate generally has a larger water holding capacity than those of soils with a higher desaturation rate when α increases i e soil desaturation rate increases the water holding capacity of the soil is decreasing resulting in a lower amount of contaminants in the soil chen and ng 2013 chen et al 2018 zhou and ng 2014 after 50 years of diffusion the amount of contaminants at the soil surface i e z 0 for four values of α i e 0 2 m 1 0 m 3 0 m and 5 0 m are 1 35 μg l 1 07 μg l 0 61 μg l and 0 35 μg l respectively in other words the amount of contaminants at the soil surface i e z 0 decreases by 74 as the soil desaturation rate increases α increases from 0 2 m to 5 0 m this is because that the soil with higher desaturation rate i e α 0 2 m has a much higher water content than that of soil with a higher desaturation rate i e α 5 0 m at the soil surface see the small chart embedded in fig 7 this is in accordance with the numerical results from liu and hu 2014 fig 8 shows the variation of the contaminant mass flux rate with time at the bottom of gm for different values of α it can be observed from the figure that for all the four values of α the mass flux rate firstly increases and then decreases to a certain value at a certain time after which the mass flux rate starts to keep an almost stable value for the sake of simplicity the development of mass flux rate of contaminants at the bottom of gm is divided into three stages ascending stage descending stage and stable stage as shown in fig 8 for all the four cases of α the duration of the period in the ascending stage is almost equal the presence of the descent stage is ascribed to the change of the concentration gradient of contaminants at the bottom of gm on the one hand contaminants would diffuse into the underlying soil after they break through the barrier leading to an increase in the concentration of contaminants at the bottom of the gm on the other hand the concentration of contaminants in the leachate is assumed to be unchanged thus the concentration gradient of the contaminants in the barrier decreases causing a decreasing mass flux rate at the bottom of gm after reaching a certain time the mass flux rate seems to approach a steady mass flux rate this is because the concentration at the bottom of the gm is close to a stable value at this moment resulting in a constant concentration gradient it can be observed that the steady mass flux rate is 0 260 g ha year in the soil with α 0 2 m which is higher than that in the soil with α 1 0 m 0 255 g ha year soil with α 3 0 m 0 235 g ha year and soil with α 5 0 m 0 197 g ha year this is due to the higher water content of the soil with lower desaturation rate than those of soils with higher desaturation rate as shown in embedded small chart in fig 7 which results in a higher diffusion coefficient according to eq 11 and hence a larger steady flux rate 3 2 effect of water pressure condition the water pressure ratio f is used to describe water pressure condition when soil water content is stable in particular f 1 represents the hydrostatic pressure condition in this analysis three values of f i e 0 1 and 0 5 are considered to represent saturated condition hydrostatic pressure condition and a certain condition in between the saturated and hydrostatic pressure condition respectively fixed values of α i e α 1 0 m and ls i e ls 0 6 m are used in this analysis in order to study the effects of f on diffusion of contaminants in the soils underneath the barriers fig 9 shows the profile of amount of contaminants in the soil at 50 years with different values of f the embedded small chart illustrates the relationship between water content θ and depth z for different values of f when the soil state changes from saturated to unsaturated i e f increases from 0 to a positive value at the same depth the amount of contaminants gradually decreases this agrees with the profile of water content for different values of f as shown in the embedded small chart in fig 9 water content decreases at a certain depth when the soil state changes from saturated condition i e f 0 to unsaturated condition i e f 0 furthermore it can be seen from the figure that when the soil is saturated i e f 0 the amount of contaminants is almost linearly distributed with depth z as expected this is explained later for results in fig 10 fig 10 shows the development of mass flux rate with time at the bottom of gm with different values of f it can be seen that variations of mass flux rate for all the three cases have a similar trend the flux rate at hydrostatic pressure condition i e f 1 is slightly smaller than those at other two conditions when the steady state condition is reached the steady mass flux rate is 0 261 g ha year for saturated condition i e f 0 which is higher than that in a certain condition in between the saturated and hydrostatic pressure condition 0 258 g ha year i e f 0 5 and hydrostatic pressure condition 0 255 g ha year i e f 1 this is because that the soil water content at saturated condition is larger than that at hydrostatic pressure condition resulting in a higher diffusion coefficient at saturated condition compared with that at hydrostatic pressure condition as shown in the figure after 50 years of diffusion the mass flux rate has almost reached the steady state condition therefore according to eq 11 the concentration gradient under the steady state condition is constant since the diffusion coefficient is constant for saturated soil i e f 0 based on the fick s first law this can explain the linear distribution of the amount of contaminants with depth at the condition of f 0 as shown in fig 9 3 3 effect of groundwater depth ls the groundwater depth ls represents the thickness of the unsaturated zone and the distance between the bottom of landfill barrier and groundwater level six values of ls i e 0 m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m and 5 m and fixed values of α i e α 1 0 m and f i e f 1 are considered in this section to analyze the effects of groundwater depth on the diffusion process of contaminants fig 11 shows the profile of the amount of contaminants in the soil at 50 years with different values of ls the embedded small chart illustrates the relationship between water content θ and depth z for different values of ls with respect to ls 0 the amount of contaminants is zero as shown in the figure this is because that contaminants would directly diffuse into the groundwater once the breakthrough occurs at the bottom of the barriers as ls increases from 1 m to 5 m it can be seen from the figure that after 50 years of diffusion the amount of contaminants at soil surface i e z 0 gradually reduces this is because that water content reduces at soil surface when ls increases from 1 m to 5 m see the embedded small chart shown in fig 11 however the amount of contaminants for ls 1 m is not always larger than that for ls 2 m below the soil surface i e in the entire unsaturated zone z as such comparison of the amount of contaminants for all five cases of ls depends on the depth z this is due to the assumption of zero concentration at the groundwater level fig 12 gives the mass flux rate with time at the bottom of gm with different values of ls after the mass flux rate reaches the maximum value the mass flux rate for the case of ls 0 does not decline with time this is because the concentration gradient for this case almost reaches a constant value when ls increases from 1 m to 5 m a decreasing steady flux rate can be observed from the figure this is because that more contaminants would be retained in the soil as the unsaturated zones are enlarged i e ls increases which results in a decrease of the concentration gradient and hence a decrease in flux rate the larger the thickness of the unsaturated zones the greater the amount of contaminants can be retained by the soil and hence the smaller the flux rate compared with the effects of soil desaturation rate on the steady flux rate as shown in fig 8 when α varies from α 1 0 m to α 5 0 m at ls 0 6 m the steady flux rate decreased by 22 7 0 255 g ha year to 0 197 g ha year whereas when ls varies from ls 0 6 m to ls 5 m at α 1 0 m the steady flux rate decreased by 93 5 0 255 g ha year to 0 0165 g ha year this clearly indicates that the diffusion of contaminants is more sensitive to ls as compared with the effects of α on the steady flux rate therefore the groundwater depth ls should be particularly assessed in the design of landfill barriers in order to minimize the pollution of the underlying soils and hence the groundwater 3 4 effect of partition coefficient sgs and sgl on mass flux rate j the partition coefficient is defined as a particular ratio of the concentrations of a solute between the two solvents at equilibrium fig 13 shows the variation of the mass flux rate at the bottom of gm at different values of sgs which represents the contaminant partition coefficient between the gm and the soil three values of sgs i e 0 0032 0 032 0 32 and fixed values of α i e α 1 0 m f i e f 1 ls i e ls 0 6 m and sgl i e 0 022 are considered in this section to analyze the effects of the contaminant partition coefficient sgs on the diffusion process of contaminants as shown in the figure the mass flux rate j increases with time and reaches their peak values at the time of 0 1 year for all three values of sgs the peak value decreases with the increase of sgs after that j gradually decreases and finally reaches a steady value for all three values of sgs the steady value increases with the decrease of sgs and it is almost close to the peak value when sgs 0 0032 this indicates that the mass flux rate j is more sensitive to sgs when the value of sgs is higher a relatively higher value of sgs is recommended to be utilized in landfill liner in order to reduce the mass flux rate j this is because that when sgs is lower the contaminant concentration in gm is lower compared with the contaminant concentration in the underlying soil resulting in a higher mass flux rate at the bottom of gm fig 14 shows the variation of the mass flux rate at the bottom of gm at different values of sgl which represents the contaminant partition coefficient between the gm and the leachate and in principle is a constant for a given fluid gm and temperature of interest three values of sgl i e 0 0022 0 022 0 22 and fixed values of α i e α 1 0 m f i e f 1 ls i e ls 0 6 m and sgs i e 0 032 are considered in this section to analyze the sensitivity of the contaminant partition coefficient sgl on the mass flux rate j as shown in the figure the mass flux rate j increases as sgl increases from 0 0022 to 0 22 with time as sgl increases the mass flux rate j increases firstly and then gradually reaches a steady value for all three values of sgl this agrees with eq 25a where a linear positive correlation between the mass flux rate j and sgl is presented 3 5 coupled effects of α f and ls on steady flux rate jm as mentioned previously the steady flux rate jm is the flux rate at the depth z 0 when the steady state is reached it is an important indicator to assess the performance of the landfill barrier system a lower jm is preferable for the landfill barrier system since a lower jm corresponds to a lower concentration of contamination it can be known from the eq 25b the desaturation coefficient α and the water pressure ratio f present in the form of product therefore the product αf can be regarded as a single parameter in order to facilitate the analysis five cases for αf i e 0 e g α 1 0 m f 0 0 2 m e g α 0 2 m f 1 1 0 m e g α 1 0 m f 1 3 0 m e g α 3 0 m f 1 and 5 0 m e g α 5 0 m f 1 and the range of ls from 0 m to 5 m are considered in this analysis to investigate the combined effects of α f and ls on the steady flux rate jm fig 15 shows the variation of the steady flux rate of contaminants with groundwater depth for different values of αf it can be seen from the figure that when ls is 0 the steady flux rates for all these five cases are equal this is because that as ls 0 the contaminants would directly diffuse into the groundwater once the breakthrough occurs at the bottom of the barriers resulting in an equal steady flux rate for different cases of αf when ls increases i e ls 0 jm for the case of αf 0 is higher than those for other four cases of αf at a certain ls as f 1 the steady flux rates for the soils with α 0 2 m and α 1 0 m decrease almost linearly with the increase of groundwater depth with respect to the cases for the soils with α 3 0 m and α 5 0 the steady flux rates for the soil with α 3 0 m and the soil with α 5 0 m decrease exponentially with the increase of groundwater depth this is because the diffusion coefficient of the soils decreases exponentially with the increase of groundwater depth as shown in the diffusion model according to eqs 9 11 in addition jm and ls would approach a linear relationship when the value of αf is relatively small i e αf 0 2 m and 1 0 m it should be noted that the steady flux rates of the soil with α 3 0 m f 1 and the soil with α 5 0 m f 1 are negligible when the groundwater depth exceeds 3 m and 2 m respectively this suggests that when the depth of the groundwater is large enough i e 3 m and the contaminants would be difficult to break through the underlying soil layers with high desaturation rate below the landfill barriers and to reach the groundwater therefore a thicker soil layer with high desaturation rate is recommended to be an effective diffusion barrier in the design of landfill barrier systems in order to mitigate the pollution of the underlying soils and groundwater 4 conclusions the main conclusions obtained from the present study are listed as follows 1 an analytical one dimensional diffusion model of contaminants which can account for unsaturated behavior of the soils beneath the landfill barriers is developed 2 compared with the relative effects of groundwater depth water pressure condition and the type of underlying soil beneath landfill barriers on the diffusion of contaminants groundwater depth has the most influential effect on the steady flux rate of contaminants and followed by the soil type this is mainly due to their different impacts on the soil water content and thus on the diffusion coefficient of the soil therefore the groundwater depth is particularly important to be assessed in the design of landfill barrier systems in order to effectively control the steady flux rate of contaminants 3 the steady flux rate of contaminants decreases almost linearly for the soils with α 0 2 m and α 1 0 m and exponentially for the soils with α 3 0 m and α 5 0 m as the groundwater depth increases this is because the diffusion coefficient of the soils decreases exponentially with the increase of groundwater depth based on the developed diffusion model considering the magnitude of value of αf 4 in this study the obtained steady flux rates in the soil layers with higher desaturation rate are negligible when the groundwater depth exceeds 3 m and 2 m this suggests that when the groundwater is deep enough i e 3 m and the contaminants would be difficult to break through the underlying soil layers with higher desaturation rate below the landfill barriers to reach the groundwater therefore a thicker soil layers with higher desaturation rate is recommended to be an effective diffusion barrier in the design of landfill barrier systems in order to mitigate the pollution of the underlying soils and groundwater it should be noted that the sorption of chemical on soil was not considered in this developed model for simplicity however it is important for assessing chemical transfer in liners therefore the model can be further improved by incorporating the effects of sorption of chemical on contamination migration acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grants no 51578196

6813,climate induced disturbances are expected to increase in frequency and intensity and affect wetland ecology by altering its hydrology investigating how wetland hydrology responds to climate disturbances is an important first step to understand the ecological response of coastal wetlands to these disturbances wetland hydrologic resilience the ability of wetland in absorbing disturbances and restoring to pre disturbance conditions in hydrological function is a critical measure of wetland hydrological response to climate disturbances however a practical methodology for quantifying wetland hydrologic resilience hr is still lacking this study aimed to improve the approach for quantifying the hydrologic resilience of wetland ecosystems to climate variability and climate change a set of quantitative metrics was developed including the variations of groundwater table overland flow and saltwater table this approach was then applied to a coastal landscape that includes coastal forested and herbaceous wetlands in north carolina usa we investigated the threshold behaviors of groundwater table overland flow and saltwater table for a 20 year period 1995 2014 by applying a regional scale wetland hydrological model penn state integrated hydrological model for wetland hydrology pihm wetland we found that the multiscale variations of groundwater table under dry climatic conditions is a good indicator of wetland hr to drought the variation of overland flow during rainfall events effectively quantified hr to wet periods we also found that the variation of the water level of saltwater is an important metric of wetland hr to sea level rise this study improves the methodology of quantifying wetland hydrologic resilience at a regional scale representing an important first step towards understanding the wetland hydrological and ecological resilience to future intensified climate disturbances in coastal regions and beyond keywords coastal wetland wetland resilience hydrologic model climate variability tipping point absorption and restoration 1 introduction climate change comprised of rising temperature changes in the intensity and frequency of rainfall and accelerating sea level rise slr over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales is one of the most important threats to coastal wetland ecosystems burkett and kusler 2000 mitsch et al 2013 these climate driven disturbances affect wetland ecological functions through altering wetland hydrological function the capability of wetlands in storing and releasing water winter 2000 for example the decline of groundwater storage due to droughts may cause water stress on wetland vegetation rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2007 and enhance the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs from wetland soil burkett and kusler 2000 flooding associated with storms and sea level rise may significantly increase soil erosion day et al 2008 and the mortality of flood intolerant vegetation conner et al 2002 furthermore saltwater intrusion driven by the change in storage of freshwater and sea level rise may affect the survival and productivity of salt intolerant plants williams et al 2003 thus understanding how wetland hydrology responds to the changing climate is important for wetland ecosystem conservation previous studies have focused on assessing and predicting the consequences of current and future climate disturbances on wetland hydrology desantis et al 2007 lu et al 2009 michener et al 1997 nicholls 2004 tufford 2011 zhu et al 2017 however most of these studies provided limited information about the threshold response of hydrological processes to climate disturbances in other words under what climate conditions thresholds the wetland hydrological functions may be significantly altered are not clear such knowledge is urgently needed in wetland ecosystem management to respond to increasing climate change and sea level rise globally wetland hydrologic resilience hr has been found as a useful concept to understand the threshold response of wetland hydrology to climatic disturbances peterson et al 2012 ridolfi et al 2006 the term hydrologic resilience which stems from the concept of ecological resilience describes the ability of wetlands to absorb a disturbance and return to pre disturbance hydrological function folke et al 2002 gunderson 2000 gunderson and pritchard 2012 holling 1973 peterson et al 2012 following this concept studies have quantified the hydrologic resilience of ecosystem from two aspects 1 the size of disturbances that an ecosystem could withstand without changing its original hydrological function and or 2 the return rate to its prior hydrological states after disturbances gunderson 2000 for example richter et al 1996 developed a method for assessing the threshold of climate condition under which the hydrological processes were altered they used monthly and yearly stream flow to quantify hydrologic alterations under human and climate disturbances this method efficiently detected the change of hydrologic regimes associated with long term disturbances e g the dam effect and year round groundwater pumping richter et al 1996 however the method does not well capture the hydrological alteration under short term disturbances e g hurricanes rainfall storms and droughts in vulnerable systems a short term climate disturbance may cause dramatic hydrological alteration with ecological and social consequences folke 2006 peterson et al 2012 improved the representation of hydrological responses to shorter temporal scale disturbances by using an analytical resilience method in their study the dynamics of groundwater table gwt in a lumped artificial unconfined aquifer was used as a metric to quantify wetland resilience peterson et al 2012 two separate deep and shallow stable states of gwt were identified under constant annual precipitation with dry and wet initial conditions peterson et al 2012 after identifying the stable states peterson et al 2012 examined the deviation of gwt from the stable states under stochastic precipitation series with different annual intensity they found that with the increase in precipitation gwt near the deep steady state is more resilient to large rainfall events than the gwt near the shallow stable state because the lower steady state enabled large storage rooms for large rainfall thus can absorb more rainfall however due to the non linearity of wetland dynamics the steady states of gwt under annual averaged rainfall may not represent the stable states of the water table at daily weekly and monthly scales additionally the ecosystem heterogeneity was not considered in the lumped modeling framework which might cause large uncertainties in quantifying the hydrologic resilience of an actual ecosystem montefalcone et al 2011 furthermore using only one hydrological variable e g flow rate in richter et al 1996 and gwt in peterson et al 2012 may not be sufficient to effectively reflect the hydrologic resilience of an ecosystem where a full hydrological cycle is involved to comprehensively quantify the hydrologic resilience of actual wetland ecosystems with high landscape heterogeneity our study aimed to improve the methodology of quantifying wetland hydrological resilience of actual wetland ecosystems we developed a set of comprehensive metrics e g groundwater table overland flow rate and saltwater table to enhance the state of knowledge on coastal wetland resilience at multi spatial and temporal scales the application of the approach to coastal forested and coastal herbaceous wetlands in north carolina usa demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed quantitative method for quantifying hydrologic resilience of coastal wetlands 2 methodology 2 1 quantification of wetland hydrologic resilience hr to characterize wetland hydrologic resilience we focused on quantifying 1 the threshold intensity of climate disturbances that coastal wetland system could withstand without significant change in their hydrological function and 2 the capability of recovering their hydrological function from disturbances to the pre disturbance state we defined significant change in hydrological function as the large deviation of the hydrological fluxes states from their climatological mean for example we identified the change of the hydrological fluxes states as statistically significant when the change was at least one standard deviation above or below the climatological mean the method proposed here emphasizes the hydrological interactions among upland coastal forested wetland coastal herbaceous wetland and the ocean which together determine the hydrodynamics of coastal wetlands we hypothesized that 1 due to the non linearity of the complex wetland system one or several thresholds of climate disturbances forcing may exist passing which the hydrological function may be significantly altered and 2 the characteristics of ecosystem resilience may not be easily examined under a short time series analysis thus a long time series analysis of the hydrological processes e g decades is needed we chose groundwater table gwt overland flow rate ofr and water table of saltwater st as indicators of wetland hydrologic resilience level 1 in fig 1 the variations of these variables reflect the changes in wetland hydrological functions in particular the capability to store and release water wetland hydrology impacts wetland biogeochemical and morphological functions level 2 in fig 1 mainly through changing the gwt ofr and st the arrows linking level 1 and level 2 in fig 1 ardón et al 2013 cahoon et al 2006 desantis et al 2007 ferguson and gleeson 2012 since hydrologic resilience could present different features across scales gunderson and pritchard 2012 montefalcone et al 2011 thrush et al 2009 this method aims to study the variations of gwt ofr and st on multiple spatial and temporal scales to reveal the nonlinearity of wetland ecosystems specifically we first analyzed the climatic forcing and identified climate variability and extremes e g dry and wet years large rainfall events and droughts then we quantified the hydrologic resilience by examining the self adaptive cycles of gwt ofr and st at the seasonal and inter annual scales next we investigated the response of gwt ofr and st to climate extreme events on the daily scale last we quantified the spatial variation of hydrologic resilience to climate disturbances by examining the spatial variations of gwt ofr and st under climate extreme events table 1 2 2 study area the study area is the albemarle pamlico peninsula on the lower coastal plain of eastern north carolina with an area of 2784 km2 fig 2 the area experiences little disturbances from human activities the elevation is higher at the west and lower at the east with an elevation relief of approximately 7 m fig s1 the domain generally consists of forested wetland 78 of the study area and emergent herbaceous wetland 3 of the study area fig 2 vegetation height varies from 0 6 m for the herbaceous wetland to up to 20 m for the forest moorhead and brinson 1995 derived the distribution of each wetland community type based on the national wetlands inventory nwi the majority of vegetation types in the forested wetland are an evergreen forest 50 and a mixed forest 40 and the majority of vegetation types in the emergent herbaceous wetland are marsh 60 and shrub 40 moorhead and brinson 1995 in terms of tolerance to salinity the highly salt tolerant vegetation saltwater marsh mainly occurs in the coastal zone within 200 300 m from the shoreline kemp et al 2009 although no studies have documented the detailed distribution of vegetation species in the forested wetlands richardson 1991 generally described that the forested wetland as consists of highly salt tolerant trees e g persea borbonia moderately salt tolerant trees e g magnolia virginiana moderately salt tolerant shrub e g ilex glabra and weakly salt tolerant shrub e g aronia arbutifolia the level of salt tolerance of these vegetation species refers to graetz 1973 a fully

this paper star in fig 2 to measure energy fluxes precipitation temperature humidity carbon flux soil respiration groundwater table dynamics and soil water content mean annual temperature of the study area is about 16 9 c 1971 2000 with the lowest and highest temperature of 6 8 c and 26 5 c in january and july respectively miao et al 2013 according to local sea level observations the mean sea level has increased by 0 083 m from 1995 to 2014 noaa 2017 the soil is an organic muck hydric soil water regime underlain by poorly drained pleistocene sedimentary deposits riggs et al 1992 the groundwater table gwt of the forested wetland varied between 0 3 m below ground surface to 0 3 m above the ground surface from 2009 to 2011 miao et al 2013 our previous modeling study by zhang et al 2018 found that the averaged summer and winter gwt of the herbaceous wetland is about 0 1 m higher and 0 02 m lower than those in the forested wetland respectively 2 3 pihm wetland model to simulate surface and subsurface hydrological processes we used pihm wetland a new version of penn state integrated hydrological model pihm developed for wetland hydrology a physically based distributed hydrologic model fully coupling coastal processes e g tide sea level rise and saltwater intrusion zhang et al 2018 the model domain was decomposed into unstructured triangular mesh and the hydrological processes were solved by using the semi discrete finite volume method zhang et al 2018 pihm wetland tracks the changes of surface water unsaturated and saturated soil water saltwater and canopy water by simulating water exchange through canopy interception infiltration overland flow channel flow unsaturated water flow saturated water flow saltwater lateral flow and evapotranspiration in pihm wetland the canopy interception is described as a function of leaf area index lai dickinson 1984 kumar 2009 if precipitation exceeds the capacity of canopy interception precipitation drops to the land surface as throughfall overland flow and channel flow are represented by a two dimensional simplified st venant equation zhang et al 2016 with a cell to cell routing processes overland flow occurs when precipitation rate exceeds infiltration rate infiltration excess overland flow or soil is saturated saturation excess overland flow soil water movement is described by a one dimensional unsaturated flow and two dimensional saturated flow which are represented by richard s equation and darcy s saturated flow equation respectively zhang et al 2016 pihm wetland assumes that fresh groundwater and saltwater form a clear freshwater saltwater interface and the saltwater lateral flow follows darcy s law the model also tracks water loss from soil evaporation plant transpiration and canopy evaporation which are governed by the penman monteith equation zhang et al 2016 pihm wetland is useful for the current study because 1 it has the ability to simulate regional scale hydrological processes across environmental gradients 2 it is physically based and fully couples coastal processes and 3 it is well calibrated and validated for this site zhang et al 2018 details of the hydrological components of the model are referred to the literature kumar 2009 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 2 4 data pihm wetland used the national dataset for meteorological forcing and parameterizations of soil and land cover properties we used the time series of meteorological data from phase 2 of the national land data assimilation system nldas 2 xia et al 2012 as our forcing data including precipitation surface air temperature specific humidity air pressure and solar radiation nldas 2 has a spatial resolution of 0 125 and temporal scale of one hour xia et al 2012 the adequacy of using the national meteorological dataset to the study domain is evaluated by zhang et al 2018 who found that the 20 year nldas 2 dataset agrees well with the observed meteorological variables from the observation sites in the seasonal analysis we defined the four seasons as spring march may summer june august fall september november and winter december of the current year and january and february of the following year the soil parameters governing the processes of infiltration recharge and lateral groundwater flow include vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity porosity and coefficients for the soil water retention curve these parameters were derived from the national gridded soil survey geographic gssurgo database that provides soil texture organic matter content and soil bulk density at different depths of soil layer soil survey staff 2016 the derivation of the soil parameters can be found at wösten et al 1999 the gssurgo dataset shows that the well drained soil is mainly located at the top 0 0 3 m soil zone where the soil is rich in coarse organic matter and the bottom soil layer below 0 3 m is poorly drained substrate which is consistent with the field measurement studies bruland and richardson 2006 moorhead and brinson 1995 the dataset also has a good spatial representation of soil type variability because of its fine spatial resolution 30 m soil survey staff 2016 the soil map can be found in the supplementary information fig s2 the land cover parameters governing the processes of evapotranspiration overland flow and energy budget are maximum leaf area index lai minimum stomatal resistance reference stomatal resistance albedo vegetation fraction manning s roughness and root zone depth these parameters were obtained from the national land cover dataset nlcd fry et al 2011 and the monthly vegetation database https ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas web web veg monthly table html that is widely used in the land surface models such as bat dickinson et al 1993 sib sellers et al 1986 clm dai et al 2003 and noah lsm chen et al 1996 based on the nlcd land cover classification in 2011 there are 10 land cover types in the study domain including open water barren land deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest shrub scrub herbaceous cultivated crops woody wetlands and emergent herb wetlands fig 2 for the coastal processes we obtained the tidal observations from the oregon inlet marina station station id 8652587 of noaa national oceanic and atmospheric association tide and current https tidesandcurrents noaa gov the absolute height of hourly tide was calculated by adding the relative tide height above mean sea level msl to the msl according to the mean sea level trend in noaa we used a linear function msl 0 0003 t 43200 0 019 to represent sea level rise where t is the time from 1995 to 2014 unit minute and t 0 on jan 1st 1995 2 5 model setup we conducted a 20 year hydrological simulation from 1995 to 2014 with the one minute time interval for simulation and the daily time step for outputs the study domain was decomposed into 6290 unstructured triangular elements with the closed boundary condition except the open boundary condition near the coastline where the coastal processes interact with the hydrological processes on land fig s3 the average size longest edge of the elements was around 100 m with finer elements located at the areas with a higher heterogeneity of land cover topography and soil according to the soil features from the gssurgo dataset and in situ measurements the model set two soil layers comprised of a well drained top layer 0 0 3 m and poorly drained bottom layer 0 3 1 m by assuming that the subsurface hydrological activities primarily occur in the top one meter soil zone we set the initial gwt to be 0 1 m below ground surface with no surface water for the model domain the lake level was set to be constant through time the model simulation started after a five year spin up run by which the system reaches a relative equilibrium state the model parameters are summarized in tables s1 and s2 3 results 3 1 long term climate variability change precipitation and temperature data from the nldas 2 product and in situ measurements from the observation site red star in fig 2 were used to analyze the impact of climate on wetland hydrology during 1995 2014 validation of the nldas 2 products indicated that the nldas 2 data reasonably captured the meteorological conditions in this area zhang et al 2018 the 20 year averaged annual precipitation was 3 4 0 4 mm day and the annual air temperature was 18 3 2 c the seasonal and inter annual variations of precipitation were larger than the seasonal and inter annual variations of temperature from 1995 to 2014 fig 3 a and b storms and hurricanes contributed significantly to high rainfall in summer miao et al 2013 to better understand hydrological responses to climate variability and climate change we classified the 20 yr period into dry years wet years and normal years based on annual precipitation there were three dry years 1997 2001 and 2007 colored in orange in fig 3 and three wet years 1996 2003 and 2009 colored in light blue in fig 3 where the annual precipitation anomaly is lower and higher than one standard deviation of the climatological mean precipitation i e 0 42 mm day respectively following li et al 2011 the remaining 14 years were normal years colored in gray in fig 3 in general precipitation in all seasons during the wet years was higher than that in the dry years fig 3a for example in 2003 a wet year the annual mean precipitation was two standard deviations above the 20 year climatological mean similarly the annual mean precipitation of 2001 a dry year was 33 lower than two standard deviations below the 20 year climatology in order to understand the hydrological response to climate extremes we defined heavy rainfall events with their daily precipitation rates higher than the 75th percentile of the precipitation distribution equivalent to 13 mm day see the precipitation distribution in fig s4 in contrast to precipitation the magnitude and variation of annual mean temperature are about the same during dry and wet years fig 3b according to noaa tide and sea level observation near the coast of the study area the sea level presents clear seasonal and inter annual variations during the 20 yr period fig 3c seasonal sea level varied within 0 05 m each year the annual sea level first decreased from 1996 to 2002 followed by a gradual increase from 2003 to 2006 annual sea level dropped in 2007 after which it increased again from 2008 to 2014 the overall sea level increased about 0 08 m from 0 019 m in 1995 to 0 099 m in 2014 3 2 response of groundwater table to multi scale climate disturbances 3 2 1 seasonal and inter annual groundwater table variations the first component of the hydrologic metrics for quantifying the threshold response of wetland hydrology to climate variability is groundwater table gwt we first examined the spatial averaged seasonal and annual variations of gwt from the model simulation for the coastal forested wetland fig 4 a and the coastal herbaceous wetland fig 4b respectively at the inter annual scale the gwt varied between 0 02 and 0 13 m below the ground surface for the coastal forested wetland middle point of the black bars in fig 4a and between 0 025 and 0 1 m below the ground surface for the coastal herbaceous wetland middle point of the black bars in fig 4b the interannual variation of gwt was highly correlated with annual precipitation the correlation coefficient between the two is 0 95 and 0 91 for the coastal forested and coastal herbaceous wetland respectively both significant at 0 01 level the annual mean gwt of the coastal herbaceous wetland showed a slight increase from 1995 to 2014 fig 4b which may be attributed to the increase in sea level during the period fig 3c however no significant change of annual mean gwt for the coastal forested wetland was found indicating that the influence of current sea level rise on gwt of the coastal forested wetland was minor over the study period at the seasonal scale gwt fluctuated widely with a high gwt in winter and low gwt in summer in general for the coastal forested wetland the winter gwt tended to return to its climatological winter gwt 0 015 m blue dashed line in fig 4a during 1995 2014 except the extremely dry years when the annual precipitation was two standard deviations lower than the climatological mean precipitation specifically in the extremely dry years i e 2001 and 2007 the winter gwt 0 11 m and 0 3 m for 2001 and 2007 respectively did not return to the climatological mean level for the coastal herbaceous wetland the seasonal variations of gwt were impacted by both precipitation and sea level variations the winter gwt showed a larger seasonal variation compared to that of the coastal forested wetland due to the regulation of sea level further seasonal mean gwt in the extremely dry years 2001 and 2007 were apparently lower than that in the other years fig 3a and b 3 2 2 daily scale groundwater table variation under climatic dryness the gwt variations at the seasonal and annual time scales may dampen how gwt responds to climate events at finer time scales therefore we analyzed the gwt variation under the different duration of no rainfall on daily time scales fig 5 shows the lowest daily gwt during different durations of no rainfall in the dry orange bars and wet years light blue bars for the coastal forested wetland fig 5a and coastal herbaceous wetland fig 5b respectively each bar represents the mean middle dot and one standard deviation ends of the bar of gwt during different drought events with the same duration the longest duration of no rainfall was 15 days and 9 days during the dry and wet years respectively for the coastal forested wetland the gwt remained at a similar level in the wet years about 0 02 m fig 5a even when drought reached its longest duration nine days the water level was approximately 0 1 m higher than that in the dry years fig 5a likewise the gwt about 0 12 m did not change much in the dry years when the no rainfall days were shorter than six days the stable groundwater level may be attributed to the stable hydrologic connectivity between aquifers because the water loss in the forested wetland can be easily compensated by water supplies from the upland and the coastal herbaceous wetland however when the drought duration was longer than six days in the dry years fig 5a the gwt dropped significantly with an increase in drought duration because the hydrologic connectivity between aquifers weakened the water supply from the upland and the coastal herbaceous wetland could not compensate for the water loss during long dry periods the gwt declined approximately linearly when the dry periods exceeded 6 days dashed line in fig 5a with an averaged drop rate of 0 03 m per day for the herbaceous wetland the gwt remained at the similar level regardless of the dry and wet climate conditions mainly because of strong regulation by sea level fig 5b 3 3 response of overland flow to multi scale climate disturbances 3 3 1 the variation of overland flow under rainfall events the second component in the metrics for quantifying the threshold response of wetland hydrology to climate variability is overland flow substantial studies have shown that overland flow responds quickly to rainfall events beven 2011 freeze 1980 lyne and hollick 1979 thus we focused on the threshold response of overland flow to individual rainfall events on daily scales and the seasonal and inter annual variations of overland flow can be found in fig s5 fig 6 shows the relationship between daily overland flow and precipitation intensity in different seasons in the dry and wet years in the dry years fig 6b large overland flow rarely occurred especially in the spring summer and fall seasons when rainfall was less than 30 mm day this is because the relatively low soil water content during dry years provided sufficient water storage room for water infiltration and storage the relatively large overland flow was observed in winter black dots in fig 6a because the soil was close to saturation due to shallow gwt in winter and provided a limited capacity for water infiltration and storage however during the wet years overland flow rates were approximately two to ten times greater than those during the dry years and the high flow rate occurred in all seasons fig 6b because soil saturation level was high throughout the year making the overland flow more likely to occur in the wet years 3 3 2 spatial variation of overland flow during large rainfall events our previous work demonstrates that the hydrological processes of coastal wetland respond differently to seasonal climate variability across environmental gradient zhang et al 2018 we therefore examined the spatial variation of the overland flow rate under large rainfall events to better understand the magnitude and distribution of overland flow rate we also analyzed the spatial distribution of subsurface flow rate during large rainfall events fig 7 shows the maximum rates of surface and subsurface water passing through the edges of each triangular element at different elevations in the decomposed model domain each dot represents the water flow rate on each cell with different elevation during each individual rainfall event we focused on the spatial variation of water flow under rainfall events higher than 13 mm day 75th percentile of the rainfall distribution in fig s4 upon which soil erosion is more likely to happen for overland flow distribution fig 7a the elements with high flow rate were located in the region with elevation between 0 5 m and 2 m light green shaded area in fig 7a especially the extremely high flow region with elevation between 0 2 m and 0 7 m light orange shaded area in fig 7a the overland flow rate was relatively low at the regions with the elevation higher than approximately two meters it is estimated that spatially the regions with high and extremely high overland flows occupied 82 light green in fig 7b and 39 orange in fig 7b respectively of the study domain when daily precipitation was higher than 13 mm day in contrast the subsurface flow rate was much lower than overland flow rate during large rainfall events 13 mm day because a large proportion of the rainfall becomes overland flow without infiltrating to the soil zone e g infiltration excess runoff generation the elements with relatively high subsurface flow rate were located in a much narrower region with elevation between 0 4 m and 0 6 m light blue shaded area in fig 7c occupying 25 of the study domain light blue in fig 7d beyond which the subsurface flow rates were small regardless of the intensity of rainfall 3 4 response of saltwater intrusion to multi scale climate disturbances 3 4 1 seasonal and inter annual variations of saltwater table the third metric for quantifying the threshold response of wetland hydrology to climate variability is saltwater table saltwater intrudes into the coastal wetland due to the hydraulic head gradient between seawater and fresh groundwater fig 8 due to the higher density intruded saltwater usually exists beneath fresh groundwater forming a saltwater freshwater interface gupta 1985 mcelwee 1985 polo and ramis 1983 shamir and dagan 1971 seasonally the saltwater table variation was small within 0 025 m even in the dry and wet years see the colored dots in fig 8 inter annually saltwater table the black solid line in fig 8 is relatively smooth and flat from 1995 to 2007 after which saltwater table was apparently elevated from 2008 to 2014 statistically in general the annual saltwater table variation was well correlated with the annual sea level variation correlation coefficient of 0 72 at 95 confidence level while the influences of annual precipitation and temperature on the saltwater table were secondary correlation coefficient of 0 36 and 0 21 for precipitation and temperature at 95 confidence level respectively 3 4 2 spatial distribution of saltwater table during extremely wet and dry periods although the influences of precipitation and temperature on the domain averaged saltwater variation were secondary it is interesting to know the spatial variation of the saltwater table under extremely wet and dry periods during the 20 year period the extremely wet and dry periods are equivalent to the periods with the highest and lowest gwt which were identified in december of 2009 one of the wet years and december of 2007 one of the dry years respectively fig 9 shows the difference in saltwater depth between these two periods the regions in dark blue and light colors represent the area without and with saltwater intrusion respectively the region with saltwater intrusion was mainly located in the low lying area near the coast fig 9 the largest difference of saltwater depth in the extremely wet and dry periods was approximately 0 5 m and the regions with the largest difference of saltwater depth were located hundreds of meters away from the coastline yellow circles in fig 9 notably these regions indicate the critical region where freshwater processes strongly interact with the coastal processes towards the ocean the interaction weakens and the coastal processes dominate the dynamics of wetland hydrology towards the inland the interaction weakens as well and the freshwater processes dominate the hydrodynamics of the wetland 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic resilience of the coastal wetland 4 1 1 hydrologic resilience to drought at the seasonal and inter annual scales the gwt of forested wetlands in winter returned to the climatological mean except during the extremely dry years when annual mean precipitation was two standard deviation below the 20 year climatological mean precipitation fig 4a this reveals the capacity of the coastal wetland to restore the gwt from dry climate conditions less or no rainfall thus seasonal and inter annual variations of gwt can be used as an indicator of hydrologic resilience to dry climate conditions this gwt climate relationship reveals the hydrological adaptive cycle of the coastal wetland system holling and gunderson 2002 large disturbances like the extremely dry year may delay and change the time and trajectory of the cycle we also found that gwt of forested wetland declined dramatically when the drought duration was longer than six days in the dry years orange bars in fig 5a indicating low resilience to drought under these conditions fig 5a on the other hand the coastal herbaceous wetland was resilient to drought because the gwt level always stayed at a similar level 0 04 m even when the duration of drought reached its longest duration blue and orange bars in fig 5b therefore for forested wetlands it appears a dramatic decline in hydrologic function may occur when the duration of drought exceeds the threshold of six days this water stress condition may therefore have a large impact on the stability of other wetland ecological functions folke et al 2004 4 1 2 hydrologic resilience to rainfall events the event based analysis found that overland flows were largely attenuated or prevented in the spring summer and fall during the dry years when the rainfall rate was less than 30 mm day fig 6 indicating hydrologic resilience to rainfall events of this magnitude during the dry years however in the wet years the ecosystem became less resilient to rainfall because a small amount of rainfall caused large overland flow due to limited water storage capacity fig 6b the spatial distribution of overland flow suggests that high overland flow would occur on over 82 of the coastal wetland domain under heavy rainfall 13 mm day fig 7a and b which reveals that the majority of the wetland is less resilient to heavy rainfall thus understanding the threshold response of overland flow to rainfall events is important for predicting changes in wetland structure and function under heavy rainfall events for example a large overland flow may significantly increase land surface erosion and massive losses of biomass kirwan and megonigal 2013 kozlowski 2002 thereby changing the wetland morphological function additionally flood frequency and duration can be critical for vegetation development through impacting on soil oxygen availability for root aerobic respiration seed germination and vegetation growth fagherazzi et al 2004 thus the increase in flooding would accelerate the mortality of flooding intolerant plants conner et al 2002 4 1 3 hydrologic resilience to sea level rise seasonally the variation of the domain averaged saltwater table was within 0 025 m fig 8 which could be attributed to the slow response of saltwater diffusion to seasonal climate variability in other words the saltwater table variation is not sensitive to seasonal climate fluctuations revealing that the wetland system could effectively absorb seasonal climate disturbance and retain its pre disturbance saltwater table levels annually the saltwater table was relatively flat with very few oscillations between 1995 and 2007 and increased obviously after 2007 fig 8 before 2007 the sea level control on the saltwater table was not apparent although sea level presented 0 1 m annual variation the relatively low sea level averaged sea level of 0 04 m in fig 3c would be the main reason for the relatively flat saltwater table profile the wetland system could absorb the influence of the annual sea level change on the saltwater table variation however after 2007 the saltwater table increased apparently with the rise in sea level averaged sea level of 0 1 m in fig 3c the relatively high sea level presented dominant control on saltwater table variation this suggests that the sea level of 0 1 m after 2007 would be equal to or higher than the sea level threshold above which the wetland system cannot absorb the influence of sea level rise on saltwater table variation spatially the largest difference of saltwater table between the extremely dry and wet periods was up to 0 5 m the areas in yellow in fig 9 suggesting that the area is a critical region where freshwater processes highly interact with the coastal processes the analyses above are based on current climate conditions however the future sea level rise is expected to be three to ten times higher than the current rate of sea level rise by the end of the 21st century nicholls and cazenave 2010 as a result the dominant control of sea level on saltwater table variation will be intensified in the future placing more stress on salt intolerant vegetation 4 2 limitations and future work we acknowledge that some levels of uncertainty still exist due to the lack of sufficient observation of the hydrological processes for model calibration and validation and uncertainties in datasets and in the model itself a detailed discussion of the uncertainties can be found in zhang et al 2018 despite the limitations this study provides guidance for field observations which in turn will facilitate a more accurate model based wetland resilience assessment especially on a regional scale future research should target improving the hr quantification method for example soil moisture change and the frequency and duration of flood can potentially be other indicators of wetland resilience in addition future research should use the knowledge of hydrologic resilience gained from this study to understand the threshold response of biogeochemical and geomorphological processes to climate variability and climate change for instance with the understanding of saltwater table variation we can investigate the different ecological response of vegetation species such as saltwater and freshwater marsh to sea level rise additionally the influences of human activities on wetland hydrological resilience such as ditching and land conversion liu et al 2018 must be considered as feedbacks between human and natural system exert significant control over ecosystem resilience to environmental change gunderson 2001 walker et al 2006 5 conclusions we developed a quantitative method for characterizing wetland hydrologic resilience by introducing comprehensive metrics of coastal hydrologic processes for multi scale assessments of coastal wetland resilience emphasizing the capacity of coastal wetland in storing and releasing water we used groundwater table overland flow rate and saltwater table as indicators of hydrologic resilience in an updated process based hydrologic model pihm wetland we applied the model approach to coastal wetlands in north carolina usa to investigate its hydrologic resilience to climate disturbances from 1995 to 2014 including multiscale variabilities of precipitation temperature and sea level rise to our knowledge this is the first study investigating hydrologic resilience to climate variability using a process based numerical model at multiple spatial and temporal scales in an actual ecosystem our analyses confirmed the existence of threshold climate conditions that controlled the hydrological functions of coastal wetlands hydrologic resilience presented different characteristics at different temporal scales the gwt variation could effectively reflect the hydrologic resilience of the coastal wetland to drought at the seasonal inter annual and daily scales the variation of overland flow under individual rainfall events can be a good indicator of hydrologic resilience to rainfall events the saltwater table can be a good indicator of hydrologic resilience to sea level rise the saltwater table is not sensitive to seasonal climate variability and the annual sea level rise is the primary control of the annual variation of the saltwater table this study demonstrates the importance of quantifying wetland resilience at the regional scale accounting for water supply sources and sinks from adjacent landscape components such as uplands and the ocean which together control the hydrodynamics of coastal wetland ecosystems this study also confirmed the necessity of quantifying hydrologic resilience from long time series data analysis that is more likely to capture threshold responses to the wide range of stochastically varying climate conditions although wetlands are very diverse globally our model based approach is adaptable to other systems as long as the data required for parameterization are available providing a consistent framework to assess wetland hydrological resilience to global environmental change acknowledgments we first thank the

6813,climate induced disturbances are expected to increase in frequency and intensity and affect wetland ecology by altering its hydrology investigating how wetland hydrology responds to climate disturbances is an important first step to understand the ecological response of coastal wetlands to these disturbances wetland hydrologic resilience the ability of wetland in absorbing disturbances and restoring to pre disturbance conditions in hydrological function is a critical measure of wetland hydrological response to climate disturbances however a practical methodology for quantifying wetland hydrologic resilience hr is still lacking this study aimed to improve the approach for quantifying the hydrologic resilience of wetland ecosystems to climate variability and climate change a set of quantitative metrics was developed including the variations of groundwater table overland flow and saltwater table this approach was then applied to a coastal landscape that includes coastal forested and herbaceous wetlands in north carolina usa we investigated the threshold behaviors of groundwater table overland flow and saltwater table for a 20 year period 1995 2014 by applying a regional scale wetland hydrological model penn state integrated hydrological model for wetland hydrology pihm wetland we found that the multiscale variations of groundwater table under dry climatic conditions is a good indicator of wetland hr to drought the variation of overland flow during rainfall events effectively quantified hr to wet periods we also found that the variation of the water level of saltwater is an important metric of wetland hr to sea level rise this study improves the methodology of quantifying wetland hydrologic resilience at a regional scale representing an important first step towards understanding the wetland hydrological and ecological resilience to future intensified climate disturbances in coastal regions and beyond keywords coastal wetland wetland resilience hydrologic model climate variability tipping point absorption and restoration 1 introduction climate change comprised of rising temperature changes in the intensity and frequency of rainfall and accelerating sea level rise slr over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales is one of the most important threats to coastal wetland ecosystems burkett and kusler 2000 mitsch et al 2013 these climate driven disturbances affect wetland ecological functions through altering wetland hydrological function the capability of wetlands in storing and releasing water winter 2000 for example the decline of groundwater storage due to droughts may cause water stress on wetland vegetation rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2007 and enhance the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs from wetland soil burkett and kusler 2000 flooding associated with storms and sea level rise may significantly increase soil erosion day et al 2008 and the mortality of flood intolerant vegetation conner et al 2002 furthermore saltwater intrusion driven by the change in storage of freshwater and sea level rise may affect the survival and productivity of salt intolerant plants williams et al 2003 thus understanding how wetland hydrology responds to the changing climate is important for wetland ecosystem conservation previous studies have focused on assessing and predicting the consequences of current and future climate disturbances on wetland hydrology desantis et al 2007 lu et al 2009 michener et al 1997 nicholls 2004 tufford 2011 zhu et al 2017 however most of these studies provided limited information about the threshold response of hydrological processes to climate disturbances in other words under what climate conditions thresholds the wetland hydrological functions may be significantly altered are not clear such knowledge is urgently needed in wetland ecosystem management to respond to increasing climate change and sea level rise globally wetland hydrologic resilience hr has been found as a useful concept to understand the threshold response of wetland hydrology to climatic disturbances peterson et al 2012 ridolfi et al 2006 the term hydrologic resilience which stems from the concept of ecological resilience describes the ability of wetlands to absorb a disturbance and return to pre disturbance hydrological function folke et al 2002 gunderson 2000 gunderson and pritchard 2012 holling 1973 peterson et al 2012 following this concept studies have quantified the hydrologic resilience of ecosystem from two aspects 1 the size of disturbances that an ecosystem could withstand without changing its original hydrological function and or 2 the return rate to its prior hydrological states after disturbances gunderson 2000 for example richter et al 1996 developed a method for assessing the threshold of climate condition under which the hydrological processes were altered they used monthly and yearly stream flow to quantify hydrologic alterations under human and climate disturbances this method efficiently detected the change of hydrologic regimes associated with long term disturbances e g the dam effect and year round groundwater pumping richter et al 1996 however the method does not well capture the hydrological alteration under short term disturbances e g hurricanes rainfall storms and droughts in vulnerable systems a short term climate disturbance may cause dramatic hydrological alteration with ecological and social consequences folke 2006 peterson et al 2012 improved the representation of hydrological responses to shorter temporal scale disturbances by using an analytical resilience method in their study the dynamics of groundwater table gwt in a lumped artificial unconfined aquifer was used as a metric to quantify wetland resilience peterson et al 2012 two separate deep and shallow stable states of gwt were identified under constant annual precipitation with dry and wet initial conditions peterson et al 2012 after identifying the stable states peterson et al 2012 examined the deviation of gwt from the stable states under stochastic precipitation series with different annual intensity they found that with the increase in precipitation gwt near the deep steady state is more resilient to large rainfall events than the gwt near the shallow stable state because the lower steady state enabled large storage rooms for large rainfall thus can absorb more rainfall however due to the non linearity of wetland dynamics the steady states of gwt under annual averaged rainfall may not represent the stable states of the water table at daily weekly and monthly scales additionally the ecosystem heterogeneity was not considered in the lumped modeling framework which might cause large uncertainties in quantifying the hydrologic resilience of an actual ecosystem montefalcone et al 2011 furthermore using only one hydrological variable e g flow rate in richter et al 1996 and gwt in peterson et al 2012 may not be sufficient to effectively reflect the hydrologic resilience of an ecosystem where a full hydrological cycle is involved to comprehensively quantify the hydrologic resilience of actual wetland ecosystems with high landscape heterogeneity our study aimed to improve the methodology of quantifying wetland hydrological resilience of actual wetland ecosystems we developed a set of comprehensive metrics e g groundwater table overland flow rate and saltwater table to enhance the state of knowledge on coastal wetland resilience at multi spatial and temporal scales the application of the approach to coastal forested and coastal herbaceous wetlands in north carolina usa demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed quantitative method for quantifying hydrologic resilience of coastal wetlands 2 methodology 2 1 quantification of wetland hydrologic resilience hr to characterize wetland hydrologic resilience we focused on quantifying 1 the threshold intensity of climate disturbances that coastal wetland system could withstand without significant change in their hydrological function and 2 the capability of recovering their hydrological function from disturbances to the pre disturbance state we defined significant change in hydrological function as the large deviation of the hydrological fluxes states from their climatological mean for example we identified the change of the hydrological fluxes states as statistically significant when the change was at least one standard deviation above or below the climatological mean the method proposed here emphasizes the hydrological interactions among upland coastal forested wetland coastal herbaceous wetland and the ocean which together determine the hydrodynamics of coastal wetlands we hypothesized that 1 due to the non linearity of the complex wetland system one or several thresholds of climate disturbances forcing may exist passing which the hydrological function may be significantly altered and 2 the characteristics of ecosystem resilience may not be easily examined under a short time series analysis thus a long time series analysis of the hydrological processes e g decades is needed we chose groundwater table gwt overland flow rate ofr and water table of saltwater st as indicators of wetland hydrologic resilience level 1 in fig 1 the variations of these variables reflect the changes in wetland hydrological functions in particular the capability to store and release water wetland hydrology impacts wetland biogeochemical and morphological functions level 2 in fig 1 mainly through changing the gwt ofr and st the arrows linking level 1 and level 2 in fig 1 ardón et al 2013 cahoon et al 2006 desantis et al 2007 ferguson and gleeson 2012 since hydrologic resilience could present different features across scales gunderson and pritchard 2012 montefalcone et al 2011 thrush et al 2009 this method aims to study the variations of gwt ofr and st on multiple spatial and temporal scales to reveal the nonlinearity of wetland ecosystems specifically we first analyzed the climatic forcing and identified climate variability and extremes e g dry and wet years large rainfall events and droughts then we quantified the hydrologic resilience by examining the self adaptive cycles of gwt ofr and st at the seasonal and inter annual scales next we investigated the response of gwt ofr and st to climate extreme events on the daily scale last we quantified the spatial variation of hydrologic resilience to climate disturbances by examining the spatial variations of gwt ofr and st under climate extreme events table 1 2 2 study area the study area is the albemarle pamlico peninsula on the lower coastal plain of eastern north carolina with an area of 2784 km2 fig 2 the area experiences little disturbances from human activities the elevation is higher at the west and lower at the east with an elevation relief of approximately 7 m fig s1 the domain generally consists of forested wetland 78 of the study area and emergent herbaceous wetland 3 of the study area fig 2 vegetation height varies from 0 6 m for the herbaceous wetland to up to 20 m for the forest moorhead and brinson 1995 derived the distribution of each wetland community type based on the national wetlands inventory nwi the majority of vegetation types in the forested wetland are an evergreen forest 50 and a mixed forest 40 and the majority of vegetation types in the emergent herbaceous wetland are marsh 60 and shrub 40 moorhead and brinson 1995 in terms of tolerance to salinity the highly salt tolerant vegetation saltwater marsh mainly occurs in the coastal zone within 200 300 m from the shoreline kemp et al 2009 although no studies have documented the detailed distribution of vegetation species in the forested wetlands richardson 1991 generally described that the forested wetland as consists of highly salt tolerant trees e g persea borbonia moderately salt tolerant trees e g magnolia virginiana moderately salt tolerant shrub e g ilex glabra and weakly salt tolerant shrub e g aronia arbutifolia the level of salt tolerance of these vegetation species refers to graetz 1973 a fully instrumented eddy flux observation tower is located in the alligator river national wildlife refuge red 1 1 for interpretation to colours in this fig 2 the reader is referred to the web version of

area is about 16 9 c 1971 2000 with the lowest and highest temperature of 6 8 c and 26 5 c in january and july respectively miao et al 2013 according to local sea level observations the mean sea level has increased by 0 083 m from 1995 to 2014 noaa 2017 the soil is an organic muck hydric soil water regime underlain by poorly drained pleistocene sedimentary deposits riggs et al 1992 the groundwater table gwt of the forested wetland varied between 0 3 m below ground surface to 0 3 m above the ground surface from 2009 to 2011 miao et al 2013 our previous modeling study by zhang et al 2018 found that the averaged summer and winter gwt of the herbaceous wetland is about 0 1 m higher and 0 02 m lower than those in the forested wetland respectively 2 3 pihm wetland model to simulate surface and subsurface hydrological processes we used pihm wetland a new version of penn state integrated hydrological model pihm developed for wetland hydrology a physically based distributed hydrologic model fully coupling coastal processes e g tide sea level rise and saltwater intrusion zhang et al 2018 the model domain was decomposed into unstructured triangular mesh and the hydrological processes were solved by using the semi discrete finite volume method zhang et al 2018 pihm wetland tracks the changes of surface water unsaturated and saturated soil water saltwater and canopy water by simulating water exchange through canopy interception infiltration overland flow channel flow unsaturated water flow saturated water flow saltwater lateral flow and evapotranspiration in pihm wetland the canopy interception is described as a function of leaf area index lai dickinson 1984 kumar 2009 if precipitation exceeds the capacity of canopy interception precipitation drops to the land surface as throughfall overland flow and channel flow are represented by a two dimensional simplified st venant equation zhang et al 2016 with a cell to cell routing processes overland flow occurs when precipitation rate exceeds infiltration rate infiltration excess overland flow or soil is saturated saturation excess overland flow soil water movement is described by a one dimensional unsaturated flow and two dimensional saturated flow which are represented by richard s equation and darcy s saturated flow equation respectively zhang et al 2016 pihm wetland assumes that fresh groundwater and saltwater form a clear freshwater saltwater interface and the saltwater lateral flow follows darcy s law the model also tracks water loss from soil evaporation plant transpiration and canopy evaporation which are governed by the penman monteith equation zhang et al 2016 pihm wetland is useful for the current study because 1 it has the ability to simulate regional scale hydrological processes across environmental gradients 2 it is physically based and fully couples coastal processes and 3 it is well calibrated and validated for this site zhang et al 2018 details of the hydrological components of the model are referred to the literature kumar 2009 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 2 4 data pihm wetland used the national dataset for meteorological forcing and parameterizations of soil and land cover properties we used the time series of meteorological data from phase 2 of the national land data assimilation system nldas 2 xia et al 2012 as our forcing data including precipitation surface air temperature specific humidity air pressure and solar radiation nldas 2 has a spatial resolution of 0 125 and temporal scale of one hour xia et al 2012 the adequacy of using the national meteorological dataset to the study domain is evaluated by zhang et al 2018 who found that the 20 year nldas 2 dataset agrees well with the observed meteorological variables from the observation sites in the seasonal analysis we defined the four seasons as spring march may summer june august fall september november and winter december of the current year and january and february of the following year the soil parameters governing the processes of infiltration recharge and lateral groundwater flow include vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity porosity and coefficients for the soil water retention curve these parameters were derived from the national gridded soil survey geographic gssurgo database that provides soil texture organic matter content and soil bulk density at different depths of soil layer soil survey staff 2016 the derivation of the soil parameters can be found at wösten et al 1999 the gssurgo dataset shows that the well drained soil is mainly located at the top 0 0 3 m soil zone where the soil is rich in coarse organic matter and the bottom soil layer below 0 3 m is poorly drained substrate which is consistent with the field measurement studies bruland and richardson 2006 moorhead and brinson 1995 the dataset also has a good spatial representation of soil type variability because of its fine spatial resolution 30 m soil survey staff 2016 the soil map can be found in the supplementary information fig s2 the land cover parameters governing the processes of evapotranspiration overland flow and energy budget are maximum leaf area index lai minimum stomatal resistance reference stomatal resistance albedo vegetation fraction manning s roughness and root zone depth these parameters were obtained from the national land cover dataset nlcd fry et al 2011 and the monthly vegetation database https ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas web web veg monthly table html that is widely used in the land surface models such as bat dickinson et al 1993 sib sellers et al 1986 clm dai et al 2003 and noah lsm chen et al 1996 based on the nlcd land cover classification in 2011 there are 10 land cover types in the study domain including open water barren land deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest shrub scrub herbaceous cultivated crops woody wetlands and emergent herb wetlands fig 2 for the coastal processes we obtained the tidal observations from the oregon inlet marina station station id 8652587 of noaa national oceanic and atmospheric association tide and current https tidesandcurrents noaa gov the absolute height of hourly tide was calculated by adding the relative tide height above mean sea level msl to the msl according to the mean sea level trend in noaa we used a linear function msl 0 0003 t 43200 0 019 to represent sea level rise where t is the time from 1995 to 2014 unit minute and t 0 on jan 1st 1995 2 5 model setup we conducted a 20 year hydrological simulation from 1995 to 2014 with the one minute time interval for simulation and the daily time step for outputs the study domain was decomposed into 6290 unstructured triangular elements with the closed boundary condition except the open boundary condition near the coastline where the coastal processes interact with the hydrological processes on land fig s3 the average size longest edge of the elements was around 100 m with finer elements located at the areas with a higher heterogeneity of land cover topography and soil according to the soil features from the gssurgo dataset and in situ measurements the model set two soil layers comprised of a well drained top layer 0 0 3 m and poorly drained bottom layer 0 3 1 m by assuming that the subsurface hydrological activities primarily occur in the top one meter soil zone we set the initial gwt to be 0 1 m below ground surface with no surface water for the model domain the lake level was set to be constant through time the model simulation started after a five year spin up run by which the system reaches a relative equilibrium state the model parameters are summarized in tables s1 and s2 3 results 3 1 long term climate variability change precipitation and temperature data from the nldas 2 product and in situ measurements from the observation site red star in fig 2 were used to analyze the impact of climate on wetland hydrology during 1995 2014 validation of the nldas 2 products indicated that the nldas 2 data reasonably captured the meteorological conditions in this area zhang et al 2018 the 20 year averaged annual precipitation was 3 4 0 4 mm day and the annual air temperature was 18 3 2 c the seasonal and inter annual variations of precipitation were larger than the seasonal and inter annual variations of temperature from 1995 to 2014 fig 3 a and b storms and hurricanes contributed significantly to high rainfall in summer miao et al 2013 to better understand hydrological responses to climate variability and climate change we classified the 20 yr period into dry years wet years and normal years based on annual precipitation there were three dry years 1997 2001 and 2007 colored in orange in fig 3 and three wet years 1996 2003 and 2009 colored in light blue in fig 3 where the annual precipitation anomaly is lower and higher than one standard deviation of the climatological mean precipitation i e 0 42 mm day respectively following li et al 2011 the remaining 14 years were normal years colored in gray in fig 3 in general precipitation in all seasons during the wet years was higher than that in the dry years fig 3a for example in 2003 a wet year the annual mean precipitation was two standard deviations above the 20 year climatological mean similarly the annual mean precipitation of 2001 a dry year was 33 lower than two standard deviations below the 20 year climatology in order to understand the hydrological response to climate extremes we defined heavy rainfall events with their daily precipitation rates higher than the 75th percentile of the precipitation distribution equivalent to 13 mm day see the precipitation distribution in fig s4 in contrast to precipitation the magnitude and variation of annual mean temperature are about the same during dry and wet years fig 3b according to noaa tide and sea level observation near the coast of the study area the sea level presents clear seasonal and inter annual variations during the 20 yr period fig 3c seasonal sea level varied within 0 05 m each year the annual sea level first decreased from 1996 to 2002 followed by a gradual increase from 2003 to 2006 annual sea level dropped in 2007 after which it increased again from 2008 to 2014 the overall sea level increased about 0 08 m from 0 019 m in 1995 to 0 099 m in 2014 3 2 response of groundwater table to multi scale climate disturbances 3 2 1 seasonal and inter annual groundwater table variations the first component of the hydrologic metrics for quantifying the threshold response of wetland hydrology to climate variability is groundwater table gwt we first examined the spatial averaged seasonal and annual variations of gwt from the model simulation for the coastal forested wetland fig 4 a and the coastal herbaceous wetland fig 4b respectively at the inter annual scale the gwt varied between 0 02 and 0 13 m below the ground surface for the coastal forested wetland middle point of the black bars in fig 4a and between 0 025 and 0 1 m below the ground surface for the coastal herbaceous wetland middle point of the black bars in fig 4b the interannual variation of gwt was highly correlated with annual precipitation the correlation coefficient between the two is 0 95 and 0 91 for the coastal forested and coastal herbaceous wetland respectively both significant at 0 01 level the annual mean gwt of the coastal herbaceous wetland showed a slight increase from 1995 to 2014 fig 4b which may be attributed to the increase in sea level during the period fig 3c however no significant change of annual mean gwt for the coastal forested wetland was found indicating that the influence of current sea level rise on gwt of the coastal forested wetland was minor over the study period at the seasonal scale gwt fluctuated widely with a high gwt in winter and low gwt in summer in general for the coastal forested wetland the winter gwt tended to return to its climatological winter gwt 0 015 m blue dashed line in fig 4a during 1995 2014 except the extremely dry years when the annual precipitation was two standard deviations lower than the climatological mean precipitation specifically in the extremely dry years i e 2001 and 2007 the winter gwt 0 11 m and 0 3 m for 2001 and 2007 respectively did not return to the climatological mean level for the coastal herbaceous wetland the seasonal variations of gwt were impacted by both precipitation and sea level variations the winter gwt showed a larger seasonal variation compared to that of the coastal forested wetland due to the regulation of sea level further seasonal mean gwt in the extremely dry years 2001 and 2007 were apparently lower than that in the other years fig 3a and b 3 2 2 daily scale groundwater table variation under climatic dryness the gwt variations at the seasonal and annual time scales may dampen how gwt responds to climate events at finer time scales therefore we analyzed the gwt variation under the different duration of no rainfall on daily time scales fig 5 shows the lowest daily gwt during different durations of no rainfall in the dry orange bars and wet years light blue bars for the coastal forested wetland fig 5a and coastal herbaceous wetland fig 5b respectively each bar represents the mean middle dot and one standard deviation ends of the bar of gwt during different drought events with the same duration the longest duration of no rainfall was 15 days and 9 days during the dry and wet years respectively for the coastal forested wetland the gwt remained at a similar level in the wet years about 0 02 m fig 5a even when drought reached its longest duration nine days the water level was approximately 0 1 m higher than that in the dry years fig 5a likewise the gwt about 0 12 m did not change much in the dry years when the no rainfall days were shorter than six days the stable groundwater level may be attributed to the stable hydrologic connectivity between aquifers because the water loss in the forested wetland can be easily compensated by water supplies from the upland and the coastal herbaceous wetland however when the drought duration was longer than six days in the dry years fig 5a the gwt dropped significantly with an increase in drought duration because the hydrologic connectivity between aquifers weakened the water supply from the upland and the coastal herbaceous wetland could not compensate for the water loss during long dry periods the gwt declined approximately linearly when the dry periods exceeded 6 days dashed line in fig 5a with an averaged drop rate of 0 03 m per day for the herbaceous wetland the gwt remained at the similar level regardless of the dry and wet climate conditions mainly because of strong regulation by sea level fig 5b 3 3 response of overland flow to multi scale climate disturbances 3 3 1 the variation of overland flow under rainfall events the second component in the metrics for quantifying the threshold response of wetland hydrology to climate variability is overland flow substantial studies have shown that overland flow responds quickly to rainfall events beven 2011 freeze 1980 lyne and hollick 1979 thus we focused on the threshold response of overland flow to individual rainfall events on daily scales and the seasonal and inter annual variations of overland flow can be found in fig s5 fig 6 shows the relationship between daily overland flow and precipitation intensity in different seasons in the dry and wet years in the dry years fig 6b large overland flow rarely occurred especially in the spring summer and fall seasons when rainfall was less than 30 mm day this is because the relatively low soil water content during dry years provided sufficient water storage room for water infiltration and storage the relatively large overland flow was observed in winter black dots in fig 6a because the soil was close to saturation due to shallow gwt in winter and provided a limited capacity for water infiltration and storage however during the wet years overland flow rates were approximately two to ten times greater than those during the dry years and the high flow rate occurred in all seasons fig 6b because soil saturation level was high throughout the year making the overland flow more likely to occur in the wet years 3 3 2 spatial variation of overland flow during large rainfall events our previous work demonstrates that the hydrological processes of coastal wetland respond differently to seasonal climate variability across environmental gradient zhang et al 2018 we therefore examined the spatial variation of the overland flow rate under large rainfall events to better understand the magnitude and distribution of overland flow rate we also analyzed the spatial distribution of subsurface flow rate during large rainfall events fig 7 shows the maximum rates of surface and subsurface water passing through the edges of each triangular element at different elevations in the decomposed model domain each dot represents the water flow rate on each cell with different elevation during each individual rainfall event we focused on the spatial variation of water flow under rainfall events higher than 13 mm day 75th percentile of the rainfall distribution in fig s4 upon which soil erosion is more likely to happen for overland flow distribution fig 7a the elements with high flow rate were located in the region with elevation between 0 5 m and 2 m light green shaded area in fig 7a especially the extremely high flow region with elevation between 0 2 m and 0 7 m light orange shaded area in fig 7a the overland flow rate was relatively low at the regions with the elevation higher than approximately two meters it is estimated that spatially the regions with high and extremely high overland flows occupied 82 light green in fig 7b and 39 orange in fig 7b respectively of the study domain when daily precipitation was higher than 13 mm day in contrast the subsurface flow rate was much lower than overland flow rate during large rainfall events 13 mm day because a large proportion of the rainfall becomes overland flow without infiltrating to the soil zone e g infiltration excess runoff generation the elements with relatively high subsurface flow rate were located in a much narrower region with elevation between 0 4 m and 0 6 m light blue shaded area in fig 7c occupying 25 of the study domain light blue in fig 7d beyond which the subsurface flow rates were small regardless of the intensity of rainfall 3 4 response of saltwater intrusion to multi scale climate disturbances 3 4 1 seasonal and inter annual variations of saltwater table the third metric for quantifying the threshold response of wetland hydrology to climate variability is saltwater table saltwater intrudes into the coastal wetland due to the hydraulic head gradient between seawater and fresh groundwater fig 8 due to the higher density intruded saltwater usually exists beneath fresh groundwater forming a saltwater freshwater interface gupta 1985 mcelwee 1985 polo and ramis 1983 shamir and dagan 1971 seasonally the saltwater table variation was small within 0 025 m even in the dry and wet years see the colored dots in fig 8 inter annually saltwater table the black solid line in fig 8 is relatively smooth and flat from 1995 to 2007 after which saltwater table was apparently elevated from 2008 to 2014 statistically in general the annual saltwater table variation was well correlated with the annual sea level variation correlation coefficient of 0 72 at 95 confidence level while the influences of annual precipitation and temperature on the saltwater table were secondary correlation coefficient of 0 36 and 0 21 for precipitation and temperature at 95 confidence level respectively 3 4 2 spatial distribution of saltwater table during extremely wet and dry periods although the influences of precipitation and temperature on the domain averaged saltwater variation were secondary it is interesting to know the spatial variation of the saltwater table under extremely wet and dry periods during the 20 year period the extremely wet and dry periods are equivalent to the periods with the highest and lowest gwt which were identified in december of 2009 one of the wet years and december of 2007 one of the dry years respectively fig 9 shows the difference in saltwater depth between these two periods the regions in dark blue and light colors represent the area without and with saltwater intrusion respectively the region with saltwater intrusion was mainly located in the low lying area near the coast fig 9 the largest difference of saltwater depth in the extremely wet and dry periods was approximately 0 5 m and the regions with the largest difference of saltwater depth were located hundreds of meters away from the coastline yellow circles in fig 9 notably these regions indicate the critical region where freshwater processes strongly interact with the coastal processes towards the ocean the interaction weakens and the coastal processes dominate the dynamics of wetland hydrology towards the inland the interaction weakens as well and the freshwater processes dominate the hydrodynamics of the wetland 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic resilience of the coastal wetland 4 1 1 hydrologic resilience to drought at the seasonal and inter annual scales the gwt of forested wetlands in winter returned to the climatological mean except during the extremely dry years when annual mean precipitation was two standard deviation below the 20 year climatological mean precipitation fig 4a this reveals the capacity of the coastal wetland to restore the gwt from dry climate conditions less or no rainfall thus seasonal and inter annual variations of gwt can be used as an indicator of hydrologic resilience to dry climate conditions this gwt climate relationship reveals the hydrological adaptive cycle of the coastal wetland system holling and gunderson 2002 large disturbances like the extremely dry year may delay and change the time and trajectory of the cycle we also found that gwt of forested wetland declined dramatically when the drought duration was longer than six days in the dry years orange bars in fig 5a indicating low resilience to drought under these conditions fig 5a on the other hand the coastal herbaceous wetland was resilient to drought because the gwt level always stayed at a similar level 0 04 m even when the duration of drought reached its longest duration blue and orange bars in fig 5b therefore for forested wetlands it appears a dramatic decline in hydrologic function may occur when the duration of drought exceeds the threshold of six days this water stress condition may therefore have a large impact on the stability of other wetland ecological functions folke et al 2004 4 1 2 hydrologic resilience to rainfall events the event based analysis found that overland flows were largely attenuated or prevented in the spring summer and fall during the dry years when the rainfall rate was less than 30 mm day fig 6 indicating hydrologic resilience to rainfall events of this magnitude during the dry years however in the wet years the ecosystem became less resilient to rainfall because a small amount of rainfall caused large overland flow due to limited water storage capacity fig 6b the spatial distribution of overland flow suggests that high overland flow would occur on over 82 of the coastal wetland domain under heavy rainfall 13 mm day fig 7a and b which reveals that the majority of the wetland is less resilient to heavy rainfall thus understanding the threshold response of overland flow to rainfall events is important for predicting changes in wetland structure and function under heavy rainfall events for example a large overland flow may significantly increase land surface erosion and massive losses of biomass kirwan and megonigal 2013 kozlowski 2002 thereby changing the wetland morphological function additionally flood frequency and duration can be critical for vegetation development through impacting on soil oxygen availability for root aerobic respiration seed germination and vegetation growth fagherazzi et al 2004 thus the increase in flooding would accelerate the mortality of flooding intolerant plants conner et al 2002 4 1 3 hydrologic resilience to sea level rise seasonally the variation of the domain averaged saltwater table was within 0 025 m fig 8 which could be attributed to the slow response of saltwater diffusion to seasonal climate variability in other words the saltwater table variation is not sensitive to seasonal climate fluctuations revealing that the wetland system could effectively absorb seasonal climate disturbance and retain its pre disturbance saltwater table levels annually the saltwater table was relatively flat with very few oscillations between 1995 and 2007 and increased obviously after 2007 fig 8 before 2007 the sea level control on the saltwater table was not apparent although sea level presented 0 1 m annual variation the relatively low sea level averaged sea level of 0 04 m in fig 3c would be the main reason for the relatively flat saltwater table profile the wetland system could absorb the influence of the annual sea level change on the saltwater table variation however after 2007 the saltwater table increased apparently with the rise in sea level averaged sea level of 0 1 m in fig 3c the relatively high sea level presented dominant control on saltwater table variation this suggests that the sea level of 0 1 m after 2007 would be equal to or higher than the sea level threshold above which the wetland system cannot absorb the influence of sea level rise on saltwater table variation spatially the largest difference of saltwater table between the extremely dry and wet periods was up to 0 5 m the areas in yellow in fig 9 suggesting that the area is a critical region where freshwater processes highly interact with the coastal processes the analyses above are based on current climate conditions however the future sea level rise is expected to be three to ten times higher than the current rate of sea level rise by the end of the 21st century nicholls and cazenave 2010 as a result the dominant control of sea level on saltwater table variation will be intensified in the future placing more stress on salt intolerant vegetation 4 2 limitations and future work we acknowledge that some levels of uncertainty still exist due to the lack of sufficient observation of the hydrological processes for model calibration and validation and uncertainties in datasets and in the model itself a detailed discussion of the uncertainties can be found in zhang et al 2018 despite the limitations this study provides guidance for field observations which in turn will facilitate a more accurate model based wetland resilience assessment especially on a regional scale future research should target improving the hr quantification method for example soil moisture change and the frequency and duration of flood can potentially be other indicators of wetland resilience in addition future research should use the knowledge of hydrologic resilience gained from this study to understand the threshold response of biogeochemical and geomorphological processes to climate variability and climate change for instance with the understanding of saltwater table variation we can investigate the different ecological response of vegetation species such as saltwater and freshwater marsh to sea level rise additionally the influences of human activities on wetland hydrological resilience such as ditching and land conversion liu et al 2018 must be considered as feedbacks between human and natural system exert significant control over ecosystem resilience to environmental change gunderson 2001 walker et al 2006 5 conclusions we developed a quantitative method for characterizing wetland hydrologic resilience by introducing comprehensive metrics of coastal hydrologic processes for multi scale assessments of coastal wetland resilience emphasizing the capacity of coastal wetland in storing and releasing water we used groundwater table overland flow rate and saltwater table as indicators of hydrologic resilience in an updated process based hydrologic model pihm wetland we applied the model approach to coastal wetlands in north carolina usa to investigate its hydrologic resilience to climate disturbances from 1995 to 2014 including multiscale variabilities of precipitation temperature and sea level rise to our knowledge this is the first study investigating hydrologic resilience to climate variability using a process based numerical model at multiple spatial and temporal scales in an actual ecosystem our analyses confirmed the existence of threshold climate conditions that controlled the hydrological functions of coastal wetlands hydrologic resilience presented different characteristics at different temporal scales the gwt variation could effectively reflect the hydrologic resilience of the coastal wetland to drought at the seasonal inter annual and daily scales the variation of overland flow under individual rainfall events can be a good indicator of hydrologic resilience to rainfall events the saltwater table can be a good indicator of hydrologic resilience to sea level rise the saltwater table is not sensitive to seasonal climate variability and the annual sea level rise is the primary control of the annual variation of the saltwater table this study demonstrates the importance of quantifying wetland resilience at the regional scale accounting for water supply sources and sinks from adjacent landscape components such as uplands and the ocean which together control the hydrodynamics of coastal wetland ecosystems this study also confirmed the necessity of quantifying hydrologic resilience from long time series data analysis that is more likely to capture threshold responses to the wide range of stochastically varying climate conditions although wetlands are very diverse globally our model based approach is adaptable to other systems as long as the data required for parameterization are available providing a consistent framework to assess wetland hydrological resilience to global environmental change acknowledgments we first thank the

6814,hydropower production is altering the mekong river basin s riverine ecosystems which contain the world s largest inland fishery and provide food security and livelihoods to millions of people the basin s hydropower reservoir storage which may rise from 2 of its mean annual flow in 2008 to 20 in 2025 is attenuating seasonal flow variability downstream of many dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs in addition tributary diversions for off stream energy production are reducing downstream flows and augmenting them in recipient tributaries to help manage tradeoffs between dam benefits hydropower irrigation flood control domestic water supply and navigation and their consequences for livelihoods and ecosystems we review observed and projected impacts on river flows along both the mekong mainstream and its tributaries we include the effects of diversions and inter basin transfers which prior reviews of flow alteration in the mekong basin have largely neglected we also discuss the extent to which concurrent changes in climate water demand and land use may offset or exacerbate hydropower induced flow alteration our major recommendations for assessing hydrological impacts in the mekong and other basins undergoing rapid hydropower development include synchronizing and integrating observational and modeling studies improving the accuracy of reservoir water balances evaluating multi objective reservoir operating rules examining hydropeaking induced flow alteration conducting multi dam safety assessments evaluating flow indicators relevant to local ecosystems and livelihoods and considering alternative energy sources and reservoir sedimentation in long term projections finally we strongly recommend that dam impact studies consider hydrological

these multi sectoral and transboundary tradeoffs requires accurate characterizations of observed and projected hydrological changes indeed hydrological changes in the lower mekong floodplain have been

regional hydrological alterations in the basin and their socioeconomic and ecological implications pokhrel et al 2018 lu et al 2008 and li et al 2017a have included reviews of prior studies on dam induced hydrological alteration while fan et al 2015 and yu and geheb 2017 have recently summarized observed hydrological impacts of chinese hydropower dams in the upper mekong basin numerous recent studies grumbine et al 2012 johnston and kummu 2012 pokhrel et al 2018 have also advocated integrated modeling approaches for assessing socioeconomic and ecological impacts of hydrological alteration however given the potential ecological and livelihood impacts of mekong hydropower development a more detailed review of hydrological alteration in different regions of the basin is warranted moreover managing impacts from diversions and inter basin transfers in tributary basins often requires mitigation strategies different from those suited for dams with large reservoirs that attenuate seasonal flow variability thus this paper aims to synthesize and critically review existing knowledge regarding observed and projected hydrological alterations caused by hydropower dams on both the mekong mainstream and tributaries section 2 provides an overview of the basin s geography outlines historical and projected trajectories of dam development highlights some key impacts of hydrological alteration to ecosystems and livelihoods and briefly describes basin management efforts and challenges sections 3 and 4 detail the extent to which observed hydrological impacts and model based

summarizes recent advances in understanding the hydrological impacts of mekong hydropower dams and identifies research gaps that could be addressed to further guide hydropower development in the mekong and other basins worldwide 2 background 2 1 basin overview the mekong is one of the world s most prominent rivers its mean annual discharge of 14 500 m3 s wang et al 2017 and length of 4909 km liu et al 2009 both rank tenth globally while its drainage area 795 000 km2 is the 25th largest mrc 2005 its population was approximately 70 75 million in 2005 ringler and cai 2006 varis et al 2012 and could increase to 100 145 million by 2050 pech and sunada 2008 varis et al 2012 the lower mekong basin lmb fig 1 lies in the southeast asian countries of lao pdr 25 of the basin area thailand 23 cambodia 20 vietnam 8 and myanmar 3 meanwhile the upstream portion of the basin 21 in china is often known as the upper mekong basin umb or lancang basin mrc 2005 the lmb has a monsoonal climate with distinct wet and dry seasons the wet season analyzed in most studies runs from june to november while the dry season often lasts from december to may typically 75 of the river s annual discharge of 460 km3 mrc 2005 passes through the delta between july and october a period with extensive flooding that sustains many ecosystems and livelihoods e g kummu and sarkkula 2008 piman et al 2013a meanwhile 35 of its dry season flow originates from china making impacts of large umb dams especially critical see mrc 2005 adamson et al 2009 and mrc 2018a b for more detailed basin descriptions 2 2 hydropower dam development while hydropower ambitions have existed for over half a century jacobs 2002 most hydropower dams have been constructed in the last decade fig 2 in 2008 the mekong was one of the least regulated large river basins in the world as its total active reservoir storage capacity 8 6 km3 amounted to just 2 of its mean annual discharge kummu et al 2010 data from mrc 2015 suggests that the basin s active reservoir storage in 2025 86 8 km3 is expected to be equal to 19 of its mean annual discharge this estimate falls within the 17 23 range of earlier projections hoanh et al 2010 kummu et al 2010 mrc 2011 note that the mrc databases used in these estimates have not contained numerous existing and planned dams in china which according to the greater mekong dam database gmdd https wle mekong cgiar org maps from wle mekong 2017 will have over 8 7 km3 of combined active and dead storage by 2025 recent dam status updates in the gmdd indicate that 64 of the 187 existing and proposed hydropower dams with an installed capacity of at least 15 mw in the entire mekong basin had been commissioned by june 2017 out of these 64 dams 18 dams in china can generate up to 17 770 mw over 91 of which is installed at the six large lancang cascade dams on the umb mainstream the other 46 lmb tributary dams can produce up to 8650 mw the combined installed capacity of all existing and proposed dams 15 mw in the gmdd database exceeds 65 000 mw while other estimates range from nearly 59 000 mw dore et al 2007 to 88 000 mw stone 2011 these estimates include a controversial cascade of 11 proposed lmb mainstream dams with a total installed capacity of 13 000 mw wle mekong 2017 greater seasonal flow regulation from upstream hydropower reservoirs increases the feasibility of hydropower at downstream locations moreover if increased annual and dry season flows projected under many climate change scenarios e g hoang et al 2016 exceed climate driven increases in reservoir evaporation both total and firm energy production could increase such potential basin wide changes in the hydropower generation capacity of the basin have not been modeled 2 3 ecological implications of hydrological alteration dam induced changes in streamflow affect many aspects of riverine ecosystems including hydraulics depth velocity temperature along with nutrient and sediment transport e g power et al 1995 many studies around the world have shown that flow alteration often impacts riverine species and ecosystems negatively e g poff and zimmerman 2010 ecological impacts of dam induced flow alteration have been debated in the mekong basin including the loss of flood pulses floodplain habitat and wetlands ringler et al 2004 stone 2010a mrc 2017 intralawan et al 2018 as lmb residents depend on fish and other aquatic animals for 47 80 of their required protein intake more than any other major basin in the world hortle 2007 in particular the tonle sap lake fishery enables cambodia to have one of the world s highest freshwater fish catch rates per capita mcintyre et al 2016 spatiotemporal variations in river and floodplain hydrology influence lmb fisheries several components of the flood pulse have been hypothesized to affect fish catches including flood magnitude duration timing and variability sabo et al 2017 welcomme 1979 overall halls et al 2013 observed that larger annual floods tend to yield greater fish catches yet this correlation is likely due to numerous hydrologically driven processes including fish population density and reproduction halls and welcomme 2004 as well as floodplain primary production and habitat chea et al 2016b koponen et al 2010 numerous studies have investigated and reviewed dam impacts on fisheries and diversity in fish species e g baran and myschowoda 2009 kang et al 2009 dugan et al 2010 ziv et al 2012 pukinskis and geheb 2012 zhang et al 2018 the tendency for generalist species to proliferate downstream of dams that regulate seasonal flow e g poff et al 2007 has also been observed in the mekong basin chea et al 2016b the mekong river is also well known for its abundance and diversity of migratory species many of which travel hundreds of kilometers along free flowing reaches to spawn e g hogan et al 2007 some of these species are becoming endangered as the percentage of free flowing reaches in the basin decreases as in other parts of the world e g anderson et al 2018 mekong dams have substantially reduced river network connectivity ziv et al 2012 ou and winemiller 2016 and changed downstream flow variability vital to many fish species baran et al 2011 li et al 2013 these physical changes in addition to changes in sediment and nutrient transport e g chea et al 2016a kondolf et al 2018 and overfishing pressure e g ngor et al 2018a are compromising fish biodiversity and production in the mekong floodplains between 1990 and 2010 river connectivity declined from 93 to 77 and could drop as low as 10 grill et al 2014 losses in connectivity have even caused run of river dams to disrupt fisheries in the mekong basin such as the pak mun dam on the mun river in thailand e g molle et al 2010 while this study focuses on flow alteration further research is needed to untangle the effects of passage barriers and flow alteration on mekong fisheries and ecosystems while many ecological studies focused on flow alteration impacts on specific species e g hogan et al 2007 sabo et al 2017 some studies have assessed a wider range of riverine ecological communities in the umb kang et al 2009 li et al 2013 fan et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 and lmb tributaries ou and winemiller 2016 ngor et al 2018a b although pronounced flow alteration has been associated with severe ecological impacts e g baran et al 2011 the optimality of natural flow for some species i e the natural flow paradigm poff et al 1997 has also been questioned most notably sabo et al 2017 proposed that if hydropower dams were collectively operated to generate year round dry season flows with punctuated flood pulses dai bag net fisheries in the tonle sap river could maintain or even increase historical yields as recently clarified halls and moyle 2018 holtgrieve et al 2018 these designer flows are only one of several mitigation strategies this strategy is only viable as long as there are no major dams impeding fish migration in the mekong floodplains and as long as other environmental conditions critical for their habitat e g sediment delivery primary production and water quality are intact other studies have also suggested that replicating annual flow variability through artificial flood releases may provide ecological benefits li and zhao 2016 hydropower induced changes in ecosystem productivity have also been investigated as arias et al 2014a suggested that the annual average net primary productivity in open water and floodplain areas of tonle sap lake could decrease by 34 4 under climate change and a 126 dam hydropower development scenario overall a more detailed review of ecological impacts from dam development and other concurrent drivers of changes such as castello and macedo s 2015 review on the amazon basin is warranted 2 4 toward river basin management the mekong river commission mrc comprised of thailand lao pdr cambodia and vietnam has facilitated many studies that inform transboundary basin management e g mrc 2005 2011 2018a china and myanmar also participate in many mrc activities as dialogue partners yet relatively few transboundary streamflow regulations have been implemented the mekong agreement mrc 1995 the mrc countries signed articulates guidelines to limit excessive dry season withdrawals but these rules have never been specified tfdd 2018 there are a limited number of binational cooperation efforts such as the vietnam cambodia agreement establishing minimum sesan river flows ngo et al 2018 and the recent fisheries management efforts between lao pdr and cambodia mrc 2018b often dam operators belonging to different companies make decisions without concern for downstream dams and overall basin impact piman et al 2016 schmitt et al 2018 in the lmb dams along tributaries frequently have different owners jeuland et al 2014 whereas hydrolancang owns all major dams on the umb mainstream except dachaoshan yu and geheb 2017 while the mrc has facilitated a transboundary flood forecasting system for the mainstream pagano 2014 the mekong agreement does not explicitly address potential transboundary impacts along tributaries sithirith et al 2016 the lack of tributary flood forecasting and early warning systems exacerbated the consequences that cambodian citizens residing along the sekong river suffered from the failure of an auxiliary saddle dam of the xe pian xe namnoy project under construction in southern lao pdr on july 23 2018 wallace and leng 2018 this breach unleashed a flash flood that has left over 100 people dead or missing in both lao pdr and cambodia business standard 2018 url http www nationmultimedia com detail opinion 30357045 this catastrophe also prompted the government of lao pdr to suspend new dam projects and re evaluate its dam construction standards boyle 2018 widespread concerns about ecosystem and livelihood impacts of seasonal flow regulation have largely not been considered in major transboundary water resources agreements among mekong countries tfdd 2018 while extreme floods threaten human safety infrastructure and crops the typical wet season flood pulse benefits fisheries and floodplain agriculture tremendously the average annual economic benefits of floods in lmb countries us 8 10 billion are more than hundred times greater than their average annual damages us 60 70 million mrc 2010 in contrast wet season droughts often not considered as a hazard in tropical monsoon regions adamson and bird 2010 can impact agricultural and fisheries production substantially hydropower dams that regulate seasonal flow substantially may reduce the ecological and agricultural benefits of the annual flood pulse especially during drier years e g piman et al 2013a hydropower dams may improve dry season navigation downstream of dams but they may also impede passage further upstream and irregular releases can be hazardous for small boats these navigation tradeoffs have not been systematically examined while hydropower development is not centrally coordinated numerous basin wide dam development scenarios have been devised kummu et al 2010 mrc 2011 lauri et al 2012 mrc 2018a b some scenarios such as the prominent ones in mrc 2011 consider ongoing changes in other sectors such as water demand agricultural industrial and domestic along with climate change this allows for direct comparisons between different impacts recently the mrc s council study mrc 2018a b created a preliminary new scenario set however since this study was still under review at the time of submission we comment on its broader scope but not its findings prior dam development scenarios have not considered possible increases in hydropower potential from increased future precipitation rapidly lowering solar energy costs intralawan et al 2018 liu et al 2018 growing concerns about high ghg emissions from some reservoirs räsänen et al 2018 or possible overcapacity problems world bank

hydrological impacts this section surveys the extent of studies that have assessed the actual hydrological impact of hydropower dams using observed flow records and comparing pre and post dam periods in the mekong basin including the conclusions inferable from these studies given short record lengths and other confounding factors we partition this section into reviews of impacts observed in the umb and lmb umb impacts encompass the effects that a cascade of dams within china has on mekong mainstream flows in both the umb and lmb meanwhile the review of flow alteration from lmb dams covers the observed hydrological effects of tributary dams on tributaries the lmb mainstream and lower mekong floodplains see section 4 3 for the projected effects of the lmb mainstream dams under construction 3 1 impacts of upper mekong dams on mainstream flow hydrological effects of umb dams have been scrutinized ever since manwan dam active storage capacity of 0 26 km3 was completed in 1993 e g chapman and he 1996 lu and siew 2006 while some media reports have attributed lmb droughts to umb dams campbell 2007 stone 2010b most studies suggest that the smaller umb mainstream dams combined active storage capacity of 0 72 km3 built before xiaowan and nuozhadu combined active storage capacity of 32 1 km3 have either only minimally altered flow in the mekong mainstream campbell 2007 or increased dry season flows zhao et al 2012 cochrane et al 2014 detected statistically significant increases in late dry season flow feb may monthly flows between 1961 and 1990 and 1991 2010 fig 3 although this study did not control for possible confounding factors such as changes in precipitation and land use irregular releases from manwan and dachaoshan dams have also been associated with more variable daily and monthly flows during the dry season at chiang saen li and he 2008 lu et al 2014 cochrane et al 2014 dry season flow alteration associated with their construction has also been detected as far downstream as vientiane he et al 2006 meanwhile the xiaowan and nuozhadu dams commissioned in 2010 and 2014 respectively and filled in 2008 and 2011 respectively are altering streamflow seasonality in the mekong mainstream much more than earlier umb dams did cochrane et al 2014 li et al 2017a räsänen 2017 ji et al 2018 dry season flows have increased dramatically as far downstream as kratie cambodia li et al 2017a including low flows in march may 2014 that were 41 74 above pre dam averages and 41 68 larger than simulated unregulated discharges räsänen 2017 these increases fell within the range of earlier projections hoanh et al 2010 lauri et al 2012 räsänen et al 2012 the refilling of reservoirs during the beginning of the wet season may have delayed the date of the maximum daily flow by 22 days at both chiang saen and stung treng in 2010 2014 relative to their 1960 1991 averages li et al 2017a however this short post xiaowan record limits the statistical strength of this conclusion as does the filling of nuozhadu 2011 during this post impact period post xiaowan daily flow fluctuations are also greater cochrane et al 2014 li et al 2017a mohammed et al 2018b li et al 2017a also associated a dramatic decrease in the duration of low flow pulses below the 25th daily flow percentile which are critical for lmb fisheries sabo et al 2017 with irregular releases from xiaowan dam yet while low flow pulses have shortened irregular releases have also made extreme low flows even lower lu et al 2014 some measures have been made to mitigate negative consequences of downstream impacts within china see fan et al 2015 yu and geheb 2017 and strategies for reducing impacts to flows entering the lmb mainstream and evaluate hydropower ecological tradeoffs li et al 2018 have also been explored however the small ganlanba re regulation dam 0 12 km3 c f kummu et al 2010 is primarily being constructed to attenuate short term hydropeaking fluctuations as restoring seasonal flow variability requires far more storage 3 2 impacts of lower mekong basin dams on mainstream and tributaries relatively few streamflow stations downstream of tributary dams have pre and post dam flow records exceeding ten years lacombe et al 2014a lyon et al 2017 which limits assessments of tributary flow alteration while numerous studies emphasize that dams attenuate flow seasonality e g adamson 2001 pokhrel et al 2018 observed flow records indicate diverse hydrological impacts that depend in part on the on stream vs off stream location of hydropower turbines to increase the hydraulic head for power generation numerous tributary dams impound water for diversions to powerhouses at much lower elevations either further downstream along the same river or into adjacent tributary basins only two pumped storage projects could be found in the mekong basin both of which are located in thailand kraitud 2017 as expected tributary dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs have attenuated seasonal flow variability in lao pdr lacombe et al 2014a examined daily flow records available since 1962 from several stations along the nam ngum river downstream of a cascade of hydropower dams the oldest of which nam ngum 1 was constructed in 1971 without the dams current irrigation needs would compete with environmental flow requirements during drier than normal years in contrast wet season flows decreased by about 17 after nam ngum 1 dam was commissioned in other tributary basins where extensive flow alteration has been projected such as the 3s basin initial dams have only caused minor impacts because they are largely run of river projects piman et al 2013a tributary studies have not examined flow alteration over interannual timescales despite numerous dams with storage capacities exceeding their annual inflow volume bonnema and hossain 2017 and the interannual persistence of hydroclimatic conditions in the region frappart et al 2018 mohammed et al 2018b meanwhile diversions have been associated with reduced flows downstream of dams as well as flow augmentation in recipient basins e g baird et al 2015 chanudet et al 2016 changes in the nam theun nam kading basin in lao pdr fig 4 showcase diverse forms of hydropower induced flow alteration the nam theun 2 nt2 dam completed in 2010 see fig 4 enables diversions from the nam theun river into the xe bang fai river a separate mekong tributary e g stone 2010a average diversions entering the xe bang fai 220 m3 s are nearly equal to the river s natural mean annual flow 266 m3 s at mahaxai from 1989 to 2002 descloux et al 2016 this flow alteration affects the livelihoods of over 110 000 people international rivers 2018 due to these diversions downstream releases from nt2 are just 2 m3 s less than 1 of its mean annual inflow of 238 m3 s except during spills chanudet et al 2016 since nt2 heavily depletes flow in the nam theun river releases from a hydropower reservoir on the nam gnouang river ng a nam theun tributary boost dry season hydropower production at the theun hinboun project thxp further downstream reis et al 2015 this project can divert up to 220 m3 s through a tunnel to a powerhouse that discharges into the adjacent nam hinboun basin in contrast only 5 m3 s must be released directly downstream reis et al 2015 which has raised water temperatures and depleted dissolved oxygen warren 1999 while post nt2 streamflow changes are being monitored in the nam theun and xe bang fai basins descloux et al 2016 rigorous assessments of hydrological alteration have not been published while diversions from mekong tributaries have not been comprehensively catalogued other major tributary projects also have them including houay ho lao pdr and yali falls vietnam diversions to raise water levels in nam ngun 1 reservoir have drastically reduced dry season flows in the nam song river neua 2007 pronounced fluctuations in flow downstream of diversions and in recipient basins stemming from irregular electricity demands have been reported e g chanudet et al 2016 but have not been quantified extensive diversions for irrigation in the mun chi basin in northeastern thailand may explain the concurrence of the increasing precipitation and decreasing flow trends that ruiz barradas and nigam 2018 detected at pakse lao pdr during the wet season although more research is needed as kibler and tullos 2013 who assessed recent hydropower diversions in southeast asia s nu river basin emphasized these diversions can make reservoir storage capacity an inappropriate proxy for a dam s hydrological impact next many dam operators have employed profit driven hydropeaking strategies to meet energy demands that fluctuate substantially over daily lower nighttime demands and weekly lower weekend demands timescales e g wyatt and baird 2007 reis et al 2015 trung et al 2018 consequently increased flow fluctuations have been observed downstream of lmb tributary dams cochrane et al 2014 even associated increased daily fluctuations in the mekong mainstream with hydropeaking in thailand s chi mun tributary basin inadequate warnings about abrupt flow changes have compromised navigation and even led to drowning deaths lerner 2003 neua 2007 soutthisombat et al 2011 a few designated re regulation dams such as the small sesan 4a dam meynell et al 2014 and ones downstream of the theun hinboun and nt2 projects aim to curtail flow alteration however these dams primarily modulate short term fluctuations and cannot restore seasonal flow variability or attenuate flood hazards from inter basin transfers significantly only modeling studies have addressed the extent to which downstream dams in cascades can also function as re regulation dams jeuland et al 2014 piman et al 2016 they show that cascade optimal operations can mildly reduce flow alteration jeuland et al 2014 but more studies are needed since impacts can vary considerably among reservoirs piman et al 2016 in addition flow alteration during dam construction and reservoir filling has also impacted human safety livelihoods and ecosystems in lmb tributaries including the recent xe pian xe namnoy auxiliary dam failure in southern lao pdr which has left over 100 people dead or missing in lao pdr and cambodia see section 2 4 in vietnam the failure of a temporary diversion dam caused a large flood when the yali falls dam was constructed wyatt and baird 2007 moreover irregular flow releases following its construction killed 39 people lerner 2003 aquatic life in the nam lik river in lao pdr was deeply disturbed when dam construction completely halted downstream flow in 2010 baran et al 2011 despite these myriad impacts few studies have examined reservoir filling rates and other flow alterations before dams are commissioned see sections 4 1 and 4 2 for reviews of dam safety studies 3 3 gaps in observational studies short tributary streamflow records especially ones preceding dam construction also make distinguishing dam induced impacts from natural hydroclimatic variability and other ongoing environmental changes more difficult while a comprehensive list of stations suitable for assessing dam induced flow alteration is unavailable ketelsen et al 2014 offer a partial list of stations used to estimate 100 year floods at dam sites and lacombe et al 2014b and lyon et al 2017 have identified subsets of unregulated tributary stations for analyses of pre dam conditions procedures for extending short records filling intermittent records inomata and fukami 2008 or computing regional estimates of time series or flow statistics at ungauged locations using longer records in hydrologically similar regions could help estimate pre dam flows at dam impacted sites lacombe et al 2014b ketelsen et al 2014 sub daily streamflow and water level observations would also improve assessments of hydropeaking impacts remotely sensed data are being increasingly used to overcome in situ data limitations e g liu et al 2016 ji et al 2018 wang et al 2016 recent satellite altimetry efforts have estimated daily water levels in the mainstream with sub meter accuracy pham et al 2018 observations of changing water body surface areas and their relationship with remotely sensed terrain and water surface elevations have been used to deduce reservoir operation patterns bonnema and hossain 2017 and changes in tonle sap lake storage frappart et al 2018 however limitations for using satellite based observations remain for instance correction factors have often been necessary for incorporating satellite based precipitation estimates into process based hydrological models liu et al 2017 mohammed et al 2018a to address the decision making consequences of record length limitations some studies have applied hypothesis testing to indicate the likelihood that pre and post dam differences do not arise from sampling variability cochrane et al 2014 li et al 2017a although this uncertainty has not been integrated into formal decision making frameworks see hecht 2017 however hypothesis testing cannot eliminate the possibility that other confounding factors explain differences between two periods in contrast the effects of different dam configurations can be compared directly through simulation models in which the meteorological forcings and upstream watershed conditions are identical e g lauri et al 2012 yet these comparisons often rely upon simplified reservoir operation rules to evaluate implications of operating rule assumptions räsänen 2017 simulated the hydrology of the basin without umb reservoirs and then applied a bias correction procedure to remove systematic model error from these simulations before comparing them to observed discharges their observations of flow alteration suggest reservoir operating rules could vary substantially from year to year highlighting the importance of actual operating rules for modeling studies while mrc 2011 and mrc 2018a scenarios have been configured to isolate dam impacts from other concurrent changes they have yet to be used to make direct comparisons with observed flow alteration we also examined the availability of hydrometeorological observations for simulating reservoir water balances although evaporation from many tributary reservoirs may substantially affect firm energy production and exacerbate consequences of uncoordinated reservoir operations jeuland et al 2014 estimates of open water evaporation are limited kummu et al 2013 coefficients relating pan and lake evaporation are not widely available open water evaporation estimates using only monthly temperature solar radiation and sunshine data morton 1983 which have been comparable to estimates obtained using more data intensive methods in tropical locations dos reis and dias 1998 vallet coulumb et al 2001 could offer an initial approach for reservoirs with negligible seepage losses finally effects of reservoir sedimentation on downstream releases have not been assessed in detail ultimately assessments of hydrological change geared toward improving tradeoffs associated with dam development must evaluate flow indicators relevant for ecosystems and livelihoods li et al 2017a and li et al 2018 have examined changes in the magnitude and timing of mainstream flow with the popular indicators of hydrologic alteration iha which aim to capture ecologically relevant dimensions of flow alteration richter et al 1996 yet applications of generalized frameworks for characterizing site specific or transferable flow ecology relationships such as the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration poff et al 2010 remain scant in the mekong basin while standard flow alteration metrics enable comparisons with other locations indicators tailored to mekong livelihoods e g sabo et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 such as dry season days when riverbank gardens are exposed or conversely when small boat navigation is possible could enrich tradeoff analyses 4 projected hydrological impacts this section focuses on studies of projected hydropower impacts simulated using hydrological models without considering concurrent drivers of hydrological change 4 1 basin wide studies basin wide modeling studies have concurred that increased reservoir storage would reduce wet season flows and increase dry season flows e g hoanh et al 2010 lauri et al 2012 piman et al 2013a b fig 5 using hydrological conditions from 1985 to 2000 hoanh et al 2010 investigated impacts of 6 umb and 81 lmb dams including 11 mainstream dams with a cumulative active storage capacity equal to 16 of the basin s annual flow at kratie cambodia together these prospective dams and other forms of water resources development through 2030 would reduce wet season flows by 8 17 and increase dry season flows by 30 60 relative to a baseline scenario with just 18 lmb tributary dams in a related study piman et al 2013a found that six umb dams and 82 lmb tributary dams including 11 mainstream dams would increase dry season flows at kratie by 28 whereas wet season flows would drop by 9 under a long range development scenario through 2060 featuring 136 lmb and 6 umb dams wet season flows would decline by an additional 4 13 from baseline whereas dry season flows would increase by just 1 primarily because irrigation withdrawals would offset reservoir induced increases in contrast lauri et al 2012 simulated greater dry season increases 25 160 and wet season decreases 5 24 at kratie since they examined seasonal flow changes strictly from a 126 dam cumulative development scenario using discharge from 1982 to 1992 impacts of basin wide hydropower development on flooding have also been assessed using representative dry 1998 average 1997 and wet 2000 years piman et al 2013a also predicted that six umb mainstream dams and 71 lmb tributary dams would decrease the river s annually flooded area by 5 0 in a dry year 6 6 in an average year but only by 0 4 during a wet year the extent to which this low wet year reduction is driven by reservoir design constraints storage and spillway capacity or operating rules merits future research especially considering projected increases in future floods see section 5 1 numerous studies have projected impacts of basin wide hydropower development on the lower mekong floodplain which begins downstream of kratie in central cambodia these floodplains have a unique hydrology as tonle sap lake in cambodia effectively serves as a natural flood control reservoir for the mekong river see uk et al 2018 for a recent review in a typical year the lake s surface area expands from a dry season minimum of 2400 km2 to a wet season maximum of 13 200 km2 kummu and sarkkula 2008 the hydraulic gradient between the mekong river and tonle sap lake determines the flow direction between the two bodies of water as mekong flow enters the lake via the tonle sap river during the wet season while the lake drains to the mekong delta during the dry season since 54 of its annual surface water inflow originates from the mekong mainstream on average kummu et al 2013 uk et al 2018 the lake ecosystem and its extremely productive fishery are sensitive to hydrological changes from upstream dam development e g lamberts 2008 arias et al 2014a upstream hydropower development is expected to attenuate inter seasonal variations in lake area and exacerbate impacts to aquatic and amphibious species during years with unusually dry monsoons piman et al 2013a arias et al 2014c as one travels downstream the mekong mainstream into vietnam it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish hydropower induced hydrological alteration from numerous local drivers of change including sea level rise flood control and navigation infrastructure irrigation and land subsidence exacerbated by groundwater pumping e g le et al 2007 hoa et al 2008 västilä et al 2010 dang et al 2016 dang et al 2018 found local water infrastructure development controlled wet season levels in the upper vietnamese delta while sea level rise and land subsidence increasingly influenced them near the coast upstream dam impacts are expected to be greater during dry years piman et al 2013a dang et al 2018 emergency releases from umb dams to alleviate the lmb drought in 2016 mrc and mwrc 2016 corroborated previous predictions that dry season releases from umb hydropower dams could alleviate salinity and acidic groundwater constraints to dry season agriculture in the delta e g hoa et al 2008 hoanh et al 2010 piman et al 2013a smajgl et al 2015 however piman et al 2013a projected that by 2030 sea level rise will offset agricultural gains from dry season releases made under normal hydropower operations moreover a drastic reduction in the delta s sediment supply due to trapping in upstream reservoirs e g kummu et al 2010 kondolf et al 2018 and to a lesser extent reduced cyclonic activity darby et al 2016 are expected to accelerate land subsidence and aggravate coastal flooding 4 2 upper mekong dams impacts to mainstream flow potential hydrological changes from umb dams have attracted considerable attention partly due to their transboundary implications e g chapman and he 1996 adamson 2001 mrc 2011 lauri et al 2012 räsänen et al 2012 wang et al 2017 mohammed et al 2018b studies concur that umb dams would attenuate seasonal flow variability in the lmb mainstream for instance räsänen et al 2012 projected that six umb dams would increase dry season flow by 90 and decrease wet season flow by 22 at chiang saen recent observations of dam altered flows have corroborated these projections cochrane et al 2014 li et al 2017a räsänen et al 2017 although longer post dam records are needed for stronger statistical conclusions overall umb flow regulation has been expected to diminish further downstream because lmb tributaries have more annual rainfall and less reservoir storage some studies have also predicted that the flood season will commence later due to seasonal reservoir filling e g adamson 2001 which recent observations have corroborated räsänen et al 2017 li et al 2017a wang et al 2017 also estimated that umb reservoirs could reduce the frequency of floods exceeding 0 5 year recurrence intervals by 72 at chiang saen but only by 6 0 at stung treng cambodia reductions in annual maximum floods were lower 29 5 at chiang saen and 2 6 at stung treng possibly due to current reservoir storage limitations while quantifying design floods whose return periods far exceed record lengths is challenging liang et al 2017 estimated that the lancang cascade dams could withstand a 5000 year flood but that manwan and jinghong dams would be overtopped during a 10 000 year event assuming hydrological stationarity 4 3 lower mekong basin dam impacts on mainstream and tributaries numerous studies have evaluated the potential hydrological effects of the 11 lmb mainstream dams icem 2010 mrc 2011 vnmre 2015 trung et al 2018 although their reservoirs are expected to convert many reaches from lotic to lentic lacustrine habitat seasonal flow alteration from them is expected to be minimal since they store no more than a few days of their mean annual inflow however alteration at sub daily to daily timescales from hydropeaking is expected to be substantial for instance trung et al 2018 projected that dry season flows at kratie 31 km below the dam furthest downstream in the cascade might fluctuate by 16 000 m3 s and water levels might oscillate by 2 m in addition dam induced channel incision is expected to deepen the channel which in turn could expedite the propagation of flood waves to the delta by a few days while much of the debate surrounding the basin s hydropower dam development has focused on mainstream impacts substantial flow alteration has been projected in many tributaries one focal point of tributary studies has been the sekong sesan and srepok 3s rivers wyatt and baird 2007 piman et al 2013a arias et al 2014b wild and loucks 2014 räsänen et al 2014 piman et al 2016 ngo et al 2018 the source of 16 23 of the mekong s annual flow adamson et al 2009 piman et al 2013b trang et al 2017 piman et al 2013b found that dry season flows in this tri national watershed lao pdr cambodia vietnam could increase by 63 and wet season flows may decline by 22 when considering 23 proposed hydropower projects aiming to maximize their own hydropower production moreover under a full development scenario consisting of 41 projects piman et al 2013b projected a dry season increase of 95 and a wet season decrease of 25 piman et al 2016 also found impacts on annual daily flow extremes to be even greater as annual daily maxima and minima could be reduced and increased by 36 and 168 respectively in addition they showed that existing and near term projects in the 3s basin many of which are run of river dams offered a much greater energy return per unit of reservoir storage than larger long term projects however this study did not examine potential impacts of smaller dams to fish passage including in the sekong river one of the mekong s last free flowing tributaries other 3s basin studies have examined impacts to just the sesan river räsänen et al 2014 found that assumed hydropower maximizing rules at the 11 largest hydropower dams would increase dry season flows by 53 and reduce wet season flows by 11 however when dam operations in the vietnamese portion of the sesan river basin were simulated using government issued operating rules dry season flows increased by just 30 whereas wet season flows dropped by 15 ngo et al 2018 when minimum flow requirements at the cambodian border downstream of the dams were also considered dry season flows rose by 40 this also suggests that minimum flow requirements account for productive uses as well as the environmental demand while other modeling differences between these two studies prevent a direct comparison these findings motivate further efforts to include actual operating rules in reservoir simulations flow alteration in the 3s basin could also propagate downstream into the mekong mainstream and lower mekong floodplain arias et al 2014b estimated that 42 new 3s basin dams could increase tonle sap lake s annual minimum level by 25 35 cm which could inhibit tree germination and fish migration piman et al 2013a showed that reductions in the annual maximum water level are less certain and that the timing of the tonle sap river flow reversal may vary by a few weeks in either direction compared to the pre development date 6 8 days earlier in a typical year the earlier reversal during a typical year stems from higher mainstream water levels at the end of the dry season hydropower and irrigation reservoirs within the lake s catchment might further attenuate seasonal lake level extremes upon which many ecosystems and livelihoods depend potential dam impacts have also been simulated in other tributary basins including those under innovative single and multi reservoir operating rules reis et al 2015 showed that maintaining low reservoir levels in the nam gnouang reservoir see fig 4 would facilitate recession agriculture while reducing average annual hydropower by only 8 1 although it substantially increases hourly peak demand shortfalls between april and june sioudom 2013 simulated increases in flooding in the nam hinboun basin caused by diversions from the nam theun river in the nam ngum basin jeuland et al 2014 demonstrated that multi reservoir coordination could increase basin wide benefits from hydropower and irrigation by 3 12 relatively few basin wide modeling studies have assessed sub daily flow alteration from hydropeaking in lmb tributaries see reis et al 2015 the recent catastrophic failure of an auxiliary dam of the xe pian xe namnoy project in lao pdr illuminates the need for more dam safety assessments in the lmb ketelsen et al 2014 found that 40 of 67 lmb dams have design peak inflows lower than their 100 year floods and 11 do not even have spillways that can convey this discharge follow up studies are needed including ones that compare design floods estimated with different distributional assumptions while the safety of individual dams has been assessed e g tingsanchali and tammanee 2012 the hazards of large floods on lmb tributary cascades have not been investigated more importantly as micovic et al 2016 point out dam failure risk assessments must not only consider design inflows but also antecedent reservoir storage emergency operating rules debris blockage gate failures seismic hazards among other factors in addition few studies have examined the possible magnification of floods due to emergency releases made to avoid dam failures vattenfall power consultant ab 2008 4 4 gaps in studies of projected impacts hydrological impacts are frequently simulated within different areas of the mekong basin but basin wide projections especially ones considering other ongoing water resources developments are less frequent ostensibly due to the large modeling effort required in contrast many tributary projections do not employ sets of scenarios that isolate effects of different drivers of change more model comparison studies are also needed as our review of 3s basin projections demonstrates differences in reservoir operating rules input data study area definitions and other assumptions can inhibit these comparisons as post dam hydrological records become longer more difference in differences studies that compare simulated hydrological changes with observed ones should be carried out currently many modeling studies focus on dam impacts often without considering alternative operating rules or design choices including re regulation dams moreover many assumptions such as hydropower maximization are made when operating rules are unavailable more efforts to optimize the design and operation of individual dams cascades see bogardi and duckstein 1992 schmitt et al 2018 or dam implementation sequences in basins ziv et al 2012 grill et al 2014 jager et al 2015 could reveal mitigation opportunities flood hazards due to dam failure emergency spills multi reservoir operation reservoir induced backwater effects rubin et al 2015 and geomorphic changes also merit further research while comparing the performance of individual models lies beyond the scope of this review see kite 2001 and johnston and kummu 2012 for earlier modeling reviews our review revealed opportunities to improve some contemporary modeling practices first while summary metrics such as nash sutcliffe efficiency often facilitate quick model comparisons we strongly encourage performance indicators relevant for ecosystems and livelihoods for decision making applications also see krause et al 2005 for a cautionary note about nse second uncertainty analysis is especially critical given that short and sparse hydroclimatic records can constrain the calibration and validation of hydrological models while many recent studies are beginning to examine the effects of parameter uncertainty on streamflow simulations e g shrestha et al 2013 khoi and thom 2015 phomsouvanh et al 2016 one issue that has received less attention is the frequent attenuation of hydrological extremes in continuous simulation models e g rossi et al 2009 wang et al 2017 mohammed et al 2018b while numerous factors can contribute to this tendency including a paucity of high elevation meteorological stations rossi et al 2009 simulated streamflow time series have frequently omitted calibration residuals while the site specific consequences of this practice depend on the correlation between calibration residuals and discharge observations a large sample study outside the mekong basin farmer and vogel 2016 finds that re introducing calibration residuals into simulated time series can alleviate the attenuation of discharge variance in simulation models considering calibration residuals could be especially critical given the impacts that hydrological extremes have on livelihoods ecosystems and human safety in the basin 5 effects of concurrent environmental changes many ongoing changes in climate water use and land cover are occurring as new dams are being constructed e g hoanh et al 2010 piman et al 2013a b hoang et al 2018 mrc 2018a b building on the recent review by pokhrel et al 2018 we evaluate the extent to which these concurrent drivers of change could exacerbate or offset hydrological changes stemming from hydropower production in addition we briefly review the hydrological impacts of dam induced changes to sediment transport 5 1 climate change numerous studies e g kingston et al 2011 cook et al 2012 lauri et al 2012 thompson et al 2013 fan and he 2015 hoang et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016a wang et al 2017 have evaluated possible hydrological effects of future changes in precipitation and temperature hydrological models run with recent climate model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 projections have suggested that streamflow will increase during both the wet 8 out of 10 scenarios and dry seasons all 10 scenarios at the basin scale with the uncertainty stemming primarily from precipitation projections hoang et al 2016 in the lmb these increases in precipitation are consistent with observations from the last half century lacombe et al 2013 however these projected changes are not ubiquitous as annual flows may decrease in some tributary basins e g shrestha et al 2016b ngo et al 2018 global climate models gcms also consistently predict increases in extreme floods hirabayashi et al 2013 hoang et al 2016 perera et al 2017 while projected changes in mean annual floods are less consistent e g wang et al 2017 and observations at some mainstream stations indicate a decreasing trend delgado et al 2010 gcm projections of future droughts are also uncertain as kiem et al 2008 projected reduced streamflow drought severity due to greater precipitation whereas thilakaranthne and sridhar 2017 forecasted that greater interannual variability would worsen droughts gcms have been essential for projecting combined impacts of hydropower and climate change wang et al 2017 noted that umb reservoir storage could alleviate increased flooding along the upper lmb mainstream down to nong khai thailand where they predict flood control benefits of reservoir storage will outweigh climate driven increases in flood magnitude through 2070 however they expect increased precipitation to immediately outweigh the flood control benefits of reservoir storage further downstream a finding that hoang et al 2018 echo hoanh et al 2010 also stressed that reservoirs cannot mitigate projected climate induced flood increases as they would reduce the lmb s seasonally flooded area by less than 1 lauri et al 2012 reported that climate change could either exacerbate or offset 10 reductions in wet season flow from hydropower at kratie from 2032 to 2042 21 to 4 while many gcms predict increased dry season flows e g hoang et al 2016 even projected decreases in them are unlikely to fully offset much larger hydropower induced increases e g hoang et al 2018 other studies examining joint hydropower climate change impacts have focused on specific tributary basins in the 3s basin ngo et al 2018 predicted that climate change would partially offset increases in dry season flows from jan may offset decreases from jun jul while changes from aug dec vary by sub basin using ten gcm runs from lauri et al 2012 arias et al 2014a estimated that hydropower development may worsen climate change induced habitat losses in tonle sap lake as expanded areas of open water 32 38 along with irrigated and rain fed rice 11 21 may drastically reduce riparian forests 13 67 and other seasonally flooded habitat in other tributary basins such as the nam ou in northern lao pdr uncertain directions of change in precipitation 27 to 41 and annual streamflow 27 to 160 shrestha et al 2013 confound efforts to mitigate hydropower impacts few studies have examined whether climate induced increases in streamflow could offset flow depletion downstream of diversions or exacerbate flooding in surcharged basins phomsouvanh et al 2016 5 2 water demand historically the mekong has been one of the least irrigated basins in monsoonal asia barker and molle 2004 ringler et al 2004 haddeland et al 2006 yet higher dry season flows from hydropower can enable greater dry season irrigation withdrawals in turn these larger withdrawals are expected to offset elevated dry season flows increasingly since the largest dams have already been commissioned mrc 2011 lacombe et al 2014 documented the complementarity of hydropower and irrigation in the nam ngum tributary basin in lao pdr which differs from some other basins in the world where they directly compete with one another zeng and cai 2017 lmb irrigation may expand from 6 6 million ha in 2010 to 8 2 9 7 million ha in 2030 hoanh et al 2010 mrc 2011 including a dry season increase from 1 2 to 1 8 million ha mrc 2011 together these estimates suggest a wet season increase of 1 0 2 5 million ha note that irrigated areas are difficult to estimate partly due to the diverse forms of irrigation in the basin ringler et al 2004 pokhrel et al 2018 mrc 2018a is also developing new projections of irrigation withdrawals based on national development plans global food demand and climate change some studies project that most irrigation expansion will take place in lao pdr and cambodia where more land is available and both reservoir storage and export driven production are growing rapidly icem 2010 erban and gorelick 2016 trung et al 2018 however elevated dry season flows in the mainstream could also be diverted to northeastern thailand where irrigation infrastructure already exists molle and floch 2008 numerous long term hydropower impact studies that also consider future changes in irrigation hoanh et al 2010 mrc 2011 hoang et al 2018 estimate that dry season flow increases are smaller than the ones that only consider hydropower development e g lauri et al 2012 while tools for assessing possible irrigation withdrawals downstream of hydropower dams under different climate change scenarios have been developed e g hoang et al 2018 they do not consider reservoir operations made for irrigation purposes including reservoirs primarily dedicated to irrigation in northeastern thailand few studies have examined decreases in irrigation opportunities downstream of diversions higher dry season flows in recipient basins have motivated irrigation projects with varying success baird et al 2015 next the extent to which wet season irrigation could exacerbate dam induced reductions in wet season flow has not received as much attention even though more than 80 of all irrigated land was for wet season use in 2010 mrc 2011 warmer temperatures could further increase this demand hoanh et al 2010 mainuddin et al 2012 shrestha 2017 which could exacerbate the wet season droughts that compromise many livelihoods dependent on fisheries and floodplain agriculture hoang et al 2018 simulated evapotranspiration from hydropower enabled rice irrigation under different climate scenarios but did not report the resulting increases in irrigation demand while domestic and industrial sectors consume much less water than agriculture a doubling of the water demand by 2030 could worsen dry season droughts e g johnston et al 2010 making flow regulation from hydropower more valuable for water supply while hydropower development can provide extensive irrigation co benefits during the dry season lacombe et al 2014a rising water levels upstream of new mainstream dams and channel migration below them may require as many as half of all existing and planned pumping stations to be relocated resized and retrofitted to deal with greater daily flow fluctuations icem 2010 in contrast pokhrel et al 2018 suggest that higher dry season flows may elevate groundwater levels thereby reducing pumping costs many riverbank gardens may become permanently inundated including 54 on the mekong mainstream icem 2010 higher dry season flows may also force farmers to grow new varieties of rice fox and wood 2007 increased in irrigation withdrawals necessary for producing food to replace declining river capture fisheries see orr et al 2012 have not been assessed 5 3 land cover change numerous basin wide studies e g kite 2001 kiem et al 2008 costa cabral et al 2008 mrc 2018a b as well as ones in smaller tributary watersheds e g lacombe et al 2010 ty 2011 lacombe and pierret 2013 lacombe et al 2014b 2016 lyon et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 offer some insight regarding the extent to which changes in land cover may offset or exacerbate hydropower induced flow alteration these impacts depend on many site specific factors for instance converting a low density forest to intensive agriculture may reduce high flows shrestha et al 2017 which could exacerbate the reduction in wet season flows from hydropower however deforestation has often been associated with increased runoff due to the lower evapotranspiration of newly developed land cover e g lacombe et al 2010 lacombe and pierret 2013 lacombe et al 2016 observed that afforestation from planting or from natural regeneration had opposing effects on annual streamflow since planting especially for commercial timber tends to reduce soil infiltration capacity whereas natural regeneration increases it these site specific nuances are important to consider when examining the cumulative effects of hydropower development and land use changes on river flow variability finally it should be noted that in some cases land use policies and soil management initiatives aim to improve long term hydropower production by reducing reservoir sedimentation see arias et al 2011 and shrestha et al 2017 for mekong basin examples hydrological effects of changes in land cover stemming from economic development catalyzed by new dams such as road construction and mining also merit consideration e g shrestha et al 2016b hennig et al 2016 hoang and tran 2017 pokhrel et al 2018 orr et al 2012 estimated that livestock production areas would need to expand by 19 63 to compensate for a 40 loss in fish protein without considering livestock intensification or the expansion of aquaculture or reservoir and rice paddy fisheries however they did not spatially model this land conversion which inhibits the effects of greater livestock production from being assessed with a distributed hydrological model while possible increases in river withdrawals for rice irrigation in response to greater dry season flows have been examined see section 5 2 the effects of new rice paddies on surface runoff e g costa cabral et al 2008 homdee et al 2011 lacombe et al 2014b have not been reported in hydropower impact studies 5 4 sediment impacts dam induced flow alteration is not expected to be constant over time due to changes in sediment transport that will affect reservoir and downstream river channel capacities projected rates of reservoir sedimentation vary widely wild and loucks 2014 predicted that only 5 out of 41 3s basin reservoirs would lose more than 20 of their active storage over the next century due to their large dead storage volumes in contrast manwan dam s reservoir located in the erosion prone umb had already lost 16 7 of its active storage capacity 0 26 km3 and 75 9 of its dead storage capacity 0 66 km3 between 1993 and 2009 before xiaowan dam and erosion control projects were constructed upstream fan et al 2015 basin wide changes in sediment loads have also been examined including both the entrapment of sediment in reservoirs kummu et al 2010 wild and loucks 2014 as well as the effects of downstream sediment starvation e g kondolf et al 2014 kondolf et al 2018 li et al 2017b suggested that upstream dams have been a major driver of the net erosion the delta has experienced since 2005 mrc monitoring data indicate a dramatic reduction in suspended sediment loads following the construction of xiaowan dam when the average suspended loads at the chiang saen station in northern thailand decreased from 60 to 10 million tonnes per year mt yr an 83 reduction at pakse in lao pdr from 120 to 60 mt yr a 50 reduction and at kratie cambodia from 160 to 90 mt yr a 43 reduction piman and shrestha 2017 these observed decreases are consistent with prior modeling results kummu et al 2010 kondolf et al 2014 if all planned mekong basin dams are built the sediment load entering the delta may decrease from 51 69 kummu et al 2010 to 96 kondolf et al 2014 see wild et al 2015 for options for routing sediment through reservoirs overall more information about the interannual variability of sediment loads trapping in multi reservoir cascades e g kummu et al 2010 wild and loucks 2014 deposition in active storage zones reservoir sediment compaction and changes in upstream erosion e g shrestha et al 2013 is needed the effects of changes in channel and floodplain storage capacity downstream of dams kondolf et al 2014 rubin et al 2015 on channel floodplain connectivity kondolf et al 2018 and on flood propagation trung et al 2018 are starting to be assessed particularly along vulnerable alluvial and deltaic river reaches studies that examine both hydrological and geomorphic drivers of changing flood hazards are essential for assessing changes in floodplain water levels see slater et al 2015 for an example outside of the mekong basin 6 concluding remarks understanding hydropower induced changes to the hydrology of the mekong basin is essential for anticipating and mitigating their negative impacts although many studies have analyzed hydrological impacts of mekong hydropower dams observed and projected changes to both mainstream and tributaries flows have not been reviewed in detail while most dams with integral powerhouses are expected to regulate seasonal flow variability diversions for off stream power generation can drastically decrease downstream flows and augment flows in adjacent basins a change which prior reviews have not captured although lmb mainstream dams are often considered run of river operations they are expected to modify diurnal flow variability substantially and their effects on flood propagation are underexplored importantly these studies collectively indicate that other dam design metrics including release and diversion capacity should complement storage capacity in future assessments of the hydrological effects of mekong dams in addition flood hazards from dam failures emergency spills and inter basin transfers also require further study as does reservoir evaporation we also assess whether concurrent changes in climate water demand and land cover offset or exacerbate hydrological impacts of hydropower while some uncertainty in the direction of hydrological responses to climate change remains modeling studies increasingly suggest that both wet and dry season flows will increase in many parts of the basin under this circumstance on stream hydropower development could be increasingly important for offsetting climate change impacts during the wet season but would exacerbate them during the dry season meanwhile increased dry season flows could enable irrigation to meet growing food and export demands as allowed by land availability however fertile land flooded by new impoundments or temporarily submerged by higher river water levels may compromise many agricultural livelihoods e g riverbank gardens the combined effects of increased wet season irrigation and seasonal flow regulation could negatively impact livelihoods and ecosystems reliant upon the annual flood pulse finally joint impacts of these concurrent changes also depend on the on site vs off site nature of hydropower production for instance greater precipitation could offset diversions in donor basins but aggravate flooding in recipient basins yet comparing hydrological alteration from dams and other concurrent drivers of change is insufficient for addressing transboundary and multi sectoral tradeoffs of dam development rather integrated models featuring indirect pathways through which hydropower induces hydrological alteration such as land cover change near dams are necessary to fully examine them e g ringler et al 2004 johnston and kummu 2012 pokhrel et al 2018 in addition while flow alteration often harms riverine ecosystems poff et al 1997 ecological objectives could be integrated into dam operations to improve livelihood relevant ecological indicators beyond what hydropower operations conventionally yield sabo et al 2017 li et al 2018 indeed the uncertain ecological effects of hydropower dams further underscore the need for more quantitative relationships between flow alteration and ecological responses such assessments must untangle other drivers of ecological change such as connectivity and sediment concentrations from flow alteration e g mcmanamay et al 2013 knight et al 2014 hogan et al 2018 multi reservoir operation rules that mitigate ecological and livelihood impacts e g lacombe et al 2014a jeuland et al 2014 reis et al 2015 also merit further research as do ecological effects of dam construction sequences large investments in water resources modeling johnston and kummu 2012 naturally spark a discussion regarding our current ability to characterize hydrological impacts of dams in the mekong while some simulations have reproduced seasonal flow alteration well räsänen et al 2017 simplified representations of reservoir operating rules often make capturing shorter term fluctuations more challenging preliminary efforts to examine changes in flow predictability e g mohammed et al 2018b must be expanded to address forecasting needs for specific livelihood objectives more attention should also be paid to estimates of extreme events and sub daily flow variation given their impacts to ecosystems and livelihoods also continued efforts to compare the modeling implications of choosing different meteorological and other environmental datasets e g soil land cover is essential studies that explore how uncertainty in input variables and parameters and future conditions influence uncertainty in simulated streamflow e g shrestha et al 2016b would help assess the robustness of ecological and livelihood impact assessments protocols for updating management plans based on previous modeling efforts when new observations and or projections become available including regular assessments of flow alteration using stakeholder relevant indicators will be essential for transboundary management in addition future studies must carefully consider the extent to which flow alteration versus other impacts of dams e g connectivity sediment transport and other ongoing environmental pressures e g indiscriminate fishing jointly affect ecosystems and livelihoods in the basin finally our review offers guidance for research in other basins where extensive hydropower development is possible we especially encourage the coordination of observational and modeling studies and integration of their results when assessing dam induced flow alteration in addition studies should consider i the uncertainty associated with the limited length of available pre and post dam streamflow records which makes it challenging to distinguish hydropower impacts from climate variability ii hydrological change metrics relevant for local ecosystems and livelihoods e g dry season days when riverbank gardens are exposed or conversely when navigation is possible iii different timescales of hydrological alteration including sub daily ones iv different modes of hydropower production on stream vs off stream v impacts of inter basin transfers vi dam operations during floods and their influence on downstream flood hazards including dam failure risks vii concurrent environmental changes that might offset or exacerbate hydropower induced flow alteration viii conducting holistic assessments through integrated models featuring direct and indirect pathways through which dams can alter streamflow ix scheduling and coordination of hydropower projects to minimize basin wide impacts especially in transboundary river basins or where hydropower cascades have multiple dam operators and x assessing long term hydrological effects of reservoir sedimentation addressing these gaps would facilitate the inter sectoral and transboundary coordination needed to improve tradeoffs between hydropower production and other river management objectives

6814,hydropower production is altering the mekong river basin s riverine ecosystems which contain the world s largest inland fishery and provide food security and livelihoods to millions of people the basin s hydropower reservoir storage which may rise from 2 of its mean annual flow in 2008 to 20 in 2025 is attenuating seasonal flow variability downstream of many dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs in addition tributary diversions for off stream energy production are reducing downstream flows and augmenting them in recipient tributaries to help manage tradeoffs between dam benefits hydropower irrigation flood control domestic water supply and navigation and their consequences for livelihoods and ecosystems we review observed and projected impacts on river flows along both the mekong mainstream and its tributaries we include the effects of diversions and inter basin transfers which prior reviews of flow alteration in the mekong basin have largely neglected we also discuss the extent to which concurrent changes in climate water demand and land use may offset or exacerbate hydropower induced flow alteration our major recommendations for assessing hydrological impacts in the mekong and other basins undergoing rapid hydropower development include synchronizing and integrating observational and modeling studies improving the accuracy of reservoir water balances evaluating multi objective reservoir operating rules examining hydropeaking induced flow alteration conducting multi dam safety assessments evaluating flow indicators relevant to local ecosystems and livelihoods and considering alternative energy sources and reservoir sedimentation in long term projections finally we strongly recommend that dam impact studies consider hydrological alteration in conjunction with fish passage barriers geomorphic changes and other contemporaneous stressors keywords dams hydrological alteration hydropower mekong reservoirs river basin management 1 introduction in many river basins with emerging economies rising energy demands and campaigns to reduce fossil fuel dependence have spurred the rapid expansion of hydropower e g zarfl et al 2015 zhang

these multi sectoral and transboundary tradeoffs requires accurate characterizations of observed and projected hydrological changes indeed hydrological changes in the lower mekong floodplain have been highly scrutinized due to its dense population and dependence on fisheries and flood recession agriculture especially rice e g intralawan et al 2018 dang et al 2018 recent studies have synthesized regional hydrological alterations in the basin and their socioeconomic and ecological implications pokhrel et al 2018 lu et al 2008 and li et al 2017a have included reviews of prior studies on dam induced hydrological alteration while fan et al 2015 and yu and geheb 2017 have recently summarized observed hydrological impacts of chinese hydropower dams in the upper mekong basin numerous recent studies grumbine et al 2012 johnston and kummu 2012 pokhrel et al 2018 have also advocated integrated modeling approaches for assessing socioeconomic and ecological impacts of hydrological alteration however given the potential ecological and livelihood impacts of mekong hydropower development a more detailed review of hydrological alteration in different regions of the basin is warranted moreover managing impacts from diversions and inter basin transfers in tributary basins often requires mitigation strategies different from those suited for dams with large reservoirs that attenuate seasonal flow variability thus this paper aims to synthesize and critically review existing knowledge regarding observed and projected hydrological alterations caused by hydropower dams on both the mekong mainstream and tributaries section 2 provides an overview of the basin s geography outlines historical and projected trajectories of dam development highlights some key impacts of hydrological alteration to ecosystems and livelihoods and briefly describes basin management efforts and challenges sections 3 and 4 detail the extent to which observed hydrological impacts and model based projections have been assessed throughout the basin respectively section 5 assesses the extent to which concurrent drivers of hydrological change may offset or exacerbate hydropower impacts section 6 summarizes recent advances in understanding the hydrological impacts of mekong hydropower dams and identifies research gaps that could be addressed to further guide hydropower development in the mekong and other basins worldwide 2 background 2 1 basin overview the mekong is one of the world s most prominent rivers its mean annual discharge of 14 500 m3 s wang et al 2017 and length of 4909 km liu et al 2009 both rank tenth globally while its drainage area 795 000 km2 is the 25th largest mrc 2005 its population was approximately 70 75 million in 2005 ringler and cai 2006 varis et al 2012 and could increase to 100 145 million by 2050 pech and sunada 2008 varis et al 2012 the lower mekong basin lmb fig 1 lies in the southeast asian countries of lao pdr 25 of the basin area thailand 23 cambodia 20 vietnam 8 and myanmar 3 meanwhile the upstream portion of the basin 21 in china is often known as the upper mekong basin umb or lancang basin mrc 2005 the lmb has a monsoonal climate with distinct wet and dry seasons the wet season analyzed in most studies runs from june to november while the dry season often lasts from december to may typically 75 of the river s annual discharge of 460 km3 mrc 2005 passes through the delta between july and october a period with extensive flooding that sustains many ecosystems and livelihoods e g kummu and sarkkula 2008 piman et al 2013a meanwhile 35 of its dry season flow originates from china making impacts of large umb dams especially critical see mrc 2005 adamson et al 2009 and mrc 2018a b for more detailed basin descriptions 2 2 hydropower dam development while hydropower ambitions have existed for over half a century jacobs 2002 most hydropower dams have been constructed in the last decade fig 2 in 2008 the mekong was one of the least regulated large river basins in the world as its total active reservoir storage capacity 8 6 km3 amounted to just 2 of its mean annual discharge kummu et al 2010 data from mrc 2015 suggests that the basin s active reservoir storage in 2025 86 8 km3 is expected to be equal to 19 of its mean annual discharge this estimate falls within the 17 23 range of earlier projections hoanh et al 2010 kummu et al 2010 mrc 2011 note that the mrc databases used in these estimates have not contained numerous existing and planned dams in china which according to the greater mekong dam database gmdd https wle mekong cgiar org maps from wle mekong 2017 will have over 8 7 km3 of combined active and dead storage by 2025 recent dam status updates in the gmdd indicate that 64 of the 187 existing and proposed hydropower dams with an installed capacity of at least 15 mw in the entire mekong basin had been commissioned by june 2017 out of these 64 dams 18 dams in china can generate up to 17 770 mw over 91 of which is installed at the six large lancang cascade dams on the umb mainstream the other 46 lmb tributary dams can produce up to 8650 mw the combined installed capacity of all existing and proposed dams 15 mw in the gmdd database exceeds 65 000 mw while other estimates range from nearly 59 000 mw dore et al 2007 to 88 000 mw stone 2011 these estimates include a controversial cascade of 11 proposed lmb mainstream dams with a total installed capacity of 13 000 mw wle mekong 2017 greater seasonal flow regulation from upstream hydropower reservoirs increases the feasibility of hydropower at downstream locations moreover if increased annual and dry season flows projected under many climate change scenarios e g hoang et al 2016 exceed climate driven increases in reservoir evaporation both total and firm energy production could increase such potential basin wide changes in the hydropower generation capacity of the basin have not been modeled 2 3 ecological implications of hydrological alteration dam induced changes in streamflow affect many aspects of riverine ecosystems including hydraulics depth velocity temperature along with nutrient and sediment transport e g power et al 1995 many studies around the world have shown that flow alteration often impacts riverine species and ecosystems negatively e g poff and zimmerman 2010 ecological impacts of dam induced flow alteration have been debated in the mekong basin including the loss of flood pulses floodplain habitat and wetlands ringler et al 2004 stone 2010a mrc 2017 intralawan et al 2018 as lmb residents depend on fish and other aquatic animals for 47 80 of their required protein intake more than any other major basin in the world hortle 2007 in particular the tonle sap lake fishery enables cambodia to have one of the world s highest freshwater fish catch rates per capita mcintyre et al 2016 spatiotemporal variations in river and floodplain hydrology influence lmb fisheries several components of the flood pulse have been hypothesized to affect fish catches including flood magnitude duration timing and variability sabo et al 2017 welcomme 1979 overall halls et al 2013 observed that larger annual floods tend to yield greater fish catches yet this correlation is likely due to numerous hydrologically driven processes including fish population density and reproduction halls and welcomme 2004 as well as floodplain primary production and habitat chea et al 2016b koponen et al 2010 numerous studies have investigated and reviewed dam impacts on fisheries and diversity in fish species e g baran and myschowoda 2009 kang et al 2009 dugan et al 2010 ziv et al 2012 pukinskis and geheb 2012 zhang et al 2018 the tendency for generalist species to proliferate downstream of dams that regulate seasonal flow e g poff et al 2007 has also been observed in the mekong basin chea et al 2016b the mekong river is also well known for its abundance and diversity of migratory species many of which travel hundreds of kilometers along free flowing reaches to spawn e g hogan et al 2007 some of these species are becoming endangered as the percentage of free flowing reaches in the basin decreases as in other parts of the world e g anderson et al 2018 mekong dams have substantially reduced river network connectivity ziv et al 2012 ou and winemiller 2016 and changed downstream flow variability vital to many fish species baran et al 2011 li et al 2013 these physical changes in addition to changes in sediment and nutrient transport e g chea et al 2016a kondolf et al 2018 and overfishing pressure e g ngor et al 2018a are compromising fish biodiversity and production in the mekong floodplains between 1990 and 2010 river connectivity declined from 93 to 77 and could drop as low as 10 grill et al 2014 losses in connectivity have even caused run of river dams to disrupt fisheries in the mekong basin such as the pak mun dam on the mun river in thailand e g molle et al 2010 while this study focuses on flow alteration further research is needed to untangle the effects of passage barriers and flow alteration on mekong fisheries and ecosystems while many ecological studies focused on flow alteration impacts on specific species e g hogan et al 2007 sabo et al 2017 some studies have assessed a wider range of riverine ecological communities in the umb kang et al 2009 li et al 2013 fan et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 and lmb tributaries ou and winemiller 2016 ngor et al 2018a b although pronounced flow alteration has been associated with severe ecological impacts e g baran et al 2011 the optimality of natural flow for some species i e the natural flow paradigm poff et al 1997 has also been questioned most notably sabo et al 2017 proposed that if hydropower dams were collectively operated to generate year round dry season flows with punctuated flood pulses dai bag net fisheries in the tonle sap river could maintain or even increase historical yields as recently clarified halls and moyle 2018 holtgrieve et al 2018 these designer flows are only one of several mitigation strategies this strategy is only viable as long as there are no major dams impeding fish migration in the mekong floodplains and as long as other environmental conditions critical for their habitat e g sediment delivery primary production and water quality are intact other studies have also suggested that replicating annual flow variability through artificial flood releases may provide ecological benefits li and zhao 2016 hydropower induced changes in ecosystem productivity have also been investigated as arias et al 2014a suggested that the annual average net primary productivity in open water and floodplain areas of tonle sap lake could decrease by 34 4 under climate change and a 126 dam hydropower development scenario overall a more detailed review of ecological impacts from dam development and other concurrent drivers of changes such as castello and macedo s 2015 review on the amazon basin is warranted 2 4 toward river basin management the mekong river commission mrc comprised of thailand lao pdr cambodia and vietnam has facilitated many studies that inform transboundary basin management e g mrc 2005 2011 2018a china and myanmar also participate in many mrc activities as dialogue partners yet relatively few transboundary streamflow regulations have been implemented the mekong agreement mrc 1995 the mrc countries signed articulates guidelines to limit excessive dry season withdrawals but these rules have never been specified tfdd 2018 there are a limited number of binational cooperation efforts such as the vietnam cambodia agreement establishing minimum sesan river flows ngo et al 2018 and the recent fisheries management efforts between lao pdr and cambodia mrc 2018b often dam operators belonging to different companies make decisions without concern for downstream dams and overall basin impact piman et al 2016 schmitt et al 2018 in the lmb dams along tributaries frequently have different owners jeuland et al 2014 whereas hydrolancang owns all major dams on the umb mainstream except dachaoshan yu and geheb 2017 while the mrc has facilitated a transboundary flood forecasting system for the mainstream pagano 2014 the mekong agreement does not explicitly address potential transboundary impacts along tributaries sithirith et al 2016 the lack of tributary flood forecasting and early warning systems exacerbated the consequences that cambodian citizens residing along the sekong river suffered from the failure of an auxiliary saddle dam of the xe pian xe namnoy project under construction in southern lao pdr on july 23 2018 wallace and leng 2018 this breach unleashed a flash flood that has left over 100 people dead or missing in both lao pdr and cambodia business standard 2018 url http www nationmultimedia com detail opinion 30357045 this catastrophe also prompted the government of lao pdr to suspend new dam projects and re evaluate its dam construction standards boyle 2018 widespread concerns about ecosystem and livelihood impacts of seasonal flow regulation have largely not been considered in major transboundary water resources agreements among mekong countries tfdd 2018 while extreme floods threaten human safety infrastructure and crops the typical wet season flood pulse benefits fisheries and floodplain agriculture tremendously the average annual economic benefits of floods in lmb countries us 8 10 billion are more than hundred times greater than their average annual damages us 60 70 million mrc 2010 in contrast wet season droughts often not considered as a hazard in tropical monsoon regions adamson and bird 2010 can impact agricultural and fisheries production substantially hydropower dams that regulate seasonal flow substantially may reduce the ecological and agricultural benefits of the annual flood pulse especially during drier years e g piman et al 2013a hydropower dams may improve dry season navigation downstream of dams but they may also impede passage further upstream and irregular releases can be hazardous for small boats these navigation tradeoffs have not been systematically examined while hydropower development is not centrally coordinated numerous basin wide dam development scenarios have been devised kummu et al 2010 mrc 2011 lauri et al 2012 mrc 2018a b some scenarios such as the prominent ones in mrc 2011 consider ongoing changes in other sectors such as water demand agricultural industrial and domestic along with climate change this allows for direct comparisons between different impacts recently the mrc s council study mrc 2018a b created a preliminary new scenario set however since this study was still under review at the time of submission we comment on its broader scope but not its findings prior dam development scenarios have not considered possible increases in hydropower potential from increased future precipitation rapidly lowering solar energy costs intralawan et al 2018 liu et al 2018 growing concerns about high ghg emissions from some reservoirs räsänen et al 2018 or possible overcapacity problems world bank 2017 hydropower integrated with other forms of renewable energy including a floating solar power plant on the lower sesan 2 reservoir in cambodia is also being evaluated nhi 2018 3 observed hydrological impacts this section surveys the extent of studies that have assessed the actual hydrological impact of hydropower dams using observed flow records and comparing pre and post dam periods in the mekong basin including the conclusions inferable from these studies given short record lengths and other confounding factors we partition this section into reviews of impacts observed in the umb and lmb umb impacts encompass the effects that a cascade of dams within china has on mekong mainstream flows in both the umb and lmb meanwhile the review of flow alteration from lmb dams covers the observed hydrological effects of tributary dams on tributaries the lmb mainstream and lower mekong floodplains see section 4 3 for the projected effects of the lmb mainstream dams under construction 3 1 impacts of upper mekong dams on mainstream flow hydrological effects of umb dams have been scrutinized ever since manwan dam active storage capacity of 0 26 km3 was completed in 1993 e g chapman and he 1996 lu and siew 2006 while some media reports have attributed lmb droughts to umb dams campbell 2007 stone 2010b most studies suggest that the smaller umb mainstream dams combined active storage capacity of 0 72 km3 built before xiaowan and nuozhadu combined active storage capacity of 32 1 km3 have either only minimally altered flow in the mekong mainstream campbell 2007 or increased dry season flows zhao et al 2012 cochrane et al 2014 detected statistically significant increases in late dry season flow feb may monthly flows between 1961 and 1990 and 1991 2010 fig 3 although this study did not control for possible confounding factors such as changes in precipitation and land use irregular releases from manwan and dachaoshan dams have also been associated with more variable daily and monthly flows during the dry season at chiang saen li and he 2008 lu et al 2014 cochrane et al 2014 dry season flow alteration associated with their construction has also been detected as far downstream as vientiane he et al 2006 meanwhile the xiaowan and nuozhadu dams commissioned in 2010 and 2014 respectively and filled in 2008 and 2011 respectively are altering streamflow seasonality in the mekong mainstream much more than earlier umb dams did cochrane et al 2014 li et al 2017a räsänen 2017 ji et al 2018 dry season flows have increased dramatically as far downstream as kratie cambodia li et al 2017a including low flows in march may 2014 that were 41 74 above pre dam averages and 41 68 larger than simulated unregulated discharges räsänen 2017 these increases fell within the range of earlier projections hoanh et al 2010 lauri et al 2012 räsänen et al 2012 the refilling of reservoirs during the beginning of the wet season may have delayed the date of the maximum daily flow by 22 days at both chiang saen and stung treng in 2010 2014 relative to their 1960 1991 averages li et al 2017a however this short post xiaowan record limits the statistical strength of this conclusion as does the filling of nuozhadu 2011 during this post impact period post xiaowan daily flow fluctuations are also greater cochrane et al 2014 li et al 2017a mohammed et al 2018b li et al 2017a also associated a dramatic decrease in the duration of low flow pulses below the 25th daily flow percentile which are critical for lmb fisheries sabo et al 2017 with irregular releases from xiaowan dam yet while low flow pulses have shortened irregular releases have also made extreme low flows even lower lu et al 2014 some measures have been made to mitigate negative consequences of downstream impacts within china see fan et al 2015 yu and geheb 2017 and strategies for reducing impacts to flows entering the lmb mainstream and evaluate hydropower ecological tradeoffs li et al 2018 have also been explored however the small ganlanba re regulation dam 0 12 km3 c f kummu et al 2010 is primarily being constructed to attenuate short term hydropeaking fluctuations as restoring seasonal flow variability requires far more storage 3 2 impacts of lower mekong basin dams on mainstream and tributaries relatively few streamflow stations downstream of tributary dams have pre and post dam flow records exceeding ten years lacombe et al 2014a lyon et al 2017 which limits assessments of tributary flow alteration while numerous studies emphasize that dams attenuate flow seasonality e g adamson 2001 pokhrel et al 2018 observed flow records indicate diverse hydrological impacts that depend in part on the on stream vs off stream location of hydropower turbines to increase the hydraulic head for power generation numerous tributary dams impound water for diversions to powerhouses at much lower elevations either further downstream along the same river or into adjacent tributary basins only two pumped storage projects could be found in the mekong basin both of which are located in thailand kraitud 2017 as expected tributary dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs have attenuated seasonal flow variability in lao pdr lacombe et al 2014a examined daily flow records available since 1962 from several stations along the nam ngum river downstream of a cascade of hydropower dams the oldest of which nam ngum 1 was constructed in 1971 without the dams current irrigation needs would compete with environmental flow requirements during drier than normal years in contrast wet season flows decreased by about 17 after nam ngum 1 dam was commissioned in other tributary basins where extensive flow alteration has been projected such as the 3s basin initial dams have only caused minor impacts because they are largely run of river projects piman et al 2013a tributary studies have not examined flow alteration over interannual timescales despite numerous dams with storage capacities exceeding their annual inflow volume bonnema and hossain 2017 and the interannual persistence of hydroclimatic conditions in the region frappart et al 2018 mohammed et al 2018b meanwhile diversions have been associated with reduced flows downstream of dams as well as flow augmentation in recipient basins e g baird et al 2015 chanudet et al 2016 changes in the nam theun nam kading basin in lao pdr fig 4 showcase diverse forms of hydropower induced flow alteration the nam theun 2 nt2 dam completed in 2010 see fig 4 enables diversions from the nam theun river into the xe bang fai river a separate mekong tributary e g stone 2010a average diversions entering the xe bang fai 220 m3 s are nearly equal to the river s natural mean annual flow 266 m3 s at mahaxai from 1989 to 2002 descloux et al 2016 this flow alteration affects the livelihoods of over 110 000 people international rivers 2018 due to these diversions downstream releases from nt2 are just 2 m3 s less than 1 of its mean annual inflow of 238 m3 s except during spills chanudet et al 2016 since nt2 heavily depletes flow in the nam theun river releases from a hydropower reservoir on the nam gnouang river ng a nam theun tributary boost dry season hydropower production at the theun hinboun project thxp further downstream reis et al 2015 this project can divert up to 220 m3 s through a tunnel to a powerhouse that discharges into the adjacent nam hinboun basin in contrast only 5 m3 s must be released directly downstream reis et al 2015 which has raised water temperatures and depleted dissolved oxygen warren 1999 while post nt2 streamflow changes are being monitored in the nam theun and xe bang fai basins descloux et al 2016 rigorous assessments of hydrological alteration have not been published while diversions from mekong tributaries have not been comprehensively catalogued other major tributary projects also have them including houay ho lao pdr and yali falls vietnam diversions to raise water levels in nam ngun 1 reservoir have drastically reduced dry season flows in the nam song river neua 2007 pronounced fluctuations in flow downstream of diversions and in recipient basins stemming from irregular electricity demands have been reported e g chanudet et al 2016 but have not been quantified extensive diversions for irrigation in the mun chi basin in northeastern thailand may explain the concurrence of the increasing precipitation and decreasing flow trends that ruiz barradas and nigam 2018 detected at pakse lao pdr during the wet season although more research is needed as kibler and tullos 2013 who assessed recent hydropower diversions in southeast asia s nu river basin emphasized these diversions can make reservoir storage capacity an inappropriate proxy for a dam s hydrological impact next many dam operators have employed profit driven hydropeaking strategies to meet energy demands that fluctuate substantially over daily lower nighttime demands and weekly lower weekend demands timescales e g wyatt and baird 2007 reis et al 2015 trung et al 2018 consequently increased flow fluctuations have been observed downstream of lmb tributary dams cochrane et al 2014 even associated increased daily fluctuations in the mekong mainstream with hydropeaking in thailand s chi mun tributary basin inadequate warnings about abrupt flow changes have compromised navigation and even led to drowning deaths lerner 2003 neua 2007 soutthisombat et al 2011 a few designated re regulation dams such as the small sesan 4a dam meynell et al 2014 and ones downstream of the theun hinboun and nt2 projects aim to curtail flow alteration however these dams primarily modulate short term fluctuations and cannot restore seasonal flow variability or attenuate flood hazards from inter basin transfers significantly only modeling studies have addressed the extent to which downstream dams in cascades can also function as re regulation dams jeuland et al 2014 piman et al 2016 they show that cascade optimal operations can mildly reduce flow alteration jeuland et al 2014 but more studies are needed since impacts can vary considerably among reservoirs piman et al 2016 in addition flow alteration during dam construction and reservoir filling has also impacted human safety livelihoods and ecosystems in lmb tributaries including the recent xe pian xe namnoy auxiliary dam failure in southern lao pdr which has left over 100 people dead or missing in lao pdr and cambodia see section 2 4 in vietnam the failure of a temporary diversion dam caused a large flood when the yali falls dam was constructed wyatt and baird 2007 moreover irregular flow releases following its construction killed 39 people lerner 2003 aquatic life in the nam lik river in lao pdr was deeply disturbed when dam construction completely halted downstream flow in 2010 baran et al 2011 despite these myriad impacts few studies have examined reservoir filling rates and other flow alterations before dams are commissioned see sections 4 1 and 4 2 for reviews of dam safety studies 3 3 gaps in observational studies short tributary streamflow records especially ones preceding dam construction also make distinguishing dam induced impacts from natural hydroclimatic variability and other ongoing environmental changes more difficult while a comprehensive list of stations suitable for assessing dam induced flow alteration is unavailable ketelsen et al 2014 offer a partial list of stations used to estimate 100 year floods at dam sites and lacombe et al 2014b and lyon et al 2017 have identified subsets of unregulated tributary stations for analyses of pre dam conditions procedures for extending short records filling intermittent records inomata and fukami 2008 or computing regional estimates of time series or flow statistics at ungauged locations using longer records in hydrologically similar regions could help estimate pre dam flows at dam impacted sites lacombe et al 2014b ketelsen et al 2014 sub daily streamflow and water level observations would also improve assessments of hydropeaking impacts remotely sensed data are being increasingly used to overcome in situ data limitations e g liu et al 2016 ji et al 2018 wang et al 2016 recent satellite altimetry efforts have estimated daily water levels in the mainstream with sub meter accuracy pham et al 2018 observations of changing water body surface areas and their relationship with remotely sensed terrain and water surface elevations have been used to deduce reservoir operation patterns bonnema and hossain 2017 and changes in tonle sap lake storage frappart et al 2018 however limitations for using satellite based observations remain for instance correction factors have often been necessary for incorporating satellite based precipitation estimates into process based hydrological models liu et al 2017 mohammed et al 2018a to address the decision making consequences of record length limitations some studies have applied hypothesis testing to indicate the likelihood that pre and post dam differences do not arise from sampling variability cochrane et al 2014 li et al 2017a although this uncertainty has not been integrated into formal decision making frameworks see hecht 2017 however hypothesis testing cannot eliminate the possibility that other confounding factors explain differences between two periods in contrast the effects of different dam configurations can be compared directly through simulation models in which the meteorological forcings and upstream watershed conditions are identical e g lauri et al 2012 yet these comparisons often rely upon simplified reservoir operation rules to evaluate implications of operating rule assumptions räsänen 2017 simulated the hydrology of the basin without umb reservoirs and then applied a bias correction procedure to remove systematic model error from these simulations before comparing them to observed discharges their observations of flow alteration suggest reservoir operating rules could vary substantially from year to year highlighting the importance of actual operating rules for modeling studies while mrc 2011 and mrc 2018a scenarios have been configured to isolate dam impacts from other concurrent changes they have yet to be used to make direct comparisons with observed flow alteration we also examined the availability of hydrometeorological observations for simulating reservoir water balances although evaporation from many tributary reservoirs may substantially affect firm energy production and exacerbate consequences of uncoordinated reservoir operations jeuland et al 2014 estimates of open water evaporation are limited kummu et al 2013 coefficients relating pan and lake evaporation are not widely available open water evaporation estimates using only monthly temperature solar radiation and sunshine data morton 1983 which have been comparable to estimates obtained using more data intensive methods in tropical locations dos reis and dias 1998 vallet coulumb et al 2001 could offer an initial approach for reservoirs with negligible seepage losses finally effects of reservoir sedimentation on downstream releases have not been assessed in detail ultimately assessments of hydrological change geared toward improving tradeoffs associated with dam development must evaluate flow indicators relevant for ecosystems and livelihoods li et al 2017a and li et al 2018 have examined changes in the magnitude and timing of mainstream flow with the popular indicators of hydrologic alteration iha which aim to capture ecologically relevant dimensions of flow alteration richter et al 1996 yet applications of generalized frameworks for characterizing site specific or transferable flow ecology relationships such as the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration poff et al 2010 remain scant in the mekong basin while standard flow alteration metrics enable comparisons with other locations indicators tailored to mekong livelihoods e g sabo et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 such as dry season days when riverbank gardens are exposed or conversely when small boat navigation is possible could enrich tradeoff analyses 4 projected hydrological impacts this section focuses on studies of projected hydropower impacts simulated using hydrological models without considering concurrent drivers of hydrological change 4 1 basin wide studies basin wide modeling studies have concurred that increased reservoir storage would reduce wet season flows and increase dry season flows e g hoanh et al 2010 lauri et al 2012 piman et al 2013a b fig 5 using hydrological conditions from 1985 to 2000 hoanh et al 2010 investigated impacts of 6 umb and 81 lmb dams including 11 mainstream dams with a cumulative active storage capacity equal to 16 of the basin s annual flow at kratie cambodia together these prospective dams and other forms of water resources development through 2030 would reduce wet season flows by 8 17 and increase dry season flows by 30 60 relative to a baseline scenario with just 18 lmb tributary dams in a related study piman et al 2013a found that six umb dams and 82 lmb tributary dams including 11 mainstream dams would increase dry season flows at kratie by 28 whereas wet season flows would drop by 9 under a long range development scenario through 2060 featuring 136 lmb and 6 umb dams wet season flows would decline by an additional 4 13 from baseline whereas dry season flows would increase by just 1 primarily because irrigation withdrawals would offset reservoir induced increases in contrast lauri et al 2012 simulated greater dry season increases 25 160 and wet season decreases 5 24 at kratie since they examined seasonal flow changes strictly from a 126 dam cumulative development scenario using discharge from 1982 to 1992 impacts of basin wide hydropower development on flooding have also been assessed using representative dry 1998 average 1997 and wet 2000 years piman et al 2013a also predicted that six umb mainstream dams and 71 lmb tributary dams would decrease the river s annually flooded area by 5 0 in a dry year 6 6 in an average year but only by 0 4 during a wet year the extent to which this low wet year reduction is driven by reservoir design constraints storage and spillway capacity or operating rules merits future research especially considering projected increases in future floods see section 5 1 numerous studies have projected impacts of basin wide hydropower development on the lower mekong floodplain which begins downstream of kratie in central cambodia these floodplains have a unique hydrology as tonle sap lake in cambodia effectively serves as a natural flood control reservoir for the mekong river see uk et al 2018 for a recent review in a typical year the lake s surface area expands from a dry season minimum of 2400 km2 to a wet season maximum of 13 200 km2 kummu and sarkkula 2008 the hydraulic gradient between the mekong river and tonle sap lake determines the flow direction between the two bodies of water as mekong flow enters the lake via the tonle sap river during the wet season while the lake drains to the mekong delta during the dry season since 54 of its annual surface water inflow originates from the mekong mainstream on average kummu et al 2013 uk et al 2018 the lake ecosystem and its extremely productive fishery are sensitive to hydrological changes from upstream dam development e g lamberts 2008 arias et al 2014a upstream hydropower development is expected to attenuate inter seasonal variations in lake area and exacerbate impacts to aquatic and amphibious species during years with unusually dry monsoons piman et al 2013a arias et al 2014c as one travels downstream the mekong mainstream into vietnam it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish hydropower induced hydrological alteration from numerous local drivers of change including sea level rise flood control and navigation infrastructure irrigation and land subsidence exacerbated by groundwater pumping e g le et al 2007 hoa et al 2008 västilä et al 2010 dang et al 2016 dang et al 2018 found local water infrastructure development controlled wet season levels in the upper vietnamese delta while sea level rise and land subsidence increasingly influenced them near the coast upstream dam impacts are expected to be greater during dry years piman et al 2013a dang et al 2018 emergency releases from umb dams to alleviate the lmb drought in 2016 mrc and mwrc 2016 corroborated previous predictions that dry season releases from umb hydropower dams could alleviate salinity and acidic groundwater constraints to dry season agriculture in the delta e g hoa et al 2008 hoanh et al 2010 piman et al 2013a smajgl et al 2015 however piman et al 2013a projected that by 2030 sea level rise will offset agricultural gains from dry season releases made under normal hydropower operations moreover a drastic reduction in the delta s sediment supply due to trapping in upstream reservoirs e g kummu et al 2010 kondolf et al 2018 and to a lesser extent reduced cyclonic activity darby et al 2016 are expected to accelerate land subsidence and aggravate coastal flooding 4 2 upper mekong dams impacts to mainstream flow potential hydrological changes from umb dams have attracted considerable attention partly due to their transboundary implications e g chapman and he 1996 adamson 2001 mrc 2011 lauri et al 2012 räsänen et al 2012 wang et al 2017 mohammed et al 2018b studies concur that umb dams would attenuate seasonal flow variability in the lmb mainstream for instance räsänen et al 2012 projected that six umb dams would increase dry season flow by 90 and decrease wet season flow by 22 at chiang saen recent observations of dam altered flows have corroborated these projections cochrane et al 2014 li et al 2017a räsänen et al 2017 although longer post dam records are needed for stronger statistical conclusions overall umb flow regulation has been expected to diminish further downstream because lmb tributaries have more annual rainfall and less reservoir storage some studies have also predicted that the flood season will commence later due to seasonal reservoir filling e g adamson 2001 which recent observations have corroborated räsänen et al 2017 li et al 2017a wang et al 2017 also estimated that umb reservoirs could reduce the frequency of floods exceeding 0 5 year recurrence intervals by 72 at chiang saen but only by 6 0 at stung treng cambodia reductions in annual maximum floods were lower 29 5 at chiang saen and 2 6 at stung treng possibly due to current reservoir storage limitations while quantifying design floods whose return periods far exceed record lengths is challenging liang et al 2017 estimated that the lancang cascade dams could withstand a 5000 year flood but that manwan and jinghong dams would be overtopped during a 10 000 year event assuming hydrological stationarity 4 3 lower mekong basin dam impacts on mainstream and tributaries numerous studies have evaluated the potential hydrological effects of the 11 lmb mainstream dams icem 2010 mrc 2011 vnmre 2015 trung et al 2018 although their reservoirs are expected to convert many reaches from lotic to lentic lacustrine habitat seasonal flow alteration from them is expected to be minimal since they store no more than a few days of their mean annual inflow however alteration at sub daily to daily timescales from hydropeaking is expected to be substantial for instance trung et al 2018 projected that dry season flows at kratie 31 km below the dam furthest downstream in the cascade might fluctuate by 16 000 m3 s and water levels might oscillate by 2 m in addition dam induced channel incision is expected to deepen the channel which in turn could expedite the propagation of flood waves to the delta by a few days while much of the debate surrounding the basin s hydropower dam development has focused on mainstream impacts substantial flow alteration has been projected in many tributaries one focal point of tributary studies has been the sekong sesan and srepok 3s rivers wyatt and baird 2007 piman et al 2013a arias et al 2014b wild and loucks 2014 räsänen et al 2014 piman et al 2016 ngo et al 2018 the source of 16 23 of the mekong s annual flow adamson et al 2009 piman et al 2013b trang et al 2017 piman et al 2013b found that dry season flows in this tri national watershed lao pdr cambodia vietnam could increase by 63 and wet season flows may decline by 22 when considering 23 proposed hydropower projects aiming to maximize their own hydropower production moreover under a full development scenario consisting of 41 projects piman et al 2013b projected a dry season increase of 95 and a wet season decrease of 25 piman et al 2016 also found impacts on annual daily flow extremes to be even greater as annual daily maxima and minima could be reduced and increased by 36 and 168 respectively in addition they showed that existing and near term projects in the 3s basin many of which are run of river dams offered a much greater energy return per unit of reservoir storage than larger long term projects however this study did not examine potential impacts of smaller dams to fish passage including in the sekong river one of the mekong s last free flowing tributaries other 3s basin studies have examined impacts to just the sesan river räsänen et al 2014 found that assumed hydropower maximizing rules at the 11 largest hydropower dams would increase dry season flows by 53 and reduce wet season flows by 11 however when dam operations in the vietnamese portion of the sesan river basin were simulated using government issued operating rules dry season flows increased by just 30 whereas wet season flows dropped by 15 ngo et al 2018 when minimum flow requirements at the cambodian border downstream of the dams were also considered dry season flows rose by 40 this also suggests that minimum flow requirements account for productive uses as well as the environmental demand while other modeling differences between these two studies prevent a direct comparison these findings motivate further efforts to include actual operating rules in reservoir simulations flow alteration in the 3s basin could also propagate downstream into the mekong mainstream and lower mekong floodplain arias et al 2014b estimated that 42 new 3s basin dams could increase tonle sap lake s annual minimum level by 25 35 cm which could inhibit tree germination and fish migration piman et al 2013a showed that reductions in the annual maximum water level are less certain and that the timing of the tonle sap river flow reversal may vary by a few weeks in either direction compared to the pre development date 6 8 days earlier in a typical year the earlier reversal during a typical year stems from higher mainstream water levels at the end of the dry season hydropower and irrigation reservoirs within the lake s catchment might further attenuate seasonal lake level extremes upon which many ecosystems and livelihoods depend potential dam impacts have also been simulated in other tributary basins including those under innovative single and multi reservoir operating rules reis et al 2015 showed that maintaining low reservoir levels in the nam gnouang reservoir see fig 4 would facilitate recession agriculture while reducing average annual hydropower by only 8 1 although it substantially increases hourly peak demand shortfalls between april and june sioudom 2013 simulated increases in flooding in the nam hinboun basin caused by diversions from the nam theun river in the nam ngum basin jeuland et al 2014 demonstrated that multi reservoir coordination could increase basin wide benefits from hydropower and irrigation by 3 12 relatively few basin wide modeling studies have assessed sub daily flow alteration from hydropeaking in lmb tributaries see reis et al 2015 the recent catastrophic failure of an auxiliary dam of the xe pian xe namnoy project in lao pdr illuminates the need for more dam safety assessments in the lmb ketelsen et al 2014 found that 40 of 67 lmb dams have design peak inflows lower than their 100 year floods and 11 do not even have spillways that can convey this discharge follow up studies are needed including ones that compare design floods estimated with different distributional assumptions while the safety of individual dams has been assessed e g tingsanchali and tammanee 2012 the hazards of large floods on lmb tributary cascades have not been investigated more importantly as micovic et al 2016 point out dam failure risk assessments must not only consider design inflows but also antecedent reservoir storage emergency operating rules debris blockage gate failures seismic hazards among other factors in addition few studies have examined the possible magnification of floods due to emergency releases made to avoid dam failures vattenfall power consultant ab 2008 4 4 gaps in studies of projected impacts hydrological impacts are frequently simulated within different areas of the mekong basin but basin wide projections especially ones considering other ongoing water resources developments are less frequent ostensibly due to the large modeling effort required in contrast many tributary projections do not employ sets of scenarios that isolate effects of different drivers of change more model comparison studies are also needed as our review of 3s basin projections demonstrates differences in reservoir operating rules input data study area definitions and other assumptions can inhibit these comparisons as post dam hydrological records become longer more difference in differences studies that compare simulated hydrological changes with observed ones should be carried out currently many modeling studies focus on dam impacts often without considering alternative operating rules or design choices including re regulation dams moreover many assumptions such as hydropower maximization are made when operating rules are unavailable more efforts to optimize the design and operation of individual dams cascades see bogardi and duckstein 1992 schmitt et al 2018 or dam implementation sequences in basins ziv et al 2012 grill et al 2014 jager et al 2015 could reveal mitigation opportunities flood hazards due to dam failure emergency spills multi reservoir operation reservoir induced backwater effects rubin et al 2015 and geomorphic changes also merit further research while comparing the performance of individual models lies beyond the scope of this review see kite 2001 and johnston and kummu 2012 for earlier modeling reviews our review revealed opportunities to improve some contemporary modeling practices first while summary metrics such as nash sutcliffe efficiency often facilitate quick model comparisons we strongly encourage performance indicators relevant for ecosystems and livelihoods for decision making applications also see krause et al 2005 for a cautionary note about nse second uncertainty analysis is especially critical given that short and sparse hydroclimatic records can constrain the calibration and validation of hydrological models while many recent studies are beginning to examine the effects of parameter uncertainty on streamflow simulations e g shrestha et al 2013 khoi and thom 2015 phomsouvanh et al 2016 one issue that has received less attention is the frequent attenuation of hydrological extremes in continuous simulation models e g rossi et al 2009 wang et al 2017 mohammed et al 2018b while numerous factors can contribute to this tendency including a paucity of high elevation meteorological stations rossi et al 2009 simulated streamflow time series have frequently omitted calibration residuals while the site specific consequences of this practice depend on the correlation between calibration residuals and discharge observations a large sample study outside the mekong basin farmer and vogel 2016 finds that re introducing calibration residuals into simulated time series can alleviate the attenuation of discharge variance in simulation models considering calibration residuals could be especially critical given the impacts that hydrological extremes have on livelihoods ecosystems and human safety in the basin 5 effects of concurrent environmental changes many ongoing changes in climate water use and land cover are occurring as new dams are being constructed e g hoanh et al 2010 piman et al 2013a b hoang et al 2018 mrc 2018a b building on the recent review by pokhrel et al 2018 we evaluate the extent to which these concurrent drivers of change could exacerbate or offset hydrological changes stemming from hydropower production in addition we briefly review the hydrological impacts of dam induced changes to sediment transport 5 1 climate change numerous studies e g kingston et al 2011 cook et al 2012 lauri et al 2012 thompson et al 2013 fan and he 2015 hoang et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016a wang et al 2017 have evaluated possible hydrological effects of future changes in precipitation and temperature hydrological models run with recent climate model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 projections have suggested that streamflow will increase during both the wet 8 out of 10 scenarios and dry seasons all 10 scenarios at the basin scale with the uncertainty stemming primarily from precipitation projections hoang et al 2016 in the lmb these increases in precipitation are consistent with observations from the last half century lacombe et al 2013 however these projected changes are not ubiquitous as annual flows may decrease in some tributary basins e g shrestha et al 2016b ngo et al 2018 global climate models gcms also consistently predict increases in extreme floods hirabayashi et al 2013 hoang et al 2016 perera et al 2017 while projected changes in mean annual floods are less consistent e g wang et al 2017 and observations at some mainstream stations indicate a decreasing trend delgado et al 2010 gcm projections of future droughts are also uncertain as kiem et al 2008 projected reduced streamflow drought severity due to greater precipitation whereas thilakaranthne and sridhar 2017 forecasted that greater interannual variability would worsen droughts gcms have been essential for projecting combined impacts of hydropower and climate change wang et al 2017 noted that umb reservoir storage could alleviate increased flooding along the upper lmb mainstream down to nong khai thailand where they predict flood control benefits of reservoir storage will outweigh climate driven increases in flood magnitude through 2070 however they expect increased precipitation to immediately outweigh the flood control benefits of reservoir storage further downstream a finding that hoang et al 2018 echo hoanh et al 2010 also stressed that reservoirs cannot mitigate projected climate induced flood increases as they would reduce the lmb s seasonally flooded area by less than 1 lauri et al 2012 reported that climate change could either exacerbate or offset 10 reductions in wet season flow from hydropower at kratie from 2032 to 2042 21 to 4 while many gcms predict increased dry season flows e g hoang et al 2016 even projected decreases in them are unlikely to fully offset much larger hydropower induced increases e g hoang et al 2018 other studies examining joint hydropower climate change impacts have focused on specific tributary basins in the 3s basin ngo et al 2018 predicted that climate change would partially offset increases in dry season flows from jan may offset decreases from jun jul while changes from aug dec vary by sub basin using ten gcm runs from lauri et al 2012 arias et al 2014a estimated that hydropower development may worsen climate change induced habitat losses in tonle sap lake as expanded areas of open water 32 38 along with irrigated and rain fed rice 11 21 may drastically reduce riparian forests 13 67 and other seasonally flooded habitat in other tributary basins such as the nam ou in northern lao pdr uncertain directions of change in precipitation 27 to 41 and annual streamflow 27 to 160 shrestha et al 2013 confound efforts to mitigate hydropower impacts few studies have examined whether climate induced increases in streamflow could offset flow depletion downstream of diversions or exacerbate flooding in surcharged basins phomsouvanh et al 2016 5 2 water demand historically the mekong has been one of the least irrigated basins in monsoonal asia barker and molle 2004 ringler et al 2004 haddeland et al 2006 yet higher dry season flows from hydropower can enable greater dry season irrigation withdrawals in turn these larger withdrawals are expected to offset elevated dry season flows increasingly since the largest dams have already been commissioned mrc 2011 lacombe et al 2014 documented the complementarity of hydropower and irrigation in the nam ngum tributary basin in lao pdr which differs from some other basins in the world where they directly compete with one another zeng and cai 2017 lmb irrigation may expand from 6 6 million ha in 2010 to 8 2 9 7 million ha in 2030 hoanh et al 2010 mrc 2011 including a dry season increase from 1 2 to 1 8 million ha mrc 2011 together these estimates suggest a wet season increase of 1 0 2 5 million ha note that irrigated areas are difficult to estimate partly due to the diverse forms of irrigation in the basin ringler et al 2004 pokhrel et al 2018 mrc 2018a is also developing new projections of irrigation withdrawals based on national development plans global food demand and climate change some studies project that most irrigation expansion will take place in lao pdr and cambodia where more land is available and both reservoir storage and export driven production are growing rapidly icem 2010 erban and gorelick 2016 trung et al 2018 however elevated dry season flows in the mainstream could also be diverted to northeastern thailand where irrigation infrastructure already exists molle and floch 2008 numerous long term hydropower impact studies that also consider future changes in irrigation hoanh et al 2010 mrc 2011 hoang et al 2018 estimate that dry season flow increases are smaller than the ones that only consider hydropower development e g lauri et al 2012 while tools for assessing possible irrigation withdrawals downstream of hydropower dams under different climate change scenarios have been developed e g hoang et al 2018 they do not consider reservoir operations made for irrigation purposes including reservoirs primarily dedicated to irrigation in northeastern thailand few studies have examined decreases in irrigation opportunities downstream of diversions higher dry season flows in recipient basins have motivated irrigation projects with varying success baird et al 2015 next the extent to which wet season irrigation could exacerbate dam induced reductions in wet season flow has not received as much attention even though more than 80 of all irrigated land was for wet season use in 2010 mrc 2011 warmer temperatures could further increase this demand hoanh et al 2010 mainuddin et al 2012 shrestha 2017 which could exacerbate the wet season droughts that compromise many livelihoods dependent on fisheries and floodplain agriculture hoang et al 2018 simulated evapotranspiration from hydropower enabled rice irrigation under different climate scenarios but did not report the resulting increases in irrigation demand while domestic and industrial sectors consume much less water than agriculture a doubling of the water demand by 2030 could worsen dry season droughts e g johnston et al 2010 making flow regulation from hydropower more valuable for water supply while hydropower development can provide extensive irrigation co benefits during the dry season lacombe et al 2014a rising water levels upstream of new mainstream dams and channel migration below them may require as many as half of all existing and planned pumping stations to be relocated resized and retrofitted to deal with greater daily flow fluctuations icem 2010 in contrast pokhrel et al 2018 suggest that higher dry season flows may elevate groundwater levels thereby reducing pumping costs many riverbank gardens may become permanently inundated including 54 on the mekong mainstream icem 2010 higher dry season flows may also force farmers to grow new varieties of rice fox and wood 2007 increased in irrigation withdrawals necessary for producing food to replace declining river capture fisheries see orr et al 2012 have not been assessed 5 3 land cover change numerous basin wide studies e g kite 2001 kiem et al 2008 costa cabral et al 2008 mrc 2018a b as well as ones in smaller tributary watersheds e g lacombe et al 2010 ty 2011 lacombe and pierret 2013 lacombe et al 2014b 2016 lyon et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 offer some insight regarding the extent to which changes in land cover may offset or exacerbate hydropower induced flow alteration these impacts depend on many site specific factors for instance converting a low density forest to intensive agriculture may reduce high flows shrestha et al 2017 which could exacerbate the reduction in wet season flows from hydropower however deforestation has often been associated with increased runoff due to the lower evapotranspiration of newly developed land cover e g lacombe et al 2010 lacombe and pierret 2013 lacombe et al 2016 observed that afforestation from planting or from natural regeneration had opposing effects on annual streamflow since planting especially for commercial timber tends to reduce soil infiltration capacity whereas natural regeneration increases it these site specific nuances are important to consider when examining the cumulative effects of hydropower development and land use changes on river flow variability finally it should be noted that in some cases land use policies and soil management initiatives aim to improve long term hydropower production by reducing reservoir sedimentation see arias et al 2011 and shrestha et al 2017 for mekong basin examples hydrological effects of changes in land cover stemming from economic development catalyzed by new dams such as road construction and mining also merit consideration e g shrestha et al 2016b hennig et al 2016 hoang and tran 2017 pokhrel et al 2018 orr et al 2012 estimated that livestock production areas would need to expand by 19 63 to compensate for a 40 loss in fish protein without considering livestock intensification or the expansion of aquaculture or reservoir and rice paddy fisheries however they did not spatially model this land conversion which inhibits the effects of greater livestock production from being assessed with a distributed hydrological model while possible increases in river withdrawals for rice irrigation in response to greater dry season flows have been examined see section 5 2 the effects of new rice paddies on surface runoff e g costa cabral et al 2008 homdee et al 2011 lacombe et al 2014b have not been reported in hydropower impact studies 5 4 sediment impacts dam induced flow alteration is not expected to be constant over time due to changes in sediment transport that will affect reservoir and downstream river channel capacities projected rates of reservoir sedimentation vary widely wild and loucks 2014 predicted that only 5 out of 41 3s basin reservoirs would lose more than 20 of their active storage over the next century due to their large dead storage volumes in contrast manwan dam s reservoir located in the erosion prone umb had already lost 16 7 of its active storage capacity 0 26 km3 and 75 9 of its dead storage capacity 0 66 km3 between 1993 and 2009 before xiaowan dam and erosion control projects were constructed upstream fan et al 2015 basin wide changes in sediment loads have also been examined including both the entrapment of sediment in reservoirs kummu et al 2010 wild and loucks 2014 as well as the effects of downstream sediment starvation e g kondolf et al 2014 kondolf et al 2018 li et al 2017b suggested that upstream dams have been a major driver of the net erosion the delta has experienced since 2005 mrc monitoring data indicate a dramatic reduction in suspended sediment loads following the construction of xiaowan dam when the average suspended loads at the chiang saen station in northern thailand decreased from 60 to 10 million tonnes per year mt yr an 83 reduction at pakse in lao pdr from 120 to 60 mt yr a 50 reduction and at kratie cambodia from 160 to 90 mt yr a 43 reduction piman and shrestha 2017 these observed decreases are consistent with prior modeling results kummu et al 2010 kondolf et al 2014 if all planned mekong basin dams are built the sediment load entering the delta may decrease from 51 69 kummu et al 2010 to 96 kondolf et al 2014 see wild et al 2015 for options for routing sediment through reservoirs overall more information about the interannual variability of sediment loads trapping in multi reservoir cascades e g kummu et al 2010 wild and loucks 2014 deposition in active storage zones reservoir sediment compaction and changes in upstream erosion e g shrestha et al 2013 is needed the effects of changes in channel and floodplain storage capacity downstream of dams kondolf et al 2014 rubin et al 2015 on channel floodplain connectivity kondolf et al 2018 and on flood propagation trung et al 2018 are starting to be assessed particularly along vulnerable alluvial and deltaic river reaches studies that examine both hydrological and geomorphic drivers of changing flood hazards are essential for assessing changes in floodplain water levels see slater et al 2015 for an example outside of the mekong basin 6 concluding remarks understanding hydropower induced changes to the hydrology of the mekong basin is essential for anticipating and mitigating their negative impacts although many studies have analyzed hydrological impacts of mekong hydropower dams observed and projected changes to both mainstream and tributaries flows have not been reviewed in detail while most dams with integral powerhouses are expected to regulate seasonal flow variability diversions for off stream power generation can drastically decrease downstream flows and augment flows in adjacent basins a change which prior reviews have not captured although lmb mainstream dams are often considered run of river operations they are expected to modify diurnal flow variability substantially and their effects on flood propagation are underexplored importantly these studies collectively indicate that other dam design metrics including release and diversion capacity should complement storage capacity in future assessments of the hydrological effects of mekong dams in addition flood hazards from dam failures emergency spills and inter basin transfers also require further study as does reservoir evaporation we also assess whether concurrent changes in climate water demand and land cover offset or exacerbate hydrological impacts of hydropower while some uncertainty in the direction of hydrological responses to climate change remains modeling studies increasingly suggest that both wet and dry season flows will increase in many parts of the basin under this circumstance on stream hydropower development could be increasingly important for offsetting climate change impacts during the wet season but would exacerbate them during the dry season meanwhile increased dry season flows could enable irrigation to meet growing food and export demands as allowed by land availability however fertile land flooded by new impoundments or temporarily submerged by higher river water levels may compromise many agricultural livelihoods e g riverbank gardens the combined effects of increased wet season irrigation and seasonal flow regulation could negatively impact livelihoods and ecosystems reliant upon the annual flood pulse finally joint impacts of these concurrent changes also depend on the on site vs off site nature of hydropower production for instance greater precipitation could offset diversions in donor basins but aggravate flooding in recipient basins yet comparing hydrological alteration from dams and other concurrent drivers of change is insufficient for addressing transboundary and multi sectoral tradeoffs of dam development rather integrated models featuring indirect pathways through which hydropower induces hydrological alteration such as land cover change near dams are necessary to fully examine them e g ringler et al 2004 johnston and kummu 2012 pokhrel et al 2018 in addition while flow alteration often harms riverine ecosystems poff et al 1997 ecological objectives could be integrated into dam operations to improve livelihood relevant ecological indicators beyond what hydropower operations conventionally yield sabo et al 2017 li et al 2018 indeed the uncertain ecological effects of hydropower dams further underscore the need for more quantitative relationships between flow alteration and ecological responses such assessments must untangle other drivers of ecological change such as connectivity and sediment concentrations from flow alteration e g mcmanamay et al 2013 knight et al 2014 hogan et al 2018 multi reservoir operation rules that mitigate ecological and livelihood impacts e g lacombe et al 2014a jeuland et al 2014 reis et al 2015 also merit further research as do ecological effects of dam construction sequences large investments in water resources modeling johnston and kummu 2012 naturally spark a discussion regarding our current ability to characterize hydrological impacts of dams in the mekong while some simulations have reproduced seasonal flow alteration well räsänen et al 2017 simplified representations of reservoir operating rules often make capturing shorter term fluctuations more challenging preliminary efforts to examine changes in flow predictability e g mohammed et al 2018b must be expanded to address forecasting needs for specific livelihood objectives more attention should also be paid to estimates of extreme events and sub daily flow variation given their impacts to ecosystems and livelihoods also continued efforts to compare the modeling implications of choosing different meteorological and other environmental datasets e g soil land cover is essential studies that explore how uncertainty in input variables and parameters and future conditions influence uncertainty in simulated streamflow e g shrestha et al 2016b would help assess the robustness of ecological and livelihood impact assessments protocols for updating management plans based on previous modeling efforts when new observations and or projections become available including regular assessments of flow alteration using stakeholder relevant indicators will be essential for transboundary management in addition future studies must carefully consider the extent to which flow alteration versus other impacts of dams e g connectivity sediment transport and other ongoing environmental pressures e g indiscriminate fishing jointly affect ecosystems and livelihoods in the basin finally our review offers guidance for research in other basins where extensive hydropower development is possible we especially encourage the coordination of observational and modeling studies and integration of their results when assessing dam induced flow alteration in addition studies should consider i the uncertainty associated with the limited length of available pre and post dam streamflow records which makes it challenging to distinguish hydropower impacts from climate variability ii hydrological change metrics relevant for local ecosystems and livelihoods e g dry season days when riverbank gardens are exposed or conversely when navigation is possible iii different timescales of hydrological alteration including sub daily ones iv different modes of hydropower production on stream vs off stream v impacts of inter basin transfers vi dam operations during floods and their influence on downstream flood hazards including dam failure risks vii concurrent environmental changes that might offset or exacerbate hydropower induced flow alteration viii conducting holistic assessments through integrated models featuring direct and indirect pathways through which dams can alter streamflow ix scheduling and coordination of hydropower projects to minimize basin wide impacts especially in transboundary river basins or where hydropower cascades have multiple dam operators and x assessing long term hydrological effects of reservoir sedimentation addressing these gaps would facilitate the inter sectoral and transboundary coordination needed to improve tradeoffs between hydropower production and other river management objectives
