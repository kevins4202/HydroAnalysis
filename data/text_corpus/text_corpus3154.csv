15770,the negative effects of effluent organic matter efom on receiving aquatic environments and advanced treatment facilities pose significant concerns however the effective removal of efom is challenging due to its chemically complex nature and its refractory characteristics in this study two fe ii assisted oxidation processes including uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii persulfate uv fe ii ps were investigated to promote efom reduction fe ii was essential for promoting efom degradation the mineralization rate of efom increased from 7 to 29 with 2 mm fe ii addition in the uv h2o2 process and to 23 with 0 8 mm fe ii addition in the uv ps process a preliminary experiment was conducted to obtain the optimal molar ratio of oxidant to fe ii for practical applications based on different indicators the form of fe iii prevalent at different ph values strongly affected fe ii fe iii cycling thus determining the progress of efom degradation a machine learning approach consisting of parallel factor analysis coupled with self organizing maps parafac som was employed with fluorescence spectra to visualize the degradation behavior of efom in the different reaction systems four components i e two humic like substances one fulvic acid and one tryptophan like substance were eventually identified and their reductions reached more than 62 during the fe ii assisted oxidation processes the degradation orders for each component in the different oxidation processes were initially evaluated by som analysis with f max percentage data the degradation behavior of efom in the uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps systems exhibited different trends based on the best matching unit map and component planes the humic like component was more refractory than the other three components in both oxidation processes the microbial humic like and high molecular weight fulvic acid substances showed higher reactivity with so 4 than with oh while the tryptophan like substance was more reactive in the uv fe ii h2o2 system than in the uv fe ii ps system the outcomes of this study provide new insights into the degradation behavior of efom promoting the development of advanced wastewater treatments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced wastewater treatment fe ii assisted uv aops eem parafac self organizing maps degradation order data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater reuse for landscape or ecological compensation plays a vital role in mitigating water shortages in water deficient areas generally secondary effluent is abundant in effluent organic matter efom identified as a heterogeneous mixture of natural organic matter soluble microbial products organic micropollutants and products from biological wastewater treatment michael kordatou et al 2015 many studies have reported the potential risks of efom to aquatic organisms such as genotoxicity estrogenicity and cytotoxicity du et al 2018 hu et al 2016 macova et al 2010 moreover after secondary effluent is discharged into lakes or other water bodies efom may play an important role in the carbon cycle and drive carbon emissions zhao et al 2021 therefore it is of great environmental significance to reduce the discharge of efom into water environments numerous advanced wastewater treatment processes such as coagulation cui et al 2016 biofiltration peterson and summers 2021 ozonation and advanced oxidation processes aops audenaert et al 2013 have been tested for efom reduction and oxidation processes have been shown to have many advantages when uv irradiation a frequently used disinfection process in wastewater treatment plants is coupled with oxidants such as h2o2 and persulfate ps it generates strong radicals that can degrade efom lee et al 2020 liu et al 2020 therefore uv based aops uv aops have drawn a substantial amount of attention for advanced wastewater treatment however extended reaction times generally more than 30 min are necessary to obtain satisfactory organics removal which results in large amounts of power consumption and relatively high costs qu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 noted that low levels of fe ii addition could enhance organic mineralization during uv h2o2 another study showed that fe ii addition to uv h2o2 could save 10 50 in the electrical energy required to degrade organic micropollutants qiu et al 2019 therefore the addition of fe ii could considerably shorten the reaction time of uv aops thus reducing operating costs moreover oh reacts with organics through electron transfer hydrogen abstraction or electrophilic addition while the reaction between so 4 and organics is mainly based on electron transfer reactions ahmed and chiron 2014 these differences can result in different degradation behaviors in efom during oxidation processes and these still need to be elucidated a fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem provides important information for tracking the evolution of efom in engineered aquatic systems multiple approaches for fluorescence data analysis have been proposed such as peak picking methods mcknight et al 2001 fluorescence regional integrations chen et al 2003 principal component analysis peiris et al 2010 and parallel factor analysis parafac stedmon and bro 2008 although these methods can help us quantify redundant fluorescence data processing large volumes of selected data is irrelevant and tedious with the development of interdisciplinarity machine learning approaches provide great potential for data classification regression and clustering kohonen s self organizing maps som are an artificial neural network used to illustrate geometric correlations on maps among fluorescence component data without prior knowledge or hypotheses applied to the dataset cuss and guéguen 2016 hence som could provide new ways to visualize multidimensional fluorescence data and find correlations among them thus revealing the underlying degradation behavior of efom yang et al 2019 successfully revealed the degradation behaviors of dissolved organic matter during landfill leachate treatment by coupling parafac with som parafac som which was of great significance for regulating the engineered system in addition the som approach can also produce several maps such as k means clusters and component planes which can help identify sample clustering and trends in the degradation process yu et al 2014 identified the degradation order of tryptophan like tyrosine like microbial humic like and fulvic like substances during biological processes during uv aops many factors affect the degradation of efom such as the reaction system ph changes uv irradiation intensity and chemical dosage only a limited number of studies have been conducted on the degradation behavior of efom during different oxidation processes using the som approach so visual data on the simultaneous effect of multiple factors on efom degradation is sparse in this study the evolution of efom in fe ii assisted uv aops including uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps was revealed based on fluorescence analysis coupled with a parafac som model the aims of this work were to 1 investigate the role of fe ii on uv aops for enhanced efom degradation 2 track the degradation behavior of efom during different oxidation processes and 3 expand the application of the eem parafac som model for aops to visualize fluorescence results 2 materials and methods 2 1 secondary effluent secondary effluent was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in harbin china and a detailed description can be found in our previous research chen et al 2017a the general parameters of the secondary effluent are listed in table s1 and the fluorescent features of the efom are shown in fig s1 three distinct peaks could be recognized with ex em wavelengths of 355 nm 430 nm 325 nm 420 nm and 255 nm 445 nm corresponding to humic acid like components marine humic acids and fulvic acids respectively chen et al 2003 2 2 experimental setup and procedures semi batch uv catalytic experiments were performed in a cylindrical glass reactor with a working volume of 1 l as depicted in fig s2 a low pressure hg lamp 9 w bldxbly china with a quartz sleeve was placed coaxially in the reactor using a hydrogen peroxide chemical actinometry beltran et al 1995 the average irradiance intensity i0 and effective path l were measured to be 2 37 10 6 ein l s and 1 87 cm respectively the solution was homogeneously mixed with a magnetic stirrer and circulation pump to investigate the effect of ph fe ii and oxidant concentration on efom degradation six groups of experiments were designed with different gradients fig s3 groups 1 and 4 had the same oxidants and fe ii concentrations and the initial ph of the secondary effluent was adjusted to 4 7 and 10 by 1 m hcl or naoh in groups 2 and 5 h2o2 and ps concentrations were set to 2 mm and 0 8 mm respectively and then fe ii concentration was adjusted to oxidant fe ii ratios of 1 4 and 10 in groups 3 and 6 the fe ii concentration was set to 0 2 mm and then the h2o2 or ps concentration was adjusted to oxidant fe ii ratios of 1 4 and 10 after sampling residual h2o2 was quenched with sodium sulfite while residual ps was immediately measured without quenching chen et al 2017b before measuring the ph was adjusted to 3 to prevent interferences from fe efom binding in the eem measurements aftab et al 2018 2 3 analytical methods a multi n c 2100s analyzer analytik jena germany was used to measure the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 was analyzed with a uv visible spectrophotometer t6 china and 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes residual h2o2 and ps concentrations were analyzed according to a previous report antoniou and andersen 2015 fluorescence eem was recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer jasco fp 6500 japan to prevent inner filter effects all samples were diluted to uv254 values below 0 05 cm 1 the eem noise was removed according to the following procedures i raman scatter was corrected by subtracting the eem of ultrapure water ii first order rayleigh scatter was removed using the domfluor toolbox and iii second order rayleigh scatter was limited by a 290 nm cutoff filter all fluorescence data were normalized by quinine sulfate equivalent units qsu with quinine in 0 05 m h2so4 at ex em of 350 450 nm fig s4 2 4 mathematical analysis the fluorescence eems of 81 samples sample ids presented in table s2 were analyzed using the domfluor toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 a series of parafac models containing between 3 and 7 components were generated split half analysis and random initialization were used to validate the appropriate number of components and four components were eventually extracted the relative content of the parafac components was estimated by the maximum fluorescence intensity f max after that f max coupled with doc and uv254 values were used for som training duf max som with the som and fluor somap toolboxes cuss and guéguen 2016 samples subjected to different degrees of oxidation could be visually recognized which allowed us to determine the oxidation process that was effective in degrading efom moreover fluorescence percentage data were used for som analysis f max som to track the inherent degradation behavior of efom which was obscured by concentration based differences in the duf max som model in both models the som contained a two layered artificial neural network which generated low dimensional discrete mapping by learning the data of the input layer the input vector constantly sought the best matching neuron eq 1 and adjusted the weight vector eq 2 to eventually achieve sample clustering and visualization maps 1 x m c m i n x m i 2 m i t 1 m i t α t n c t x t m i t where x is the input vector mc is the closest map vector is the euclidean distance mi t 1 is the new weight of the neuron mi t is the previous weight of the neuron α t is the learning rate and nc is the neighborhood size of the winning neuron the map quality was estimated with the mean quantization error duf max som of 0 46 f max som of 0 54 and topographical error duf max som of 0 10 f max som of 0 05 the u matrix and best matching unit bmu were used to exhibit clusters of similar samples to help distinguish the degradation behavior of efom during different oxidation processes bieroza et al 2012 the parafac and som analyses as mentioned above were performed in matlab r2014b mathworks usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 mineralization performance of efom doc removal was used to indicate the mineralization efficiency of efom by oxidation processes doc removal followed a pseudo first order kinetic model fig s5 which was consistent with our previous report chen et al 2017b however the doc concentration showed a sharp drop after fe ii addition to quantitatively describe efom degradation the mean removal of doc within 40 min under different oxidation processes was calculated fig 1 3 1 1 difference between uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps negligible doc removal 7 was observed after 40 min of photocatalytic reaction without fe ii addition which was a much lower reduction than that observed for individual organic micropollutants by uv aops qiu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 this implies that efom tends to be converted into organic products rather than being mineralized eqs 3 and 4 it is worth noting that to achieve the same doc removal more h2o2 was required 2 mm relative to ps 0 8 mm indicating that so 4 was more easily generated in uv ps than oh in uv h2o2 eqs 5 and 6 due to the higher molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield of ps than h2o2 21 1 m 1 cm 1 and 0 7 mol e 1 for ps 18 m 1 cm 1 and 0 5 mol e 1 for h2o2 luo et al 2015 this result was further confirmed by comparing the results of group 3 and group 6 in which uv ps had much higher doc removal than uv h2o2 with the addition of equimolar quantities of oxidants doc removal exhibited a significant increase after fe ii addition during the uv aops namely 7 to 29 for uv h2o2 and 7 to 23 for uv ps this promotion was primarily attributed to the fe ii activation of oxidants which generated more radicals eqs 7 and 8 wang et al 2021 moreover fe ii can transform into the nonradical species fe iv to degrade efom eqs 9 and 10 wang et al 2019 3 efom oh products 4 efom so 4 products 5 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh 6 s 2 o 8 2 hv 2 so 4 7 s 2 o 8 2 fe ii fe iii so 4 so 4 2 8 h 2 o 2 fe ii fe iii oh h 9 s 2 o 8 2 fe ii h 2 o fe iv 2 h 2 so 4 2 10 h 2 o 2 fe ii fe iv h 2 o 3 1 2 effect of ph the initial ph is an important factor affecting efom degradation during uv aops with fe ii cai et al 2021 according to the results of groups 1 and 4 fig 1 doc removal exhibited significant promotion to 42 in uv h2o2 h2o2 fe ii 2 mm and 30 in uv ps ps fe ii 0 8 mm at ph 4 fig s3 with increasing ph the efom degradation efficiency showed a distinct decrease fe ii played a key role in activating h2o2 and ps but high ph accelerated the hydrolysis precipitation of fe iii thus disrupting the formation of fe ii from fe iii in addition oh played a leading role in degrading efom and the redox potential of oh at different ph values was calculated by the nernst equation eq 11 zhang et al 2016 and is shown in table s3 in this study the redox potentials of oh at ph values of 3 7 and 10 were calculated as 2 62 v 2 39 v and 2 21 v respectively indicating that oxidation efficiency decreased with increasing ph in addition oh can react with oh to generate the weak reactive radical o redox potential 1 78 v eq 12 buxton et al 1988 a limited doc removal of 7 was obtained by uv fe ii ps at a ph of 10 because so 4 reacted with oh thus generating oh eq 13 and o eq 12 which exhibited a relatively low redox potential neta et al 1988 11 e oh h 2 o e oh h 2 o 0 0 059 ph 12 oh o h o 13 so 4 o h oh so 4 2 3 1 3 effect of fe ii concentration according to our previous study chen et al 2017b one challenge of uv aops is that oxidant utilization is not sufficient resulting in weak efom degradation fortunately fe ii addition dramatically promoted the degradation of efom when the fe ii concentration was increased from 0 2 to 2 mm in uv fe ii h2o2 doc removal increased from 11 to 29 and the same phenomenon occurred in uv fe ii ps fe ii can provide electrons directly and rapidly to attack the o o bonds in h2o2 or ps eqs 7 and 8 while uv activates o o bonds eqs 5 and 6 with short and high energy waves resulting in relatively low reaction rates chang et al 2020 fe ii can also accelerate the decomposition of oxidants and another study pointed out that excess fe ii might quench radicals leading to the attenuation of oxidation processes eqs 14 and 15 wang et al 2021 and this phenomenon can cause changes in the optimal value of the oxidants fe ii ratio 14 fe ii oh fe iii o h 15 fe ii so 4 fe iii so 4 2 3 1 4 effect of oxidant concentration generally high efom reduction is attributed to a high steady state concentration of radicals by more oxidant decomposition however doc removal declined slightly from 14 to 11 with h2o2 increase from 0 2 to 2 mm in uv fe ii h2o2 group 3 in fig 1 and the same phenomenon occurred in uv fe ii ps cai et al 2021 pointed out that excess h2o2 scavenges oh eq 16 and superfluous ps can trap so 4 and oh eqs 17 and 18 meanwhile oh and so 4 also undergo a self recombination reaction eqs 19 and 20 wang et al 2021 16 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o 17 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 s 2 o 8 so 4 2 18 s 2 o 8 2 oh s 2 o 8 o h 19 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 20 oh oh h 2 o 2 the effect of fe ii and oxidants on efom degradation may be explained by the molar ratio i e h2o2 fe ii or ps fe ii based on the results of groups 2 and 3 fig 1 doc removal decreased with h2o2 fe ii ratio increase from 1 to 10 and the same trend was observed in uv fe ii ps a recent study showed that the optimal molar ratio can vary among different types of wastewaters cai et al 2021 different evaluation indicators see uv254 and parafac components below can also result in different optimal molar ratios for the same type of wastewater 3 2 identification of efom transformation by spectroscopy 3 2 1 evolution of uv254 uv254 is widely used for indicating unsaturated bonds and aromatic chromophores in efom which are susceptible to radical attack chang et al 2020 uv254 removal increased from 35 to 43 as the h2o2 concentration increased from 0 2 h2o2 fe ii 1 to 2 mm h2o2 fe ii 10 in uv fe ii h2o2 however an optimal uv254 removal of 38 was observed with a ps concentration of 0 8 mm ps fe ii 4 in uv fe ii ps this result showed the need to experimentally verify the optimum molar ratio for applying fe ii assisted uv aops 3 2 2 fluorescence components identified by parafac fluorescence eem was a useful tool for tracking the evolution of fluorescence characteristics during uv aops and the parafac algorithm was used for decomposing the overlapping fluorescence signals of efom the number of components was verified based on residual analysis split half validation and random initialization analysis four fluorescence components were eventually extracted based on the eem dataset for all the samples fig 2 the ex em loadings of four components were compared with those in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 and the identification of the four components is shown in table s4 c1 is bimodal at ex em of 245 420 nm and 325 420 nm indicating the presence of humic like substances sharma et al 2017 c2 exhibits double peaks at ex em of 255 438 nm and 365 438 nm which are assigned to microbial humic like components yamashita et al 2010 c3 presents fluorescence peaks at ex em of 260 478 nm and 405 478 nm and was previously reported as a component of high molecular weight mw fulvic acids harjung et al 2018 c4 has maxima at ex em of 230 360 nm and 285 360 nm which originate predominantly from the source of tryptophan like organics indicating that this component may be derived from microbial activities kothawala et al 2012 the highest contribution to the total fluorescence of the secondary effluent was from humic like substances c1 43 followed by microbial humic like components c2 31 high mw fulvic acids c3 15 and tryptophan like organics c4 11 3 2 3 evolution of the parafac components the evolution of parafac components fitted well with a pseudo first order kinetic model in uv aops without fe ii addition fig s6 however f max dropped dramatically after fe ii addition figs s7 s9 so the mean value of f max reduction within 40 min was calculated fig 1 generally f max reduction was much higher than doc and uv254 reduction which is consistent with a previous report li et al 2020 low ph promoted the degradation of parafac components in both uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps for instance f max reduction increased from 63 78 to 92 97 in the uv fe ii h2o2 processes and from 65 79 to 88 96 in the uv fe ii ps processes after the ph was altered from 10 to 3 however the effects of fe ii and oxidant concentrations on parafac component removal was different from those on doc and uv254 removal to better understand the degradation trends in the parafac components the evolution of f max was calculated from a statistical perspective as shown in fig 3 based on the overall features of fig 3 ph was the main factor affecting efom degradation the residual fluorescent efom was mainly humics c1 and c2 which was because they were dominant components of efom 74 their degradation was improved with fe ii and oxidant increases during uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps processes however the degradation of c3 and c4 showed some fluctuations with increasing fe ii dosage in uv fe ii ps residual c3 first increased and then decreased while c4 showed the opposite trend when the oxidant dosage increased the residual c3 in the uv fe ii h2o2 process and c4 in the uv fe ii ps process first decreased and then increased this phenomenon informed us that the optimal dosage of oxidants and fe ii varied according to the evaluation indicator employed in addition the transformation order of each parafac component was different in the uv aops and this will be discussed subsequently by the som approach 3 2 4 results of correlation analysis generally the complete mineralization of efom is a challenging goal to reach because byproducts often remain in the system sciscenko et al 2020 correlation analysis fig 4 was performed to investigate the relationship between spectroscopy indicators and doc removal uv254 removal showed a highly positive correlation with the removal of doc r2 0 91 followed by c2 r2 0 85 c1 r2 0 84 and c3 r2 0 79 uv254 is a bulk organic indicator for all aromatic organics thus it has a strong relationship with doc similarly other studies have reported that uv254 can serve as a surrogate for doc during water treatment processes watson et al 2018 c1 and c2 account for the majority of the fluorescent efom and parafac components are more sensitive and informative in characterizing the evolution of organics therefore these help in the identification of the degradation behavior of efom during advanced wastewater treatments 3 3 som analysis 3 3 1 duf max som model som analysis is a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of fluorescent organics cuss and guéguen 2016 cuss et al 2014 applying the duf max som model facilitates a more holistic view of efom evolution fig 5 presents the basic som visualization maps such as the u matrix bmu multiple hits histogram and component planes the u matrix shows the similarity of samples in which the distance among adjacent map units is visualized by the color gradient that is higher values dark red indicate less similarity of samples fig 5a from the overall features of the bmu fig 5b the samples were scattered across the maps a combination of the u matrix and bmu enabled us to obtain more information for instance the samples se p6 p7 p8 p9 h1 and h2 showed more similar organic characteristics indicating that efom was subjected to weak perturbation during uv aops without fe ii addition most of the samples were distributed in the middle of the u matrix map indicating stable efom degradation efficiency by uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps based on k means clusters a more distinct clustering of samples with nine clusters was shown in fig s10 which represented the division of organics degradation by different effect factors i e ph fe ii and oxidant concentration for instance cluster 1 and cluster 9 were dominated by the h and p samples respectively these differences among the factors for efom degradation could be further recognized by examining a multiple hits histogram fig 5c based on six group samples fig s3 component planes are helpful features that allow us to visualize all variable distributions simultaneously the six planes exhibit an overall intensity in decreasing order from map unit 14 to unit 1 detailed map unit number in fig s10a the color changes in the doc and uv254 features were gradual from the bottom up which was related to moderate removal during the oxidation processes the c1 to c4 planes dramatically decreased from the bottom left corner to the top indicating excellent fluorescence removal by oxidation by overlaying the component planes on the bmu or the multiple hits histogram of the target samples the relative abundance of each organic indicator from the different samples could be visualized cuss and guéguen 2015 for instance the samples se and p6 in map unit 14 showed the maximum value doc and uv254 in cluster 1 were lower than those in cluster 9 however the fluorescence components exhibited the opposite trend this indicates that the doc and uv254 of the samples in cluster 1 were more sensitive to external perturbations than the fluorescence components this finding allowed us to obtain comprehensive and visual insights into the changes in bulk organic indicators during uv aops 3 3 2 f max som model the duf max som model mentioned above provides a global view of the efom degradation trends however these trends may obscure the inherent transformation behaviors of the fluorescence components by concentration based differences cuss and guéguen 2016 to track subtle changes in different parafac components during uv aops the som model was applied using f max of c1 c4 the overall bmu shows that the samples were mainly clustered into three regions fig 6 most of the h samples were located on the top while the p samples were on the bottom between these two regions a prominent transition region contained both h and p samples by overlaying the bmu and component planes the degradation order of different components could be visualized the se sample acting as the initial value for the som maps was located in the upper right corner the samples from uv aop degradation without fe ii addition e g h1 h5 and p6 p8 showed characteristics similar to the se sample for moderate removal an anomalous neuron containing samples h11 and h14 was located at the lower right corner which may have resulted from a modeling error in parafac fig s7a this phenomenon was also verified by the u matrix fig s11a in which map unit 40 was noticeably different from the other map units so it was ignored during the subsequent analysis based on the overall features of the component planes the degradation orders of the four components during the uv aops were determined and these results are summarized in table 1 the f max of the humic like substances c1 increased more in the uv fe ii h2o2 process than in the uv fe ii ps process these results indicate that humics exhibited weaker reaction activity than the other three components a global f max decline in c2 and c3 implies that microbial humics and high mw fulvic acids were reactive in uv aops and so 4 showed higher reaction activity than oh the f max of the tryptophan like component c4 decreased after uv fe ii h2o2 but increased after uv fe ii ps our previous research confirmed that so 4 is more reactive with terrestrial humic like substances but oh preferentially reacts with protein like substances chen et al 2017b moreover several studies also reported a similar phenomenon during the oxidation of efom phong et al 2016 qu et al 2021 3 4 the roles of fe ii and fe iii in efom degradation fe ii and fe iii play dominant roles in uv aops so the prevalent fe ii and fe iii species can provide us with further insights into the oxidation processes aqueous fe2 can be hydrolyzed into feoh fe oh 2 aq and fe oh 3 and these ferrous species play a key role in the uv h2o2 and uv ps processes therefore abundant radical formation so 4 or oh was induced qiu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 moreover fe ii rapidly transformed into fe iii liu et al 2021 which also showed reactivity with h2o2 or ps despite having lower efficiency than fe ii subsequently fe3 was hydrolyzed step by step in water and generated feoh2 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 aq and fe oh 4 eqs 21 24 when feo was generated eq 25 fe oh 3 s adsorbed feo forming fe oh 3 colloids eq 26 thus disrupting the fe ii fe iii cycle generally fe iii exists in three forms including precipitate i e fe oh 3 s unpolymerized species i e fe3 feoh2 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 aq and fe oh 4 and polymeride i e fe oh 3 colloid fig 7 murphy et al 1976 among all the ferrous and ferric species unpolymerized iron serves as an effective form that can activate oxidants and their distributions were calculated using visual minteq 3 1 software 21 fe iii h 2 o fe oh 2 h 22 fe iii 2 h 2 o fe oh 2 2 h 23 fe iii 3 h 2 o fe oh 3 3 h 24 fe iii 4 h 2 o fe oh 4 4 h 25 fe oh 3 h fe o 2 h 2 o 26 mfe oh 3 nfe o fe oh 3 m nfe o colloid 27 fe iii h 2 o hv f e 2 oh h 28 fe iii e aq f e 2 the initial fe2 or fe3 concentration was set to 2 mm and the distribution of ferrous and ferric species depended on the ph of the solution fig 8 according to the results in fig 1 uv aops at ph 4 showed the best performance for efom degradation wherein fe2 was the main form of ferrous ions after the reaction fe ii was transformed into fe iii and the distribution of fe iii was mainly feoh2 35 and fe oh 2 64 less fe iii transforms into fe oh 3 s at low ph therefore oh and so 4 can be maintained at relatively high steady state concentrations conversely uv photons and e aq can convert fe iii into fe ii to accelerate the iron redox cycle eqs 27 and 28 wang et al 2021 the forms of fe ii and fe iii become complex with increasing ph and more fe oh 3 s or polymeride is generated blocking the regeneration of fe ii 3 5 environmental implications the present research shows that fluorescence spectra are powerful tools for tracking the evolution of efom by parafac coupled with som analysis the subtle changes in the different fluorescence components can be recognized that is the preferential reaction of humic like substances with so 4 and protein like substances with oh can be observed this finding can be applied for guiding oxidation pretreatment prior to membrane filtration processes in which protein like substances have been recognized as the main compounds inducing membrane fouling shao et al 2014 this discovery by machine learning could serve as a powerful complement to traditional analysis measures moreover the performance of oxidant activation by uv alone is far from satisfactory fe ii plays a crucial role in accelerating oxidant decomposition during uv aops and uv also promotes the regeneration of fe iii to fe ii the ph of the solution strongly affects the forms of fe iii and fe ii so further research is needed to improve oxidation efficiency under neutral conditions overall fe ii can promote oxidant utilization and efom degradation unfortunately the complete mineralization of efom is still challenging for aops and residual organics or byproducts in reclaimed water distribution systems may cause excessive microbial regrowth and lead to health risks chen et al 2018 4 conclusions in this study the degradation behavior of efom during fe ii assisted uv aops was investigated by eem parafac som analysis the following major conclusions were drawn 1 three humic like and fulvic acid components and one tryptophan like component were identified in efom based on eem parafac they provided sensitive information for characterizing the efom 2 fe ii significantly promoted efom mineralization during uv h2o2 and uv ps at low ph the optimal molar ratio of oxidant to fe ii varied according to the evaluation indicator employed 3 parafac som analysis showed that humic like component was more refractory than the other three components during the oxidation processes microbial humic like substances and high mw fulvic acids showed higher activity with so 4 than with oh the proportion of tryptophan like substance decreased in the oh based processes but increased slightly in the so 4 based processes 4 fe ii was rapidly converted to fe iii along with oxidant decomposition in the uv aops and fe iii precipitated under neutral or alkaline conditions thus blocking the rapid fe ii regeneration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15770,the negative effects of effluent organic matter efom on receiving aquatic environments and advanced treatment facilities pose significant concerns however the effective removal of efom is challenging due to its chemically complex nature and its refractory characteristics in this study two fe ii assisted oxidation processes including uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii persulfate uv fe ii ps were investigated to promote efom reduction fe ii was essential for promoting efom degradation the mineralization rate of efom increased from 7 to 29 with 2 mm fe ii addition in the uv h2o2 process and to 23 with 0 8 mm fe ii addition in the uv ps process a preliminary experiment was conducted to obtain the optimal molar ratio of oxidant to fe ii for practical applications based on different indicators the form of fe iii prevalent at different ph values strongly affected fe ii fe iii cycling thus determining the progress of efom degradation a machine learning approach consisting of parallel factor analysis coupled with self organizing maps parafac som was employed with fluorescence spectra to visualize the degradation behavior of efom in the different reaction systems four components i e two humic like substances one fulvic acid and one tryptophan like substance were eventually identified and their reductions reached more than 62 during the fe ii assisted oxidation processes the degradation orders for each component in the different oxidation processes were initially evaluated by som analysis with f max percentage data the degradation behavior of efom in the uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps systems exhibited different trends based on the best matching unit map and component planes the humic like component was more refractory than the other three components in both oxidation processes the microbial humic like and high molecular weight fulvic acid substances showed higher reactivity with so 4 than with oh while the tryptophan like substance was more reactive in the uv fe ii h2o2 system than in the uv fe ii ps system the outcomes of this study provide new insights into the degradation behavior of efom promoting the development of advanced wastewater treatments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced wastewater treatment fe ii assisted uv aops eem parafac self organizing maps degradation order data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater reuse for landscape or ecological compensation plays a vital role in mitigating water shortages in water deficient areas generally secondary effluent is abundant in effluent organic matter efom identified as a heterogeneous mixture of natural organic matter soluble microbial products organic micropollutants and products from biological wastewater treatment michael kordatou et al 2015 many studies have reported the potential risks of efom to aquatic organisms such as genotoxicity estrogenicity and cytotoxicity du et al 2018 hu et al 2016 macova et al 2010 moreover after secondary effluent is discharged into lakes or other water bodies efom may play an important role in the carbon cycle and drive carbon emissions zhao et al 2021 therefore it is of great environmental significance to reduce the discharge of efom into water environments numerous advanced wastewater treatment processes such as coagulation cui et al 2016 biofiltration peterson and summers 2021 ozonation and advanced oxidation processes aops audenaert et al 2013 have been tested for efom reduction and oxidation processes have been shown to have many advantages when uv irradiation a frequently used disinfection process in wastewater treatment plants is coupled with oxidants such as h2o2 and persulfate ps it generates strong radicals that can degrade efom lee et al 2020 liu et al 2020 therefore uv based aops uv aops have drawn a substantial amount of attention for advanced wastewater treatment however extended reaction times generally more than 30 min are necessary to obtain satisfactory organics removal which results in large amounts of power consumption and relatively high costs qu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 noted that low levels of fe ii addition could enhance organic mineralization during uv h2o2 another study showed that fe ii addition to uv h2o2 could save 10 50 in the electrical energy required to degrade organic micropollutants qiu et al 2019 therefore the addition of fe ii could considerably shorten the reaction time of uv aops thus reducing operating costs moreover oh reacts with organics through electron transfer hydrogen abstraction or electrophilic addition while the reaction between so 4 and organics is mainly based on electron transfer reactions ahmed and chiron 2014 these differences can result in different degradation behaviors in efom during oxidation processes and these still need to be elucidated a fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem provides important information for tracking the evolution of efom in engineered aquatic systems multiple approaches for fluorescence data analysis have been proposed such as peak picking methods mcknight et al 2001 fluorescence regional integrations chen et al 2003 principal component analysis peiris et al 2010 and parallel factor analysis parafac stedmon and bro 2008 although these methods can help us quantify redundant fluorescence data processing large volumes of selected data is irrelevant and tedious with the development of interdisciplinarity machine learning approaches provide great potential for data classification regression and clustering kohonen s self organizing maps som are an artificial neural network used to illustrate geometric correlations on maps among fluorescence component data without prior knowledge or hypotheses applied to the dataset cuss and guéguen 2016 hence som could provide new ways to visualize multidimensional fluorescence data and find correlations among them thus revealing the underlying degradation behavior of efom yang et al 2019 successfully revealed the degradation behaviors of dissolved organic matter during landfill leachate treatment by coupling parafac with som parafac som which was of great significance for regulating the engineered system in addition the som approach can also produce several maps such as k means clusters and component planes which can help identify sample clustering and trends in the degradation process yu et al 2014 identified the degradation order of tryptophan like tyrosine like microbial humic like and fulvic like substances during biological processes during uv aops many factors affect the degradation of efom such as the reaction system ph changes uv irradiation intensity and chemical dosage only a limited number of studies have been conducted on the degradation behavior of efom during different oxidation processes using the som approach so visual data on the simultaneous effect of multiple factors on efom degradation is sparse in this study the evolution of efom in fe ii assisted uv aops including uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps was revealed based on fluorescence analysis coupled with a parafac som model the aims of this work were to 1 investigate the role of fe ii on uv aops for enhanced efom degradation 2 track the degradation behavior of efom during different oxidation processes and 3 expand the application of the eem parafac som model for aops to visualize fluorescence results 2 materials and methods 2 1 secondary effluent secondary effluent was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in harbin china and a detailed description can be found in our previous research chen et al 2017a the general parameters of the secondary effluent are listed in table s1 and the fluorescent features of the efom are shown in fig s1 three distinct peaks could be recognized with ex em wavelengths of 355 nm 430 nm 325 nm 420 nm and 255 nm 445 nm corresponding to humic acid like components marine humic acids and fulvic acids respectively chen et al 2003 2 2 experimental setup and procedures semi batch uv catalytic experiments were performed in a cylindrical glass reactor with a working volume of 1 l as depicted in fig s2 a low pressure hg lamp 9 w bldxbly china with a quartz sleeve was placed coaxially in the reactor using a hydrogen peroxide chemical actinometry beltran et al 1995 the average irradiance intensity i0 and effective path l were measured to be 2 37 10 6 ein l s and 1 87 cm respectively the solution was homogeneously mixed with a magnetic stirrer and circulation pump to investigate the effect of ph fe ii and oxidant concentration on efom degradation six groups of experiments were designed with different gradients fig s3 groups 1 and 4 had the same oxidants and fe ii concentrations and the initial ph of the secondary effluent was adjusted to 4 7 and 10 by 1 m hcl or naoh in groups 2 and 5 h2o2 and ps concentrations were set to 2 mm and 0 8 mm respectively and then fe ii concentration was adjusted to oxidant fe ii ratios of 1 4 and 10 in groups 3 and 6 the fe ii concentration was set to 0 2 mm and then the h2o2 or ps concentration was adjusted to oxidant fe ii ratios of 1 4 and 10 after sampling residual h2o2 was quenched with sodium sulfite while residual ps was immediately measured without quenching chen et al 2017b before measuring the ph was adjusted to 3 to prevent interferences from fe efom binding in the eem measurements aftab et al 2018 2 3 analytical methods a multi n c 2100s analyzer analytik jena germany was used to measure the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 was analyzed with a uv visible spectrophotometer t6 china and 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes residual h2o2 and ps concentrations were analyzed according to a previous report antoniou and andersen 2015 fluorescence eem was recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer jasco fp 6500 japan to prevent inner filter effects all samples were diluted to uv254 values below 0 05 cm 1 the eem noise was removed according to the following procedures i raman scatter was corrected by subtracting the eem of ultrapure water ii first order rayleigh scatter was removed using the domfluor toolbox and iii second order rayleigh scatter was limited by a 290 nm cutoff filter all fluorescence data were normalized by quinine sulfate equivalent units qsu with quinine in 0 05 m h2so4 at ex em of 350 450 nm fig s4 2 4 mathematical analysis the fluorescence eems of 81 samples sample ids presented in table s2 were analyzed using the domfluor toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 a series of parafac models containing between 3 and 7 components were generated split half analysis and random initialization were used to validate the appropriate number of components and four components were eventually extracted the relative content of the parafac components was estimated by the maximum fluorescence intensity f max after that f max coupled with doc and uv254 values were used for som training duf max som with the som and fluor somap toolboxes cuss and guéguen 2016 samples subjected to different degrees of oxidation could be visually recognized which allowed us to determine the oxidation process that was effective in degrading efom moreover fluorescence percentage data were used for som analysis f max som to track the inherent degradation behavior of efom which was obscured by concentration based differences in the duf max som model in both models the som contained a two layered artificial neural network which generated low dimensional discrete mapping by learning the data of the input layer the input vector constantly sought the best matching neuron eq 1 and adjusted the weight vector eq 2 to eventually achieve sample clustering and visualization maps 1 x m c m i n x m i 2 m i t 1 m i t α t n c t x t m i t where x is the input vector mc is the closest map vector is the euclidean distance mi t 1 is the new weight of the neuron mi t is the previous weight of the neuron α t is the learning rate and nc is the neighborhood size of the winning neuron the map quality was estimated with the mean quantization error duf max som of 0 46 f max som of 0 54 and topographical error duf max som of 0 10 f max som of 0 05 the u matrix and best matching unit bmu were used to exhibit clusters of similar samples to help distinguish the degradation behavior of efom during different oxidation processes bieroza et al 2012 the parafac and som analyses as mentioned above were performed in matlab r2014b mathworks usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 mineralization performance of efom doc removal was used to indicate the mineralization efficiency of efom by oxidation processes doc removal followed a pseudo first order kinetic model fig s5 which was consistent with our previous report chen et al 2017b however the doc concentration showed a sharp drop after fe ii addition to quantitatively describe efom degradation the mean removal of doc within 40 min under different oxidation processes was calculated fig 1 3 1 1 difference between uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps negligible doc removal 7 was observed after 40 min of photocatalytic reaction without fe ii addition which was a much lower reduction than that observed for individual organic micropollutants by uv aops qiu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 this implies that efom tends to be converted into organic products rather than being mineralized eqs 3 and 4 it is worth noting that to achieve the same doc removal more h2o2 was required 2 mm relative to ps 0 8 mm indicating that so 4 was more easily generated in uv ps than oh in uv h2o2 eqs 5 and 6 due to the higher molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield of ps than h2o2 21 1 m 1 cm 1 and 0 7 mol e 1 for ps 18 m 1 cm 1 and 0 5 mol e 1 for h2o2 luo et al 2015 this result was further confirmed by comparing the results of group 3 and group 6 in which uv ps had much higher doc removal than uv h2o2 with the addition of equimolar quantities of oxidants doc removal exhibited a significant increase after fe ii addition during the uv aops namely 7 to 29 for uv h2o2 and 7 to 23 for uv ps this promotion was primarily attributed to the fe ii activation of oxidants which generated more radicals eqs 7 and 8 wang et al 2021 moreover fe ii can transform into the nonradical species fe iv to degrade efom eqs 9 and 10 wang et al 2019 3 efom oh products 4 efom so 4 products 5 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh 6 s 2 o 8 2 hv 2 so 4 7 s 2 o 8 2 fe ii fe iii so 4 so 4 2 8 h 2 o 2 fe ii fe iii oh h 9 s 2 o 8 2 fe ii h 2 o fe iv 2 h 2 so 4 2 10 h 2 o 2 fe ii fe iv h 2 o 3 1 2 effect of ph the initial ph is an important factor affecting efom degradation during uv aops with fe ii cai et al 2021 according to the results of groups 1 and 4 fig 1 doc removal exhibited significant promotion to 42 in uv h2o2 h2o2 fe ii 2 mm and 30 in uv ps ps fe ii 0 8 mm at ph 4 fig s3 with increasing ph the efom degradation efficiency showed a distinct decrease fe ii played a key role in activating h2o2 and ps but high ph accelerated the hydrolysis precipitation of fe iii thus disrupting the formation of fe ii from fe iii in addition oh played a leading role in degrading efom and the redox potential of oh at different ph values was calculated by the nernst equation eq 11 zhang et al 2016 and is shown in table s3 in this study the redox potentials of oh at ph values of 3 7 and 10 were calculated as 2 62 v 2 39 v and 2 21 v respectively indicating that oxidation efficiency decreased with increasing ph in addition oh can react with oh to generate the weak reactive radical o redox potential 1 78 v eq 12 buxton et al 1988 a limited doc removal of 7 was obtained by uv fe ii ps at a ph of 10 because so 4 reacted with oh thus generating oh eq 13 and o eq 12 which exhibited a relatively low redox potential neta et al 1988 11 e oh h 2 o e oh h 2 o 0 0 059 ph 12 oh o h o 13 so 4 o h oh so 4 2 3 1 3 effect of fe ii concentration according to our previous study chen et al 2017b one challenge of uv aops is that oxidant utilization is not sufficient resulting in weak efom degradation fortunately fe ii addition dramatically promoted the degradation of efom when the fe ii concentration was increased from 0 2 to 2 mm in uv fe ii h2o2 doc removal increased from 11 to 29 and the same phenomenon occurred in uv fe ii ps fe ii can provide electrons directly and rapidly to attack the o o bonds in h2o2 or ps eqs 7 and 8 while uv activates o o bonds eqs 5 and 6 with short and high energy waves resulting in relatively low reaction rates chang et al 2020 fe ii can also accelerate the decomposition of oxidants and another study pointed out that excess fe ii might quench radicals leading to the attenuation of oxidation processes eqs 14 and 15 wang et al 2021 and this phenomenon can cause changes in the optimal value of the oxidants fe ii ratio 14 fe ii oh fe iii o h 15 fe ii so 4 fe iii so 4 2 3 1 4 effect of oxidant concentration generally high efom reduction is attributed to a high steady state concentration of radicals by more oxidant decomposition however doc removal declined slightly from 14 to 11 with h2o2 increase from 0 2 to 2 mm in uv fe ii h2o2 group 3 in fig 1 and the same phenomenon occurred in uv fe ii ps cai et al 2021 pointed out that excess h2o2 scavenges oh eq 16 and superfluous ps can trap so 4 and oh eqs 17 and 18 meanwhile oh and so 4 also undergo a self recombination reaction eqs 19 and 20 wang et al 2021 16 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o 17 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 s 2 o 8 so 4 2 18 s 2 o 8 2 oh s 2 o 8 o h 19 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 20 oh oh h 2 o 2 the effect of fe ii and oxidants on efom degradation may be explained by the molar ratio i e h2o2 fe ii or ps fe ii based on the results of groups 2 and 3 fig 1 doc removal decreased with h2o2 fe ii ratio increase from 1 to 10 and the same trend was observed in uv fe ii ps a recent study showed that the optimal molar ratio can vary among different types of wastewaters cai et al 2021 different evaluation indicators see uv254 and parafac components below can also result in different optimal molar ratios for the same type of wastewater 3 2 identification of efom transformation by spectroscopy 3 2 1 evolution of uv254 uv254 is widely used for indicating unsaturated bonds and aromatic chromophores in efom which are susceptible to radical attack chang et al 2020 uv254 removal increased from 35 to 43 as the h2o2 concentration increased from 0 2 h2o2 fe ii 1 to 2 mm h2o2 fe ii 10 in uv fe ii h2o2 however an optimal uv254 removal of 38 was observed with a ps concentration of 0 8 mm ps fe ii 4 in uv fe ii ps this result showed the need to experimentally verify the optimum molar ratio for applying fe ii assisted uv aops 3 2 2 fluorescence components identified by parafac fluorescence eem was a useful tool for tracking the evolution of fluorescence characteristics during uv aops and the parafac algorithm was used for decomposing the overlapping fluorescence signals of efom the number of components was verified based on residual analysis split half validation and random initialization analysis four fluorescence components were eventually extracted based on the eem dataset for all the samples fig 2 the ex em loadings of four components were compared with those in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 and the identification of the four components is shown in table s4 c1 is bimodal at ex em of 245 420 nm and 325 420 nm indicating the presence of humic like substances sharma et al 2017 c2 exhibits double peaks at ex em of 255 438 nm and 365 438 nm which are assigned to microbial humic like components yamashita et al 2010 c3 presents fluorescence peaks at ex em of 260 478 nm and 405 478 nm and was previously reported as a component of high molecular weight mw fulvic acids harjung et al 2018 c4 has maxima at ex em of 230 360 nm and 285 360 nm which originate predominantly from the source of tryptophan like organics indicating that this component may be derived from microbial activities kothawala et al 2012 the highest contribution to the total fluorescence of the secondary effluent was from humic like substances c1 43 followed by microbial humic like components c2 31 high mw fulvic acids c3 15 and tryptophan like organics c4 11 3 2 3 evolution of the parafac components the evolution of parafac components fitted well with a pseudo first order kinetic model in uv aops without fe ii addition fig s6 however f max dropped dramatically after fe ii addition figs s7 s9 so the mean value of f max reduction within 40 min was calculated fig 1 generally f max reduction was much higher than doc and uv254 reduction which is consistent with a previous report li et al 2020 low ph promoted the degradation of parafac components in both uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps for instance f max reduction increased from 63 78 to 92 97 in the uv fe ii h2o2 processes and from 65 79 to 88 96 in the uv fe ii ps processes after the ph was altered from 10 to 3 however the effects of fe ii and oxidant concentrations on parafac component removal was different from those on doc and uv254 removal to better understand the degradation trends in the parafac components the evolution of f max was calculated from a statistical perspective as shown in fig 3 based on the overall features of fig 3 ph was the main factor affecting efom degradation the residual fluorescent efom was mainly humics c1 and c2 which was because they were dominant components of efom 74 their degradation was improved with fe ii and oxidant increases during uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps processes however the degradation of c3 and c4 showed some fluctuations with increasing fe ii dosage in uv fe ii ps residual c3 first increased and then decreased while c4 showed the opposite trend when the oxidant dosage increased the residual c3 in the uv fe ii h2o2 process and c4 in the uv fe ii ps process first decreased and then increased this phenomenon informed us that the optimal dosage of oxidants and fe ii varied according to the evaluation indicator employed in addition the transformation order of each parafac component was different in the uv aops and this will be discussed subsequently by the som approach 3 2 4 results of correlation analysis generally the complete mineralization of efom is a challenging goal to reach because byproducts often remain in the system sciscenko et al 2020 correlation analysis fig 4 was performed to investigate the relationship between spectroscopy indicators and doc removal uv254 removal showed a highly positive correlation with the removal of doc r2 0 91 followed by c2 r2 0 85 c1 r2 0 84 and c3 r2 0 79 uv254 is a bulk organic indicator for all aromatic organics thus it has a strong relationship with doc similarly other studies have reported that uv254 can serve as a surrogate for doc during water treatment processes watson et al 2018 c1 and c2 account for the majority of the fluorescent efom and parafac components are more sensitive and informative in characterizing the evolution of organics therefore these help in the identification of the degradation behavior of efom during advanced wastewater treatments 3 3 som analysis 3 3 1 duf max som model som analysis is a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of fluorescent organics cuss and guéguen 2016 cuss et al 2014 applying the duf max som model facilitates a more holistic view of efom evolution fig 5 presents the basic som visualization maps such as the u matrix bmu multiple hits histogram and component planes the u matrix shows the similarity of samples in which the distance among adjacent map units is visualized by the color gradient that is higher values dark red indicate less similarity of samples fig 5a from the overall features of the bmu fig 5b the samples were scattered across the maps a combination of the u matrix and bmu enabled us to obtain more information for instance the samples se p6 p7 p8 p9 h1 and h2 showed more similar organic characteristics indicating that efom was subjected to weak perturbation during uv aops without fe ii addition most of the samples were distributed in the middle of the u matrix map indicating stable efom degradation efficiency by uv fe ii h2o2 and uv fe ii ps based on k means clusters a more distinct clustering of samples with nine clusters was shown in fig s10 which represented the division of organics degradation by different effect factors i e ph fe ii and oxidant concentration for instance cluster 1 and cluster 9 were dominated by the h and p samples respectively these differences among the factors for efom degradation could be further recognized by examining a multiple hits histogram fig 5c based on six group samples fig s3 component planes are helpful features that allow us to visualize all variable distributions simultaneously the six planes exhibit an overall intensity in decreasing order from map unit 14 to unit 1 detailed map unit number in fig s10a the color changes in the doc and uv254 features were gradual from the bottom up which was related to moderate removal during the oxidation processes the c1 to c4 planes dramatically decreased from the bottom left corner to the top indicating excellent fluorescence removal by oxidation by overlaying the component planes on the bmu or the multiple hits histogram of the target samples the relative abundance of each organic indicator from the different samples could be visualized cuss and guéguen 2015 for instance the samples se and p6 in map unit 14 showed the maximum value doc and uv254 in cluster 1 were lower than those in cluster 9 however the fluorescence components exhibited the opposite trend this indicates that the doc and uv254 of the samples in cluster 1 were more sensitive to external perturbations than the fluorescence components this finding allowed us to obtain comprehensive and visual insights into the changes in bulk organic indicators during uv aops 3 3 2 f max som model the duf max som model mentioned above provides a global view of the efom degradation trends however these trends may obscure the inherent transformation behaviors of the fluorescence components by concentration based differences cuss and guéguen 2016 to track subtle changes in different parafac components during uv aops the som model was applied using f max of c1 c4 the overall bmu shows that the samples were mainly clustered into three regions fig 6 most of the h samples were located on the top while the p samples were on the bottom between these two regions a prominent transition region contained both h and p samples by overlaying the bmu and component planes the degradation order of different components could be visualized the se sample acting as the initial value for the som maps was located in the upper right corner the samples from uv aop degradation without fe ii addition e g h1 h5 and p6 p8 showed characteristics similar to the se sample for moderate removal an anomalous neuron containing samples h11 and h14 was located at the lower right corner which may have resulted from a modeling error in parafac fig s7a this phenomenon was also verified by the u matrix fig s11a in which map unit 40 was noticeably different from the other map units so it was ignored during the subsequent analysis based on the overall features of the component planes the degradation orders of the four components during the uv aops were determined and these results are summarized in table 1 the f max of the humic like substances c1 increased more in the uv fe ii h2o2 process than in the uv fe ii ps process these results indicate that humics exhibited weaker reaction activity than the other three components a global f max decline in c2 and c3 implies that microbial humics and high mw fulvic acids were reactive in uv aops and so 4 showed higher reaction activity than oh the f max of the tryptophan like component c4 decreased after uv fe ii h2o2 but increased after uv fe ii ps our previous research confirmed that so 4 is more reactive with terrestrial humic like substances but oh preferentially reacts with protein like substances chen et al 2017b moreover several studies also reported a similar phenomenon during the oxidation of efom phong et al 2016 qu et al 2021 3 4 the roles of fe ii and fe iii in efom degradation fe ii and fe iii play dominant roles in uv aops so the prevalent fe ii and fe iii species can provide us with further insights into the oxidation processes aqueous fe2 can be hydrolyzed into feoh fe oh 2 aq and fe oh 3 and these ferrous species play a key role in the uv h2o2 and uv ps processes therefore abundant radical formation so 4 or oh was induced qiu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 moreover fe ii rapidly transformed into fe iii liu et al 2021 which also showed reactivity with h2o2 or ps despite having lower efficiency than fe ii subsequently fe3 was hydrolyzed step by step in water and generated feoh2 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 aq and fe oh 4 eqs 21 24 when feo was generated eq 25 fe oh 3 s adsorbed feo forming fe oh 3 colloids eq 26 thus disrupting the fe ii fe iii cycle generally fe iii exists in three forms including precipitate i e fe oh 3 s unpolymerized species i e fe3 feoh2 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 aq and fe oh 4 and polymeride i e fe oh 3 colloid fig 7 murphy et al 1976 among all the ferrous and ferric species unpolymerized iron serves as an effective form that can activate oxidants and their distributions were calculated using visual minteq 3 1 software 21 fe iii h 2 o fe oh 2 h 22 fe iii 2 h 2 o fe oh 2 2 h 23 fe iii 3 h 2 o fe oh 3 3 h 24 fe iii 4 h 2 o fe oh 4 4 h 25 fe oh 3 h fe o 2 h 2 o 26 mfe oh 3 nfe o fe oh 3 m nfe o colloid 27 fe iii h 2 o hv f e 2 oh h 28 fe iii e aq f e 2 the initial fe2 or fe3 concentration was set to 2 mm and the distribution of ferrous and ferric species depended on the ph of the solution fig 8 according to the results in fig 1 uv aops at ph 4 showed the best performance for efom degradation wherein fe2 was the main form of ferrous ions after the reaction fe ii was transformed into fe iii and the distribution of fe iii was mainly feoh2 35 and fe oh 2 64 less fe iii transforms into fe oh 3 s at low ph therefore oh and so 4 can be maintained at relatively high steady state concentrations conversely uv photons and e aq can convert fe iii into fe ii to accelerate the iron redox cycle eqs 27 and 28 wang et al 2021 the forms of fe ii and fe iii become complex with increasing ph and more fe oh 3 s or polymeride is generated blocking the regeneration of fe ii 3 5 environmental implications the present research shows that fluorescence spectra are powerful tools for tracking the evolution of efom by parafac coupled with som analysis the subtle changes in the different fluorescence components can be recognized that is the preferential reaction of humic like substances with so 4 and protein like substances with oh can be observed this finding can be applied for guiding oxidation pretreatment prior to membrane filtration processes in which protein like substances have been recognized as the main compounds inducing membrane fouling shao et al 2014 this discovery by machine learning could serve as a powerful complement to traditional analysis measures moreover the performance of oxidant activation by uv alone is far from satisfactory fe ii plays a crucial role in accelerating oxidant decomposition during uv aops and uv also promotes the regeneration of fe iii to fe ii the ph of the solution strongly affects the forms of fe iii and fe ii so further research is needed to improve oxidation efficiency under neutral conditions overall fe ii can promote oxidant utilization and efom degradation unfortunately the complete mineralization of efom is still challenging for aops and residual organics or byproducts in reclaimed water distribution systems may cause excessive microbial regrowth and lead to health risks chen et al 2018 4 conclusions in this study the degradation behavior of efom during fe ii assisted uv aops was investigated by eem parafac som analysis the following major conclusions were drawn 1 three humic like and fulvic acid components and one tryptophan like component were identified in efom based on eem parafac they provided sensitive information for characterizing the efom 2 fe ii significantly promoted efom mineralization during uv h2o2 and uv ps at low ph the optimal molar ratio of oxidant to fe ii varied according to the evaluation indicator employed 3 parafac som analysis showed that humic like component was more refractory than the other three components during the oxidation processes microbial humic like substances and high mw fulvic acids showed higher activity with so 4 than with oh the proportion of tryptophan like substance decreased in the oh based processes but increased slightly in the so 4 based processes 4 fe ii was rapidly converted to fe iii along with oxidant decomposition in the uv aops and fe iii precipitated under neutral or alkaline conditions thus blocking the rapid fe ii regeneration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

digestion ad has attracted a lot of attention and has become the main choice of treatment fermenting bacteria convert the organics in fw to methane and carbon dioxide as the final products through the processes of hydrolysis acidification hydrogen and acetic acid production and methanogenesis the conversion efficiency depends on the balance between fermentation and methanogenesis as well as the interaction among microorganisms due to the economic benefits related to the recovery of methane various methods have been employed to enhance the conversion efficiency of organics to methane including hydrolysis enhancement building of diet direct interspecific electron transfer and bio augmenttation wang et al 2021b ren et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 in recent years application of calcium peroxide cao2 in ad was developed to promote the conversion of organics to methane calcium peroxide cao2 is a white or yellowish crystalline powder which is considered to be an environmentally safe inorganic peroxide due to its stability and low cost it can slowly release o2 h2o2 ca oh 2 and oxygen at a controlled rate when in contact with water zhang et al 2015 which can be used in pre hydrolysis of some organic wastes being resistant to digestion wang et al 2019b pretreated the excess sludge with cao2 and found that the cao2 promoted was decomposition by releasing higher quantities of soluble organic matters for the subsequent digestive process thus increasing the cumulative methane yield tian et al 2021 used cao2 to pretreat wheat straw and enhanced the degradation of cellulose and the release of carbohydrates resulting in an improved digestive performance however the direct use of cao2 as an additive for ad has been avoided due to the potential toxicity of the oxidative agents to anaerobic microbes the suitable orp of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacterium is below 285 mv and that of methanogens is below 350 mv vongvichiankul et al 2017 khanal and huang 2003 therefore proper application of cao2 can adjust orp in anaerobic digesters create conditions suitable for facultative microorganisms and promote the growth of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacterium wang et al 2021a ping et al 2020 if the cao2 dosage is well controlled it is possible to improve the digestive efficiency by enhancing the hydrolytic acidification process to provide a more abundant intermediate for subsequent methanogenesis however the related study is still limited especially in the digester running in a semi continuous mode due to the collaboration between fermentation bacteria and methanogenic archaea maintaining high activities of archaea would improve the efficiency of methanogenesis as would the enhancement of diet through the use of exogenous conductive materials kumar et al 2021 the presence of conductive materials can build an electron bridge between syntrophic oxidation bacteria sob and hydrogenotrophic methanogens hms accelerates the transformation of electrons from sob released in fatty acids oxidation to hms and avoids the mass transfer resistance through the path of iht interspecific hydrogen transfer in previous studies different kinds of conductive materials including activated carbon ac graphite and iron oxides et al have been adopted kumar et al 2021 xu et al 2020 among them magnetite poses the most potential due to its excellent conductivity and magnetic separation characteristics the application of magnetite in promoting ad efficiency has been widely investigated wang et al 2018a showed that magnetite facilitated the establishment of diet between fermentative bacteria and methanogens and it alleviated the need for pili and c type cytochromes in diet as a result energy metabolism could be effectively used for other cellular activities since cao2 addition enhances the growth of fermentation bacteria and magnetite addition is helpful for methanogens metabolism will microbes produce different responses if they are added to ad system at the same time will the digestive efficiency be further improved under their co effects will magnetite have a positive effect on the regulation of calcium peroxide up to now there is no related report therefore this study tries to employ cao2 coupled with magnetite to regulate the digestive system by using fw as feedstock in semi continuous ad digestive performance carbon mass balance analysis enzyme activity measurement and microbial community analysis were used to improve the utilization and metabolism of organic matter metagenomic analysis was also used to clarify the internal mechanism of microorganisms in different environments results of this study may provide new insights and references for further improving ad efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 feedstock

their potential promotion effect reactors for comparison were named as r1 with 0 01 g l cao2 addition and r2 with 0 4 g l magnetite cao2 or magnetite was not added to the control group and the rest of the conditions were kept the same as in the experimental groups the dosage is referred to the previous study with slight adjustment baek et al 2017 tian et al 2021 samples were taken daily then adding

results and discussion 3 1 digestive performance 3 1 1 methane production biogas is critical to the ad process and directly reflect digestive performance the four reactors were operated continuously for 56 days and the daily methane yield is presented in fig 1 during the first 26 days the four groups ran in parallel maintaining the same olr of 2 5 g vs l d 1 with the hrt of 20 d there were large fluctuations in daily methane yield during the first 7 days of digestion after which the yield got stabilized of all experimental groups on day26 p 0 05 different additives were introduced and digestive performances were evaluated as seen in fig 1 the addition of magnetite r2 slightly improved 5 95 the methane yield with an average daily specific methane production of 353 6 ml ch4 g vs jung et al 2020 also found that the promotion of methane production by the addition of single magnetite was also not significant compared to these slight improvements the addition of cao2 r1 significantly increased the daily methane yield to 384 9 ml ch4 g vs p 0 05 with was 15 3 greater than the control digester notbaly the combination of cao2 and magnetite r3 resulted in the highest methane production with an average yield of 423 4 ml ch4 g vs which is 26 8 higher than the control to further explore the positive effects of these additives on methane production we recorded the cumulative production of methane during the first 12 h of digestion fig s1 was recorded supplementation with cao2 and or magnetite improved the methane production rate in the following order r3 r1 r2 control we also measured the total volatile fatty acid tvfa change fig s2 which is linked to methane production during the first 12 h all four reactors showed an initial increase in tvfa concentrations but the time at which the peaks appeared and the peak concentration varied r2 produced the highest tvfa concentrations peaking at 6 h of digestion verifying that the addition of magnetite can promote vfa production consistent with previous literature reports peng et al 2018 however the consumption rate of the tvfa in this digester is quite limited the peak concentration in digester r3 appeared 1 2 h after their addition and values were lower than for r1 and r2 suggesting there was a faster conversion of the intermediates into the methane after 12 h of digestion the tvfa concentrations decreased to a low level revealing that most of the organics contained in feedstock were degraded 3 1 2 organics degradation fig 2 shows the average removal rate of vs in different digesters it can be seen from the figure that the participation of these additives improves the utilization of vs the digesters in which cao2 was involved r1 and r3 showed higher removal rates of vs the vs removal rates were 84 9 83 2 85 3 and 79 1 for r1 r2 r3 and the control group respectively thus all combinations of additives improved the degradation rate of organic matter and the greatest improvement was seen with the combined use of cao2 and magnetite 3 1 3 orp variations and free radicals release orp is defined as the tendency of a solution in acquiring or losing electrons solutions with a positive orp have stronger oxidation conditions while a negative orp is indicative of a reduction environment due to the participation of cao2 which can be used as an oxidant orp in digesters would suffer fluctuation and this fluctuation was recorded and presented in fig 3 the presence of cao2 caused a rapid increase in the orp reaching peak values after 2 h followed by a gradual decline use of cao2 alone r1 resulted in a peak orp value of 466 mv which was about 20 mv increase from the orp baseline when magnetite and cao2 were used simultaneously r3 the orp increased more significantly from 485 mv to about 435 mv and dropped rapidly within 2 h after reaching the peak value these results indicate that there might by a catalytic effect of the magnetite in decomposing cao2 which accelerated the release of hydrogen peroxide as well as some oxidative free radicals such as oh and o2 and reduced the retaining time of the promoted orp compared to cao2 addition alone this kind of fast orp stimulation may be beneficial to the hydrolysis of organics and the enriching of different functional microorganisms which will be discussed in section 3 5 to verify the catalytic effect of magnetite on cao2 decomposition epr paramagnetic resonance detection was carried out the relative intensities of oh and o2 in digester r1 and r3 were measured fig 3b and c the results show that the vibration of oh in r3 is stronger than r1 while there was also a slight enhancement of the o2 vibration in r3 these results verify that the combined use of cao2 and magnetite will produce more oh in a shorter time creating a fast orp increase drop environment 3 2 carbon mass balance during ad it is desired that as much carbon contained in the feedstock can be converted to c ch4 by microorganisms as possible therefore to determine the effect of adding trace amounts of cao2 or magnetite and their combination on the carbon conversion a carbon mass balance analysis was built and the results can be found in fig 4 compared with the control digester the individual addition of cao2 and magnetite increased the carbon recovery in the form of ch4 which consisted of 27 6 and 25 2 in total these findings were also supported by improved vs removal fig 2 the simultaneous use of the cao2 and magnetite further improve the conversion of organics to the ch4 and the percentage of the c ch4 reached 31 5 for the carbon contained in digestate the contents in digester r1 r2 and r3 were 15 0 16 0 and 13 8 which was significantly lower than that of the control digester 20 7 it is known that feedstock organics in the solid form were hydrolyzed into a dissolved form that can be utilized by microorganisms so the lower content of c digestate in the presence of additives verifies that the utilization of substrates by microorganisms was enhanced in the cao2 containing digesters r1 and r3 less carbon mass was contained as biomass and intermediates especially for digester r3 a much lower content 36 4 was observed the results imply that the addition of cao2 and magnetite together enhances the degradation and utilization of substrates by microorganisms that produce ch4 and co2 and this effect was most significant in the presence of cao2 moreover synergism exists between cao2 and magnetite in the bio conversion of these organics 3 3 enzymes activity and ets to compare the metabolic activity of microorganisms in each step when adding cao2 or magnetite and their combination the enzyme activity and ets in different digesters were measured fig 5 firstly hydrolysis related enzymes including protease and α glucosaccharase were examined previous studies have shown that magnetite accelerated substrate hydrolysis and increased the hydrolase activity wang et al 2018a in the presence of magnetite alone r2 the activities of protease and α glucosaccharase were 125 and 110 of the control digester respectively further enhancement of enzyme activity was seen in the presence of cao2 r1 and r3 α glucosaccharase and protease can accelerate the transformation of solid macromolecular organic matter into small molecular organic matter for utilization by microorganisms wang et al 2022b acetokinase is the key enzyme in acetic acid production and controls the final production of acetic acid estevez canales et al 2015 the activity of acetate kinase was improved by these additives particularly in the cao2 containing digesters indicating a positive effect of electron acceptor in acetate conversion coenzyme f420 is commonly used to reflect the methanogenic activity mu et al 2011 and the combination of cao2 and magnetite r3 greatly improved its activity being about 149 of the control digester the f420 activity in r1 and r2 was 120 and 113 of the control the order of the coenzyme f420 activity was highly consistent with the results presented in section 3 1 1 ets is an indicator of metabolic activity and is related to electron transfer between cells du et al 2021 the presence of magnetite significantly enhanced the ets of the digester suggesting that magnetite improves cellular respiration the lower ets values and higher methane production efficiency in digesters r1 and r3 can be ascribed to the presence of different ecological networks in these digesters compared to the control group the ets in digester r1 with individual cao2 addition also got a promotion o2 acts as an electron acceptor in ets wang et al 2020b the reduction of o2 in nadh can release a large amount of energy which then generates a proton gradient this process can drive the synthesis of atp and the transport of other metabolites which may be the reason for the improved ets by cao2 moreover more than just facilitating the electron transfer activity the combination of cao2 and magnetite can induce more symbiotic modes among microorganisms c type cytochrome c cyts in the outer membrane of bacteria directly and indirectly participates in the process of interspecific electron transfer estevez canales et al 2015 from the figure it can be seen that cao2 addition increased the expression of c cyts previous studies have proved that oxygen containing functional groups contained on the bioelectrode surface enhanced the expression of c cyts in biofilm and thus promoted the extracellular electron transfer li et al 2019 it was also reported that appropriate oxygen addition increased the expression of c cyts in yeast burke et al 1997 cao2 provided a micro aeration environment which can reasonably explain this result however the addition of magnetite decreased the expression of c cyts this is because magnetite can replace the function of c cyts in electron transfer and thus reducing the energy demand in c cyts synthesis wang et al 2019a c cyts content in r3 was between r1 and r2 and was higher than that of the control this indicates that cao2 and magnetite play a co regulatory role on microbial energy metabolism magnetite does reduce the energy required for c cyts synthesis by microorganisms to some extent but cao2 seems to play a more dominant role as an energy regulator although enhanced ets implies enhanced efficiency of intercellular electron transfer no correlation between ets and c cyts has been demonstrated in previous literatures that is to say the microorganisms prefer the energy metabolism mode under microaerophilic environment in this process rather than the diet mode mediated by magnetite which is also confirmed in section 3 5 2 3 4 microbial community analysis microorganisms are key participants in the decomposition and utilization of organics in ad and their abundance and composition of the microorganism community dictates digestive performance thus microbial community analysis of bacteria and archaea carried out indexes of chao ace simpson shannon and coverage were used to judge the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in different digesters table 2 the index of coverage in every digester was as high as 99 indicating that almost all of otus were detected in this study according to the shannon and simpson index the individual addition of magnetite had a slight effect on the diversity of bacteria but it poses a great effect on the archaea community addition of cao2 alone or combination with magnetite reduced the diversity of microbial bacteria and archaea community indicating that the microbial bacteria population may evolve in a specific direction 3 4 1 bacterial community the taxonomic distribution of bacteria at the phylum and class level are shown in fig 6 bacteroidota firmicutes actinobacteriota synergistota and proteobacteria were the dominant phylum other studies have shown that bacteroidota and firmicutes are the main bacteria phylum ubiquitous in food waste ad system gao et al 2021 wang et al 2020a firmicutes produces extracellular enzymes such as cellulase lipase and protease which mainly play a role in the metabolism of cellulose protein lignin and lipids and are highly related to the hydrolysis of substrates zhao et al 2020 in r1 and r3 with cao2 addition firmicutes was enriched to a higher degree reaching 24 2 and 28 0 respectively and the enrichment degree in r2 also increased to 19 3 firmicutes is also a kind of facultative bacteria the micro aeration environment provided by cao2 changes flora towards the direction of higher oxygen tolerance therefore fermentation under micro aeration conditions can metabolize complex substrates which leads to a higher hydrolysis rate previous studies have also found this phenomenon duarte et al 2018 bacteroidota is responsible for the hydrolysis of carbohydrates to acetate butyrate and propionic acid luo et al 2015 its relative abundance in r1 r3 and control was 24 3 28 2 10 6 and 27 7 indicating that the combination of cao2 and magnetite altered the abundance of this bacteria the most synergistota also named synergistetes can produce short chain fatty acids and act as syntrophic acetate oxidizers rivière et al 2009 it occupies a high level in r3 with an abundance of 19 5 this high abundance would likely help to maintain a low hydrogen partial pressure in the digester consistent with the results of the higher methane production rate and the relatively lower vfa concentration within 12 h in r3 actinobacteriota can also easily decompose polysaccharides and protein substrates under anaerobic conditions zou et al 2018 in r1 and r3 with cao2 addition this phylum maintained a high abundance probacteoria decreased significantly in r1 and r3 implying it is quite sensitive to orp variation brought by cao2 decomposition the abundance of elusimicrobiota in r1 is much higher than that of r2 and r3 this phylum contains a single facultative species which has a cluster of genes for resisting oxygen stress guo et al 2021 from above results it can be concluded that the combination of cao2 and magnetite promoted both hydrolysis and vfas syntrophic oxidation 3 4 2 archaea community the relative abundance of archaea at the genus level is shown in fig 7 the main archaea in all digesters was methanosaeta followed by methanolinea accounting for 87 92 of the total archaea methanosaeta is a common archaea species that has a high affinity for acetic acid at low acetate concentration while methanolinea is a hydrogenotrophic methanogen that uses h2 to reduce co2 to produce methane xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 the abundance of methanosaeta in the control and r1 was 72 0 and 73 2 respectively which was exceeded by the magnetite participated digesters 85 2 r2 and 86 1 r3 in addition methanolinea accounted for 16 1 and 14 2 of the total archaea population in the control and r1 digester respectively while its abundance in magnetite containing digesters was 6 9 r2 and 6 1 r3 it can be inferred from above results that the addition of cao2 alone does not significantly change the archaea composition while the participation of magnetite does however the combination of cao2 and magnetite did not affect archaea abundance the enrichment of acidophilic acid methanogen and reduction of hydrogenotrophic methanogen indicate that there is a reduced dependency of the hydrogenotrophic methanogen when magnetite was present the magnetite in the digestive system built a direct connection between syntrophic oxidation bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in electron transference which reduced the yield of hydrogen for hydrogenotrophic methanogens utilization in addition the diet further promoted the syntrophic oxidation of fatty acids and more acetic acid was released which can be found in fig s1 r2 zhao et al 2020 also found that when diet was induced the energy metabolism of methanosaeta was more active in conclusion methanosaeta abundance increased and methanolinea abundance decreased moreover though the digester r2 magnetite and r3 cao2 magnetite displayed a similar distribution of archaea they showed different methane and vfas production profiles indicating that the methanogenic activities in these digesters differ which will be discussed in the following section 3 5 metagenomics analysis 3 5 1 cao2 magnetite improves the level of metabolism and utilization of organic matter to further clarify the mechanism by which bacteria and archaea enhance hydrolysis and methane production when composed to cao2 and magnetite metagenome sequencing of these microorganisms was carried out fig 8 a shows the abundance of key kegg pathways related to the ad process under different conditions the presence of these additives increased the abundance expression of most genes while the abundance promotion follows the order of r3 r1 r2 control which was consistent with the methane yield presented in fig 1 however the digester r2 presented higher methane metabolism abundance than r1 from this result we can infer that cao2 addition alone does not significantly regulate methane metabolism it could however indirectly improve methane production by enhancing both the processes of hydrolysis and acidification as observed in fig 8a the metabolism of carbohydrates e g starch sucrose glucose and pyruvate and vfas e g butanoate and propanoate are promoted genes related to vfas production in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway were further analyzed table s1 the abundance of fabg encoding gene was significantly increased in the presence of cao2 while the addition of magnetite alone showed a slight increase it is reported that fabg is related to the coding of acyl reductase which uses nad or nadp as the electron acceptor in lipid metabolism and fatty acid synthesis zhang et al 2017 moreover the combination of cao2 and magnetite also increased the abundance of fabz which is necessary for encoding hydrolase providing more small molecule substrates for fatty acid biosynthesis the gene abundance of bcca and accd6 was relatively low but they still play an important role because they are functional genes encoding acetyl coa carboxylase and they participate in producing vfas ping et al 2020 its abundance in digester r1 and r3 was significantly higher than that in the control fas encodes fatty acid synthetase and participates in organic metabolism similarly cao2 has a stronger ability to promote this gene than magnetite desa3 is related to acyl reductase kachroo et al 2006 which acts on paired donors and binds or reduces molecular oxygen directly participating in the formation of fatty acids in the micro oxygen environment created by cao2 addition the expression of this gene was more than twice that of the control these results verify the promotion of fatty acid synthesis in the presence of cao2 cao2 also increased the expression of genes related to the citric acid cycle pathway more significantly than individual use of magnetite citric acid cycle also known as tca cycle is one of the central pathways of metabolism and is responsible for oxidizing respiratory substances to generate adenosine triphosphate atp in the presence of oxygen sweetlove et al 2010 fig 8b shows the tca cycle pathway and table s7 lists the key enzymes and their expression abundance in the tca cycle the enhancement of tca cycle genes suggested that cao2 promotes the aerobic oxidation of carbohydrates furthermore the combination of cao2 and magnetite greatly enhanced the expression abundance of this pathway it can be seen from the table s2 that cao2 also strongly enhances the expression of tca cycle related modules and that is further enhanced by the combination of cao2 and magnetite the top 5 modules associated with the tca cycle were gluconeogenesis m00003 pyruvate oxidation m00307 citrate cycle m00009 the first carbon oxidation m00010 and the second carbon oxidation m00011 acetyl coa is the substrate for the tca cycle and an essential intermediate product for methane production sugar fat and protein all need to enter the tca cycle and undergo oxidative phosphorylation through acetyl coa which is completely oxidized to generate co2 and h2o and release energy for atp synthesis acetyl coa usually comes from three pathways including the degradation of ketogenic amino acids β oxidation of fatty acids and glycolysis products sweetlove et al 2010 the addition of magnetite could promote the formation of pyruvate m00001 by promoting glycolysis and the expression of all related enzymes in this metabolic process was significantly elevated table s7 pyruvate is the main precursor for acetyl coa production implying that there are more materials in r2 that can be utilized by microorganisms and converted to methane and co2 at the same time we also found that the ability of magnetite to regulate the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coa m00307 by microorganisms was difficult to improve and the expression of most enzymes in this process was similar to that of the control therefore the organic matter metabolic process in r2 was slower compared to r1 and r3 in digester r1 and r3 with cao2 addition pyruvate metabolism was strongly increased as the final product of glycolytic pathway pyruvic acid can be oxidized into acetyl coa in mitochondria and then finally to co2 and h2o to complete the aerobic oxidation and energy supply process of glucose pyruvate can also realize the mutual transformation of sugar fat and amino acids in vivo through acetyl coa and tca cycle in other words although magnetite can regulate the process of microbial metabolism of glucose to pyruvate but in the process of entering the tca cycle microbial energy supply is insufficient so the problem of metabolic retardation occurs in contrast the metabolism of organic matter was enhanced as well as the regulation of metabolic synthesis and adaptability to the micro oxygen environment especially when cao2 and magnetite were co regulated the stimulation of metabolism of microorganisms may be more intense and more organic matter is rapidly converted to pyruvate and synthesized into acetyl coa thus increasing methane production as an important component of fw protein can be transformed by hydrolysis and for subsequent amino acid metabolism another major metabolic pathway of microorganisms amino acids can be converted into pyruvic acid by deamination transamination and decarboxylation then vfa is produced through the metabolism of pyruvate in addition some amino acids can also be converted into acetyl coa which is an essential intermediate product for subsequent methane production wang et al 2022a therefore the conversion of amino acids to pyruvate or acetyl coa is highly relevant pyruvate or acetyl coa are involved in 10 amino acid metabolic pathways among which there are 6 pathways with complete conversion from amino acids to intermediate products pyruvate or acetyl coa the amino acid metabolic pathways in fig 8a include six pathways which are glycine serine and threonine metabolism ko00260 alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism ko00250 phenylalanine metabolism ko00360 lysine degradation ko00310 valine leucine and isoleucine degradation ko00280 and cysteine and methionine metabolism ko00270 the expression of these metabolic pathways in cao2 participated digesters r1 and r3 is higher than that in r2 with magnetite alone according to kegg database apart from converting amino acids into acetyl coa these pathways are also involved in pyruvate metabolism fatty acid degradation glycolysis and other processes under the action of cao2 the gene expression of these important amino acid metabolic pathways was significantly improved which is indicative of more intermediate metabolites eg acetyl coa for subsequent methane production in the ad process 3 5 2 cao2 magnetite triggers higher energy metabolism pentose phosphate pathway ppp is an important process of glucose 6 phosphate g6p metabolism to produce nadph and ribose 5 phosphate ribose 5p therefore this pathway can provide reducing power for various cell synthesis reactions such as oxidative phosphorylation rauch et al 2010 at the same time ppp can compensate and coordinate glycolysis and tca cycle supporting the regulation of the microbial community seiboth and metz 2011 the expression abundance of genes related to the oxidative phosphate pathway is listed in table s3 the data indicate that the combination of cao2 and magnetite may improve the energy metabolism of microorganisms by driving the expression of oxidative phosphate pathways in cells atp can be transformed with adp to storage and release energy thus ensuring the energy supply for all life activities of cells and its synthesis depends on the transmembrane gradient of na h zhao et al 2020 generally bacteria mainly express genes encoding f type atpase to catalyze adp to atp m00157 while archaea mainly express genes encoding v a type atpase to catalyze adp to atp m00159 bird et al 2011 magnetite and cao2 promoted the gene module encoding f type atpase but there was no significant difference in their gene abundance while the gene encoding v a type atpase shows higher abundance in the presence of cao2 therefore although cao2 can hardly change the community structure of archaea fig 7 the energy metabolism of archaea becomes more active in the micro oxygen environment than in the environment only assisted by magnetite and their combination further increases this effect oxidative phosphorylation was greatly promoted in the cao2 containing digesters fig 8a but was limited in the presence of magnetite alone it has been reported that the amount of energy produced by substrate horizontal phosphorylation in the absence of oxygen is rather limited with only four atp molecules per molecule of glucose however in aerobic conditions oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor can produce 28 additional atp molecules in each molecule of glucose through glycolysis tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation that is to say the micro oxygen environment introduced by cao2 stimulates the fermentation bacteria and the acidogenic bacterium to produce higher energy metabolism the key enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway include nadh dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome bd complex and cytochrome c oxidase which act as front end complexes and provide power for atp synthase to convert adp into atp individual cao2 addition increased the expression of all these key enzyme synthesis genes for the nadh dehydrogenase its gene abundance of r1 is significantly increased as the produced nadh tends to be reduced to nad the feedback inhibition caused by the accumulation of nadh nad ratio can be avoided thus promoting the related carbohydrate metabolism lin et al 2016 the transformation between succinic acid and fumaric acid cannot directly cause the transmembrane gradient of na h to produce atp and transfer electrons but can drive the transformation between ubiquinone uq and uqh2 and transfer na h and electrons from nadh dehydrogenase complex to cytochrome bd complex zhao et al 2020 succinate dehydrogenase is an important membrane bound enzyme in tca cycle the increase of its expression may be related to the promotion of tca cycle by cao2 which may accelerate the transport of na h and electrons in mitochondrial inner membrane thus further accelerating atp synthesis cytochrome c oxidase can reduce o2 to h2o and its increased expression in r1 means that the micro oxygen environment may stimulate higher energy metabolism interestingly addition of magnetite only increased the gene abundance of atp synthase gene while the gene expression of the four key enzymes decreased compared with the control group magnetite as an excellent conductive material can directly conduct electrons from fermentation bacteria to methanogenic archaea reducing energy consumption for electron transfer components such as cytochrome c and e pili wang et al 2018b this also explains the decrease in abundance of the cytochrome bd complex and cytochrome c oxidase furthermore it seems that magnetite can also replace part of the functions of nadh dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase and directly act as the carrier of electron transfer further reducing energy loss more interestingly the combination of magnetite and cao2 seems to make microbes more smart although magnetite also exists in r3 microorganisms seem to prefer the way of energy synthesis and metabolism assisted by cao2 and retain some ways of saving energy expenditure of magnetite because the expression of genes encoding cytochrome bd complex succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase presented significant synergistic effect of individual cao2 and magnetite moreover additives also increased the abundance of genes responsible for pyrimidine and purine metabolism which are related to cell activity wang et al 2018a especially in cao2 participated digester the abundance of msmx was greatly improved especially when cao2 is combined with magnetite which is twice of the control digester table s1 msmx is responsible for encoding atp binding protein of polysaccharide transport system which has been shown to combine atp hydrolysis with the active transport of ions sugars amino acids lipids and other substrates wilkens 2015 from above results it can be concluded that the combination of cao2 and magnetite not only improves the energy metabolism of microorganisms but also accelerates the transformation of available substances 3 5 3 cao2 magnetite stimulates the strong expression of methanogenic metabolism modules further analysis of the metagenomic sequencing results was conducted to determine the impact of cao2 and magnetite on methanogenic pathways in the metabolic pathway of methane archaea can use four methane generation modules acetic acid m00357 co2 m00567 methylamine dimethylamine trimethylamine m00563 and methanol m00356 fig 9 shows the specific pathway of methane metabolism table s4 shows the abundance of these four modules while table s5 shows the abundance of related enzymes specifically involved in metabolic pathway interestingly the addition of cao2 alone increased the expression of the m00357 module while the expression of the other three modules decreased the presence of magnetite clearly increased the expression of these four modules which was un line with the reported positive effect of magnetite on archaea additionally there is no obvious difference between the reads of r1 and control although it is less than r2 the gene abundance the methane metabolic pathway increased in the r1 digester fig 8a further indicating that cao2 does not regulate methanogenic archaea the increase in gene abundance of this metabolic pathway may be caused by the enhancement of the metabolism of bacteria that provides better interaction with methanogenic archaea it appears that the symbiotic network of bacteria and archaea moves in different directions under the micro oxygen condition introduced by cao2 in addition it seems that the combination of cao2 and magnetite compensates for the deficiency caused by cao2 addition alone further strengthening the expression of genes related to methane producing modules carbon dioxide reduction and acetate decarboxylation were the two primary methanogenic pathways but the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes for the other two methanogenic pathways was quite low table s5 acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 and acetate coa ligase ec 6 2 1 1 are the key enzymes for the conversion of acetic acid into acetyl coa acetyl coa is further converted into acetate decarboxylation pathway and acetyl coa decarboxylase synthase acds is the precursor of methane 5 methyl thmpt wang et al 2018a these enzymes are greatly improved after adding cao2 or magnetite especially in addition of cao2 the improvement is more obvious this is consistent with the results of enzyme characteristics described in section 3 3 although the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogen community in the magnetite participated digesters r1 and r3 is lower than that of r1 fig 7 the abundance of genes encoding key enzymes detected in the carbon dioxide reduction pathway is higher the most abundant enzyme is formylmethane furan dehydrogenase ec1 2 7 12 the addition of cao2 alone did not significantly increase the number of genes encoding this enzyme but the number in the magnetite participated digesters increased by more than 1 5 times higher than the control the more actively expressed genes for co2 dependent methanogenesis show that the addition of magnetite strengthens the utilization of co2 by diet through the magnetite 3 6 overall summary in summary the participation of a small amount of cao2 and magnetite in ad improved the digestive performance by improving the balance between fermentation bacterium and methanogenic archaea the cao2 created a micro aeration environment which stimulated the growth of facultative bacteria these bacteria are mainly involved in glycolysis amino acid metabolism tca cycle fatty acid metabolism pyruvate metabolism and other pathways at the same time the enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation pathway of these bacteria provides more energy for transporting and transforming organic matter and improves metabolic activity the enhanced metabolic activity of these bacteria led to the improvement of the processes of hydrolysis and acidification which induced the release of intermediates with a small molecular weight that can be utilized by methanogenic archaea under the co effect of cao2 and magnetite both bacteria and archaea showed increased metabolic activities thus accelerating the conversion of organics to methane fig 10 altogether the methane yield was significantly increased by the addition of cao2 and magnetite 26 8 higher than control though the study was still in the laboratory research stage the economic analysis results gave us confidence for potential engineering application table s7 cao2 is widely available its low price and limited dosage in ad further increase the possibility of engineering application for magnetite it can be magnetically separated from slurry and recycled compared with micro aeration microwave and heating treatments direct introduction of additives into the digesters avoided the adjustment of the digestive equipment in addition the importance of the presence of trace electron acceptors in ad should be given more attention as it appears critical in regulating the anaerobic microorganism community 4 conclusion this study employed cao2 coupled with magnetite to regulate the digestive system by using fw as feedstock in semi continuous ad the results showed that 1 the combination use of cao2 and magnetite improved the specific methane yield with the promotion ratio of 26 8 as well as the conversion rate of organics to methane 2 the activities of hydrolytic and acidogenic enzymes f420 enzymes and electron transfer were significantly enhanced the participation of cao2 and magnetite in ad enriched facultative bacteria and regulated the abundance distribution of methanogens 3 cao2 addition increased the gene expression of hydrolysis and acidogenic pathway accelerated tca cycle and strengthened energy metabolism pathway leading to the microbial adaptation and community structure optimization 4 magnetite acted as part of the electron carrier reduce the synthesis energy of some enzymes related to oxidative phosphorylation and strengthen the expression of the methane metabolism

15771,optimizing methane production from food waste fw efficiently is always a hot topic in the field of anaerobic digestion ad in this study we aimed to improve the conversion of organics to methane by using cao2 and magnetite to enhance the semi continuous ad of food waste under the organic load of 2 5 g vs l d 1 the specific methane yield was increased from 333 9 ml ch4 g vs to 423 4 ml ch4 g vs by adding 0 01 g l cao2 with 0 4 g l magnetite improving the production of methane from fw we assessed reactor performance orp changes mass balance enzyme activities and characterized the metagenomic profile of microorganisms involved in digestion these microorganisms showed rapid conversion of volatile fatty acids and increased expression of genes related to hydrolysis and acid production thus the addition of cao2 and magnetite optimized the relationship between fermentation bacteria and methanogenic archaea to enhance the overall production of methane microorganisms evolved unique adaptive mechanisms in the co operative environment of cao2 and magnetite as their energy metabolism patterns combined those controlled by individual cao2 and magnetite addition this method of combining a micro aeration environment with conductive materials provides a new perspective for optimizing the ad of fw graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion food waste calcium peroxide magnetite metagenomics 1 introduction in may 2020 atmospheric co2 concentrations reached 417 ppm which is the highest value ever recorded negri et al 2020 it is reported that 6 7 of the global greenhouse gas ghg emission from human activities is contributed by food waste fw pramanik et al 2019 slorach et al 2019 fw is organic matter with high moisture content and must be treated properly to avoid potential environmental pollution in 2020 125 million tons mt of food waste was generated in china its treatment consumed 30 1 mt oil of fossil fuels and 16 7 mt of freshwater and released 37 5 mt of co2 liu et al 2022 due to the abundance of organics contained in fw which can be converted to methane as a renewable fuel under anaerobic conditions anaerobic digestion ad has attracted a lot of attention and has become the main choice of treatment fermenting bacteria convert the organics in fw to methane and carbon dioxide as the final products through the processes of hydrolysis acidification hydrogen and acetic acid production and methanogenesis the conversion efficiency depends on the balance between fermentation and methanogenesis as well as the interaction among microorganisms due to the economic benefits related to the recovery of methane various methods have been employed to enhance the conversion efficiency of organics to methane including hydrolysis enhancement building of diet direct interspecific electron transfer and bio augmenttation wang et al 2021b ren et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 in recent years application of calcium peroxide cao2 in ad was developed to promote the conversion of organics to methane calcium peroxide cao2 is a white or yellowish crystalline powder which is considered to be an environmentally safe inorganic peroxide due to its stability and low cost it can slowly release o2 h2o2 ca oh 2 and oxygen at a controlled rate when in contact with water zhang et al 2015 which can be used in pre hydrolysis of some organic wastes being resistant to digestion wang et al 2019b pretreated the excess sludge with cao2 and found that the cao2 promoted was decomposition by releasing higher quantities of soluble organic matters for the subsequent digestive process thus increasing the cumulative methane yield tian et al 2021 used cao2 to pretreat wheat straw and enhanced the degradation of cellulose and the release of carbohydrates resulting in an improved digestive performance however the direct use of cao2 as an additive for ad has been avoided due to the potential toxicity of the oxidative agents to anaerobic microbes the suitable orp of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacterium is below 285 mv and that of methanogens is below 350 mv vongvichiankul et al 2017 khanal and huang 2003 therefore proper application of cao2 can adjust orp in anaerobic digesters create conditions suitable for facultative microorganisms and promote the growth of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacterium wang et al 2021a ping et al 2020 if the cao2 dosage is well controlled it is possible to improve the digestive efficiency by enhancing the hydrolytic acidification process to provide a more abundant intermediate for subsequent methanogenesis however the related study is still limited especially in the digester running in a semi continuous mode due to the collaboration between fermentation bacteria and methanogenic archaea maintaining high activities of archaea would improve the efficiency of methanogenesis as would the enhancement of diet through the use of exogenous conductive materials kumar et al 2021 the presence of conductive materials can build an electron bridge between syntrophic oxidation bacteria sob and hydrogenotrophic methanogens hms accelerates the transformation of electrons from sob released in fatty acids oxidation to hms and avoids the mass transfer resistance through the path of iht interspecific hydrogen transfer in previous studies different kinds of conductive materials including activated carbon ac graphite and iron oxides et al have been adopted kumar et al 2021 xu et al 2020 among them magnetite poses the most potential due to its excellent conductivity and magnetic separation characteristics the application of magnetite in promoting ad efficiency has been widely investigated wang et al 2018a showed that magnetite facilitated the establishment of diet between fermentative bacteria and methanogens and it alleviated the need for pili and c type cytochromes in diet as a result energy metabolism could be effectively used for other cellular activities since cao2 addition enhances the growth of fermentation bacteria and magnetite addition is helpful for methanogens metabolism will microbes produce different responses if they are added to ad system at the same time will the digestive efficiency be further improved under their co effects will magnetite have a positive effect on the regulation of calcium peroxide up to now there is no related report therefore this study tries to employ cao2 coupled with magnetite to regulate the digestive system by using fw as feedstock in semi continuous ad digestive performance carbon mass balance analysis enzyme activity measurement and microbial community analysis were used to improve the utilization and metabolism of organic matter metagenomic analysis was also used to clarify the internal mechanism of microorganisms in different environments results of this study may provide new insights and references for further improving ad efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 feedstock

make 2 l modular food waste inoculated sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester in tangjiatuo wastewater treatment plant in chongqing before using the inoculum it was placed at 37 c for at least 7 days so that the residual organic matter can be exhausted cao2 and micron magnetite were purchased from aladdin shanghai characteristics of the fw and the inoculated sludge are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental setup continuous stirred tank reactor cstr with a total volume of 2 l was built for this study the working volume of the reactor was 1 8 l with a headspace of 0 2 l it was equipped with a hydrothermal heating jacket to keep the temperature at 35 1 c and an orp monitoring sensor to record orp variation during digestion the digester was operated under a semi continuous feeding mode to maintain a constant hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days with the organic load rate olr of 2 5 g vs l d 1 subsequently 0 01 g l cao2 and 0 4 g l magnetite were added into the reactor r3 to examine their potential promotion effect reactors for comparison were named as r1 with 0 01 g l cao2 addition and r2 with 0 4 g l magnetite cao2 or magnetite was not added to the control group and the rest of the conditions were kept the same as in the experimental groups the dosage is referred to the previous study with slight adjustment baek et al 2017 tian et al 2021 samples were taken daily then adding fw magnetite and cao2 to the original concentration to ensure a completely anaerobic environment nitrogen was charged into the reactor for 5 min per day after feeding each experiment was repeated

results and discussion 3 1 digestive performance 3 1 1 methane production biogas is critical to the ad process and directly reflect digestive performance the four reactors were operated continuously for 56 days and the daily methane yield is presented in fig 1 during the first 26 days the four groups ran in parallel maintaining the same olr of 2 5 g vs l d 1 with the hrt of 20 d there were large fluctuations in daily methane yield during the first 7 days of digestion after which the yield got stabilized of all experimental groups on day26 p 0 05 different additives were introduced and digestive performances were evaluated as seen in fig 1 the addition of magnetite r2 slightly improved 5 95 the methane yield with an average daily specific methane production of 353 6 ml ch4 g vs jung et al 2020 also found that the promotion of methane production by the addition of single magnetite was also not significant compared to these slight improvements the addition of cao2 r1 significantly increased the daily methane yield to 384 9 ml ch4 g vs p 0 05 with was 15 3 greater than the control digester notbaly the combination of cao2 and magnetite r3 resulted in the highest methane production with an average yield of 423 4 ml ch4 g vs which is 26 8 higher than the control to further explore the positive effects of these additives on methane production we recorded the cumulative production of methane during the first 12 h of digestion fig s1 was recorded supplementation with cao2 and or magnetite improved the methane production rate in the following order r3 r1 r2 control we also measured the total volatile fatty acid tvfa change fig s2 which is linked to methane production during the first 12 h all four reactors showed an initial increase in tvfa concentrations but the time at which the peaks appeared and the peak concentration varied r2 produced the highest tvfa concentrations peaking at 6 h of digestion verifying that the addition of magnetite can promote vfa production consistent with previous literature reports peng et al 2018 however the consumption rate of the tvfa in this digester is quite limited the peak concentration in digester r3 appeared 1 2 h after their addition and values were lower than for r1 and r2 suggesting there was a faster conversion of the intermediates into the methane after 12 h of digestion the tvfa concentrations decreased to a low level revealing that most of the organics contained in feedstock were degraded 3 1 2 organics degradation fig 2 shows the average removal rate of vs in different digesters it can be seen from the figure that the participation of these additives improves the utilization of vs the digesters in which cao2 was involved r1 and r3 showed higher removal rates of vs the vs removal rates were 84 9 83 2 85 3 and 79 1 for r1 r2 r3 and the control group respectively thus all combinations of additives improved the degradation rate of organic matter and the greatest improvement was seen with the combined use of cao2 and magnetite 3 1 3 orp variations and free radicals release orp is defined as the tendency of a solution in acquiring or losing electrons solutions with a positive orp have stronger oxidation conditions while a negative orp is indicative of a reduction environment due to the participation of cao2 which can be used as an oxidant orp in digesters would suffer fluctuation and this fluctuation was recorded and presented in fig 3 the presence of cao2 caused a rapid increase in the orp reaching peak values after 2 h followed by a gradual decline use of cao2 alone r1 resulted in a peak orp value of 466 mv which was about 20 mv increase from the orp baseline when magnetite and cao2 were used simultaneously r3 the orp increased more significantly from 485 mv to about 435 mv and dropped rapidly within 2 h after reaching the peak value these results indicate that there might by a catalytic effect of the magnetite in decomposing cao2 which accelerated the release of hydrogen peroxide as well as some oxidative free radicals such as oh and o2 and reduced the retaining time of the promoted orp compared to cao2 addition alone this kind of fast orp stimulation may be beneficial to the hydrolysis of organics and the enriching of different functional microorganisms which will be discussed in section 3 5 to verify the catalytic effect of magnetite on cao2 decomposition epr paramagnetic resonance detection was carried out the relative intensities of oh and o2 in digester r1 and r3 were measured fig 3b and c the results show that the vibration of oh in r3 is stronger than r1 while there was also a slight enhancement of the o2 vibration in r3 these results verify that the combined use of cao2 and magnetite will produce more oh in a shorter time creating a fast orp increase drop environment 3 2 carbon mass balance during ad it is desired that as much carbon contained in the feedstock can be converted to c ch4 by microorganisms as possible therefore to determine the effect of adding trace amounts of cao2 or magnetite and their combination on the carbon conversion a carbon mass balance analysis was built and the results can be found in fig 4 compared with the control digester the individual addition of cao2 and magnetite increased the carbon recovery in the form of ch4 which consisted of 27 6 and 25 2 in total these findings were also supported by improved vs removal fig 2 the simultaneous use of the cao2 and magnetite further improve the conversion of organics to the ch4 and the percentage of the c ch4 reached 31 5 for the carbon contained in digestate the contents in digester r1 r2 and r3 were 15 0 16 0 and 13 8 which was significantly lower than that of the control digester 20 7 it is known that feedstock organics in the solid form were hydrolyzed into a dissolved form that can be utilized by microorganisms so the lower content of c digestate in the presence of additives verifies that the utilization of substrates by microorganisms was enhanced in the cao2 containing digesters r1 and r3 less carbon mass was contained as biomass and intermediates especially for digester r3 a much lower content 36 4 was observed the results imply that the addition of cao2 and magnetite together enhances the degradation and utilization of substrates by microorganisms that produce ch4 and co2 and this effect was most significant in the presence of cao2 moreover synergism exists between cao2 and magnetite in the bio conversion of these organics 3 3 enzymes activity and ets to compare the metabolic activity of microorganisms in each step when adding cao2 or magnetite and their combination the enzyme activity and ets in different digesters were measured fig 5 firstly hydrolysis related enzymes including protease and α glucosaccharase were examined previous studies have shown that magnetite accelerated substrate hydrolysis and increased the hydrolase activity wang et al 2018a in the presence of magnetite alone r2 the activities of protease and α glucosaccharase were 125 and 110 of the control digester respectively further enhancement of enzyme activity was seen in the presence of cao2 r1 and r3 α glucosaccharase and protease can accelerate the transformation of solid macromolecular organic matter into small molecular organic matter for utilization by microorganisms wang et al 2022b acetokinase is the key enzyme in acetic acid production and controls the final production of acetic acid estevez canales et al 2015 the activity of acetate kinase was improved by these additives particularly in the cao2 containing digesters indicating a positive effect of electron acceptor in acetate conversion coenzyme f420 is commonly used to reflect the methanogenic activity mu et al 2011 and the combination of cao2 and magnetite r3 greatly improved its activity being about 149 of the control digester the f420 activity in r1 and r2 was 120 and 113 of the control the order of the coenzyme f420 activity was highly consistent with the results presented in section 3 1 1 ets is an indicator of metabolic activity and is related to electron transfer between cells du et al 2021 the presence of magnetite significantly enhanced the ets of the digester suggesting that magnetite improves cellular respiration the lower ets values and higher methane production efficiency in digesters r1 and r3 can be ascribed to the presence of different ecological networks in these digesters compared to the control group the ets in digester r1 with individual cao2 addition also got a promotion o2 acts as an electron acceptor in ets wang et al 2020b the reduction of o2 in nadh can release a large amount of energy which then generates a proton gradient this process can drive the synthesis of atp and the transport of other metabolites which may be the reason for the improved ets by cao2 moreover more than just facilitating the electron transfer activity the combination of cao2 and magnetite can induce more symbiotic modes among microorganisms c type cytochrome c cyts in the outer membrane of bacteria directly and indirectly participates in the process of interspecific electron transfer estevez canales et al 2015 from the figure it can be seen that cao2 addition increased the expression of c cyts previous studies have proved that oxygen containing functional groups contained on the bioelectrode surface enhanced the expression of c cyts in biofilm and thus promoted the extracellular electron transfer li et al 2019 it was also reported that appropriate oxygen addition increased the expression of c cyts in yeast burke et al 1997 cao2 provided a micro aeration environment which can reasonably explain this result however the addition of magnetite decreased the expression of c cyts this is because magnetite can replace the function of c cyts in electron transfer and thus reducing the energy demand in c cyts synthesis wang et al 2019a c cyts content in r3 was between r1 and r2 and was higher than that of the control this indicates that cao2 and magnetite play a co regulatory role on microbial energy metabolism magnetite does reduce the energy required for c cyts synthesis by microorganisms to some extent but cao2 seems to play a more dominant role as an energy regulator although enhanced ets implies enhanced efficiency of intercellular electron transfer no correlation between ets and c cyts has been demonstrated in previous literatures that is to say the microorganisms prefer the energy metabolism mode under microaerophilic environment in this process rather than the diet mode mediated by magnetite which is also confirmed in section 3 5 2 3 4 microbial community analysis microorganisms are key participants in the decomposition and utilization of organics in ad and their abundance and composition of the microorganism community dictates digestive performance thus microbial community analysis of bacteria and archaea carried out indexes of chao ace simpson shannon and coverage were used to judge the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in different digesters table 2 the index of coverage in every digester was as high as 99 indicating that almost all of otus were detected in this study according to the shannon and simpson index the individual addition of magnetite had a slight effect on the diversity of bacteria but it poses a great effect on the archaea community addition of cao2 alone or combination with magnetite reduced the diversity of microbial bacteria and archaea community indicating that the microbial bacteria population may evolve in a specific direction 3 4 1 bacterial community the taxonomic distribution of bacteria at the phylum and class level are shown in fig 6 bacteroidota firmicutes actinobacteriota synergistota and proteobacteria were the dominant phylum other studies have shown that bacteroidota and firmicutes are the main bacteria phylum ubiquitous in food waste ad system gao et al 2021 wang et al 2020a firmicutes produces extracellular enzymes such as cellulase lipase and protease which mainly play a role in the metabolism of cellulose protein lignin and lipids and are highly related to the hydrolysis of substrates zhao et al 2020 in r1 and r3 with cao2 addition firmicutes was enriched to a higher degree reaching 24 2 and 28 0 respectively and the enrichment degree in r2 also increased to 19 3 firmicutes is also a kind of facultative bacteria the micro aeration environment provided by cao2 changes flora towards the direction of higher oxygen tolerance therefore fermentation under micro aeration conditions can metabolize complex substrates which leads to a higher hydrolysis rate previous studies have also found this phenomenon duarte et al 2018 bacteroidota is responsible for the hydrolysis of carbohydrates to acetate butyrate and propionic acid luo et al 2015 its relative abundance in r1 r3 and control was 24 3 28 2 10 6 and 27 7 indicating that the combination of cao2 and magnetite altered the abundance of this bacteria the most synergistota also named synergistetes can produce short chain fatty acids and act as syntrophic acetate oxidizers rivière et al 2009 it occupies a high level in r3 with an abundance of 19 5 this high abundance would likely help to maintain a low hydrogen partial pressure in the digester consistent with the results of the higher methane production rate and the relatively lower vfa concentration within 12 h in r3 actinobacteriota can also easily decompose polysaccharides and protein substrates under anaerobic conditions zou et al 2018 in r1 and r3 with cao2 addition this phylum maintained a high abundance probacteoria decreased significantly in r1 and r3 implying it is quite sensitive to orp variation brought by cao2 decomposition the abundance of elusimicrobiota in r1 is much higher than that of r2 and r3 this phylum contains a single facultative species which has a cluster of genes for resisting oxygen stress guo et al 2021 from above results it can be concluded that the combination of cao2 and magnetite promoted both hydrolysis and vfas syntrophic oxidation 3 4 2 archaea community the relative abundance of archaea at the genus level is shown in fig 7 the main archaea in all digesters was methanosaeta followed by methanolinea accounting for 87 92 of the total archaea methanosaeta is a common archaea species that has a high affinity for acetic acid at low acetate concentration while methanolinea is a hydrogenotrophic methanogen that uses h2 to reduce co2 to produce methane xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 the abundance of methanosaeta in the control and r1 was 72 0 and 73 2 respectively which was exceeded by the magnetite participated digesters 85 2 r2 and 86 1 r3 in addition methanolinea accounted for 16 1 and 14 2 of the total archaea population in the control and r1 digester respectively while its abundance in magnetite containing digesters was 6 9 r2 and 6 1 r3 it can be inferred from above results that the addition of cao2 alone does not significantly change the archaea composition while the participation of magnetite does however the combination of cao2 and magnetite did not affect archaea abundance the enrichment of acidophilic acid methanogen and reduction of hydrogenotrophic methanogen indicate that there is a reduced dependency of the hydrogenotrophic methanogen when magnetite was present the magnetite in the digestive system built a direct connection between syntrophic oxidation bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in electron transference which reduced the yield of hydrogen for hydrogenotrophic methanogens utilization in addition the diet further promoted the syntrophic oxidation of fatty acids and more acetic acid was released which can be found in fig s1 r2 zhao et al 2020 also found that when diet was induced the energy metabolism of methanosaeta was more active in conclusion methanosaeta abundance increased and methanolinea abundance decreased moreover though the digester r2 magnetite and r3 cao2 magnetite displayed a similar distribution of archaea they showed different methane and vfas production profiles indicating that the methanogenic activities in these digesters differ which will be discussed in the following section 3 5 metagenomics analysis 3 5 1 cao2 magnetite improves the level of metabolism and utilization of organic matter to further clarify the mechanism by which bacteria and archaea enhance hydrolysis and methane production when composed to cao2 and magnetite metagenome sequencing of these microorganisms was carried out fig 8 a shows the abundance of key kegg pathways related to the ad process under different conditions the presence of these additives increased the abundance expression of most genes while the abundance promotion follows the order of r3 r1 r2 control which was consistent with the methane yield presented in fig 1 however the digester r2 presented higher methane metabolism abundance than r1 from this result we can infer that cao2 addition alone does not significantly regulate methane metabolism it could however indirectly improve methane production by enhancing both the processes of hydrolysis and acidification as observed in fig 8a the metabolism of carbohydrates e g starch sucrose glucose and pyruvate and vfas e g butanoate and propanoate are promoted genes related to vfas production in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway were further analyzed table s1 the abundance of fabg encoding gene was significantly increased in the presence of cao2 while the addition of magnetite alone showed a slight increase it is reported that fabg is related to the coding of acyl reductase which uses nad or nadp as the electron acceptor in lipid metabolism and fatty acid synthesis zhang et al 2017 moreover the combination of cao2 and magnetite also increased the abundance of fabz which is necessary for encoding hydrolase providing more small molecule substrates for fatty acid biosynthesis the gene abundance of bcca and accd6 was relatively low but they still play an important role because they are functional genes encoding acetyl coa carboxylase and they participate in producing vfas ping et al 2020 its abundance in digester r1 and r3 was significantly higher than that in the control fas encodes fatty acid synthetase and participates in organic metabolism similarly cao2 has a stronger ability to promote this gene than magnetite desa3 is related to acyl reductase kachroo et al 2006 which acts on paired donors and binds or reduces molecular oxygen directly participating in the formation of fatty acids in the micro oxygen environment created by cao2 addition the expression of this gene was more than twice that of the control these results verify the promotion of fatty acid synthesis in the presence of cao2 cao2 also increased the expression of genes related to the citric acid cycle pathway more significantly than individual use of magnetite citric acid cycle also known as tca cycle is one of the central pathways of metabolism and is responsible for oxidizing respiratory substances to generate adenosine triphosphate atp in the presence of oxygen sweetlove et al 2010 fig 8b shows the tca cycle pathway and table s7 lists the key enzymes and their expression abundance in the tca cycle the enhancement of tca cycle genes suggested that cao2 promotes the aerobic oxidation of carbohydrates furthermore the combination of cao2 and magnetite greatly enhanced the expression abundance of this pathway it can be seen from the table s2 that cao2 also strongly enhances the expression of tca cycle related modules and that is further enhanced by the combination of cao2 and magnetite the top 5 modules associated with the tca cycle were gluconeogenesis m00003 pyruvate oxidation m00307 citrate cycle m00009 the first carbon oxidation m00010 and the second carbon oxidation m00011 acetyl coa is the substrate for the tca cycle and an essential intermediate product for methane production sugar fat and protein all need to enter the tca cycle and undergo oxidative phosphorylation through acetyl coa which is completely oxidized to generate co2 and h2o and release energy for atp synthesis acetyl coa usually comes from three pathways including the degradation of ketogenic amino acids β oxidation of fatty acids and glycolysis products sweetlove et al 2010 the addition of magnetite could promote the formation of pyruvate m00001 by promoting glycolysis and the expression of all related enzymes in this metabolic process was significantly elevated table s7 pyruvate is the main precursor for acetyl coa production implying that there are more materials in r2 that can be utilized by microorganisms and converted to methane and co2 at the same time we also found that the ability of magnetite to regulate the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coa m00307 by microorganisms was difficult to improve and the expression of most enzymes in this process was similar to that of the control therefore the organic matter metabolic process in r2 was slower compared to r1 and r3 in digester r1 and r3 with cao2 addition pyruvate metabolism was strongly increased as the final product of glycolytic pathway pyruvic acid can be oxidized into acetyl coa in mitochondria and then finally to co2 and h2o to complete the aerobic oxidation and energy supply process of glucose pyruvate can also realize the mutual transformation of sugar fat and amino acids in vivo through acetyl coa and tca cycle in other words although magnetite can regulate the process of microbial metabolism of glucose to pyruvate but in the process of entering the tca cycle microbial energy supply is insufficient so the problem of metabolic retardation occurs in contrast the metabolism of organic matter was enhanced as well as the regulation of metabolic synthesis and adaptability to the micro oxygen environment especially when cao2 and magnetite were co regulated the stimulation of metabolism of microorganisms may be more intense and more organic matter is rapidly converted to pyruvate and synthesized into acetyl coa thus increasing methane production as an important component of fw protein can be transformed by hydrolysis and for subsequent amino acid metabolism another major metabolic pathway of microorganisms amino acids can be converted into pyruvic acid by deamination transamination and decarboxylation then vfa is produced through the metabolism of pyruvate in addition some amino acids can also be converted into acetyl coa which is an essential intermediate product for subsequent methane production wang et al 2022a therefore the conversion of amino acids to pyruvate or acetyl coa is highly relevant pyruvate or acetyl coa are involved in 10 amino acid metabolic pathways among which there are 6 pathways with complete conversion from amino acids to intermediate products pyruvate or acetyl coa the amino acid metabolic pathways in fig 8a include six pathways which are glycine serine and threonine metabolism ko00260 alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism ko00250 phenylalanine metabolism ko00360 lysine degradation ko00310 valine leucine and isoleucine degradation ko00280 and cysteine and methionine metabolism ko00270 the expression of these metabolic pathways in cao2 participated digesters r1 and r3 is higher than that in r2 with magnetite alone according to kegg database apart from converting amino acids into acetyl coa these pathways are also involved in pyruvate metabolism fatty acid degradation glycolysis and other processes under the action of cao2 the gene expression of these important amino acid metabolic pathways was significantly improved which is indicative of more intermediate metabolites eg acetyl coa for subsequent methane production in the ad process 3 5 2 cao2 magnetite triggers higher energy metabolism pentose phosphate pathway ppp is an important process of glucose 6 phosphate g6p metabolism to produce nadph and ribose 5 phosphate ribose 5p therefore this pathway can provide reducing power for various cell synthesis reactions such as oxidative phosphorylation rauch et al 2010 at the same time ppp can compensate and coordinate glycolysis and tca cycle supporting the regulation of the microbial community seiboth and metz 2011 the expression abundance of genes related to the oxidative phosphate pathway is listed in table s3 the data indicate that the combination of cao2 and magnetite may improve the energy metabolism of microorganisms by driving the expression of oxidative phosphate pathways in cells atp can be transformed with adp to storage and release energy thus ensuring the energy supply for all life activities of cells and its synthesis depends on the transmembrane gradient of na h zhao et al 2020 generally bacteria mainly express genes encoding f type atpase to catalyze adp to atp m00157 while archaea mainly express genes encoding v a type atpase to catalyze adp to atp m00159 bird et al 2011 magnetite and cao2 promoted the gene module encoding f type atpase but there was no significant difference in their gene abundance while the gene encoding v a type atpase shows higher abundance in the presence of cao2 therefore although cao2 can hardly change the community structure of archaea fig 7 the energy metabolism of archaea becomes more active in the micro oxygen environment than in the environment only assisted by magnetite and their combination further increases this effect oxidative phosphorylation was greatly promoted in the cao2 containing digesters fig 8a but was limited in the presence of magnetite alone it has been reported that the amount of energy produced by substrate horizontal phosphorylation in the absence of oxygen is rather limited with only four atp molecules per molecule of glucose however in aerobic conditions oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor can produce 28 additional atp molecules in each molecule of glucose through glycolysis tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation that is to say the micro oxygen environment introduced by cao2 stimulates the fermentation bacteria and the acidogenic bacterium to produce higher energy metabolism the key enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway include nadh dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome bd complex and cytochrome c oxidase which act as front end complexes and provide power for atp synthase to convert adp into atp individual cao2 addition increased the expression of all these key enzyme synthesis genes for the nadh dehydrogenase its gene abundance of r1 is significantly increased as the produced nadh tends to be reduced to nad the feedback inhibition caused by the accumulation of nadh nad ratio can be avoided thus promoting the related carbohydrate metabolism lin et al 2016 the transformation between succinic acid and fumaric acid cannot directly cause the transmembrane gradient of na h to produce atp and transfer electrons but can drive the transformation between ubiquinone uq and uqh2 and transfer na h and electrons from nadh dehydrogenase complex to cytochrome bd complex zhao et al 2020 succinate dehydrogenase is an important membrane bound enzyme in tca cycle the increase of its expression may be related to the promotion of tca cycle by cao2 which may accelerate the transport of na h and electrons in mitochondrial inner membrane thus further accelerating atp synthesis cytochrome c oxidase can reduce o2 to h2o and its increased expression in r1 means that the micro oxygen environment may stimulate higher energy metabolism interestingly addition of magnetite only increased the gene abundance of atp synthase gene while the gene expression of the four key enzymes decreased compared with the control group magnetite as an excellent conductive material can directly conduct electrons from fermentation bacteria to methanogenic archaea reducing energy consumption for electron transfer components such as cytochrome c and e pili wang et al 2018b this also explains the decrease in abundance of the cytochrome bd complex and cytochrome c oxidase furthermore it seems that magnetite can also replace part of the functions of nadh dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase and directly act as the carrier of electron transfer further reducing energy loss more interestingly the combination of magnetite and cao2 seems to make microbes more smart although magnetite also exists in r3 microorganisms seem to prefer the way of energy synthesis and metabolism assisted by cao2 and retain some ways of saving energy expenditure of magnetite because the expression of genes encoding cytochrome bd complex succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase presented significant synergistic effect of individual cao2 and magnetite moreover additives also increased the abundance of genes responsible for pyrimidine and purine metabolism which are related to cell activity wang et al 2018a especially in cao2 participated digester the abundance of msmx was greatly improved especially when cao2 is combined with magnetite which is twice of the control digester table s1 msmx is responsible for encoding atp binding protein of polysaccharide transport system which has been shown to combine atp hydrolysis with the active transport of ions sugars amino acids lipids and other substrates wilkens 2015 from above results it can be concluded that the combination of cao2 and magnetite not only improves the energy metabolism of microorganisms but also accelerates the transformation of available substances 3 5 3 cao2 magnetite stimulates the strong expression of methanogenic metabolism modules further analysis of the metagenomic sequencing results was conducted to determine the impact of cao2 and magnetite on methanogenic pathways in the metabolic pathway of methane archaea can use four methane generation modules acetic acid m00357 co2 m00567 methylamine dimethylamine trimethylamine m00563 and methanol m00356 fig 9 shows the specific pathway of methane metabolism table s4 shows the abundance of these four modules while table s5 shows the abundance of related enzymes specifically involved in metabolic pathway interestingly the addition of cao2 alone increased the expression of the m00357 module while the expression of the other three modules decreased the presence of magnetite clearly increased the expression of these four modules which was un line with the reported positive effect of magnetite on archaea additionally there is no obvious difference between the reads of r1 and control although it is less than r2 the gene abundance the methane metabolic pathway increased in the r1 digester fig 8a further indicating that cao2 does not regulate methanogenic archaea the increase in gene abundance of this metabolic pathway may be caused by the enhancement of the metabolism of bacteria that provides better interaction with methanogenic archaea it appears that the symbiotic network of bacteria and archaea moves in different directions under the micro oxygen condition introduced by cao2 in addition it seems that the combination of cao2 and magnetite compensates for the deficiency caused by cao2 addition alone further strengthening the expression of genes related to methane producing modules carbon dioxide reduction and acetate decarboxylation were the two primary methanogenic pathways but the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes for the other two methanogenic pathways was quite low table s5 acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 and acetate coa ligase ec 6 2 1 1 are the key enzymes for the conversion of acetic acid into acetyl coa acetyl coa is further converted into acetate decarboxylation pathway and acetyl coa decarboxylase synthase acds is the precursor of methane 5 methyl thmpt wang et al 2018a these enzymes are greatly improved after adding cao2 or magnetite especially in addition of cao2 the improvement is more obvious this is consistent with the results of enzyme characteristics described in section 3 3 although the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogen community in the magnetite participated digesters r1 and r3 is lower than that of r1 fig 7 the abundance of genes encoding key enzymes detected in the carbon dioxide reduction pathway is higher the most abundant enzyme is formylmethane furan dehydrogenase ec1 2 7 12 the addition of cao2 alone did not significantly increase the number of genes encoding this enzyme but the number in the magnetite participated digesters increased by more than 1 5 times higher than the control the more actively expressed genes for co2 dependent methanogenesis show that the addition of magnetite strengthens the utilization of co2 by diet through the magnetite 3 6 overall summary in summary the participation of a small amount of cao2 and magnetite in ad improved the digestive performance by improving the balance between fermentation bacterium and methanogenic archaea the cao2 created a micro aeration environment which stimulated the growth of facultative bacteria these bacteria are mainly involved in glycolysis amino acid metabolism tca cycle fatty acid metabolism pyruvate metabolism and other pathways at the same time the enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation pathway of these bacteria provides more energy for transporting and transforming organic matter and improves metabolic activity the enhanced metabolic activity of these bacteria led to the improvement of the processes of hydrolysis and acidification which induced the release of intermediates with a small molecular weight that can be utilized by methanogenic archaea under the co effect of cao2 and magnetite both bacteria and archaea showed increased metabolic activities thus accelerating the conversion of organics to methane fig 10 altogether the methane yield was significantly increased by the addition of cao2 and magnetite 26 8 higher than control though the study was still in the laboratory research stage the economic analysis results gave us confidence for potential engineering application table s7 cao2 is widely available its low price and limited dosage in ad further increase the possibility of engineering application for magnetite it can be magnetically separated from slurry and recycled compared with micro aeration microwave and heating treatments direct introduction of additives into the digesters avoided the adjustment of the digestive equipment in addition the importance of the presence of trace electron acceptors in ad should be given more attention as it appears critical in regulating the anaerobic microorganism community 4 conclusion this study employed cao2 coupled with magnetite to regulate the digestive system by using fw as feedstock in semi continuous ad the results showed that 1 the combination use of cao2 and magnetite improved the specific methane yield with the promotion ratio of 26 8 as well as the conversion rate of organics to methane 2 the activities of hydrolytic and acidogenic enzymes f420 enzymes and electron transfer were significantly enhanced the participation of cao2 and magnetite in ad enriched facultative bacteria and regulated the abundance distribution of methanogens 3 cao2 addition increased the gene expression of hydrolysis and acidogenic pathway accelerated tca cycle and strengthened energy metabolism pathway leading to the microbial adaptation and community structure optimization 4 magnetite acted as part of the electron carrier reduce the synthesis energy of some enzymes related to oxidative phosphorylation and strengthen the expression of the methane metabolism pathway 5 under the co effect of magnetite and cao2 a better mutual nutrition relationship was built between bacteria and archaea declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15772,nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been extensively used for the passivation of cadmium cd or arsenic as from wastewaters while the underlying mechanisms of nzvi reaction with coexisting cd and as are largely overlooked herein the interactions of cd and as during the course of nzvi transformation and the corresponding effects on respective pollutant removal have been systematically investigated batch experiments results show that as iii addition significantly promotes the passivation of cd ii by nzvi and the removal capacity increases by 7 8 times compared to that of cd ii alone however the adsorption and oxidative transformation of as iii are barely affected under a relatively low cd ii concentration it is conducive to the adsorption of cd ii and as iii using nzvi under neutral conditions the transformation of nzvi to lepidocrocite dominates in the cd ii single system while it mainly converts to amorphous fe oxyhydroxide with the addition of as iii as iii notably reduces the surface charge of fe oxyhydroxide intermediates and to form the ternary complexes with cd fe as cd which is the predominant mechanism for the promoted cd ii passivation this work provides new understanding of nzvi transformation coupled to cd ii and as iii passivation which are likely contributing to the heavy metalloids regulation in waters and subsurface environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electron transfer iron transformation heavy metals redox chemistry subsurface environments data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large amounts of heavy metal oid s have been discharged into the environment due to the chemical industry smelting ore mining and other anthropogenic activities resulting in serious water and soil pollution problems kumarathilaka et al 2018 vareda et al 2019 for example cadmium cd and arsenic as co contamination in waters and soils poses a serious threat to food security production and the health of human beings and has become an environmental problem of worldwide concern chen et al 2018 however cd and as exhibit completely different physicochemical properties cd exists mainly as a cd2 cation whereas as usually exists in 3 and 5 oxidation states and in the form of negatively charged anions or neutral such as arsenite as iii includes h3aso3 h2aso3 haso3 2 aso3 3 while arsenate as v species are h2aso4 haso4 2 aso4 3 depending on the ph and oxygen content in the environment mohan and pittman 2007 furthermore as iii exhibits higher toxicity solubility and mobility than as v the different chemical properties of cd and as significantly increase the difficulty of their co remediation wu et al 2018 previous studies found that the coexistence of as and cd systems affect the respective adsorption behaviors compared to single cd as contamination zhao and wang 2020 honma et al 2016 thus it is necessary to understand their influence on the respective removal of the cd as coexistence system nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is a new type of environmentally friendly remediation material it has received wide attention yu et al 2019 the main advantages of nzvi are large specific surface area nano size low toxicity low cost and high activity zhao et al 2016 many studies have demonstrated that nzvi has been applicated to adsorb metal cation contaminants such as cd ii pb ii cu ii and ni ii huang et al 2013 su et al 2014 our previous research showed that nzvi is oxidized to form iron oxyhydroxide minerals under aerobic conditions which can electrostatically bind and complex with cd liu et al 2020 meanwhile nzvi also exhibits efficient adsorption properties for anion contaminants such as as iii as v li et al 2018 liu et al 2021b and cr iii cr vi liu et al 2021a xu et al 2021 on the one hand nzvi can generate iron oxyhydroxides for the removal of as iii during its corrosion process li et al 2018 on the other hand nzvi can activate oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species ros during the corrosion process such as o2 h2o2 or ho stefaniuk et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 which can convert as iii to as v deng et al 2022 thereby reducing as iii toxicity and enhancing the adsorption of as liu et al 2021b for example bhowmick and coworkers reported that the removal capacity of montmorillonite supported nzvi on as reaches 45 5 to 59 9 mg g and promotes the surface catalyzed oxidation of as iii bhowmick et al 2014 while many studies are mainly focused on the respective immobilization of cd ii or as iii by nzvi the performance of cd ii and as iii removal in the coexistence system remains unclear considering the different chemical properties of cd and as the information obtained from single cd or as systems cannot be used to fully understand the co adsorption process currently existing research finds that the performances of cd and as coexistence systems exhibit different results including synergistic and competitive effects for example li and coworkers recently reported that the coexistence of cd and as has a synergistic effect on their respective removal by ferrihydrite and high cd as ratios tend to co precipitate whereas low cd as ratios adsorption is mainly through adsorption on ferrihydrite surface li et al 2021 moreover the addition of as v can enhance the immobilization of cd ii on goethite which is mainly due to the decrease in electrostatic potential and formation of a ternary complex cd as v goethite whereas the adsorption of as v was not affected jiang et al 2013 however another study has shown that the presence of high concentration cd ii inhibits the adsorption of as iii by ferromanganese binary oxide and exhibits a competitive effect whereas the presence of as iii doubles cd ii removal capacity chen et al 2020 although there are still some debates it can summarize that the synergistic effect generally contributes to three mechanisms 1 electrostatic adsorption deng et al 2018 2 ternary surface complexes formation mendez and hiemstra 2020 and 3 surface precipitation hu et al 2015a compared to the widely understood performance and mechanisms for the simultaneous immobilization of cd ii and as iii using iron oxyhydroxides nzvi can promote the oxidation of as iii and its own phase transformation during the reaction which is more complicated however there has been no research investigating the mechanism of the interactions between cd and as and its simultaneous removal by nzvi in this study the interactions of cd ii and as iii during the course of nzvi transformation and the effects on respective removal have been systematically investigated the purpose of this work was to explore the interactions of cd ii and as iii effects on their respective removal using nzvi and the corresponding mechanism the dominant objectives of this work were as follows 1 to study the influence of the different as iii concentrations on the removal of cd ii using nzvi and the presence of different cd ii concentrations on the removal of as iii using nzvi 2 to investigate the effects of different reaction ph on the co removal of cd ii and as iii using nzvi 3 to examine the transformation products of nzvi in different reaction systems after the reaction combined with solid phase characterization analysis 4 to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the simultaneous removal of as iii and cd ii using nzvi 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of nzvi a detailed description of materials and reagents is given in the supporting information si the preparation method of nzvi refers to our previous research liu et al 2020 briefly an appropriate amount of feso4 7h2o was dissolved into a three necked flask which contains oxygen free ultrapure water after feso4 7h2o was completely dissolved excess dissolved nabh4 was added to the three necked flask and then vigorously stirred for 30 min which can reduce fe2 to fe0 the entire reaction process was conducted under an n2 atmosphere finally the prepared nzvi products were washed with excess ethanol by magnetic separation then place it in an oven for drying 60 c the prepared nzvi was stored in an anaerobic glove box for use 2 2 characterization surface morphology and structure of nzvi were observed using hitachi scanning electron microscope sem su8220 japan and jeol transmission electron microscope tem jem 2100f japan equipped with energy dispersive spectrometry eds patterns the crystal structures of nzvi after the reactions were detected by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku japan equipped with a high power cu target at 9 kw which scans from 10 to 90 2θ wss 10 mössbauer spectrometer wissel gmbh germany was used to obtain the mössbauer spectra of nzvi after the reaction was at low temperature 12 k all spectra results were calibrated against 7 μm α fe foil and mosswinn software was used to fit mössbauer spectra in addition the valence states of the nzvi surface element after the reaction were determined using thermo fischer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 250xi usa a frontier fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir frontier perkinelmer usa was used to detect the reacted nzvi functional group 2 3 batch experiments the interactions of cd ii and as iii effects on its respective removal using nzvi were estimated via adsorption experiments a 50 ml centrifuge tube was used to conduct all batch experiments and shaken at 200 rpm at room temperature nzvi dosage was 0 1 g l to study the influence of different as iii concentrations on cd ii removal using nzvi under aerobic and anaerobic conditions reaction systems under aerobic conditions were exposed to air and anaerobic conditions were performed in an anaerobic glove box the cd ii and as iii mass concentration ratios were set as 1 0 20 0 mg l 1 0 2 20 4 mg l 1 0 5 20 10 mg l 1 1 20 20 mg l and 1 3 20 60 mg l 5 mm of 4 morpholinepropanesulfonic acid mops was used to maintain the reaction solution ph at 7 0 0 1 meanwhile the influence of presence different cd ii concentration on as iii removal was studied using the same procedures and the as iii and cd ii ratios were set as 1 0 30 0 mg l 1 0 2 30 6 mg l 1 0 5 30 15 mg l 1 1 30 30 mg l 1 3 30 90 mg l to study the influence of different reaction ph the reaction solution ph was maintained at 6 7 and 8 using 5 mm mops after triggering the reaction the reaction solution was filtered through a filter 0 22 μm at sampling times of 1 5 10 20 30 60 and 120 min for cd and as analysis fe ii concentration in the solution during the reaction was analyzed simultaneously all batch experiments were set up in triplicate to better understand the removal process adsorption kinetic data were fitted with pseudo second order kinetics models 2 4 analytic methods a perkin elmer inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 8000 usa was used to determine cd ii concentration in the solution as iii and as v concentrations in the solution were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with atomic fluorescence spectroscopy kylin s12 beijing jitian instrument china uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1950 persee china was used to detect the fe ii concentrations during the reactions by the o phenanthroline colorimetric method 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced removal of cd ii by nzvi induced by as iii adsorption kinetics were used to investigate the influence of as iii on cd ii adsorption by nzvi as illustrated in fig 1 in the single cd ii reaction system the concentration of cd ii declined within 5 min and then gradually reached the reaction equilibrium the cd ii removal efficiency was only approximately 10 after the reaction fig 1a indicating that nzvi exhibited a lower removal rate for cd ii in cd ii and as iii coexistence system the concentration of cd ii decreased rapidly with the addition of as iii and this phenomenon greatly increased with the as iii concentration improving the result indicates that cd ii removal can be significantly promoted when as iii is introduced subsequently cd ii maximum removal capacity reached 189 37 mg g at cd as 1 3 which was 7 8 times that of the single cd ii system fig 1b furthermore the removal growth rate constant a from cd as 1 0 to 1 0 5 was 10 7 g l which was noticeably higher than that of 0 8 g l from cd as 1 1 to 1 3 this result indicates that the growth rate of promoting cd ii removal slows as the as iii concentration increases to better understand the adsorption process of cd ii using nzvi adsorption kinetics data fits well with the pseudo second order kinetic model r 2 0 99 liu et al 2022 fig 1c the kinetic rate constant k2 from cd as 1 0 5 to 1 3 was 0 031 0 039 g mg min higher than the 0 029 g mg min for the single cd ii reaction system table s1 this result suggests that the cd ii removal process using nzvi is the main chemisorption and the addition of as iii improves the reaction rate liang et al 2017 in addition it can be found that the cd ii removal using nzvi was ignorable with or without as iii under anaerobic conditions fig s1a because the generated ferrous iron by nzvi cannot continue to oxidize for cd ii adsorption mu et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 as illustrated in fig 1d fe ii concentration in the reaction solution increased rapidly within 5 min due to the corrosion of nzvi resulting in the release of large amounts of fe ii ions as the reaction progressed the concentration of fe ii decreased rapidly and then generated iron hydroxides for cd ii removal liu et al 2020 which can explain the results shown in fig 1a it is noteworthy that the concentration of fe ii at the first point 1 min decreased as the as iii concentration increased especially compared to the single cd ii system it can be speculated that as iii addition most likely inhibits the corrosion of nzvi thereby decreasing the fe ii release the possible reason for this is the rapid formation of fe oxyhydroxides on the surface of nzvi which hinders the release of fe ii the detailed analysis is in the following section the same reaction was carried out under anaerobic conditions fig s1b shows that fe ii concentration continued to increase with time because the production of fe ii could not be further oxidized similarly fe ii concentration declined with the addition of as iii compared with that of the single cd ii system under anaerobic conditions fig s1b this further proves that the addition of as iii reduced the corrosion of nzvi it can be concluded that the addition of as iii does not promote the corrosion of nzvi but probably improves the binding of cd ii to nzvi 3 2 as iii removal negligibly affected by cd ii fig 2 a shows the effect of different cd ii concentrations on the removal and oxidation of as iii using nzvi as iii concentration rapidly reduced within 5 min and then the concentration of as iii decreased slowly and achieved reaction equilibrium the removal rate of as iii did not obviously differ 80 90 with the mass concentration ratio of as cd from 1 0 to 1 1 as the cd ii concentration increased the as iii removal rate decreased to 67 1 for as cd 1 3 these results suggest that cd ii addition has no influence on the as iii removal using nzvi within a certain range meanwhile the change of as v concentration was also investigated the concentration of as v increased within 5 min and declined to 0 mg l after the reaction fig 2b indicating that as iii oxidation occurred simultaneously during the reaction this is because the fe ii produced by nzvi corrosion can activate o2 to generate ros such as ho o2 and directly transfer as iii to as v zhao et al 2021 subsequently both as iii and as v are adsorbed by the generated iron oxyhydroxides choudhury et al 2020 ramos et al 2009 the total removal capacity and the distribution of as species after the reaction are shown in fig 2c the percentage of as v was approximately 50 the results suggested that the oxidation rate of as iii did not significantly change as the cd ii concentration increased compared to aerobic conditions the concentration of as iii did not change during the reaction under anaerobic conditions fig s2a this result suggests that nzvi has no adsorption or oxidation capacity for as iii because the generated fe ii cannot be further oxidized to form secondary iron oxyhydroxides the changing trend of the fe ii concentration was similar to that shown in fig 1d the fe ii concentration in the solution increased rapidly within 5 min and then decreased to 0 mg l fig 2d moreover the concentration of fe ii gradually declined with the addition of cd ii this phenomenon also shows that cd ii addition reduced the corrosion of nzvi fig s2b shows that fe ii concentration improved with time under anaerobic conditions what is more the concentration of fe ii was reduced with cd ii addition compared to that of the single as iii system under anaerobic conditions fig s2b further illustrating that cd ii presence inhibits the corrosion of nzvi once the corrosion process of nzvi is significantly inhibited it can also affect the as iii adsorption and oxidation which can also explain the decline of as iii removal rate when the as cd was improved to 1 3 3 3 ph effects on the interactive removal of as iii and cd ii solution ph is a dominant factor that affects the surface charge and corrosion of nzvi the influence of reaction ph was conducted as depicted in fig 3 a and b cd ii and as iii concentrations declined rapidly within 10 min and then reached equilibrium however the removal efficiencies of cd ii and as iii at ph 7 were higher than those at ph values of 6 and 8 at ph 6 protons in the solution can compete with cd ii for surface adsorption sites moreover the point of nzvi zero charges has been reported to be approximately at ph 7 wen et al 2014 accordingly the surface of nzvi under acidic conditions is positively charged resulting in an electrostatic repulsive effect of cd ii and making it difficult to adsorb cd ii through electrostatic bonding li et al 2018 nevertheless the as iii removal rate decreasing is probably due to the form of as iii being neutral specie below ph 9 3 which cannot directly promote the removal of as iii by electrostatic bonding in acidic conditions baig et al 2015 moreover another reason is that the reduction of the cd ii removal rate may affect the removal of arsenic at ph 8 the surface of nzvi in solution forms an iron hydroxide passive film under alkaline conditions which can inhibit the corrosion of nzvi and fe ii production eljamal et al 2018 the formation of an iron hydroxide passive film reduces the number of adsorption sites which prevents further contact of nzvi with as iii and cd ii su et al 2016 moreover increasing deprotonation of nzvi occurs with increasing ph which leads to a negative charge on the surface of the material which is not conducive to the as iii adsorption wen et al 2014 3 4 the distinct structure transformations of nzvi modulated by as iii and cd ii xps xrd and mössbauer spectra were selected to analyze the transformation of nzvi fig 4 shows the detailed fe 2p survey spectra of the nzvi surface after reaction in different systems which are able to convolute into fe ii and fe iii species the peak at 706 9 ev corresponds to fe0 singh et al 2021 in different systems fe0 disappeared and the surface of nzvi was mainly fe iii species 68 8 85 7 this result confirms that the surface of nzvi has been oxidized after the reactions however the percentage of fe ii species 22 6 31 2 in the single cd ii as iii reaction system was higher than that in the coexistence system which is in line with the results of fe ii release fig 1d this is mainly because the coexistence of cd ii and as iii inhibits the corrosion of nzvi resulting in the reduction of fe ii release on the surface structural fe ii of nzvi meanwhile the concentration of fe ii decreased in the as iii and cd ii coexistence systems indicating that as iii and cd ii addition could regulate the transformation products of nzvi during the reaction process the xrd patterns of nzvi after reactions in different systems are illustrated in fig 5 a for the single cd system multiple characteristic peaks were observed which were in line with the xrd standard pattern of lepidocrocite these results suggest that the main transformation product of nzvi is lepidocrocite in the single cd ii system liu and coworkers reported that the main product from the oxidation of nzvi in oxygenated water is lepidocrocite liu et al 2014 it can infer that the addition of cd ii does not affect the transformation of nzvi in contrast the peak of lepidocrocite disappears in the cd ii and as iii coexistence system which only has the characteristic peaks of fe0 and is similar to the single as iii reaction system fig 5a it suggests that as iii addition has a significant influence on the transformation of nzvi and that amorphous iron oxyhydroxides are the main transformation products after the addition of as iii which is similar to our previous study liu et al 2020 2021b furthermore the intensity of the fe0 peak gradually increased with increasing as iii concentration which indicates that the generated amorphous iron oxyhydroxide likely prevents further corrosion of the internal zero valent iron resulting in lower utilization of nzvi this result explains that the oxidation and removal of as iii obviously decline in as cd 1 3 reaction system meanwhile this also leads to the reduction of fe ii released into the solution during the reaction and a lower percentage of fe ii in nzvi after the reaction therefore the reaction of nzvi with cd was mainly transformed into crystalline lepidocrocite and the reactions with as iii or cd ii and as iii were transformed into amorphous iron oxyhydroxide with the as iii concentration increases the generation of amorphous iron oxyhydroxide prevented further corrosion of nzvi in addition the transformation products of nzvi with cd ii or cd ii as iii coexistence systems were further investigated using mössbauer spectra fig 5b c the detailed fitting parameters are in table s2 for the single cd ii system three iron species are distinguishable the sextet components which are unambiguously attributed to lepidocrocite with a lepidocrocite percentage of 71 9 larese et al 2010 two double components were observed it was structural fe ii 17 2 and structural fe iii 10 9 on mineral surfaces which is an amorphous mineral formed by the oxidation of nzvi kanel et al 2006 fig 5b this further confirms that lepidocrocite is the dominant transformation product of nzvi after its reaction with cd ii compared with the single cd ii reaction system it can be seen from the results of the mössbauer spectra that 23 1 of the fe0 phase magnetic sextant with a narrow line remains in the cd ii as iii coexistence reaction system tuček et al 2017 in addition another two components were found in the samples fig 5c the doublet components are attributed to structural fe ii 30 5 species and the percentage of 46 4 of the single component is similar to that of the amorphous fe containing as phases 46 4 kanel et al 2006 sheng et al 2016 this proves that the addition of as iii inhibited nzvi corrosion and promoted the conversion of nzvi to amorphous iron oxyhydroxide more importantly amorphous iron oxyhydroxide was the main amorphous fe containing as phase 3 5 the underlying mechanisms of cd ii and as iii interactive removal in order to reveal the underlying mechanism of cd ii and as iii interactive removal by nzvi sem hr tem xps and ftir characterizations were performed to investigate the changes in the structure and morphology of nzvi after the reaction fig 6 the xps spectrum results of fe show that the fe 2p peaks obviously shifted to higher binding energy levels with the addition of as iii fig 6a this result indicates that the iron ligating mode changed significantly in the coexistence system reflecting the different transformation products of nzvi subsequently figs 6b and s3a b show that the valence state of surface cd still remained at 2 because their standard redox potential is similar zhang et al 2014 which does not change after the reaction of nzvi in the single cd ii and coexistence systems moreover the ftir spectrum results show that the peak at 740 cm 1 in the single cd system fig 6d corresponds to lepidocrocite which is the same as the xrd and mössbauer spectra results fig 5 previous studies demonstrated that cd ii can react with iron oxyhydroxide through surface complexation and the ftir spectrum results confirmed that the surface of nzvi contained obvious oh peaks at 3450 cm 1 li et al 2022 however the surface as species in nzvi can be convoluted into as iii and as v wei et al 2019 the oxidation efficiency of as iii by nzvi in the different reaction systems was maintained at approximately 50 figs 6c and s3c and d which was consistent with the results in fig 2c this further demonstrates that the addition of cd ii does not influence the oxidation of as iii meanwhile the ftir spectrum of the cd ii and as iii coexistence system showed that the peak of lepidocrocite disappeared and the peak at 811 cm 1 was found fig 6d which is as v o fe stretching vibration hu et al 2015b huang et al 2020 liu et al reported that ros can be generated for as iii oxidation during the nzvi corrosion process liu et al 2020 the oxidation progress can be determined using eqs 1 3 1 f e 0 o 2 2 h f e 2 h 2 o 2 2 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h 3 h 3 a s o 3 2 o h h 3 a s o 4 h 2 o the morphology of the reacted nzvi was observed in fig 7 the spherical nzvi nanoparticles completely disappeared and collapsed into abundant flakes in the single cd ii reaction system fig 7a the results of xrd confirmed that flake structures are lepidocrocite fig 5a a previous study reported that spherical nzvi rapidly transforms into flake structures which are mainly lepidocrocite liu et al 2017 in contrast the morphology changed significantly with the addition of as iii the morphology of the flakes gradually disappeared in the cd and as coexistence system with the increase of as iii concentration and similar to the single as iii system fig 7b d the sem eds of nzvi surface after the reaction showed that the relative content of cd ii increased from 1 70 to 9 51 with the increase of as iii concentration fig s4 furthermore as shown in fig 7e the tem image of nzvi in the cd as 1 3 coexistence system showed that the outer layer of the core shell structure changed significantly and secondary iron minerals of approximately 20 30 nm appeared on the nzvi surface compared to the pristine nzvi fig s5 upon further magnification of the secondary iron minerals on the nzvi surface the hr tem image clearly shows that the outer layer is amorphous iron oxyhydroxide and the inner layer is still crystalline nzvi it can infer that the amorphous iron oxyhydroxide in the outer layer blocks the further reaction of the inner nzvi fig 7f which is in line with the results of xrd and mössbauer spectra it can explain why the release of fe ii is reduced under the coexistence of cd ii and as iii importantly elemental distribution maps fig 7g and h reveal that the spatial distributions of cd o and as are highly consistent and mainly distributed in the outer layer of nzvi this is most likely caused by the formation of a complex of cd and as previous studies showed that cd and as tend to form surface ternary complexes fe as cd in iron oxyhydroxides jiang et al 2013 li et al 2021 which can promote the removal of cd ii based on the above analysis the mechanism of cd and as interactive removal using nzvi can be described as follows in a single cd ii reaction system nzvi mainly transfers to lepidocrocite and the cd ii adsorption capacity of lepidocrocite is weak zhao et al 2022 it is due to cd ii can only undergo edge sharing adsorption with the ends of lepidocrocite crystallites randall et al 1999 in cd ii and as iii coexistence system as iii addition significantly enhanced the removal of cd ii the mechanism is illustrated in fig 8 firstly arsenic can decline the surface charge of iron oxyhydroxide which may create new adsorption sites for cd ii electrostatic bonding liang et al 2007 previous studies found that as v adsorption enhanced cation adsorption by reducing the surface charge of goethite in the presence of as v catalano et al 2011 for example jiang and coworkers reported that the adsorbed as v transferred the zero point charge of goethite from 8 6 to 4 5 jiang et al 2013 although as iii exists in the form of neutral species h3aso3 below ph 9 3 the adsorption reaction of surface complexes can facilitate the deprotonation of as iii hu et al 2015a meanwhile the zeta potential results confirmed that the nzvi surface potential changed from 9 74 mv to 9 49 mv after adding as iii fig s6 therefore the adsorption of arsenic on nzvi creates a negative double layer potential which improves the removal capacity of cd ii secondly the xrd and mössbauer results show that the transformation products of nzvi are amorphous iron oxyhydroxide which provides more new adsorption active sites for removal cd ii wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 reported that cd ii adsorption by amorphous iron oxide is higher than that of the high degree of crystallization finally nzvi is oxidized to generate amorphous iron oxyhydroxide on the surface which adsorb arsenic through the surface complex as iii and as v exist in neutral and oxyanion forms they can further react with cd ii to form ternary complexes fe as cd which promotes the removal of cd ii by nzvi liu et al indicated that negatively charged as v can reduce the electrostatic repulsion and act as anion bridges to form fe as cd complexes thereby enhancing the removal of cd ii liu et al 2019 in addition cd ii did not affect as iii adsorption and oxidation within a low concentration which may be related to the fact that the highest valence of cd is 2 and cannot consume ros meanwhile the results of zeta potential showed that the presence of cd ii could not convert the surface potential of reacted nzvi to positive fig s6 however a high concentration of cd ii can fast form the cd as fe complex on the surface of nzvi and inhibits the corrosion of nzvi resulting in a reduction of fe ii release and iron oxyhydroxide formation thus declining the removal and oxidation of as iii therefore the presence of as iii can promote the removal of cd ii by nzvi 3 6 environmental implications the combined contamination of cadmium and arsenic is a serious environmental problem it is difficult to simultaneously remediate because of their different physicochemical properties hao et al 2018 kubier et al 2019 in this work we found that the presence of as iii can greatly promote cd ii removal by nzvi while the removal and oxidation of as iii were not affected by cd ii with low concentration the results not only achieved the co removal of cd and as but also significantly promoted the removal of cd showing a synergistic effect moreover as iii and cd ii regulate the different structural transformations of nzvi this work provides new insight into the interactions between cd and as and the transformation products of nzvi in addition in the past decade nzvi has been extensively used for environmental remediation due to its high reaction activity and environmental friendliness stefaniuk et al 2016 tarekegn et al 2021 meanwhile numerous studies have used carbon based materials to modify nzvi and further improve its reactivity dong et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the previous studies provide a possibility that using nzvi for cd and as co contamination remediation is a feasible scheme in practical water environments especially to promote the removal rate of cd 4 conclusion in this study the interactions of cd and as effects on its respective adsorption using nzvi have been systematically investigated and the corresponding mechanism was revealed the results showed that as iii addition significantly promoted cd ii removal using nzvi and the cd ii removal capacity increased from 4 7 to 189 4 mg g with an increasing mass ratio cd as from 1 0 to 1 3 however the removal and oxidation of as iii were not affected by low concentration cd ii in addition neutral conditions were more favorable for the co removal of as iii and cd ii using nzvi as iii addition changed the transformation products of nzvi from lepidocrocite to amorphous iron oxyhydroxide the mechanism through which as promotes cd removal is by reducing the surface potential of the nzvi and ternary complexes fe as cd formation thus this work highlights that the presence of as iii has great potential for enhancing the removal of cd ii by nzvi declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

15772,nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been extensively used for the passivation of cadmium cd or arsenic as from wastewaters while the underlying mechanisms of nzvi reaction with coexisting cd and as are largely overlooked herein the interactions of cd and as during the course of nzvi transformation and the corresponding effects on respective pollutant removal have been systematically investigated batch experiments results show that as iii addition significantly promotes the passivation of cd ii by nzvi and the removal capacity increases by 7 8 times compared to that of cd ii alone however the adsorption and oxidative transformation of as iii are barely affected under a relatively low cd ii concentration it is conducive to the adsorption of cd ii and as iii using nzvi under neutral conditions the transformation of nzvi to lepidocrocite dominates in the cd ii single system while it mainly converts to amorphous fe oxyhydroxide with the addition of as iii as iii notably reduces the surface charge of fe oxyhydroxide intermediates and to form the ternary complexes with cd fe as cd which is the predominant mechanism for the promoted cd ii passivation this work provides new understanding of nzvi transformation coupled to cd ii and as iii passivation which are likely contributing to the heavy metalloids regulation in waters and subsurface environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electron transfer iron transformation heavy metals redox chemistry subsurface environments data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large amounts of heavy metal oid s have been discharged into the environment due to the chemical industry smelting ore mining and other anthropogenic activities resulting in serious water and soil pollution problems kumarathilaka et al 2018 vareda et al 2019 for example cadmium cd and arsenic as co contamination in waters and soils poses a serious threat to food security production and the health of human beings and has become an environmental problem of worldwide concern chen et al 2018 however cd and as exhibit completely different physicochemical properties cd exists mainly as a cd2 cation whereas as usually exists in 3 and 5 oxidation states and in the form of negatively charged anions or neutral such as arsenite as iii includes h3aso3 h2aso3 haso3 2 aso3 3 while arsenate as v species are h2aso4 haso4 2 aso4 3 depending on the ph and oxygen content in the environment mohan and pittman 2007 furthermore as iii exhibits higher toxicity solubility and mobility than as v the different chemical properties of cd and as significantly increase the difficulty of their co remediation wu et al 2018 previous studies found that the coexistence of as and cd systems affect the respective adsorption behaviors compared to single cd as contamination zhao and wang 2020 honma et al 2016 thus it is necessary to understand their influence on the respective removal of the cd as coexistence system nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is a new type of environmentally friendly remediation material it has received wide attention yu et al 2019 the main advantages of nzvi are large specific surface area nano size low toxicity low cost and high activity zhao et al 2016 many studies have demonstrated that nzvi has been applicated to adsorb metal cation contaminants such as cd ii pb ii cu ii and ni ii huang et al 2013 su et al 2014 our previous research showed that nzvi is oxidized to form iron oxyhydroxide minerals under aerobic conditions which can electrostatically bind and complex with cd liu et al 2020 meanwhile nzvi also exhibits efficient adsorption properties for anion contaminants such as as iii as v li et al 2018 liu et al 2021b and cr iii cr vi liu et al 2021a xu et al 2021 on the one hand nzvi can generate iron oxyhydroxides for the removal of as iii during its corrosion process li et al 2018 on the other hand nzvi can activate oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species ros during the corrosion process such as o2 h2o2 or ho stefaniuk et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 which can convert as iii to as v deng et al 2022 thereby reducing as iii toxicity and enhancing the adsorption of as liu et al 2021b for example bhowmick and coworkers reported that the removal capacity of montmorillonite supported nzvi on as reaches 45 5 to 59 9 mg g and promotes the surface catalyzed oxidation of as iii bhowmick et al 2014 while many studies are mainly focused on the respective immobilization of cd ii or as iii by nzvi the performance of cd ii and as iii removal in the coexistence system remains unclear considering the different chemical properties of cd and as the information obtained from single cd or as systems cannot be used to fully understand the co adsorption process currently existing research finds that the performances of cd and as coexistence systems exhibit different results including synergistic and competitive effects for example li and coworkers recently reported that the coexistence of cd and as has a synergistic effect on their respective removal by ferrihydrite and high cd as ratios tend to co precipitate whereas low cd as ratios adsorption is mainly through adsorption on ferrihydrite surface li et al 2021 moreover the addition of as v can enhance the immobilization of cd ii on goethite which is mainly due to the decrease in electrostatic potential and formation of a ternary complex cd as v goethite whereas the adsorption of as v was not affected jiang et al 2013 however another study has shown that the presence of high concentration cd ii inhibits the adsorption of as iii by ferromanganese binary oxide and exhibits a competitive effect whereas the presence of as iii doubles cd ii removal capacity chen et al 2020 although there are still some debates it can summarize that the synergistic effect generally contributes to three mechanisms 1 electrostatic adsorption deng et al 2018 2 ternary surface complexes formation mendez and hiemstra 2020 and 3 surface precipitation hu et al 2015a compared to the widely understood performance and mechanisms for the simultaneous immobilization of cd ii and as iii using iron oxyhydroxides nzvi can promote the oxidation of as iii and its own phase transformation during the reaction which is more complicated however there has been no research investigating the mechanism of the interactions between cd and as and its simultaneous removal by nzvi in this study the interactions of cd ii and as iii during the course of nzvi transformation and the effects on respective removal have been systematically investigated the purpose of this work was to explore the interactions of cd ii and as iii effects on their respective removal using nzvi and the corresponding mechanism the dominant objectives of this work were as follows 1 to study the influence of the different as iii concentrations on the removal of cd ii using nzvi and the presence of different cd ii concentrations on the removal of as iii using nzvi 2 to investigate the effects of different reaction ph on the co removal of cd ii and as iii using nzvi 3 to examine the transformation products of nzvi in different reaction systems after the reaction combined with solid phase characterization analysis 4 to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the simultaneous removal of as iii and cd ii using nzvi 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of nzvi a detailed description of materials and reagents is given in the supporting information si the preparation method of nzvi refers to our previous research liu et al 2020 briefly an appropriate amount of feso4 7h2o was dissolved into a three necked flask which contains oxygen free ultrapure water after feso4 7h2o was completely dissolved excess dissolved nabh4 was added to the three necked flask and then vigorously stirred for 30 min which can reduce fe2 to fe0 the entire reaction process was conducted under an n2 atmosphere finally the prepared nzvi products were washed with excess ethanol by magnetic separation then place it in an oven for drying 60 c the prepared nzvi was stored in an anaerobic glove box for use 2 2 characterization surface morphology and structure of nzvi were observed using hitachi scanning electron microscope sem su8220 japan and jeol transmission electron microscope tem jem 2100f japan equipped with energy dispersive spectrometry eds patterns the crystal structures of nzvi after the reactions were detected by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku japan equipped with a high power cu target at 9 kw which scans from 10 to 90 2θ wss 10 mössbauer spectrometer wissel gmbh germany was used to obtain the mössbauer spectra of nzvi after the reaction was at low temperature 12 k all spectra results were calibrated against 7 μm α fe foil and mosswinn software was used to fit mössbauer spectra in addition the valence states of the nzvi surface element after the reaction were determined using thermo fischer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 250xi usa a frontier fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir frontier perkinelmer usa was used to detect the reacted nzvi functional group 2 3 batch experiments the interactions of cd ii and as iii effects on its respective removal using nzvi were estimated via adsorption experiments a 50 ml centrifuge tube was used to conduct all batch experiments and shaken at 200 rpm at room temperature nzvi dosage was 0 1 g l to study the influence of different as iii concentrations on cd ii removal using nzvi under aerobic and anaerobic conditions reaction systems under aerobic conditions were exposed to air and anaerobic conditions were performed in an anaerobic glove box the cd ii and as iii mass concentration ratios were set as 1 0 20 0 mg l 1 0 2 20 4 mg l 1 0 5 20 10 mg l 1 1 20 20 mg l and 1 3 20 60 mg l 5 mm of 4 morpholinepropanesulfonic acid mops was used to maintain the reaction solution ph at 7 0 0 1 meanwhile the influence of presence different cd ii concentration on as iii removal was studied using the same procedures and the as iii and cd ii ratios were set as 1 0 30 0 mg l 1 0 2 30 6 mg l 1 0 5 30 15 mg l 1 1 30 30 mg l 1 3 30 90 mg l to study the influence of different reaction ph the reaction solution ph was maintained at 6 7 and 8 using 5 mm mops after triggering the reaction the reaction solution was filtered through a filter 0 22 μm at sampling times of 1 5 10 20 30 60 and 120 min for cd and as analysis fe ii concentration in the solution during the reaction was analyzed simultaneously all batch experiments were set up in triplicate to better understand the removal process adsorption kinetic data were fitted with pseudo second order kinetics models 2 4 analytic methods a perkin elmer inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 8000 usa was used to determine cd ii concentration in the solution as iii and as v concentrations in the solution were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with atomic fluorescence spectroscopy kylin s12 beijing jitian instrument china uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1950 persee china was used to detect the fe ii concentrations during the reactions by the o phenanthroline colorimetric method 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced removal of cd ii by nzvi induced by as iii adsorption kinetics were used to investigate the influence of as iii on cd ii adsorption by nzvi as illustrated in fig 1 in the single cd ii reaction system the concentration of cd ii declined within 5 min and then gradually reached the reaction equilibrium the cd ii removal efficiency was only approximately 10 after the reaction fig 1a indicating that nzvi exhibited a lower removal rate for cd ii in cd ii and as iii coexistence system the concentration of cd ii decreased rapidly with the addition of as iii and this phenomenon greatly increased with the as iii concentration improving the result indicates that cd ii removal can be significantly promoted when as iii is introduced subsequently cd ii maximum removal capacity reached 189 37 mg g at cd as 1 3 which was 7 8 times that of the single cd ii system fig 1b furthermore the removal growth rate constant a from cd as 1 0 to 1 0 5 was 10 7 g l which was noticeably higher than that of 0 8 g l from cd as 1 1 to 1 3 this result indicates that the growth rate of promoting cd ii removal slows as the as iii concentration increases to better understand the adsorption process of cd ii using nzvi adsorption kinetics data fits well with the pseudo second order kinetic model r 2 0 99 liu et al 2022 fig 1c the kinetic rate constant k2 from cd as 1 0 5 to 1 3 was 0 031 0 039 g mg min higher than the 0 029 g mg min for the single cd ii reaction system table s1 this result suggests that the cd ii removal process using nzvi is the main chemisorption and the addition of as iii improves the reaction rate liang et al 2017 in addition it can be found that the cd ii removal using nzvi was ignorable with or without as iii under anaerobic conditions fig s1a because the generated ferrous iron by nzvi cannot continue to oxidize for cd ii adsorption mu et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 as illustrated in fig 1d fe ii concentration in the reaction solution increased rapidly within 5 min due to the corrosion of nzvi resulting in the release of large amounts of fe ii ions as the reaction progressed the concentration of fe ii decreased rapidly and then generated iron hydroxides for cd ii removal liu et al 2020 which can explain the results shown in fig 1a it is noteworthy that the concentration of fe ii at the first point 1 min decreased as the as iii concentration increased especially compared to the single cd ii system it can be speculated that as iii addition most likely inhibits the corrosion of nzvi thereby decreasing the fe ii release the possible reason for this is the rapid formation of fe oxyhydroxides on the surface of nzvi which hinders the release of fe ii the detailed analysis is in the following section the same reaction was carried out under anaerobic conditions fig s1b shows that fe ii concentration continued to increase with time because the production of fe ii could not be further oxidized similarly fe ii concentration declined with the addition of as iii compared with that of the single cd ii system under anaerobic conditions fig s1b this further proves that the addition of as iii reduced the corrosion of nzvi it can be concluded that the addition of as iii does not promote the corrosion of nzvi but probably improves the binding of cd ii to nzvi 3 2 as iii removal negligibly affected by cd ii fig 2 a shows the effect of different cd ii concentrations on the removal and oxidation of as iii using nzvi as iii concentration rapidly reduced within 5 min and then the concentration of as iii decreased slowly and achieved reaction equilibrium the removal rate of as iii did not obviously differ 80 90 with the mass concentration ratio of as cd from 1 0 to 1 1 as the cd ii concentration increased the as iii removal rate decreased to 67 1 for as cd 1 3 these results suggest that cd ii addition has no influence on the as iii removal using nzvi within a certain range meanwhile the change of as v concentration was also investigated the concentration of as v increased within 5 min and declined to 0 mg l after the reaction fig 2b indicating that as iii oxidation occurred simultaneously during the reaction this is because the fe ii produced by nzvi corrosion can activate o2 to generate ros such as ho o2 and directly transfer as iii to as v zhao et al 2021 subsequently both as iii and as v are adsorbed by the generated iron oxyhydroxides choudhury et al 2020 ramos et al 2009 the total removal capacity and the distribution of as species after the reaction are shown in fig 2c the percentage of as v was approximately 50 the results suggested that the oxidation rate of as iii did not significantly change as the cd ii concentration increased compared to aerobic conditions the concentration of as iii did not change during the reaction under anaerobic conditions fig s2a this result suggests that nzvi has no adsorption or oxidation capacity for as iii because the generated fe ii cannot be further oxidized to form secondary iron oxyhydroxides the changing trend of the fe ii concentration was similar to that shown in fig 1d the fe ii concentration in the solution increased rapidly within 5 min and then decreased to 0 mg l fig 2d moreover the concentration of fe ii gradually declined with the addition of cd ii this phenomenon also shows that cd ii addition reduced the corrosion of nzvi fig s2b shows that fe ii concentration improved with time under anaerobic conditions what is more the concentration of fe ii was reduced with cd ii addition compared to that of the single as iii system under anaerobic conditions fig s2b further illustrating that cd ii presence inhibits the corrosion of nzvi once the corrosion process of nzvi is significantly inhibited it can also affect the as iii adsorption and oxidation which can also explain the decline of as iii removal rate when the as cd was improved to 1 3 3 3 ph effects on the interactive removal of as iii and cd ii solution ph is a dominant factor that affects the surface charge and corrosion of nzvi the influence of reaction ph was conducted as depicted in fig 3 a and b cd ii and as iii concentrations declined rapidly within 10 min and then reached equilibrium however the removal efficiencies of cd ii and as iii at ph 7 were higher than those at ph values of 6 and 8 at ph 6 protons in the solution can compete with cd ii for surface adsorption sites moreover the point of nzvi zero charges has been reported to be approximately at ph 7 wen et al 2014 accordingly the surface of nzvi under acidic conditions is positively charged resulting in an electrostatic repulsive effect of cd ii and making it difficult to adsorb cd ii through electrostatic bonding li et al 2018 nevertheless the as iii removal rate decreasing is probably due to the form of as iii being neutral specie below ph 9 3 which cannot directly promote the removal of as iii by electrostatic bonding in acidic conditions baig et al 2015 moreover another reason is that the reduction of the cd ii removal rate may affect the removal of arsenic at ph 8 the surface of nzvi in solution forms an iron hydroxide passive film under alkaline conditions which can inhibit the corrosion of nzvi and fe ii production eljamal et al 2018 the formation of an iron hydroxide passive film reduces the number of adsorption sites which prevents further contact of nzvi with as iii and cd ii su et al 2016 moreover increasing deprotonation of nzvi occurs with increasing ph which leads to a negative charge on the surface of the material which is not conducive to the as iii adsorption wen et al 2014 3 4 the distinct structure transformations of nzvi modulated by as iii and cd ii xps xrd and mössbauer spectra were selected to analyze the transformation of nzvi fig 4 shows the detailed fe 2p survey spectra of the nzvi surface after reaction in different systems which are able to convolute into fe ii and fe iii species the peak at 706 9 ev corresponds to fe0 singh et al 2021 in different systems fe0 disappeared and the surface of nzvi was mainly fe iii species 68 8 85 7 this result confirms that the surface of nzvi has been oxidized after the reactions however the percentage of fe ii species 22 6 31 2 in the single cd ii as iii reaction system was higher than that in the coexistence system which is in line with the results of fe ii release fig 1d this is mainly because the coexistence of cd ii and as iii inhibits the corrosion of nzvi resulting in the reduction of fe ii release on the surface structural fe ii of nzvi meanwhile the concentration of fe ii decreased in the as iii and cd ii coexistence systems indicating that as iii and cd ii addition could regulate the transformation products of nzvi during the reaction process the xrd patterns of nzvi after reactions in different systems are illustrated in fig 5 a for the single cd system multiple characteristic peaks were observed which were in line with the xrd standard pattern of lepidocrocite these results suggest that the main transformation product of nzvi is lepidocrocite in the single cd ii system liu and coworkers reported that the main product from the oxidation of nzvi in oxygenated water is lepidocrocite liu et al 2014 it can infer that the addition of cd ii does not affect the transformation of nzvi in contrast the peak of lepidocrocite disappears in the cd ii and as iii coexistence system which only has the characteristic peaks of fe0 and is similar to the single as iii reaction system fig 5a it suggests that as iii addition has a significant influence on the transformation of nzvi and that amorphous iron oxyhydroxides are the main transformation products after the addition of as iii which is similar to our previous study liu et al 2020 2021b furthermore the intensity of the fe0 peak gradually increased with increasing as iii concentration which indicates that the generated amorphous iron oxyhydroxide likely prevents further corrosion of the internal zero valent iron resulting in lower utilization of nzvi this result explains that the oxidation and removal of as iii obviously decline in as cd 1 3 reaction system meanwhile this also leads to the reduction of fe ii released into the solution during the reaction and a lower percentage of fe ii in nzvi after the reaction therefore the reaction of nzvi with cd was mainly transformed into crystalline lepidocrocite and the reactions with as iii or cd ii and as iii were transformed into amorphous iron oxyhydroxide with the as iii concentration increases the generation of amorphous iron oxyhydroxide prevented further corrosion of nzvi in addition the transformation products of nzvi with cd ii or cd ii as iii coexistence systems were further investigated using mössbauer spectra fig 5b c the detailed fitting parameters are in table s2 for the single cd ii system three iron species are distinguishable the sextet components which are unambiguously attributed to lepidocrocite with a lepidocrocite percentage of 71 9 larese et al 2010 two double components were observed it was structural fe ii 17 2 and structural fe iii 10 9 on mineral surfaces which is an amorphous mineral formed by the oxidation of nzvi kanel et al 2006 fig 5b this further confirms that lepidocrocite is the dominant transformation product of nzvi after its reaction with cd ii compared with the single cd ii reaction system it can be seen from the results of the mössbauer spectra that 23 1 of the fe0 phase magnetic sextant with a narrow line remains in the cd ii as iii coexistence reaction system tuček et al 2017 in addition another two components were found in the samples fig 5c the doublet components are attributed to structural fe ii 30 5 species and the percentage of 46 4 of the single component is similar to that of the amorphous fe containing as phases 46 4 kanel et al 2006 sheng et al 2016 this proves that the addition of as iii inhibited nzvi corrosion and promoted the conversion of nzvi to amorphous iron oxyhydroxide more importantly amorphous iron oxyhydroxide was the main amorphous fe containing as phase 3 5 the underlying mechanisms of cd ii and as iii interactive removal in order to reveal the underlying mechanism of cd ii and as iii interactive removal by nzvi sem hr tem xps and ftir characterizations were performed to investigate the changes in the structure and morphology of nzvi after the reaction fig 6 the xps spectrum results of fe show that the fe 2p peaks obviously shifted to higher binding energy levels with the addition of as iii fig 6a this result indicates that the iron ligating mode changed significantly in the coexistence system reflecting the different transformation products of nzvi subsequently figs 6b and s3a b show that the valence state of surface cd still remained at 2 because their standard redox potential is similar zhang et al 2014 which does not change after the reaction of nzvi in the single cd ii and coexistence systems moreover the ftir spectrum results show that the peak at 740 cm 1 in the single cd system fig 6d corresponds to lepidocrocite which is the same as the xrd and mössbauer spectra results fig 5 previous studies demonstrated that cd ii can react with iron oxyhydroxide through surface complexation and the ftir spectrum results confirmed that the surface of nzvi contained obvious oh peaks at 3450 cm 1 li et al 2022 however the surface as species in nzvi can be convoluted into as iii and as v wei et al 2019 the oxidation efficiency of as iii by nzvi in the different reaction systems was maintained at approximately 50 figs 6c and s3c and d which was consistent with the results in fig 2c this further demonstrates that the addition of cd ii does not influence the oxidation of as iii meanwhile the ftir spectrum of the cd ii and as iii coexistence system showed that the peak of lepidocrocite disappeared and the peak at 811 cm 1 was found fig 6d which is as v o fe stretching vibration hu et al 2015b huang et al 2020 liu et al reported that ros can be generated for as iii oxidation during the nzvi corrosion process liu et al 2020 the oxidation progress can be determined using eqs 1 3 1 f e 0 o 2 2 h f e 2 h 2 o 2 2 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h 3 h 3 a s o 3 2 o h h 3 a s o 4 h 2 o the morphology of the reacted nzvi was observed in fig 7 the spherical nzvi nanoparticles completely disappeared and collapsed into abundant flakes in the single cd ii reaction system fig 7a the results of xrd confirmed that flake structures are lepidocrocite fig 5a a previous study reported that spherical nzvi rapidly transforms into flake structures which are mainly lepidocrocite liu et al 2017 in contrast the morphology changed significantly with the addition of as iii the morphology of the flakes gradually disappeared in the cd and as coexistence system with the increase of as iii concentration and similar to the single as iii system fig 7b d the sem eds of nzvi surface after the reaction showed that the relative content of cd ii increased from 1 70 to 9 51 with the increase of as iii concentration fig s4 furthermore as shown in fig 7e the tem image of nzvi in the cd as 1 3 coexistence system showed that the outer layer of the core shell structure changed significantly and secondary iron minerals of approximately 20 30 nm appeared on the nzvi surface compared to the pristine nzvi fig s5 upon further magnification of the secondary iron minerals on the nzvi surface the hr tem image clearly shows that the outer layer is amorphous iron oxyhydroxide and the inner layer is still crystalline nzvi it can infer that the amorphous iron oxyhydroxide in the outer layer blocks the further reaction of the inner nzvi fig 7f which is in line with the results of xrd and mössbauer spectra it can explain why the release of fe ii is reduced under the coexistence of cd ii and as iii importantly elemental distribution maps fig 7g and h reveal that the spatial distributions of cd o and as are highly consistent and mainly distributed in the outer layer of nzvi this is most likely caused by the formation of a complex of cd and as previous studies showed that cd and as tend to form surface ternary complexes fe as cd in iron oxyhydroxides jiang et al 2013 li et al 2021 which can promote the removal of cd ii based on the above analysis the mechanism of cd and as interactive removal using nzvi can be described as follows in a single cd ii reaction system nzvi mainly transfers to lepidocrocite and the cd ii adsorption capacity of lepidocrocite is weak zhao et al 2022 it is due to cd ii can only undergo edge sharing adsorption with the ends of lepidocrocite crystallites randall et al 1999 in cd ii and as iii coexistence system as iii addition significantly enhanced the removal of cd ii the mechanism is illustrated in fig 8 firstly arsenic can decline the surface charge of iron oxyhydroxide which may create new adsorption sites for cd ii electrostatic bonding liang et al 2007 previous studies found that as v adsorption enhanced cation adsorption by reducing the surface charge of goethite in the presence of as v catalano et al 2011 for example jiang and coworkers reported that the adsorbed as v transferred the zero point charge of goethite from 8 6 to 4 5 jiang et al 2013 although as iii exists in the form of neutral species h3aso3 below ph 9 3 the adsorption reaction of surface complexes can facilitate the deprotonation of as iii hu et al 2015a meanwhile the zeta potential results confirmed that the nzvi surface potential changed from 9 74 mv to 9 49 mv after adding as iii fig s6 therefore the adsorption of arsenic on nzvi creates a negative double layer potential which improves the removal capacity of cd ii secondly the xrd and mössbauer results show that the transformation products of nzvi are amorphous iron oxyhydroxide which provides more new adsorption active sites for removal cd ii wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 reported that cd ii adsorption by amorphous iron oxide is higher than that of the high degree of crystallization finally nzvi is oxidized to generate amorphous iron oxyhydroxide on the surface which adsorb arsenic through the surface complex as iii and as v exist in neutral and oxyanion forms they can further react with cd ii to form ternary complexes fe as cd which promotes the removal of cd ii by nzvi liu et al indicated that negatively charged as v can reduce the electrostatic repulsion and act as anion bridges to form fe as cd complexes thereby enhancing the removal of cd ii liu et al 2019 in addition cd ii did not affect as iii adsorption and oxidation within a low concentration which may be related to the fact that the highest valence of cd is 2 and cannot consume ros meanwhile the results of zeta potential showed that the presence of cd ii could not convert the surface potential of reacted nzvi to positive fig s6 however a high concentration of cd ii can fast form the cd as fe complex on the surface of nzvi and inhibits the corrosion of nzvi resulting in a reduction of fe ii release and iron oxyhydroxide formation thus declining the removal and oxidation of as iii therefore the presence of as iii can promote the removal of cd ii by nzvi 3 6 environmental implications the combined contamination of cadmium and arsenic is a serious environmental problem it is difficult to simultaneously remediate because of their different physicochemical properties hao et al 2018 kubier et al 2019 in this work we found that the presence of as iii can greatly promote cd ii removal by nzvi while the removal and oxidation of as iii were not affected by cd ii with low concentration the results not only achieved the co removal of cd and as but also significantly promoted the removal of cd showing a synergistic effect moreover as iii and cd ii regulate the different structural transformations of nzvi this work provides new insight into the interactions between cd and as and the transformation products of nzvi in addition in the past decade nzvi has been extensively used for environmental remediation due to its high reaction activity and environmental friendliness stefaniuk et al 2016 tarekegn et al 2021 meanwhile numerous studies have used carbon based materials to modify nzvi and further improve its reactivity dong et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the previous studies provide a possibility that using nzvi for cd and as co contamination remediation is a feasible scheme in practical water environments especially to promote the removal rate of cd 4 conclusion in this study the interactions of cd and as effects on its respective adsorption using nzvi have been systematically investigated and the corresponding mechanism was revealed the results showed that as iii addition significantly promoted cd ii removal using nzvi and the cd ii removal capacity increased from 4 7 to 189 4 mg g with an increasing mass ratio cd as from 1 0 to 1 3 however the removal and oxidation of as iii were not affected by low concentration cd ii in addition neutral conditions were more favorable for the co removal of as iii and cd ii using nzvi as iii addition changed the transformation products of nzvi from lepidocrocite to amorphous iron oxyhydroxide the mechanism through which as promotes cd removal is by reducing the surface potential of the nzvi and ternary complexes fe as cd formation thus this work highlights that the presence of as iii has great potential for enhancing the removal of cd ii by nzvi declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

15773,smart control in water systems aims to reduce the cost of infrastructure expansion by better utilizing the available capacity through real time control the recent availability of sensors and advanced data processing is expected to transform the view of water system operators increasing the need for deploying a new generation of data driven control solutions to that end this paper proposes a data driven control framework for combined wastewater and stormwater networks we propose to learn the effect of wet and dry weather flows through the variation of water levels by deploying a number of level sensors in the network to tackle the challenges associated with combining hydraulic and hydrologic modelling we adopt a gaussian process based predictive control tool to capture the dynamic effect of rain and wastewater inflows while applying domain knowledge to preserve the balance of water volumes to show the practical feasibility of the approach we test the control performance on a laboratory setup inspired by the topology of a real world wastewater network we compare our method to a rule based controller currently used by the water utility operating the proposed network overall the controller learns the wastewater load and the temporal dynamics of the network and therefore significantly outperforms the baseline controller especially during high intensity rain periods finally we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the approach for practical real time control implementations keywords smart water system data driven modelling control uncertainty sewer network 1 introduction the primary function of sewers is to convey wastewater and stormwater in case of combined networks towards treatment facilities before releasing it to the environment population growth urbanization and changing precipitation patterns due to climate change cause major impacts on these networks with increased wastewater and rain loads eggimann et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 these loads often result in harmful overflows and degraded treatment performance threatening the ecological health of the water bodies and damaging the infrastructure schütze et al 2002 advanced strategies for sewer control are designed on historical weather observations raising the question of how to operate these infrastructures in the wake of ongoing urbanization and climate change 1 1 motivation to handle the increased load on old infrastructure without substantial investment a possible solution is to use advanced control methods relying on real time data and system wide optimization techniques yuan et al 2019 the increased collection and utilization of data enabled the real time management of urban water systems forming a basis for advanced decision making tools kitchin 2014 in the context of sewer networks these tools aim to prepare the system for high intensity storm events to optimally utilize the maximum available storage capacity from a control theoretic perspective proactive control e g model predictive control mpc has high relevance in sewers however in practice reactive control is the most commonly implemented approach lund et al 2018 decision making by using weather forecasts is a widely used method by researchers in the water community campisano et al 2013 a significant issue with traditional mpc is the need for a well maintained system model at small utilities such models are often economically out of reach and therefore neither decision support nor advanced control techniques are used by the practitioners lund et al 2018 easy commissioning therefore has a great impact in practice yet it is an unresolved issue when it comes to controlling wastewater networks overflows in sewers often occur due to bottlenecks induced by the slow filling times of storage elements and the significant delays of the sewage transport ocampo martinez 2010 the uncertainty associated with the weather forecasts is also an issue often deteriorating the prediction capabilities of mpc consequently handling the rain and wastewater load via control is a challenging task not only due to the forecast uncertainty but also due to the uncertainty of the modelling to justify the need for autonomous and easy commissionable control strategies we introduce first the existing methods then we detail our contributions and specify the control and modelling methods used throughout the paper finally the proposed approach is evaluated on an experimental setup using real rain and wastewater flow data from real world utilities 1 2 state of the art instrumentation forms the basis of system wide planning and automation in urban water systems eggimann et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 the data driven transformation of water system management has resulted in the deployment of a high number of sensors enabling online monitoring and data processing at many water utilities campisano et al 2013 the most widely used instrumentation in sewers is flow and level sensors often placed in tanks and manholes banik et al 2017 flow sensors are typically used for calibrating hydraulic models for planning and decision support mignot et al 2012 yuan et al 2019 as well as for modelling the hydrologic processes e g rain running off the catchments li et al 2019 placement of the actuators and the sensors is a non trivial task in distributed parameter systems such as sewer networks for instance leitão et al 2018 discusses the identification of flow control devices to enable in sewer storage in addition to physical sensors software sensors have also been developed for flow estimation utilizing mainly weather radar data pump operation and the water level variation through level sensors ahm et al 2016 chen et al 2014 kallesøe and knudsen 2016 kisi et al 2013 rjeily et al 2017 real time control in sewer networks converts the latest sensor measurements to operational decisions by the use of controllable assets e g pumps gates and valves ocampo martinez 2010 the foundation of all predictive decision making techniques is the underlying dynamic model of the system lund et al 2018 the most intuitive approach to obtain such models is to consider the physics behind the process and apply first principle hydraulic and hydrologic laws todini 2007 while maintaining the intuition behind the modelling balla et al 2022 however such models often rely on a high level of detail involving many parameters and therefore keeping them up to date is expensive and laborious schütze et al 2002 besides one of the most commonly applied first principle modelling techniques relies on sets of partial differential equations xu et al 2012 2011 often requiring prohibitively many sensors for proper calibration other physically based techniques attempt to conceptualize parts of the network e g by considering segments of the system as virtual volumes joseph duran et al 2015 mollerup et al 2016 and to simplify the model based on skeletonization of the network thrysøe et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 as a result of the increased data availability data driven modelling and control techniques have gained popularity within the urban water systems community eggimann et al 2017 data driven models often termed as black box are described by their input output characteristics where inputs typically comprise the rain forecasts while the outputs are the corresponding flows kitchin 2014 neural networks have been applied in modelling the system hydraulics dawson and wilby 2001 mounce et al 2014 vidyarthi et al 2020 and the hydrology as well chang et al 2001 duncan et al 2012 rjeily et al 2017 one of the strengths of neural networks in water systems is their generally high performance of learning complex and nonlinear input output relations on the other hand although generating solutions with neural networks is efficient they lack the physical interpretability of parameters and depend heavily on data quality mpc is a well suited approach for the optimal mitigation of sewer volumes and regulating the flows with the use of rainfall forecasts beeneken et al 2013 lund et al 2018 characterization of the forecast uncertainties has been reported by considering a multiple scenario approach in both sewers and water resource management balla et al 2020 tian et al 2017 in löwe et al 2014 2016 and vezzaro and grum 2014 the incorporation of stochastic grey box models for rainfall runoff has been considered to reduce combined overflows additionally characterization of the forecast uncertainties by learning the underlying dynamics of the flows with gaussian processes have been reported in wang et al 2016b for water distribution systems and in troutman et al 2017 for flow prediction in combined sewers reinforcement learning has shown promising results in both combined ochoa et al 2019 and storm water networks mullapudi et al 2020 while iterative learning control has been used to learn the return periods of rain events cui et al 2015 nevertheless relatively few studies report on learning based control in sewer systems learning based control is therefore a research area promising a potential alternative or supplement to the real time control of wastewater networks 1 3 contribution this paper aims to enable fully automated decision making in combined sewer systems the key innovation behind the proposed method relates to its ability to learn and make decisions in real time based on level sensor feeds and weather forecasts specifically the contributions are the following a novel data driven control approach based on the combination of hydraulic modelling and gaussian processes an economically and practically feasible predictive controller using solely in sewer water level observations uncertainty assessment regarding the system states via propagating the uncertainty through the predictions experimental overflow control validation the proposed solution has two clear benefits first in contrast to black box modelling the basic hydraulic laws are combined with data driven techniques the structure of the model preserves intuition by incorporating the physically measurable levels familiar to practitioners working in the water sector by utilizing only the easy accessible physical description of the network we make our method robust towards forecast uncertainty as well as data deficiency additionally the purchase and maintenance costs related to flow sensors are often expensive in comparison to level sensors zhang et al 2021 in this work the level to flow conversion is bypassed by establishing direct relations between the rain and water levels as well as by relating in sewer water level measurements to the level variations in the storage tanks at the pumping stations as opposed to hydraulic modelling we focus on obtaining a prediction model to evaluate the water levels without the need of the network dimensions and other particular parameters 2 problem statement the overall concept of the method is shown in fig 1 where in sewer level sensors are deployed at critical locations in manholes and basins the network topology is defined by a tree graph thrysøe et al 2019 where pumping stations are connected via gravity sewers note that the topology is simplified based on the high level piping layout thrysøe et al 2019 while the infiltration of rain and wastewater is concentrated on network nodes manholes being affected by the discharge the discharged waste and storm water are collected and pumped from station to station until the root treatment plant is reached specifically we consider the full scale of the network however only the main sewer lines between the pumping stations are modelled the configuration of our proposed control method is shown in fig 2 the models behind the controller are the physical model section 3 1 and the data driven model section 3 2 the former incorporates the physical knowledge about the dimension of basins while the latter describes the effect of rain wastewater and the uncertainties in forms of residuals by using sensor h estimation q and rain forecast d data opposed to classical methods that handle the inflows or disturbances by building individual forecasting blocks we consider the translation of rain to level variation incorporated in the controller the gaussian process based mpc controller block gp mpc section 3 4 3 stands for the optimization algorithm behind the mpc problem using a relevant cost function section 3 4 2 and the operational and physical constraints section 3 4 1 the decision support block section 3 4 4 is an information panel providing performance measures of the closed loop control performance to e g network operators in case the algorithm is used as an offline decision support tool as shown the controller provides flow setpoints to the pumping stations where the pumps operating in parallel move the water volumes at the rate of the optimal flow q optimal in this study we focus on variable speed wastewater pumping hence the hybrid behavior induced by the traditional fixed speed pump operation is not within the scope of the proposed predictive control algorithm since only water level sensors are deployed in the wastewater network the loop is closed with an observer or pumpflow estimator allowing for using soft sensing techniques or estimating the pump flows in the proposed output feedback scheme in the following we present the control scheme by describing each building block 3 methods 3 1 physical modelling the nominal model structure is described by the physical laws of wastewater transport the information we use are the the topological layout of the network the size of storage tanks and the estimated pump flow hydraulic storage elements are described with simple mass balances specifically the level change induced by pump operation is given by 1 h t t 1 a t h t t b t q t where h t r n t is the vector of water levels in storage tanks at discrete time t with n t being the number of tanks and q r n q is the vector of pump flows representing the sum of flows for each pump at the n q pumping stations the parameter matrices a t r n t n t and b t r n t n q are defined by the physical size of the storage elements i e the diameter and the discretization time step or sampling time the mass balance is described by eq 1 with the exception that the effect of inflows i e rain runoff and domestic wastewater are in general unknown hence not considered as part of the nominal storage dynamics the discharged flow of each pump at a pumping station can be accurately approximated with a polynomial expression of each pump sitting in a basin the pump flow q is related to the relative pressure the power and the speed of the pump described by the following expressions 2 q s a 0 1 ω s a 1 δ p ω s a 2 p p ω 2 s a 3 ω where q is the flow to be estimated in m 3 s ω is the rotational speed in r a d s δ h is the level difference between the wastewater basin and the outlet point and p is the relative pressure to atmospheric pressure obtained by measuring the inlet pressure and the level in the wet well note that p is in m w c i e meter water column constants a i are pump parameters describing the pump curve of the specific pump assumed to be known in this work furthermore s p p is the sum of the power consumption of p p of individual pumps s denoting the number of running pumps several implementations of flow estimation in wastewater pumping stations exist demonstrating high accuracy in practice kallesøe and knudsen 2016 the governing dynamics of the discharged flow propagation in pipes is assumed to be unknown in the nominal model therefore the nominal part of the mass balance for the entire network is given by the combination of the vector of tank levels h t and the vector of water levels h p r n p in manholes where system parameters related to pipe dynamics are zero the full nominal model is given in the standard linear state space form 3 h t 1 f h t q t a h t b q t where f represents the known part or nominal dynamics of the wastewater network and h r n h is the vector of combined water levels where n h n t n p corresponds to the number of water level sensors deployed in the entire network note that the structure of the state space model is created based on the network topology i e using the piping layout in the case of several pumping stations connected by transport pipes building the mass balance model can be easily automated by stacking the vectors of suitable dimensions of water levels in eq 1 3 2 data driven modelling the exogenous effect of dry and wet weather flows are governed by unknown dynamics that are excluded from the nominal model in eq 3 these exogenous flows induce variations in the levels in basins and the manholes consequently the flow inside the combined sewer conduits is characterized by the sum of dry weather discharge domestic wastewater and wet weather discharge delayed rainfall runoff i e q t q r t q w w t where q r and q w w are physically present due to rainfall runoff and domestic wastewater production respectively while q is the combined sewer flow we consider both combined and stormwater networks wherein the latter case the network is not influenced by dry weather flow however we do not take into account the groundwater infiltration explicitly as we rather consider it implicitly in the dry weather flows given water level sensor data h pump flow estimate q and rainfall forecast d the problem is formed by the need to learn the model parts which can complement the nominal dynamics described in eq 3 note that our method does not require to generate the q r rain impacted flows and the q w w diurnal flows as we propose to learn the relation between rain and level in the sewers with the learned model we aim to predict the evolution of water levels i e the system states for this reason we assume that the entire network dynamics are composed of a nominal and an additive unknown part the former represents the known hydraulics of the sewer network while the latter represents the rain and wastewater flow infiltrating into the system the pipes transporting the water volumes moreover the forecast and model uncertainty the combined network model is given by 4 h t 1 f h t q t b p g h t q t d t t w t where g is a nonlinear vector function governing the unknown dynamics d r n d is the vector of rainfall forecasts at n d different locations and w is the process noise w n 0 σ w w n 0 σ w following gaussian white noise distribution besides b p is a matrix mapping the nonlinear dynamics g to the full state vector h simply stated if there is a storage tank where the level variation h is not affected by uncertain inflows b p maps the lower dimensional outputs of the function g to the full state vector h by simply contributing zero to the nominal dynamics to generate input data for learning the unknown function g we use the level sensor measurements h the flow estimates q and the forecast of rainfall d note that the weather forecast d indicates how the levels are varying inside the sewers due to the infiltration of rain q r since the dry weather flow q w w typically follows a diurnal pattern the cyclical behavior correlates to time i e it is likely that the level patterns are similar at the same time of the day at a different week for this reason we provide the time of the day t as an input to the unknown function g in this way we provide information about the time periodicity of the dry weather level pattern variations for ease of notation let us define the input data as a vector 5 z h q d t to create residuals we use the data provided by the level sensors and subtract the nominal dynamics i e 6 y t g z t w t b p h t 1 f h t q t where y r n y is the vector of residuals of size n y corresponding to the number of water levels influenced by either dry or wet weather inflows besides the mapping matrix b p is inverted with the moore penrose pseudo inverse by using the level sensors distributed along the network we aim to capture the dry and wet weather sewer level dynamics in the residuals the input output set is constructed with data under nominal operation i e 7 d z i y i i 1 m where m is the number of collected data points note that the nominal operation via the on off control of the pumps might create spikes in the residual signal y and therefore removing the outliers is recommended as part of data pre processing a powerful way to represent the input output mapping of g by taking into account the forecast uncertainties is to model the relation as a gaussian process rather than claiming that the input output relation above belongs to a specific mathematical model structure a gaussian process is a nonparametric probabilistic model based on data instead of parameterizing the unknown dynamics governing the residuals we characterize their distribution hence the residual model representing one entry of y is given by 8 y g p m z σ g p i σ n 2 where the distribution of the gaussian process is fully characterized by its mean function m z and covariance σ g p we consider the mean m z as a constant equivalent to a model bias the noise variance is denoted by σ n 2 and i is the identity matrix of suitable dimension the mean and covariance are defined by 9a m z i e g z i 9b σ g p i j cov g z i g z j k z i z j where the mean m z and the covariance matrix σ g p are obtained by evaluating the mean and covariance functions given all measured data pairs in d the expected value operator is denoted by e the covariance function or kernel k establishes a measure of similarity between the function values of g specifically our model makes use of the kernel to approximate the covariance of the residual signals in this setting we assume that the sewer dynamics exhibit smooth and continuous behavior based on the slow sewer dynamics and therefore a squared exponential kernel is used to approximate the covariance function in eq 9 rasmussen and williams 2018 the squared exponential kernel is given by 10 k z i z j σ f 2 exp 1 2 z i z j s λ 1 s z i z j where the kernel is characterized by its hyper parameters σ f 2 and λ 1 diag σ l 1 2 σ l n z 2 denoting the signal variance and the length scale matrix respectively note that we use automatic relevance determination meaning that we use different length scale parameters for different dimensions of the input vector z rasmussen and williams 2018 hence the relative importance of contribution for each input is assessed using all input dimensions in eq 5 for characterizing each residual is computationally demanding considering that each level sensor and pumping data is used to evaluate the kernel function consequently the mapping matrix s maps only the physically meaningful entries in our data set d therefore the number of hyper parameters σ l used for the parameterization of the level residuals is reduced it can be shown that the posterior distribution over all possible realization of the unknown dynamics g is given by bayes rule 11 p g z y p g p y z g p y z given our problem formulation the posterior distribution simplifies to rasmussen and williams 2018 12 p g z y g p m z σ g p i σ 2 n the hyper parameters of the above problem are learned by maximizing the marginal likelihood p y z typically done via numerical approximations as the analytical evaluation of the above problem is intractable chalupka et al 2013 once the hyper parameters are identified the gaussian process model is used to predict the level residual y at a test point z using the relation y g z the problem of predicting the residual corresponds to finding the probability distribution of p y d z given the training data d a testing input z and the hyper parameters by using the kernel to approximate the covariance between the training and testing points the mean and variance of the gaussian process are reformulated i e 13a μ gp z m z k z z k zz i σ n 2 1 y m z 13b σ gp z k z z k z z k zz i σ n 2 1 k z z where k z z k z z and k z z k z z are the covariances between the training and testing points furthermore k z z is the autocovariance of the testing point note that the above derivation of the gp based residual model provides a framework to predict the physically meaningful level residuals y based on the similarity of the measured training and newly experienced target data points regarding the pump flows q water levels h and the weather forecasts d 3 3 probabilistic prediction model to plan the state of the sewer network over multiple prediction steps ahead we aim to predict the effect of wet and dry weather discharges on the water levels predicting multiple steps ahead with the gps representing g and nominal model f means that the mean and the variance of the previously predicted states are used to predict the next states hence we feed back stochastic variables as inputs in general the resulting water level distribution is non gaussian as we propagate the stochastic states through the nonlinear kernel stated in eq 10 the resulting distribution is approximated such that the water levels h and the gp dynamics are approximated at each prediction step t as jointly gaussian i e 14 h t g p t n μ t σ t μ h t μ g p t σ h t σ h g p t σ g p h t σ g p t where σ h g p σ g p h are the cross covariances between the physical and the residual water levels μ h t is the vector of mean water levels and σ h t is the covariance matrix of the water levels at time t the covariance of the water levels provides an extra measure of how uncertain we are about our prediction the pump flows q are treated as deterministic variables to find the transition probability of the full water level states including the nominal and residual contributions we apply the first order taylor expansion of the approximated joint gaussian distribution shown in eq 14 around the mean μ h t of the water levels at time step t hewing et al 2020 note that since we are concerned with the probabilistic description of the water level evolution in our prediction the characterization of the states is done by considering the expected value μ h and the governing uncertainty around it i e the variance of the water levels σ h hence the mean and variance dynamics of the water levels result in 15a μ h t 1 f μ h t q t μ g p t 15b σ h t 1 h f μ h t q t b p σ t h f μ h t q t b p where σ is the joint covariance matrix in eq 14 and h denotes the first order partial derivative with respect to the water levels note that the expected value in terms of the mean water levels is given by the sum of the mass balance based nominal dynamics f and the contribution of the residual dynamics μ g p by inserting the model into the nominal dynamics f the final form of the mean variance dynamics describing the water level evolution becomes 16a μ h t 1 a μ h t b q t b p μ g p t 16b σ h t 1 a σ h t a b p σ gp h t a a σ h

t σ gp z t h μ gp z t σ h t μ gp z t where the input vector is given by z μ h q d t 3 4 predictive control regarding the control of large scale water systems the popularity of mpc is to a great extent due to the fact that physical and operational constraints are handled in the optimization problem according to the predictions with the model and the rain forecasts the mpc algorithm optimizes the manipulated variables flows or levels over a given prediction horizon h p of chosen length inputs are computed and evaluated to obtain a future response from the water system then the sequence of future responses is evaluated based on our cost function and we optimize until our numerical solution yields suitable inputs according to a system management policy which can be identified as optimal the optimal inputs are then sent to the actuators pumps or gates and the entire process is repeated in a receding horizon fashion in our work constraints are formed on the physical flow limits of pumps and the physical dimensions of the network e g the capacity of storage tanks and manholes the disturbances are considered as the wet and dry weather flows affecting the sewer network in terms of wastewater flow and rain runoff among which the latter is of highly stochastic nature the forecast of these exogenous signals is typically done in terms of nowcasting and forecasting nowcasts are obtained by rainfall radars providing sufficient spatial and temporal reliability up to two hours while forecasts span over a longer time horizon 3 4 1 constraints both physical and operational constraints are formulated for the optimization problem associated with the gp mpc strategy we consider the sum of each pump unit at the pumping station hence the constraint on the manipulated flows is given by 18 h q q t b q where b q q max q min r 2 n q is the vector of upper and lower flow bounds at each pumping station i e the maximum and minimum sum of flow that a station can provide furthermore the matrix h q i n q i n q maps the vector of pump flow variables q to the suitable dimensions of b q constraints on the system states pose limitations on the maximum and minimum water levels often the bounds correspond to the capacity of a manhole or a basin from the physical point of view it is evident that a combined wastewater network is best prepared for a high intensity rain event if basins are emptied beforehand keeping the water levels as low as possible is particularly important before a storm event as water volumes might need to be used to the maximum capacity of the piping network considering the uncertain nature of rain forecasts and the dynamic nature of wastewater flow patterns the goal of the controller is to reject the wet and dry weather inflows in this study we adapt some ideas from predictive control in water distribution networks grosso et al 2014 wang et al 2016a where we introduce an operational constraint this operational criterion keeps the levels in storage tanks within a specific safety range instead of forcing them to a reference the functionality of this constraint is to allow the controller to operate the level freely by penalizing only level values which violate the safety bounds the safety bounds and the operating capacity are illustrated in fig 3 while the minimum and maximum level values of the physical capacity constraints are evident the determination of the safety bounds is crucial to achieving a proper performance of the closed loop control strategy we argue that the safety bounds are placed best at the lower region of tanks as the system remains emptied and prepared in case of an unexpected storm event furthermore to limit odor problems due to retention while finding the optimal placement of the safety region is out of scope here it is reserved for future simulation studies introducing the nonlinear kernel and propagating the uncertainties with the gaussian processes result in system states water levels being probabilistic following a gaussian distribution hence the state constraints need to be treated stochastic in this study we formulate probabilistic constraints in terms of chance constraints wang et al 2016a i e 19a p h h t b α 19b p h s h t b s α s where eq 19a describes the constraint on the physical capacity of storage elements while eq 19b describes the constraint on the safety region the operator p is the probability that the inequality is satisfied with α and α s being the confidence levels furthermore the mapping matrices h h i n h i n h and h s i n h t i n h t map the vector of water levels h to suitable size of b h t max h t min and b s h s max h s min water level bounds respectively note that the lower bounds corresponding to b are defined by the minimum volume in the wet wells to avoid the dry run of the pumps under our assumptions that h is jointly gaussian with the residuals y the above probabilistic expressions can be reformulated as convex deterministic constraints hewing et al 2020 wang et al 2016a the constraints are given by 20a h μ h t b h ϵ ϵ t c h diag σ h t 1 2 20b h s μ h t b s h ξ ξ t c s h s diag σ h t 1 2 where the actual water level values are replaced by their expected or mean values μ h furthermore we introduce a term called the vector of critical values c ϕ α 1 where ϕ is the vector of inverse cumulative distribution function or quantile of the standard gaussian distribution evaluated at α these quantiles can be precomputed and used as constant values the operator denotes element by element multiplication and the slack terms ϵ ϵ max ϵ min and ξ ξ max ξ min denote vectors of relaxation variables standing for safety violation and overflow respectively the mapping matrices h r 2 n h n h and h s r 2 n t n t map the mean water level μ h and variance σ h to the suitable dimensions of the maximum and minimum water level bounds b and b s note that the additional term in eq 20 corresponds to the tightening of the original bounds conditioned on the evolution of the water level variances along the prediction horizon as expected the longer we predict into the future the higher the variances grow due to the model and forecast uncertainties to avoid recursive infeasibility the slack variables ξ and ϵ are utilized to soften the constraints 3 4 2 cost function the cost function is the key component in the design of the gp mpc in general the formulation of the control problem relates to the manipulation of water volumes to avoid undesirable overflows and water surges outside the main sewer lines from the control point of view we focus on the rejection of the stochastic meteorological rain runoff and human wastewater flow loads aiming to avoid the physical constraint violations resulting in overflows or water surges although here we propose a specific objective function there is a flexibility of either removing or adding control objectives simply by adding new control goals for example the control strategy may vary according to the infrastructure design e g the inclusion of treatment plant objectives may be crucial to add in combined networks with high wastewater load in this work we focus on the following operational and management criteria listed in decreasing order of priority i minimise overflow in storage elements ii minimise safety volume violation iii minimise the water level in storage elements iv minimise the control action of pumps the predefined objectives are aggregated in a multi objective cost function to fulfill all control criteria as the evolution of the water levels is described by an approximated joint gaussian probability distribution the cost function is formulated on stochastic variables the overall cost of the control problem is formed as expected values given by 21 l t e w 1 ϵ t 2 λ 1 i w 2 ξ t 2 λ 2 ii w 3 h t 2 λ 3 iii w 4 δ q t 2 λ 4 iv where the different control objectives are prioritized through the w weighting constants furthermore these weights also normalize each objective such that water levels and flows become comparable in magnitude cost i represents the overflow penalty where the use of slack variable ϵ represents the water level exceeding the physical bounds of the basins the amount of overflow shared between pumping stations is prioritized with the diagonal λ 1 matrix where λ 1 is diagonal and 0 λ i similarly to all λ matrices moreover the weight constant w 1 is significantly higher than any other weights as using the overflow variables is undesirable cost ii corresponds to the safety slack while cost iii penalizes the level in storage tanks and manholes by adjusting λ 3 the filling sensitivity of storage tanks or manholes can be adjusted meaning that storage nodes prone to overflows are filled slower and emptied faster than less sensitive storage elements note that cost iv on minimizing the pumpflows is formulated on the variation of the signal δ q t q t q t 1 accounting for integral action enabling smooth system response the slack variables representing overflow ϵ and the safety violation ξ are decision variables similarly to the change of flow δ q for pumps the decision variables are considered deterministic therefore the only stochastic term in eq 21 is cost iii taking the expected value of the quadratic term results in the following expression hewing et al 2020 22 e w 3 h t 2 λ 3 w 3 μ h t λ 3 2 tr λ 3 σ h t where tr is the trace operator and the expected value results in the mean μ h and the covariance σ h of the water level values 3 4 3 optimization problem bringing together the approximations of the water levels and the gaussian processes furthermore the expected values of both the constraints and cost function we introduce the tractable form of the optimization problem behind the gp mpc algorithm indicated in fig 2 the problem is given by 23a minimize δ q 0 δ q h p 1 ϵ 0 ϵ h p 1 ξ 0 ξ h p 1 i hp 1 t i w 1 ϵ i 2 λ 1 w 2 ξ i 2 λ 2 w 3 μ h i 2 λ 3 tr λ 3 σ h i w 4 δ q

along the prediction horizon h p in a receding horizon fashion note that the optimization problem is subject to the dynamic network equations in eqs 23b and 23c forming equality constraints furthermore the rain forecast d is included in these constraints as the mean and variance μ g p σ are constructed based on the z training data vector after solving the optimization problem in eq at state h 0 the resulting decision variables form an optimal control sequence of the change in pumpflows u δ q 0 δ q 1 δ q h p 1 where only the first row of u is used note that the vector of slacks ϵ and ξ are also decision variables obtained via the optimization 3 4 4 key performance indicators the proposed approach is aimed for the online automatic control of combined or separated wastewater networks the approach however serves as a toolchain not only for closed loop control but as a decision support for water practitioners information panel in fig 2 we aim to support decision making by providing key performance indicators kpis for predicting overflows assess the uncertainty of the predicted water levels and to provide information about the safety region in storage tanks the kpis are given by 24a kpi ξ 1 h p n q k 1 i 0 h p 1 ξ k i 24b kpi ϵ 1 h p n q k 1 i 0 h p 1 ϵ max k i 24c kpi δ q 1 h p h p 1 i 0 δ q i δ q i 24d kpi σ 1 h p h p 1 i 0 tr σ h i where the performance indicator in eq 24a is related to the safety bound violation the kpi in eq 24b for overflows eq 24c assesses the smooth performance of the pumping and the kpi in eq 24d is related to the amount of uncertainy along the prediction horizon h p respectively the kpi indicating the level of potential overflow is only assessed for the slack variable ϵ max corresponding to the level violation for the upper capacity limit of basins and manholes note that all kpis are averaged along the prediction horizon and considered for the entire wastewater network ideally the kpis accounting for overflows and safety violation should be zero meaning that the pumps counteract the wet and dry weather flow disturbances and they respect the safety requirements in practice the stochastic disturbances are complicated to forecast and the uncertainty in the model and in the forecast are always present additionally our kpis are also intended to indicate whether it is necessary to activate a fallback scenario in case extreme weather conditions are experienced for which the infrastructure was not designed in this case we cannot assure that our controller learns to react safely 3 4 5 implementation the control algorithm and the interfacing software to the experimental setup are available on an open source web repository https github com csocsidior lb gp based wwnetwork control the data collected during the experiments have also been attached to the web repository to allow practitioners and researchers to evaluate our implementation additionally a simulator environment replicating the topology of our laboratory equipment is also provided the algorithm has been implemented on a windows os desktop computer with a 3 6 ghz intel xeon machine with 64 gb ram and the software has been written in matlab the real time control algorithm has been interfaced with simulink and the data was obtained and locally managed at each unit of the experimental setup with a codesys soft plc in real time 3s smart software solutions gmbh the optimization problem related to the gp mpc controller has been solved via direct multiple shooting in the symbolic framework casadi andersson et al 2019 with a pimer dual interior point solver ipopt wächter and biegler 2006 for finding the hyperparameters of the gaussian processes we used the fitrgp toolbox in matlab 4 case study to show the practical feasibility of the learning based framework the controller is deployed on a laboratory setup emulating a combined wastewater network this laboratory setup enables us to prototype our control solution serving as proof of concept without the risk of compromising the operation of real world infrastructure a detailed description of the test setup can be found in val ledesma et al 2021 besides the experimental tests conducted in this paper are inspired by a real wastewater network topology located in gram denmark proposing a realistic control problem the configuration is shown in fig 4 the replicate of the network segment is a 1 80 scale of the real infrastructure therefore the resolution of the time scale and the wet and dry weather flows are scaled down accordingly specifically the diurnal pattern of wastewater is scaled to 19 min corresponding to one day in real life while the data acquisition is done at every 0 5 s the control time step is 10 s equivalent to sending a control signal every 12 min in real life besides the data used in the experiment are real wastewater and rain precipitation 1 1 the rain data has been obtained through the danish meteorological institute s open data application interface https confluence govcloud dk display fdapi the wastewater data has been obtained from the utility fredericia spildevand og energi a s in denmark it is important to note that due to the limitations of the experimental setup the proper characterization of the runoff dynamics is out of scope in this study therefore both the rain and wastewater discharges have been emulated based on the historical flow measurements however the forecast of the rain is provided from outside of the optimization problem statement and therefore our method and structure are still valid and remain the same for real world implementation where the synchronization of the rain and wastewater flows is characterized properly the experimental setup consists of an upstream and downstream pumping station connected via a sewer pipe where the water volumes are transported with pumps lateral inflow from household areas enters the system by discharging wastewater at the middle point of the pipeline as indicated in fig 4 the laboratory setup is equipped with level sensors distributed along the open channel pipes and storage tanks together with flow sensors at the pumping stations although flow estimation is given by eq 2 we simply use the available sensors on the setup following the methods in section 3 the nominal model of the network is assessed specifically we have n q 2 pumping stations n p 1 level sensor in pipes and n t 2 at the stations the dry and wet weather flows enter the system at n d 2 points where rain infiltrates the system at pumping station t 1 the training data array for identifying the data driven part of the model in eq 5 is constructed as z t h t q t d t t where the level and flow signals at time t are given by 25 h t h t 1 t h t 2 t h p 3 t 26 q t q t 1 t q t 2 t out of the four available level sensors in manholes we use h p 3 placed after the connection of the lateral inflow pipe we argue that the sensor measurement located at this point captures sufficient information to model how the pump q t 1 and disturbance flows q p 3 enter the channel then the nominal parameters of the wastewater network are given by 27 a i 2 2 0 2 1 0 1 2 0 b t s τ t 1 0 0 t s τ t 2 0 1 2 where t s denotes the sampling time of the controller while τ 1 and τ 2 are the storage tank parameters representing the geometry and size of the tanks it is important to note that the experiments are carried out such that the water recirculates in the system meaning that the flows and volumes need to be balanced for this reason the controlled pumps cannot turn off to zero flows as expected in a real world implementation instead the operating range of the pumped flows is lifted to a value where the network can run for long experiments without emptying the rain inflow and household area auxiliary tanks 5 results and discussion 5 1 residual model training given the physical model the residuals y r 3 can be constructed based on the water level measurements h r 3 as stated in section 3 2 beyond the sensor availability knowledge of the physical system plays a significant role in the training efficiency of the model to find the hyperparameters for each gp the dimension of the training data set is reduced according to eq 10 by using the slicing matrices these matrices define which dimensions of the original training set z influence the given residual based on the topological layout of the system matrices s are mapped to a lower dimension than n z where the hyper parameters σ l are picked that are physically relevant to parameterize the given residual in our specific case study to train the gp on residual y 1 corresponding to the upstream tank t 1 the predictors q t 1 4 the rain forecasts d 6 and the time t 7 are used hence only three hyper parameters are employed instead of using the full size n z 7 inputs and the corresponding hyper parameters this is well aligned with our physical insights as we can observe from the visual inspection of the water level variation in the upstream tank that both the dry and wet weather flows and the corresponding pumps influence the signal the illustration of the feature selection is shown in fig 5 the collected measurement data for training is obtained under the nominal operation of the network we consider the nominal operation of pumping stations when pumps operate with threshold based control rules most commonly applied by wastewater utilities lund et al 2018 to test the modelling capabilities of the gaussian process model fitted to the residuals the collected data have been divided into a training and validation sets the gp models have been trained on 80 of the collected data set corresponding to 60 days of on off operation the rest of the data 15 days have been used for validating the results fig 6 shows the three residuals constructed from the measurement data h obtained via the level sensors it is seen from these results that the predictions with the gp model match the level residual observations within the validation period in the two tanks and the pipes furthermore except for some outlier points the confidence interval characterized by the variance of the gp process covers the distribution of the data points well the variations in the data are primarily due to the noise and the measuring precision of the sensors as seen in residual y 1 removing the effect of the nominal dynamics from the original level signal results in the daily diurnal level variation patterns induced by the dry weather discharges and level peaks due to the wet weather rain precipitation it is worth noting that the performance of our level predictions using rain forecasts is underpinned by the fact whether we observed rain episodes similar to the current forecast before besides note that our experimental test setup has physical limitations of how different rain flow profiles we can create this might partly explain why our final model exhibited such suitable performance in predicting the combined level variations e g residual y 1 in fig 6 the data describing residual y 2 are related to the level variations induced by the discharged pump flow coming from the upstream station t 1 and the lateral inflow coming from the household area note that the level variations due to the pumping activity of such pumps sitting at the downstream station are not visible on the signal in fig 6 as we removed the pump flow time series scaled to the level variations in the tank it is seen from the signal that the diurnal lateral flows q p 3 coming from upstream induce the level variations in the downstream tank lastly residual y 3 describes exactly the level variations in the pipe without any modifications as the dynamics of flow propagation in pipes are not characterized by any physically based nominal dynamics in our study incorporating physical knowledge e g travel time level attenuation into the pipe residual model is of course possible in specific cases but ignored in this initial evaluation investigation of this will be reserved for future studies as seen the variations mainly occur due to the dry weather lateral inflow from the household area which we desire to capture through this signal while the jumps observed in both the predictions and the data are due to the pumping cycles coming from the upstream station so far we verified our assumptions on the input selection based on our physical insights however it is crucial to make sure that our model captures the correlation between each input dimension of the training set z used for the residual predictions since the gp models are used to solve an optimization problem through multiple step predictions we need to make sure that the decision variables are properly captured in the model hence the following measure is introduced to measure the relevance of each input on the corresponding residuals 28 r i exp σ l i j 1 n l σ l j where r i is the normalized relevance of the i th predictor and n l is the number of length scale hyperparameters used for the given output residual the relevant data inputs receive positive values between one and zero while a value close to zero indicates irrelevant input data the comparison of input relevance corresponding to each gp model is shown in fig 7 as seen in residual y 1 the time input t used to describe the diurnal variation of wet weather flows is dominant compared to the rain forecasts d and to the pumping activity q t 1 this fact is in line with our expectations as the majority of the residual data incorporates information about the diurnal wastewater activity while the rain peaks appear less often in the time series it is also seen that the pump flow data are quite irrelevant when we predict with the model this verifies our method since the effect of the pump dynamics is part of the nominal model hence it should not affect the residual the relevance bars of residual y 2 show that the level variation in the sewer pipe discharging to the downstream tank h p 3 has a high relevance verifying our initial assumptions as the only discharge source is the flow gravitated down from the upstream tank note however that our model shows some correlation between the nominal pump flows q t 2 and the time input t a possible explanation for this fact might be that in case of high loads both pumping stations turn on approximately at the same time meaning that q t 2 and h p 3 inhabit similar characteristics moreover we select the time input to model each residual in case there are some additional periodic components in the signal not described by the level sensor in the gravity pipe lastly the water level variation in the sewer pipe is induced by the pumps upstream q t 1 and by the lateral inflow q p 3 which we model inherently by providing time t as an input it is worth noting that we do not distinguish between weekdays and weekends this means that the predicted diurnal patterns represent an average model which considers the similarity between any days in our training set 5 2 closed loop control experiment the experimental evaluation of the learning based predictive controller has been carried out with an h p 20 steps horizon which is equivalent to a four hour ahead prediction in real life it should be noted that the computational complexity of solving the optimization problem in eq 22 is highly dependent on the gp model used for learning the dry weather flows and the unmodelled dynamics from the implementation point of view propagating the uncertainty depends on the number of data points that we use in our optimization problem as μ g p and σ g p are conditioned on the observed data and therefore evaluating eq 13 has a cost growing with the number of points to overcome this issue we select a subset of m 80 data points from the d training set with a criteria that these points need to be close to the previously predicted state trajectories hence we assume that the previous solution trajectory will lie close to the current one which is fair considering that wastewater networks inhabit slowly varying dynamics although several sparse gp approximations exists hewing et al 2020 here we implement the most simple version and reserve more advanced sparse approximations for future studies furthermore we add new level pump flow and forecast points at every second control step to our data dictionary d i e we continuously learn new state action forecast pairs note that the controller is launched after the model is pre trained on the 60 days of training data previously obtained from the nominal operation hence the point selection already has a wide feature space to select from the closed loop control results obtained from our experimental setup aim to show the benefits of distributing the water level sensors in combination with using the residual based physical and gp based data driven techniques to learn the dynamics of a network scale control problem to assess the performance of the gp mpc the method is compared with a standard baseline controller meaning that we emulate the same scenarios and run the two different controllers under the same physical and control properties we aim to emphasize how an easy commissionable controller can challenge the simple baseline controllers especially when the sewer system is facing capacity problems under heavy hydrologic load lund et al 2018 in our implementation both controllers act globally and compute the flow reference signals to the local pi controllers governing the pumps to stretch both controllers to their capacity limits a period equivalent to 18 days in real life with heavy rain periods has been chosen forcing the network to overflow due to its insufficient storage capacity the results of the experiment are shown in fig 8 the figure compares both control scenarios by showing the forecasts and the discharged inflows entering the system a b the water level in each tank c d the volume of actual overflow escaping from the tanks e f and finally the control decisions at the two pumping stations made by the learning based gp mpc g h and by the on off baseline controller i j overflows are triggered several times while running the baseline controller due to the lack of collaboration between the upstream and downstream pumping stations opposed to on off operation it is clear that the gp mpc at the upstream tank shifts the timing of the pumping under heavy rain events note that the controlled flow at the upstream station q t 1 rarely reaches its upper flow limit and often reduces the outflow thereby saving the capacity downstream by delaying the flows from the upstream station the gp mpc controller allowed the downstream tank to drain and to spend less time overflowing this shift in time and the flow reduction is observed between day 1 2 and between day 14 17 looking at the control actions between the latter period day 14 and 15 the system is exposed to an extreme event where a high intensity and long duration rain event is about to be forecasted during this episode the control actions at the upstream pumping station start to oscillate when the controller realizes that the safety bounds need to be violated and the upstream tank need to use the slack variables for overflows to reduce the overall accumulated spilled volumes the kpi corresponding to the control actions is verifying this behavior shown in fig 9 for various practical reasons this action is undesirable however the upstream pumping station indeed overflows at day 16 while the water levels at the downstream basin hover just below the upper physical level limits a possible explanation for this behavior might be the type of rain event forecasted at day 14 in fig 9 in the last row the uncertainty predicted by the controller is assessed in comparison to the different forecasts short uncertainty peak can be explained by the low performance of the point selection meaning that the points selected from the feature space d are not suitably representing the currently forecasted scenario this is visible at most times instants under rain forecasts however the uncertainty remains high during the two longest rain events between day 1 2 and 14 16 respectively this fact indicates that even though the point selection with m 80 points allows solving the optimization problem under two seconds on average the prediction quality and smoothness of the control action are degraded significantly moreover our experimental tests confirm that the performance of the gp mpc is quite sensitive to the formulation and tuning of the objective function as seen from the kpis between day 14 15 the uncertainty remains high during the rain events indicating that the points we use for the predictions do not describe the forecasted scenario in a proper way at the same time the rain has a long duration and its intensity triggers overflow in the predictions however as the uncertainty grows due to the bad description of the data the controller attempts to minimize the variance to the cost of not reporting overflows note that between day 9 14 there is a relatively dry period where the controller at both stations makes the outflows of the pumps mimic the daily diurnal flow variations induced by the wastewater flowing into the system this indicates that the gaussian process part of the model predicts an average wastewater inflow with an uncertainty bound that fits the actual inflows quite well thereby the pumps exhibit smooth control actions resulting in smooth variations inside the safety region defined in the tanks marked with the blue area in fig 8 c d the results illustrated here show a number of benefits and challenges to using the gp mpc scheme to learn and predict the dry and wet weather flows from the level variations occurring in combined wastewater networks arguably the major benefit of learning from the level data is the ability to launch the controller without developing control models relying on the level to flow conversion however as the experimental tests have shown the adoption of the method is challenged by several practical issues since the effect of the inflows is handled by the gaussian processes the contribution of the data driven decision making cannot be easily explained and explicit guarantees cannot be given however using sparse approximations of the available training data sets is anticipated to increase the quality of predicting the residuals to further improve the robustness of the controller instead of choosing m exact points for the covariance matrices it is anticipated that approximating the original training data matrix with an m dimensional sparse matrix based on the point selection will improve the uncertainty propagation 6 conclusions this paper introduced a gaussian process based predictive control algorithm for the real time control of wastewater networks while flow modelling with gaussian processes has been successfully used in water systems before to our knowledge this is the first instance where the methods have been applied and verified experimentally in real time control without the use of any flow sensors the methods proposed here and our experimental tests showed promising results in using the domain knowledge combined with the data driven model to make automated decisions on a network scale the proposed control architecture has the potential to serve as either an online or an offline decision support tool to control actuators in wastewater networks predict overflows and assess the uncertainty of the decisions to that end the formulations and real time results provided by this paper should serve as a basis to support data driven predictive control as a feasible solution in wastewater networks

15773,smart control in water systems aims to reduce the cost of infrastructure expansion by better utilizing the available capacity through real time control the recent availability of sensors and advanced data processing is expected to transform the view of water system operators increasing the need for deploying a new generation of data driven control solutions to that end this paper proposes a data driven control framework for combined wastewater and stormwater networks we propose to learn the effect of wet and dry weather flows through the variation of water levels by deploying a number of level sensors in the network to tackle the challenges associated with combining hydraulic and hydrologic modelling we adopt a gaussian process based predictive control tool to capture the dynamic effect of rain and wastewater inflows while applying domain knowledge to preserve the balance of water volumes to show the practical feasibility of the approach we test the control performance on a laboratory setup inspired by the topology of a real world wastewater network we compare our method to a rule based controller currently used by the water utility operating the proposed network overall the controller learns the wastewater load and the temporal dynamics of the network and therefore significantly outperforms the baseline controller especially during high intensity rain periods finally we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the approach for practical real time control implementations keywords smart water system data driven modelling control uncertainty sewer network 1 introduction the primary function of sewers is to convey wastewater and stormwater in case of combined networks towards treatment facilities before releasing it to the environment population growth urbanization and changing precipitation patterns due to climate change cause major impacts on these networks with increased wastewater and rain loads eggimann et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 these loads often result in harmful overflows and degraded treatment performance threatening the ecological health of the water bodies and damaging the infrastructure schütze et al 2002 advanced strategies for sewer control are designed on historical weather observations raising the question of how to operate these infrastructures in the wake of ongoing urbanization and climate change 1 1 motivation to handle the increased load on old infrastructure without substantial investment a possible solution is to use advanced control methods relying on real time data and system wide optimization techniques yuan et al 2019 the increased collection and utilization of data enabled the real time management of urban water systems forming a basis for advanced decision making tools kitchin 2014 in the context of sewer networks these tools aim to prepare the system for high intensity storm events to optimally utilize the maximum available storage capacity from a control theoretic perspective proactive control e g model predictive control mpc has high relevance in sewers however in practice reactive control is the most commonly implemented approach lund et al 2018 decision making by using weather forecasts is a widely used method by researchers in the water community campisano et al 2013 a significant issue with traditional mpc is the need for a well maintained system model at small utilities such models are often economically out of reach and therefore neither decision support nor advanced control techniques are used by the practitioners lund et al 2018 easy commissioning therefore has a great impact in practice yet it is an unresolved issue when it comes to controlling wastewater networks overflows in sewers often occur due to bottlenecks induced by the slow filling times of storage elements and the significant delays of the sewage transport ocampo martinez 2010 the uncertainty associated with the weather forecasts is also an issue often deteriorating the prediction capabilities of mpc consequently handling the rain and wastewater load via control is a challenging task not only due to the forecast uncertainty but also due to the uncertainty of the modelling to justify the need for autonomous and easy commissionable control strategies we introduce first the existing methods then we detail our contributions and specify the control and modelling methods used throughout the paper finally the proposed approach is evaluated on an experimental setup using real rain and wastewater flow data from real world utilities 1 2 state of the art instrumentation forms the basis of system wide planning and automation in urban water systems eggimann et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 the data driven transformation of water system management has resulted in the deployment of a high number of sensors enabling online monitoring and data processing at many water utilities campisano et al 2013 the most widely used instrumentation in sewers is flow and level sensors often placed in tanks and manholes banik et al 2017 flow sensors are typically used for calibrating hydraulic models for planning and decision support mignot et al 2012 yuan et al 2019 as well as for modelling the hydrologic processes e g rain running off the catchments li et al 2019 placement of the actuators and the sensors is a non trivial task in distributed parameter systems such as sewer networks for instance leitão et al 2018 discusses the identification of flow control devices to enable in sewer storage in addition to physical sensors software sensors have also been developed for flow estimation utilizing mainly weather radar data pump operation and the water level variation through level sensors ahm et al 2016 chen et al 2014 kallesøe and knudsen 2016 kisi et al 2013 rjeily et al 2017 real time control in sewer networks converts the latest sensor measurements to operational decisions by the use of controllable assets e g pumps gates and valves ocampo martinez 2010 the foundation of all predictive decision making techniques is the underlying dynamic model of the system lund et al 2018 the most intuitive approach to obtain such models is to consider the physics behind the process and apply first principle hydraulic and hydrologic laws todini 2007 while maintaining the intuition behind the modelling balla et al 2022 however such models often rely on a high level of detail involving many parameters and therefore keeping them up to date is expensive and laborious schütze et al 2002 besides one of the most commonly applied first principle modelling techniques relies on sets of partial differential equations xu et al 2012 2011 often requiring prohibitively many sensors for proper calibration other physically based techniques attempt to conceptualize parts of the network e g by considering segments of the system as virtual volumes joseph duran et al 2015 mollerup et al 2016 and to simplify the model based on skeletonization of the network thrysøe et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 as a result of the increased data availability data driven modelling and control techniques have gained popularity within the urban water systems community eggimann et al 2017 data driven models often termed as black box are described by their input output characteristics where inputs typically comprise the rain forecasts while the outputs are the corresponding flows kitchin 2014 neural networks have been applied in modelling the system hydraulics dawson and wilby 2001 mounce et al 2014 vidyarthi et al 2020 and the hydrology as well chang et al 2001 duncan et al 2012 rjeily et al 2017 one of the strengths of neural networks in water systems is their generally high performance of learning complex and nonlinear input output relations on the other hand although generating solutions with neural networks is efficient they lack the physical interpretability of parameters and depend heavily on data quality mpc is a well suited approach for the optimal mitigation of sewer volumes and regulating the flows with the use of rainfall forecasts beeneken et al 2013 lund et al 2018 characterization of the forecast uncertainties has been reported by considering a multiple scenario approach in both sewers and water resource management balla et al 2020 tian et al 2017 in löwe et al 2014 2016 and vezzaro and grum 2014 the incorporation of stochastic grey box models for rainfall runoff has been considered to reduce combined overflows additionally characterization of the forecast uncertainties by learning the underlying dynamics of the flows with gaussian processes have been reported in wang et al 2016b for water distribution systems and in troutman et al 2017 for flow prediction in combined sewers reinforcement learning has shown promising results in both combined ochoa et al 2019 and storm water networks mullapudi et al 2020 while iterative learning control has been used to learn the return periods of rain events cui et al 2015 nevertheless relatively few studies report on learning based control in sewer systems learning based control is therefore a research area promising a potential alternative or supplement to the real time control of wastewater networks 1 3 contribution this paper aims to enable fully automated decision making in combined sewer systems the key innovation behind the proposed method relates to its ability to learn and make decisions in real time based on level sensor feeds and weather forecasts specifically the contributions are the following a novel data driven control approach based on the combination of hydraulic modelling and gaussian processes an economically and practically feasible predictive controller using solely in sewer water level observations uncertainty assessment regarding the system states via propagating the uncertainty through the predictions experimental overflow control validation the proposed solution has two clear benefits first in contrast to black box modelling the basic hydraulic laws are combined with data driven techniques the structure of the model preserves intuition by incorporating the physically measurable levels familiar to practitioners working in the water sector by utilizing only the easy accessible physical description of the network we make our method robust towards forecast uncertainty as well as data deficiency additionally the purchase and maintenance costs related to flow sensors are often expensive in comparison to level sensors zhang et al 2021 in this work the level to flow conversion is bypassed by establishing direct relations between the rain and water levels as well as by relating in sewer water level measurements to the level variations in the storage tanks at the pumping stations as opposed to hydraulic modelling we focus on obtaining a prediction model to evaluate the water levels without the need of the network dimensions and other particular parameters 2 problem statement the overall concept of the method is shown in fig 1 where in sewer level sensors are deployed at critical locations in manholes and basins the network topology is defined by a tree graph thrysøe et al 2019 where pumping stations are connected via gravity sewers note that the topology is simplified based on the high level piping layout thrysøe et al 2019 while the infiltration of rain and wastewater is concentrated on network nodes manholes being affected by the discharge the discharged waste and storm water are collected and pumped from station to station until the root treatment plant is reached specifically we consider the full scale of the network however only the main sewer lines between the pumping stations are modelled the configuration of our proposed control method is shown in fig 2 the models behind the controller are the physical model section 3 1 and the data driven model section 3 2 the former incorporates the physical knowledge about the dimension of basins while the latter describes the effect of rain wastewater and the uncertainties in forms of residuals by using sensor h estimation q and rain forecast d data opposed to classical methods that handle the inflows or disturbances by building individual forecasting blocks we consider the translation of rain to level variation incorporated in the controller the gaussian process based mpc controller block gp mpc section 3 4 3 stands for the optimization algorithm behind the mpc problem using a relevant cost function section 3 4 2 and the operational and physical constraints section 3 4 1 the decision support block section 3 4 4 is an information panel providing performance measures of the closed loop control performance to e g network operators in case the algorithm is used as an offline decision support tool as shown the controller provides flow setpoints to the pumping stations where the pumps operating in parallel move the water volumes at the rate of the optimal flow q optimal in this study we focus on variable speed wastewater pumping hence the hybrid behavior induced by the traditional fixed speed pump operation is not within the scope of the proposed predictive control algorithm since only water level sensors are deployed in the wastewater network the loop is closed with an observer or pumpflow estimator allowing for using soft sensing techniques or estimating the pump flows in the proposed output feedback scheme in the following we present the control scheme by describing each building block 3 methods 3 1 physical modelling the nominal model structure is described by the physical laws of wastewater transport the information we use are the the topological layout of the network the size of storage tanks and the estimated pump flow hydraulic storage elements are described with simple mass balances specifically the level change induced by pump operation is given by 1 h t t 1 a t h t t b t q t where h t r n t is the vector of water levels in storage tanks at discrete time t with n t being the number of tanks and q r n q is the vector of pump flows representing the sum of flows for each pump at the n q pumping stations the parameter matrices a t r n t n t and b t r n t n q are defined by the physical size of the storage elements i e the diameter and the discretization time step or sampling time the mass balance is described by eq 1 with the exception that the effect of inflows i e rain runoff and domestic wastewater are in general unknown hence not considered as part of the nominal storage dynamics the discharged flow of each pump at a pumping station can be accurately approximated with a polynomial expression of each pump sitting in a basin the pump flow q is related to the relative pressure the power and the speed of the pump described by the following expressions 2 q s a 0 1 ω s a 1 δ p ω s a 2 p p ω 2 s a 3 ω where q is the flow to be estimated in m 3 s ω is the rotational speed in r a d s δ h is the level difference between the wastewater basin and the outlet point and p is the relative pressure to atmospheric pressure obtained by measuring the inlet pressure and the level in the wet well note that p is in m w c i e meter water column constants a i are pump parameters describing the pump curve of the specific pump assumed to be known in this work furthermore s p p is the sum of the power consumption of p p of individual pumps s denoting the number of running pumps several implementations of flow estimation in wastewater pumping stations exist demonstrating high accuracy in practice kallesøe and knudsen 2016 the governing dynamics of the discharged flow propagation in pipes is assumed to be unknown in the nominal model therefore the nominal part of the mass balance for the entire network is given by the combination of the vector of tank levels h t and the vector of water levels h p r n p in manholes where system parameters related to pipe dynamics are zero the full nominal model is given in the standard linear state space form 3 h t 1 f h t q t a h t b q t where f represents the known part or nominal dynamics of the wastewater network and h r n h is the vector of combined water levels where n h n t n p corresponds to the number of water level sensors deployed in the entire network note that the structure of the state space model is created based on the network topology i e using the piping layout in the case of several pumping stations connected by transport pipes building the mass balance model can be easily automated by stacking the vectors of suitable dimensions of water levels in eq 1 3 2 data driven modelling the exogenous effect of dry and wet weather flows are governed by unknown dynamics that are excluded from the nominal model in eq 3 these exogenous flows induce variations in the levels in basins and the manholes consequently the flow inside the combined sewer conduits is characterized by the sum of dry weather discharge domestic wastewater and wet weather discharge delayed rainfall runoff i e q t q r t q w w t where q r and q w w are physically present due to rainfall runoff and domestic wastewater production respectively while q is the combined sewer flow we consider both combined and stormwater networks wherein the latter case the network is not influenced by dry weather flow however we do not take into account the groundwater infiltration explicitly as we rather consider it implicitly in the dry weather flows given water level sensor data h pump flow estimate q and rainfall forecast d the problem is formed by the need to learn the model parts which can complement the nominal dynamics described in eq 3 note that our method does not require to generate the q r rain impacted flows and the q w w diurnal flows as we propose to learn the relation between rain and level in the sewers with the learned model we aim to predict the evolution of water levels i e the system states for this reason we assume that the entire network dynamics are composed of a nominal and an additive unknown part the former represents the known hydraulics of the sewer network while the latter represents the rain and wastewater flow infiltrating into the system the pipes transporting the water volumes moreover the forecast and model uncertainty the combined network model is given by 4 h t 1 f h t q t b p g h t q t d t t w t where g is a nonlinear vector function governing the unknown dynamics d r n d is the vector of rainfall forecasts at n d different locations and w is the process noise w n 0 σ w w n 0 σ w following gaussian white noise distribution besides b p is a matrix mapping the nonlinear dynamics g to the full state vector h simply stated if there is a storage tank where the level variation h is not affected by uncertain inflows b p maps the lower dimensional outputs of the function g to the full state vector h by simply contributing zero to the nominal dynamics to generate input data for learning the unknown function g we use the level sensor measurements h the flow estimates q and the forecast of rainfall d note that the weather forecast d indicates how the levels are varying inside the sewers due to the infiltration of rain q r since the dry weather flow q w w typically follows a diurnal pattern the cyclical behavior correlates to time i e it is likely that the level patterns are similar at the same time of the day at a different week for this reason we provide the time of the day t as an input to the unknown function g in this way we provide information about the time periodicity of the dry weather level pattern variations for ease of notation let us define the input data as a vector 5 z h q d t to create residuals we use the data provided by the level sensors and subtract the nominal dynamics i e 6 y t g z t w t b p h t 1 f h t q t where y r n y is the vector of residuals of size n y corresponding to the number of water levels influenced by either dry or wet weather inflows besides the mapping matrix b p is inverted with the moore penrose pseudo inverse by using the level sensors distributed along the network we aim to capture the dry and wet weather sewer level dynamics in the residuals the input output set is constructed with data under nominal operation i e 7 d z i y i i 1 m where m is the number of collected data points note that the nominal operation via the on off control of the pumps might create spikes in the residual signal y and therefore removing the outliers is recommended as part of data pre processing a powerful way to represent the input output mapping of g by taking into account the forecast uncertainties is to model the relation as a gaussian process rather than claiming that the input output relation above belongs to a specific mathematical model structure a gaussian process is a nonparametric probabilistic model based on data instead of parameterizing the unknown dynamics governing the residuals we characterize their distribution hence the residual model representing one entry of y is given by 8 y g p m z σ g p i σ n 2 where the distribution of the gaussian process is fully characterized by its mean function m z and covariance σ g p we consider the mean m z as a constant equivalent to a model bias the noise variance is denoted by σ n 2 and i is the identity matrix of suitable dimension the mean and covariance are defined by 9a m z i e g z i 9b σ g p i j cov g z i g z j k z i z j where the mean m z and the covariance matrix σ g p are obtained by evaluating the mean and covariance functions given all measured data pairs in d the expected value operator is denoted by e the covariance function or kernel k establishes a measure of similarity between the function values of g specifically our model makes use of the kernel to approximate the covariance of the residual signals in this setting we assume that the sewer dynamics exhibit smooth and continuous behavior based on the slow sewer dynamics and therefore a squared exponential kernel is used to approximate the covariance function in eq 9 rasmussen and williams 2018 the squared exponential kernel is given by 10 k z i z j σ f 2 exp 1 2 z i z j s λ 1 s z i z j where the kernel is characterized by its hyper parameters σ f 2 and λ 1 diag σ l 1 2 σ l n z 2 denoting the signal variance and the length scale matrix respectively note that we use automatic relevance determination meaning that we use different length scale parameters for different dimensions of the input vector z rasmussen and williams 2018 hence the relative importance of contribution for each input is assessed using all input dimensions in eq 5 for characterizing each residual is computationally demanding considering that each level sensor and pumping data is used to evaluate the kernel function consequently the mapping matrix s maps only the physically meaningful entries in our data set d therefore the number of hyper parameters σ l used for the parameterization of the level residuals is reduced it can be shown that the posterior distribution over all possible realization of the unknown dynamics g is given by bayes rule 11 p g z y p g p y z g p y z given our problem formulation the posterior distribution simplifies to rasmussen and williams 2018 12 p g z y g p m z σ g p i σ 2 n the hyper parameters of the above problem are learned by maximizing the marginal likelihood p y z typically done via numerical approximations as the analytical evaluation of the above problem is intractable chalupka et al 2013 once the hyper parameters are identified the gaussian process model is used to predict the level residual y at a test point z using the relation y g z the problem of predicting the residual corresponds to finding the probability distribution of p y d z given the training data d a testing input z and the hyper parameters by using the kernel to approximate the covariance between the training and testing points the mean and variance of the gaussian process are reformulated i e 13a μ gp z m z k z z k zz i σ n 2 1 y m z 13b σ gp z k z z k z z k zz i σ n 2 1 k z z where k z z k z z and k z z k z z are the covariances between the training and testing points furthermore k z z is the autocovariance of the testing point note that the above derivation of the gp based residual model provides a framework to predict the physically meaningful level residuals y based on the similarity of the measured training and newly experienced target data points regarding the pump flows q water levels h and the weather forecasts d 3 3 probabilistic prediction model to plan the state of the sewer network over multiple prediction steps ahead we aim to predict the effect of wet and dry weather discharges on the water levels predicting multiple steps ahead with the gps representing g and nominal model f means that the mean and the variance of the previously predicted states are used to predict the next states hence we feed back stochastic variables as inputs in general the resulting water level distribution is non gaussian as we propagate the stochastic states through the nonlinear kernel stated in eq 10 the resulting distribution is approximated such that the water levels h and the gp dynamics are approximated at each prediction step t as jointly gaussian i e 14 h t g p t n μ t σ t μ h t μ g p t σ h t σ h g p t σ g p h t σ g p t where σ h g p σ g p h are the cross covariances between the physical and the residual water levels μ h t is the vector of mean water levels and σ h t is the covariance matrix of the water levels at time t the covariance of the water levels provides an extra measure of how uncertain we are about our prediction the pump flows q are treated as deterministic variables to find the transition probability of the full water level states including the nominal and residual contributions we apply the first order taylor expansion of the approximated joint gaussian distribution shown in eq 14 around the mean μ h t of the water levels at time step t hewing et al 2020 note that since we are concerned with the probabilistic description of the water level evolution in our prediction the characterization of the states is done by considering the expected value μ h and the governing uncertainty around it i e the variance of the water levels σ h hence the mean and variance dynamics of the water levels result in 15a μ h t 1 f μ h t q t μ g p t 15b σ h t 1 h f μ h t q t b p σ t h f μ h t q t b p where σ is the joint covariance matrix in eq 14 and h denotes the first order partial derivative with respect to the water levels note that the expected value in terms of the mean water levels is given by the sum of the mass balance based nominal dynamics f and the contribution of the residual dynamics μ g p by inserting the model into the nominal dynamics f the final form of the mean variance dynamics describing the water level evolution becomes 16a μ h t 1 a μ h t b q t b p μ g p t 16b σ h t 1 a σ h t a b p σ gp h t a a σ h gp t b p b p σ gp t b p where the co variance update and the cross co variance between the gaussian process and the water levels are given by 17a μ g p t μ g p z t 17b σ h gp t σ h h μ gp z t 17c σ gp t σ gp z t h μ gp z t σ h t μ gp z t where the input vector is given by z μ h q d t 3 4 predictive control regarding the control of large scale water systems the popularity of mpc is to a great extent due to the fact that physical and operational constraints are handled in the optimization problem according to the predictions with the model and the rain forecasts the mpc algorithm optimizes the manipulated variables flows or levels over a given prediction horizon h p of chosen length inputs are computed and evaluated to obtain a future response from the water system then the sequence of future responses is evaluated based on our cost function and we optimize until our numerical solution yields suitable inputs according to a system management policy which can be identified as optimal the optimal inputs are then sent to the actuators pumps or gates and the entire process is repeated in a receding horizon fashion in our work constraints are formed on the physical flow limits of pumps and the physical dimensions of the network e g the capacity of storage tanks and manholes the disturbances are considered as the wet and dry weather flows affecting the sewer network in terms of wastewater flow and rain runoff among which the latter is of highly stochastic nature the forecast of these exogenous signals is typically done in terms of nowcasting and forecasting nowcasts are obtained by rainfall radars providing sufficient spatial and temporal reliability up to two hours while forecasts span over a longer time horizon 3 4 1 constraints both physical and operational constraints are formulated for the optimization problem associated with the gp mpc strategy we consider the sum of each pump unit at the pumping station hence the constraint on the manipulated flows is given by 18 h q q t b q where b q q max q min r 2 n q is the vector of upper and lower flow bounds at each pumping station i e the maximum and minimum sum of flow that a station can provide furthermore the matrix h q i n q i n q maps the vector of pump flow variables q to the suitable dimensions of b q constraints on the system states pose limitations on the maximum and minimum water levels often the bounds correspond to the capacity of a manhole or a basin from the physical point of view it is evident that a combined wastewater network is best prepared for a high intensity rain event if basins are emptied beforehand keeping the water levels as low as possible is particularly important before a storm event as water volumes might need to be used to the maximum capacity of the piping network considering the uncertain nature of rain forecasts and the dynamic nature of wastewater flow patterns the goal of the controller is to reject the wet and dry weather inflows in this study we adapt some ideas from predictive control in water distribution networks grosso et al 2014 wang et al 2016a where we introduce an operational constraint this operational criterion keeps the levels in storage tanks within a specific safety range instead of forcing them to a reference the functionality of this constraint is to allow the controller to operate the level freely by penalizing only level values which violate the safety bounds the safety bounds and the operating capacity are illustrated in fig 3 while the minimum and maximum level values of the physical capacity constraints are evident the determination of the safety bounds is crucial to achieving a proper performance of the closed loop control strategy we argue that the safety bounds are placed best at the lower region of tanks as the system remains emptied and prepared in case of an unexpected storm event furthermore to limit odor problems due to retention while finding the optimal placement of the safety region is out of scope here it is reserved for future simulation studies introducing the nonlinear kernel and propagating the uncertainties with the gaussian processes result in system states water levels being probabilistic following a gaussian distribution hence the state constraints need to be treated stochastic in this study we formulate probabilistic constraints in terms of chance constraints wang et al 2016a i e 19a p h h t b α 19b p h s h t b s α s where eq 19a describes the constraint on the physical capacity of storage elements while eq 19b describes the constraint on the safety region the operator p is the probability that the inequality is satisfied with α and α s being the confidence levels furthermore the mapping matrices h h i n h i n h and h s i n h t i n h t map the vector of water levels h to suitable size of b h t max h t min and b s h s max h s min water level bounds respectively note that the lower bounds corresponding to b are defined by the minimum volume in the wet wells to avoid the dry run of the pumps under our assumptions that h is jointly gaussian with the residuals y the above probabilistic expressions can be reformulated as convex deterministic constraints hewing et al 2020 wang et al 2016a the constraints are given by 20a h μ h t b h ϵ ϵ t c h diag σ h t 1 2 20b h s μ h t b s h ξ ξ t c s h s diag σ h t 1 2 where the actual water level values are replaced by their expected or mean values μ h furthermore we introduce a term called the vector of critical values c ϕ α 1 where ϕ is the vector of inverse cumulative distribution function or quantile of the standard gaussian distribution evaluated at α these quantiles can be precomputed and used as constant values the operator denotes element by element multiplication and the slack terms ϵ ϵ max ϵ min and ξ ξ max ξ min denote vectors of relaxation variables standing for safety violation and overflow respectively the mapping matrices h r 2 n h n h and h s r 2 n t n t map the mean water level μ h and variance σ h to the suitable dimensions of the maximum and minimum water level bounds b and b s note that the additional term in eq 20 corresponds to the tightening of the original bounds conditioned on the evolution of the water level variances along the prediction horizon as expected the longer we predict into the future the higher the variances grow due to the model and forecast uncertainties to avoid recursive infeasibility the slack variables ξ and ϵ are utilized to soften the constraints 3 4 2 cost function the cost function is the key component in the design of the gp mpc in general the formulation of the control problem relates to the manipulation of water volumes to avoid undesirable overflows and water surges outside the main sewer lines from the control point of view we focus on the rejection of the stochastic meteorological rain runoff and human wastewater flow loads aiming to avoid the physical constraint violations resulting in overflows or water surges although here we propose a specific objective function there is a flexibility of either removing or adding control objectives simply by adding new control goals for example the control strategy may vary according to the infrastructure design e g the inclusion of treatment plant objectives may be crucial to add in combined networks with high wastewater load in this work we focus on the following operational and management criteria listed in decreasing order of priority i minimise overflow in storage elements ii minimise safety volume violation iii minimise the water level in storage elements iv minimise the control action of pumps the predefined objectives are aggregated in a multi objective cost function to fulfill all control criteria as the evolution of the water levels is described by an approximated joint gaussian probability distribution the cost function is formulated on stochastic variables the overall cost of the control problem is formed as expected values given by 21 l t e w 1 ϵ t 2 λ 1 i w 2 ξ t 2 λ 2 ii w 3 h t 2 λ 3 iii w 4 δ q t 2 λ 4 iv where the different control objectives are prioritized through the w weighting constants furthermore these weights also normalize each objective such that water levels and flows become comparable in magnitude cost i represents the overflow penalty where the use of slack variable ϵ represents the water level exceeding the physical bounds of the basins the amount of overflow shared between pumping stations is prioritized with the diagonal λ 1 matrix where λ 1 is diagonal and 0 λ i similarly to all λ matrices moreover the weight constant w 1 is significantly higher than any other weights as using the overflow variables is undesirable cost ii corresponds to the safety slack while cost iii penalizes the level in storage tanks and manholes by adjusting λ 3 the filling sensitivity of storage tanks or manholes can be adjusted meaning that storage nodes prone to overflows are filled slower and emptied faster than less sensitive storage elements note that cost iv on minimizing the pumpflows is formulated on the variation of the signal δ q t q t q t 1 accounting for integral action enabling smooth system response the slack variables representing overflow ϵ and the safety violation ξ are decision variables similarly to the change of flow δ q for pumps the decision variables are considered deterministic therefore the only stochastic term in eq 21 is cost iii taking the expected value of the quadratic term results in the following expression hewing et al 2020 22 e w 3 h t 2 λ 3 w 3 μ h t λ 3 2 tr λ 3 σ h t where tr is the trace operator and the expected value results in the mean μ h and the covariance σ h of the water level values 3 4 3 optimization problem bringing together the approximations of the water levels and the gaussian processes furthermore the expected values of both the constraints and cost function we introduce the tractable form of the optimization problem behind the gp mpc algorithm indicated in fig 2 the problem is given by 23a minimize δ q 0 δ q h p 1 ϵ 0 ϵ h p 1 ξ 0 ξ h p 1 i hp 1 t i w 1 ϵ i 2 λ 1 w 2 ξ i 2 λ 2 w 3 μ h i 2 λ 3 tr λ 3 σ h i w 4 δ q

ξ ξ i c s h s diag σ h i 1 2 23h ϵ i 0 and ξ i 0 23i μ g p i σ g p i according to eq 13 23j σ i according to eq 14 23k μ h 0 h i σ h 0 0 where the minimization is solved at time t for every i 0 h p 1 along the prediction horizon h p in a receding horizon fashion note that the optimization problem is subject to the dynamic network equations in eqs 23b and 23c forming equality constraints furthermore the rain forecast d is included in these constraints as the mean and variance μ g p σ are constructed based on the z training data vector after solving the optimization problem in eq at state h 0 the resulting decision variables form an optimal control sequence of the change in pumpflows u δ q 0 δ q 1 δ q h p 1 where only the first row of u is used note that the vector of slacks ϵ and ξ are also decision variables obtained via the optimization 3 4 4 key performance indicators the proposed approach is aimed for the online automatic control of combined or separated wastewater networks the approach however serves as a toolchain not only for closed loop control but as a decision support for water practitioners information panel in fig 2 we aim to support decision making by providing key performance indicators kpis for predicting overflows assess the uncertainty of the predicted water levels and to provide information about the safety region in storage tanks the kpis are given by 24a kpi ξ 1 h p n q k 1 i 0 h p 1 ξ k i 24b kpi ϵ 1 h p n q k 1 i 0 h p 1 ϵ max k i 24c kpi δ q 1 h p h p 1 i 0 δ q i δ q i 24d kpi σ 1 h p h p 1 i 0 tr σ h i where the performance indicator in eq 24a is related to the safety bound violation the kpi in eq 24b for overflows eq 24c assesses the smooth performance of the pumping and the kpi in eq 24d is related to the amount of uncertainy along the prediction horizon h p respectively the kpi indicating the level of potential overflow is only assessed for the slack variable ϵ max corresponding to the level violation for the upper capacity limit of basins and manholes note that all kpis are averaged along the prediction horizon and considered for the entire wastewater network ideally the kpis accounting for overflows and safety violation should be zero meaning that the pumps counteract the wet and dry weather flow disturbances and they respect the safety requirements in practice the stochastic disturbances are complicated to forecast and the uncertainty in the model and in the forecast are always present additionally our kpis are also intended to indicate whether it is necessary to activate a fallback scenario in case extreme weather conditions are experienced for which the infrastructure was not designed in this case we cannot assure that our controller learns to react safely 3 4 5 implementation the control

interior point solver ipopt wächter and biegler 2006 for finding the hyperparameters of the gaussian processes we used the fitrgp toolbox in matlab 4 case study to show the practical feasibility of the learning based framework the controller is deployed on a laboratory setup emulating a combined wastewater network this laboratory setup enables us to prototype our control solution serving as proof of concept without the risk of compromising the operation of real world infrastructure a detailed description of the test setup can be found in val ledesma et al 2021 besides the experimental tests conducted in this paper are inspired by a real wastewater network topology located in gram denmark proposing a realistic control problem the configuration is shown in fig 4 the replicate of the network segment is a 1 80 scale of the real infrastructure therefore the resolution of the time scale and the wet and dry weather flows are scaled down accordingly specifically the diurnal pattern of wastewater is scaled to 19 min corresponding to one day in real life while the data acquisition is done at every 0 5 s the control time step is 10 s equivalent to sending a control signal every 12 min in real life besides the data used in the experiment are real wastewater and rain precipitation 1 1 the rain data has been obtained through the danish meteorological institute s open data application interface https confluence govcloud dk display fdapi the wastewater data has been obtained from the utility fredericia spildevand og energi a s in denmark it is important to note that due to the limitations of the experimental setup the proper characterization of the runoff dynamics is out of scope in this study therefore both the rain and wastewater discharges have been emulated based on the historical flow measurements however the forecast of the rain is provided from outside of the optimization problem statement and therefore our method and structure are still valid and remain the same for real world implementation where the synchronization of the rain and wastewater flows is characterized properly the experimental setup consists of an upstream and downstream pumping station connected via a sewer pipe where the water volumes are transported with pumps lateral inflow from household areas enters the system by discharging wastewater at the middle point of the pipeline as indicated in fig 4 the laboratory setup is equipped with level sensors distributed along the open channel pipes and storage tanks together with flow sensors at the pumping stations although flow estimation is given by eq 2 we simply use the available sensors on the setup following the methods in section 3 the nominal model of the network is assessed specifically we have n q 2 pumping stations n p 1 level sensor in pipes and n t 2 at the stations the dry and wet weather flows enter the system at n d 2 points where rain infiltrates the system at pumping station t 1 the training data array for identifying the data driven part of the model in eq 5 is constructed as z t h t q t d t t where the level and flow signals at time t are given by 25 h t h t 1 t h t 2 t h p 3 t 26 q t q t 1 t q t 2 t out of the four available level sensors in manholes we use h p 3 placed after the connection of the lateral inflow pipe we argue that the sensor measurement located at this point captures sufficient information to model how the pump q t 1 and disturbance flows q p 3 enter the channel then the nominal parameters of the wastewater network are given by 27 a i 2 2 0 2 1 0 1 2 0 b t s τ t 1 0 0 t s τ t 2 0 1 2 where t s denotes the sampling time of the controller while τ 1 and τ 2 are the storage tank parameters representing the geometry and size of the tanks it is important to note that the experiments are carried out such that the water recirculates in the system meaning that the flows and volumes need to be balanced for this reason the controlled pumps cannot turn off to zero flows as expected in a real world implementation instead the operating range of the pumped flows is lifted to a value where the network can run for long experiments without emptying the rain inflow and household area auxiliary tanks 5 results and discussion 5 1 residual model training given the physical model the residuals y r 3 can be constructed based on the water level measurements h r 3 as stated in section 3 2 beyond the sensor availability knowledge of the physical system plays a significant role in the training efficiency of the model to find the hyperparameters for each gp the dimension of the training data set is reduced according to eq 10 by using the slicing matrices these matrices define which dimensions of the original training set z influence the given residual based on the topological layout of the system matrices s are mapped to a lower dimension than n z where the hyper parameters σ l are picked that are physically relevant to parameterize the given residual in our specific case study to train the gp on residual y 1 corresponding to the upstream tank t 1 the predictors q t 1 4 the rain forecasts d 6 and the time t 7 are used hence only three hyper parameters are employed instead of using the full size n z 7 inputs and the corresponding hyper parameters this is well aligned with our physical insights as we can observe from the visual inspection of the water level variation in the upstream tank that both the dry and wet weather flows and the corresponding pumps influence the signal the illustration of the feature selection is shown in fig 5 the collected measurement data for training is obtained under the nominal operation of the network we consider the nominal operation of pumping stations when pumps operate with threshold based control rules most commonly applied by wastewater utilities lund et al 2018 to test the modelling capabilities of the gaussian process model fitted to the residuals the collected data have been divided into a training and validation sets the gp models have been trained on 80 of the collected data set corresponding to 60 days of on off operation the rest of the data 15 days have been used for validating the results fig 6 shows the three residuals constructed from the measurement data h obtained via the level sensors it is seen from these results that the predictions with the gp model match the level residual observations within the validation period in the two tanks and the pipes furthermore except for some outlier points the confidence interval characterized by the variance of the gp process covers the distribution of the data points well the variations in the data are primarily due to the noise and the measuring precision of the sensors as seen in residual y 1 removing the effect of the nominal dynamics from the original level signal results in the daily diurnal level variation patterns induced by the dry weather discharges and level peaks due to the wet weather rain precipitation it is worth noting that the performance of our level predictions using rain forecasts is underpinned by the fact whether we observed rain episodes similar to the current forecast before besides note that our experimental test setup has physical limitations of how different rain flow profiles we can create this might partly explain why our final model exhibited such suitable performance in predicting the combined level variations e g residual y 1 in fig 6 the data describing residual y 2 are related to the level variations induced by the discharged pump flow coming from the upstream station t 1 and the lateral inflow coming from the household area note that the level variations due to the pumping activity of such pumps sitting at the downstream station are not visible on the signal in fig 6 as we removed the pump flow time series scaled to the level variations in the tank it is seen from the signal that the diurnal lateral flows q p 3 coming from upstream induce the level variations in the downstream tank lastly residual y 3 describes exactly the level variations in the pipe without any modifications as the dynamics of flow propagation in pipes are not characterized by any physically based nominal dynamics in our study incorporating physical knowledge e g travel time level attenuation into the pipe residual model is of course possible in specific cases but ignored in this initial evaluation investigation of this will be reserved for future studies as seen the variations mainly occur due to the dry weather lateral inflow from the household area which we desire to capture through this signal while the jumps observed in both the predictions and the data are due to the pumping cycles coming from the upstream station so far we verified our assumptions on the input selection based on our physical insights however it is crucial to make sure that our model captures the correlation between each input dimension of the training set z used for the residual predictions since the gp models are used to solve an optimization problem through multiple step predictions we need to make sure that the decision variables are properly captured in the model hence the following measure is introduced to measure the relevance of each input on the corresponding residuals 28 r i exp σ l i j 1 n l σ l j where r i is the normalized relevance of the i th predictor and n l is the number of length scale hyperparameters used for the given output residual the relevant data inputs receive positive values between one and zero while a value close to zero indicates irrelevant input data the comparison of input relevance corresponding to each gp model is shown in fig 7 as seen in residual y 1 the time input t used to describe the diurnal variation of wet weather flows is dominant compared to the rain forecasts d and to the pumping activity q t 1 this fact is in line with our expectations as the majority of the residual data incorporates information about the diurnal wastewater activity while the rain peaks appear less often in the time series it is also seen that the pump flow data are quite irrelevant when we predict with the model this verifies our method since the effect of the pump dynamics is part of the nominal model hence it should not affect the residual the relevance bars of residual y 2 show that the level variation in the sewer pipe discharging to the downstream tank h p 3 has a high relevance verifying our initial assumptions as the only discharge source is the flow gravitated down from the upstream tank note however that our model shows some correlation between the nominal pump flows q t 2 and the time input t a possible explanation for this fact might be that in case of high loads both pumping stations turn on approximately at the same time meaning that q t 2 and h p 3 inhabit similar characteristics moreover we select the time input to model each residual in case there are some additional periodic components in the signal not described by the level sensor in the gravity pipe lastly the water level variation in the sewer pipe is induced by the pumps upstream q t 1 and by the lateral inflow q p 3 which we model inherently by providing time t as an input it is worth noting that we do not distinguish between weekdays and weekends this means that the predicted diurnal patterns represent an average model which considers the similarity between any days in our training set 5 2 closed loop control experiment the experimental evaluation of the learning based predictive controller has been carried out with an h p 20 steps horizon which is equivalent to a four hour ahead prediction in real life it should be noted that the computational complexity of solving the optimization problem in eq 22 is highly dependent on the gp model used for learning the dry weather flows and the unmodelled dynamics from the implementation point of view propagating the uncertainty depends on the number of data points that we use in our optimization problem as μ g p and σ g p are conditioned on the observed data and therefore evaluating eq 13 has a cost growing with the number of points to overcome this issue we select a subset of m 80 data points from the d training set with a criteria that these points need to be close to the previously predicted state trajectories hence we assume that the previous solution trajectory will lie close to the current one which is fair considering that wastewater networks inhabit slowly varying dynamics although several sparse gp approximations exists hewing et al 2020 here we implement the most simple version and reserve more advanced sparse approximations for future studies furthermore we add new level pump flow and forecast points at every second control step to our data dictionary d i e we continuously learn new state action forecast pairs note that the controller is launched after the model is pre trained on the 60 days of training data previously obtained from the nominal operation hence the point selection already has a wide feature space to select from the closed loop control results obtained from our experimental setup aim to show the benefits of distributing the water level sensors in combination with using the residual based physical and gp based data driven techniques to learn the dynamics of a network scale control problem to assess the performance of the gp mpc the method is compared with a standard baseline controller meaning that we emulate the same scenarios and run the two different controllers under the same physical and control properties we aim to emphasize how an easy commissionable controller can challenge the simple baseline controllers especially when the sewer system is facing capacity problems under heavy hydrologic load lund et al 2018 in our implementation both controllers act globally and compute the flow reference signals to the local pi controllers governing the pumps to stretch both controllers to their capacity limits a period equivalent to 18 days in real life with heavy rain periods has been chosen forcing the network to overflow due to its insufficient storage capacity the results of the experiment are shown in fig 8 the figure compares both control scenarios by showing the forecasts and the discharged inflows entering the system a b the water level in each tank c d the volume of actual overflow escaping from the tanks e f and finally the control decisions at the two pumping stations made by the learning based gp mpc g h and by the on off baseline controller i j overflows are triggered several times while running the baseline controller due to the lack of collaboration between the upstream and downstream pumping stations opposed to on off operation it is clear that the gp mpc at the upstream tank shifts the timing of the pumping under heavy rain events note that the controlled flow at the upstream station q t 1 rarely reaches its upper flow limit and often reduces the outflow thereby saving the capacity downstream by delaying the flows from the upstream station the gp mpc controller allowed the downstream tank to drain and to spend less time overflowing this shift in time and the flow reduction is observed between day 1 2 and between day 14 17 looking at the control actions between the latter period day 14 and 15 the system is exposed to an extreme event where a high intensity and long duration rain event is about to be forecasted during this episode the control actions at the upstream pumping station start to oscillate when the controller realizes that the safety bounds need to be violated and the upstream tank need to use the slack variables for overflows to reduce the overall accumulated spilled volumes the kpi corresponding to the control actions is verifying this behavior shown in fig 9 for various practical reasons this action is undesirable however the upstream pumping station indeed overflows at day 16 while the water levels at the downstream basin hover just below the upper physical level limits a possible explanation for this behavior might be the type of rain event forecasted at day 14 in fig 9 in the last row the uncertainty predicted by the controller is assessed in comparison to the different forecasts short uncertainty peak can be explained by the low performance of the point selection meaning that the points selected from the feature space d are not suitably representing the currently forecasted scenario this is visible at most times instants under rain forecasts however the uncertainty remains high during the two longest rain events between day 1 2 and 14 16 respectively this fact indicates that even though the point selection with m 80 points allows solving the optimization problem under two seconds on average the prediction quality and smoothness of the control action are degraded significantly moreover our experimental tests confirm that the performance of the gp mpc is quite sensitive to the formulation and tuning of the objective function as seen from the kpis between day 14 15 the uncertainty remains high during the rain events indicating that the points we use for the predictions do not describe the forecasted scenario in a proper way at the same time the rain has a long duration and its intensity triggers overflow in the predictions however as the uncertainty grows due to the bad description of the data the controller attempts to minimize the variance to the cost of not reporting overflows note that between day 9 14 there is a relatively dry period where the controller at both stations makes the outflows of the pumps mimic the daily diurnal flow variations induced by the wastewater flowing into the system this indicates that the gaussian process part of the model predicts an average wastewater inflow with an uncertainty bound that fits the actual inflows quite well thereby the pumps exhibit smooth control actions resulting in smooth variations inside the safety region defined in the tanks marked with the blue area in fig 8 c d the results illustrated here show a number of benefits and challenges to using the gp mpc scheme to learn and predict the dry and wet weather flows from the level variations occurring in combined wastewater networks arguably the major benefit of learning from the level data is the ability to launch the controller without developing control models relying on the level to flow conversion however as the experimental tests have shown the adoption of the method is challenged by several practical issues since the effect of the inflows is handled by the gaussian processes the contribution of the data driven decision making cannot be easily explained and explicit guarantees cannot be given however using sparse approximations of the available training data sets is anticipated to increase the quality of predicting the residuals to further improve the robustness of the controller instead of choosing m exact points for the covariance matrices it is anticipated that approximating the original training data matrix with an m dimensional sparse matrix based on the point selection will improve the uncertainty propagation 6 conclusions this paper introduced a gaussian process based predictive control algorithm for the real time control of wastewater networks while flow modelling with gaussian processes has been successfully used in water systems before to our knowledge this is the first instance where the methods have been applied and verified experimentally in real time control without the use of any flow sensors the methods proposed here and our experimental tests showed promising results in using the domain knowledge combined with the data driven model to make automated decisions on a network scale the proposed control architecture has the potential to serve as either an online or an offline decision support tool to control actuators in wastewater networks predict overflows and assess the uncertainty of the decisions to that end the formulations and real time results provided by this paper should serve as a basis to support data driven predictive control as a feasible solution in wastewater networks further research on how the flow and level propagation in the transport pipes could be incorporated into the nominal dynamics promises a potential for improvement in the robustness of the proposed

15774,microplastic mp pollution in soil subsurface environments has been increasingly researched given the uncertainties associated with the heterogeneous matrix of these systems in this study we tracked the spectroscopic signatures of mp derived dissolved organic matter mp dom in infiltrated water from mp contaminated sandy subsurface systems and examined their potential to form trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas by chlorination sand packed columns with commercial mps expanded polystyrene and polyvinylchloride on the upper layer were used as the model systems regardless of the plastic type the addition of mps resulted in a higher amount of dom during infiltration compared with the clean sand system this enhancement was more pronounced when the added mps were uv irradiated for 14 days the infiltration was further characterized using ft ir and fluorescence spectroscopy which identified two fluorescent components humic like c1 and protein phenol like c2 compared with pure mp dom c1 was more predominant in sand infiltration than c2 further studies have established that c2 may be more labile in terms of biodegradation and mineral adsorption that may occur within the sand column however both these environmental interferences were inadequate for entirely expanding the spectroscopic signatures of mp dom in sand infiltration the infiltration also exhibited a higher potential in generating carbonaceous disinfection byproducts than natural groundwater and riverside bank filtrates a significant correlation between the generated thms and decreased c1 suggests the possibility of using humic like components as optical precursors of carbonaceous dbps in mp contaminated subsurface systems this study highlighted an overlooked contribution of mps in terms of the infiltration of dom levels in sandy subsurface systems and the potential environmental risk when used as drinking water sources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics dissolved organic matter sand infiltration fluorescence uv aging disinfection byproducts data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction micro sized plastic i e microplastics or mps pollution is widely known to pose one of the greatest anthropogenically induced threats to global ecosystems in both freshwater and marine ecosystems the occurrence of substantial levels of mps is nearly ubiquitous and threatening as recent reports indicate their negative environmental impacts gola et al 2021 li et al 2020 however the effects of residual plastic waste on terrestrial environments remain poorly understood huang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 a few recent studies reported that approximately 79 of plastic waste is deposited in landfills worldwide geyer et al 2017 ng et al 2018 plastic contamination up to a maximum of 67 500 mg kg of soil has also been reported in the natural soil environment including croplands floodplains beaches and industrial grounds fuller and gautam 2016 scheurer and bigalke 2018 zhang and liu 2018 zhou et al 2018 mps in soil can be transported into underground aquifers through vertical migration thereby affecting groundwater quality o connor et al 2019 demonstrated an accelerated vertical mobility of mps in a sandy soil column based on an apparent linear relationship between the penetration depth and the number of wet dry cycles more recently the actual range of mps in natural groundwater in both estuarine and agricultural regions ranged from 4 2 to 90 particles per liter samandra et al 2022 selvam et al 2021 the types of plastic materials accumulated in either the soil or in the aquifer may span from non floating debris with a relatively high density such as polyvinyl chloride pvc fuller and gautam 2016 samandra et al 2022 to buoyant plastics such as expanded polystyrene eps esiukova et al 2021 xie et al 2021 a major portion of wasted mps originates from larger plastic products that might be broken down in situ signifying the extent of natural aging or weathering processes occurring during transport into either terrestrial or aquatic systems plastic leachate or mp dissolved organic matter mp dom has recently been deemed a hidden threat to aquatic environments in terms of ecotoxicity and disinfection byproduct precursors gunaalan et al 2020 lee et al 2020b ultraviolet uv irradiation or uv aging is also considered a robust catalyst for producing mp dom which commonly comprises multiple organic compounds e g additives and various carbon chain scission products gewert et al 2018 potthoff et al 2017 several studies demonstrating enhanced release of dissolved organic substances from mps under uv irradiation support these findings lee et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 although recent studies have focused on the occurrence of mp dom and its effects on aquatic environments issues related to aged mps remain a compelling topic of research alimi et al 2022 many studies have documented the practical applications of fluorescence spectroscopy or excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis eem parafac for monitoring or tracking subsurface water quality nowicki et al 2019 sorensen et al 2018 notable examples include the use of the fluorescence signature of petroleum derived dom for detecting petroleum pollution in groundwater dvorski et al 2016 podgorski et al 2018 only a few attempts to identify the unique spectroscopic features of mp dom from commercial plastics have been undertaken lee et al 2021a 2020a furthermore no effort has been undertaken to track changes in the spectroscopic signature of mp dom in subsurface systems or to examine potential environmental interference during downward transport the fate and environmental behavior of mp dom strongly depends on biogeochemical processes e g microbial degradation and adsorption on minerals through the transport process lee and hur 2020 romera castillo et al 2018 if mp dom remains in subsurface systems mp dom in infiltrated water or groundwater could potentially serve as the precursor of disinfection byproducts upon chlorination as a drinking water source ateia et al 2020 lee et al 2020b the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts dbps following chlorination is an unavoidable consequence and arguably is considered one of the most critical risks of dom to aquatic ecosystems and human health furthermore some mps containing flame retardants can release bromine ions br into surrounding water making the dbp species into more toxic brominated dbp compounds ateia et al 2020 yang et al 2014 previous studies have revealed that fluorescence spectroscopy could be used to predict dbp formation potentials in dom samples with the proper humic like signals chen and westerhoff 2010 li et al 2016 considering these earlier efforts the aims of this study were to 1 compare the amount of dom in the infiltration between clean sand systems and systems artificially contaminated with mps 2 track the spectroscopic signature of mp dom in the infiltration through fluorescence eem and ftir and 3 examine the potential presence of mp dom in the infiltration serving as dbp precursors trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas upon chlorination 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of microplastics expanded polystyrene eps and polyvinylchloride pvc were selected as representative plastics in this study expanded polystyrene eps and polyvinylchloride pvc were selected as the representative plastics in this study eps represents buoyant plastic types with a relatively low density which is likely to be impacted by sunlight in aquatic environments compared to the non floating pvc particles in contrast non floating pvc tends to sink into deep water or the bottom commercial plastics were purchased in sheet form 1 mm in thickness for pvc and as beads 1 mm in diameter for eps from a local market in seoul south korea the pvc sheet was cut into pieces with dimensions of approximately 1 mm 1 mm the prepared pieces were thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove impurities that may have been introduced into the material during sample handling the washing process was sufficient to obtain clean mp pieces a group of mps was subjected to uv irradiation for 14 days to simulate plastic pieces previously exposed to sunlight for an extended period of time i e uv aged mps the irradiation time was determined using the method in a study that reported a significant difference in mps with exposure time lambert and wagner 2016 for the irradiation benchmark 0 9 mg of each mp i e eps and pvc was transferred to six autoclaved cylindrical quartz tubes without water solution i e dry condition a stirrer was placed at the bottom of each tube for homogeneous exposure to uv light and the tubes were placed in the middle of a closed cabinet with 6 8 w uva lamps sankyo denki f8t5bl as a light source inside the cabinet the light intensity in the closed cabinet was equivalent to that of natural solar exposure in seoul south korea which was approximately 4000 μw cm2 based on an ultraviolet meter model 850 009 sper scientific the reactor

2018 were purchased from sigma aldrich sufficiently washed with deionized water and oven dried overnight at 60 c prior to use an artificial soil infiltration system was constructed in clean polycarbonate pc transparent columns with an inner diameter of 60 mm and length of 160 mm roughly 450 ml which were then packed with pre washed sand a sand layer 90 g depth of 4 cm was placed at the bottom to ensure uniform infiltration discharge with a depth of 4 cm the upper layer consisted of a mixture of both mp and sand 0 9 g of mp and 90 g of sand which was carefully laid on the top of the sand bottom the added mp dose i e 5 g mp kg sand was within the range of contamination levels previously reported in mp polluted terrestrial environments which were 0 3 g to 67 5 g of mp per kg of soil fuller and gautam 2016 because the mps in soil environments were different in shape e g fibers fragments beats spheres pellets films and foams and size from 1 μm to 5 mm the plastic doses were expressed in mass per sand gram for this study a sand control i e clean sand column was also set following the same procedure described above except for the mp addition in the upper layer such that the whole column contained sand only for infiltration distilled water was spread over the columns until the sand became fully saturated with a corresponding volume of approximately 80 ml considering the volume of sand half of the whole core or 226 ml and its porosity i e 0 37 the amount of water was sufficient enough to saturate the sandy column the top of the column was covered with aluminum foil to prevent external contamination the columns were maintained in a thermostatic chamber at 15 c during the seven day incubation period to simulate natural aquifer conditions calderer et al 2014 a hole with a diameter of 2 5 mm was drilled 2 cm above the bottom of the column at the end of the incubation period a pre washed rhizon sampler was used to extract pore infiltration water the extracted infiltration was immediately filtered through a pre washed whatman gf f filter to remove any particles that might be included during the previous extraction using the rhizon samplers the obtained solution was defined as infiltration from sand systems contaminated with either pristine or uv aged mps to investigate the effects of environmental interference e g biodegradation and mineral adsorption on mp dom concentrations and their spectroscopic signatures during infiltration mp dom was separately obtained through contact of uv irradiated mps with water for 7 days without sand at the same mp to water ratio i e 5 g of mp in 80 ml of water used in the previous column experiments fig 1 the abiotic control was prepared by adding 3 mm sodium azide nan3 to the mp dom samples black et al 2012 mp dom samples without nan3 after incubation were assumed to undergo biodegradation the mp dom solution with nan3 contained i e abiotic control was transferred to a clean sand column to observe mp dom changes driven by mineral adsorption only during infiltration one day long adsorption was sufficient to reach an apparent equilibrium lee and hur 2020 so that the adsorbed amount would be identical to that obtained during the 7 day incubation period in the sand column the infiltration water obtained with the nan3 containing mp dom was assumed to undergo only adsorption process interacting with sand surface infiltration water was extracted as previously described the difference in mp dom before and after infiltration indicates the amount of mp dom adsorbed onto the sand minerals all experiments were performed in triplicate using separate columns information regarding the infiltration system is shown in fig 1 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 dissolved organic carbon

a constant doc concentration i e 1 mg c l while that from the pristine mp contaminated system and control systems were used as is because of their low doc concentrations the ph was adjusted to 7 0 by adding 1 ml of phosphate buffer 68 1 g of kh2po4 plus 11 7 g of naoh in 1 l of water per 50 ml of sample chlorination was performed by adding sodium hypochlorite to the dom samples to achieve a sufficient chlorine dosage naocl sigma aldrich 6 14 available chlorine of 5 mg cl2 l to further investigate the correlation between the changed fluorescence intensities and the generated thm

selected dbp species were extracted using liquid liquid extraction based on methyltertbutylether mtbe with 1 3 dipromoprophane 200 μg l as an internal standard for haa measurements diazomethane derivatization was performed to prevent the adsorption of the polarized substances e g oh groups the concentrations of the extracted thms and haas were determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a usa gc μecd with a micro electron capture detector in accordance with modified versions of us epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 following the method described by park et al 2016 the details of the operated gc conditions for dbps measurements are shown in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface characteristics of mp particles ft ir spectra and sem images the two mp plastics used in this study pvc and eps exhibited several distinctive peaks in their ft ir spectra peaks a at 1030 cm 1 c at 1454 cm 1 d at 1493 1494 cm 1 and 1605 1607 cm 1 f at 2858 2864 cm 1 and 2924 2931 cm 1 and g at 3026 3031 cm 1 were observed for eps mp while pvc mp showed peaks at 951 970 cm 1 peak ⅰ 1102 1104 cm 1 peak ⅱ 1258 1269 cm 1 1363 1385 cm 1 peak ⅳ 1428 cm 1 peak ⅴ 2858 2864 cm 1 and 2924 2931 cm 1 peak ⅷ fig s1 and table s2 among the peaks peaks v and ⅷ for pvc mp and peaks c and f for eps mp represent common carbon chains with repeated ch2 units which were also observed in other plastics such as polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp table s2 jung et al 2018 for both uv aged eps and pvc mps additional peaks were observed at 1681 1730 cm 1 which were defined as peaks ⅶ and e respectively as previously reported for oxidized polymers chen et al 2021 lucki and rånby 1979 these peaks were attributed to oxygen containing groups generated by uv irradiation furthermore the feature of peak vi at 1580 cm 1 coo stretch can be assigned to oxygen containing groups in pvc which can be associated with carboxylates of the additives contained in the plastic bodecchi et al 2005 sem images of the pristine and uv aged mp surfaces indicate that see fig s2 irrespective of the plastic type the uv aged mp surfaces were rougher and characterized by more fluffy and porous structures than the pristine mps the observed surface morphologies were similar to those of uv irradiated plastics mao et al 2020 3 2 doc concentrations of infiltration 3 2 1 effects of uv aging the doc concentrations of infiltration from the sand systems were compared with respect to both the plastic type i e pvc versus eps and the uv aging effect pristine mps vs uv aged mps fig 2 a a significantly higher doc concentration was significantly observed in the sand columns containing mps 0 54 0 59 mg c l with pristine mps than in the clean sand columns 0 41 0 44 mg c l student s t test p 0 013 in contrast no significant difference was found in the infiltration between the two different plastic types 0 57 0 02 mg c l for pristine pvc versus 0 56 0 01 mg c l for pristine eps t test p 0 575 the greatest differences in doc concentrations were caused by the uv aging effect on the mps for example doc leaching from sand columns containing uv aged eps was nearly 18 times greater than that containing pristine eps suggesting the critical role of the pre exposure of mps to uv light in determining doc leaching from plastics the enhanced effect of uv irradiation on mp dom leaching in the infiltration was more pronounced for eps than for pvc with doc concentrations corresponding to 9 89 1 39 mg c l versus 4 51 0 13 mg c l these results are consistent with the previous observation of more severe damage on the surface of eps versus pvc after uv aging treatment fig s2 the structural instability of eps caused by uv irradiation has also been previously reported song et al 2017 in which a significant difference was observed in the number of fragmented plastics after six months of exposure to uv light between eps and other plastic types e g pe and pp 3 2 2 environmental interferences on mp dom concentration comparative experiments were conducted to elucidate the substantial effects of biodegradation and mineral adsorption on mp dom concentrations during infiltration fig 2b regardless of the plastic type lower mp dom concentrations were observed after the microbial incubation for example the doc concentrations in the presence versus the absence of nan3 were 4 44 0 05 mg c l vs 3 92 0 12 mg c l for pvc dom paired t test p 0 01 10 32 1 28 mg c l vs 9 15 1 33 mg c l for eps dom p 0 01 fig 2b furthermore similar observations of the bio labile properties of mp dom samples were reported after a five day incubation period romera castillo et al 2018 in this study the additional reduction in mp dom concentration after mineral adsorption was compared with that after biodegradation although a slight decrease in the eps dom concentration was observed 10 32 1 28 mg c l vs 9 36 0 10 mg c l p 0 023 the extent of the difference was smaller than from microbial degradation in addition no significant difference was observed for pvc dom which changed from 4 44 0 05 mg c l to 4 56 0 05 mg c l after infiltration p 0 052 these small changes can be attributed to the inherently low adsorption affinity of sand minerals towards organic compounds lu et al 2012 müller et al 2007 regardless of this weak interference the results suggest that biodegradation is a dominant biogeochemical process in reshaping mp dom in mp contaminated sand systems the reduction of mp dom by both biodegradation and mineral adsorption together was approximately 16 in all sand infiltration systems 11 65 2 10 by biodegradation and 5 43 8 49 by mineral adsorption fig s6a in contrast the increase in the infiltration doc due to mp contamination was evident with the enhancement rates of 34 5 1 7 for pristine mps and 1178 6 689 3 for uv aged mps this finding clearly emphasizes the impact of mp contamination on groundwater quality in sandy subsurface systems especially by uv aged mps 3 3 spectroscopic properties of infiltration from mp contaminated sand system 3 3 1 functional groups of infiltration dom the ft ir spectra of the sand infiltration from mp containing systems indicated traces of mp origins in the solutions as shown by the matched peaks between the infiltration and dom leached solely from mps or mp dom fig s1 irrespective of plastic type ch2 bands such as peaks ⅴ and ⅷ for pvc and peaks c and f for eps were commonly observed in the infiltration water and mp dom samples while no such signals were detected in the infiltration from the clean sand column the results suggest that the ft ir features of mp dom remained stable during the transport through the sand column interestingly several peaks identified from the mp particles were absent in the ftir spectra of the infiltration for example peaks a and g which exclusively appeared in the eps particles were not observed in the infiltration from eps containing sand columns furthermore the infiltration samples exhibited peaks that were not associated with the original mp therefore peaks related to quartz i e peaks iii and b appeared in the spectra of the infiltration from the sand columns either with or without mps for the sand columns containing uv aged mps additional peaks were observed in the infiltration at 1681 1730 cm 1 i e peaks ⅶ and e which were previously observed in plastic particles this result suggests the possibility of incorporating oxygen containing organic structures of mps into infiltration dom when the sandy subsurface system is contaminated with uv aged mps gewert et al 2018 supports this concept by using mass spectrometry to uncover the presence of oxidized structures in the leachate of mps during uv irradiation exposure 3 3 3 fluorescence eems and a fluorescence indicator for mp source discrimination the fluorescence eems of sand infiltration and mp dom or mp leachate are presented in fig s3 no fluorescence peak was detected for the infiltration from the clean sand column fig s3a implying that dom desorbed from the sand minerals may contain a negligible amount of fluorophores during infiltration regardless of the plastic type prominent peaks appeared in the microbial humic like fluorescence region 313 315 nm 393 423 nm ex em in the infiltration eem from mp contaminated sand systems which is similar to peak m as defined by coble 1996 similar peaks have been previously observed in other plastic leachates lee et al 2021b 2020a in this study the doc normalized maximum peak intensity in the humic like fluorescence region was much more pronounced for the infiltration from uv aged eps contaminated systems than pristine eps systems e g 0 56 0 63 r u mg c for uv aged eps vs 0 18 0 23 r u mg c for the pristine eps suggesting a close association of the detected fluorescence with the photo induced structures of eps dom in contrast no significant difference was observed between the sand systems with uv aged pvc versus the pristine pvc 0 18 0 19 r u mg c for uv aged pvc vs 0 15 0 20 r u mg c for pristine pvc t test p 0 241 a separate leaching experiment using mps without infiltration established that pure mp dom was originally characterized by the presence of both protein phenol like and humic like peaks figs s3f s3g s3i and s3j however the protein phenol like peak was negligible or less pronounced when mp dom underwent infiltration through the sand column figs s3h and s3k this signifies the potential effects of environmental interference of microbial degradation or adsorption onto the sand mineral during either residence or transport within the sand columns h p l ratio a fluorescence indicator for mp dom was successful in discriminating between the infiltration of mp contaminated sand columns and the clean sand columns as shown by the higher ratios of the mp contaminated system over the control system 1 39 1 88 versus 0 45 0 57 fig 3 a the increase in the ratio when the mps were previously uv irradiated fig 3a suggests the feasibility of the indicator for detecting mp dom in infiltration from mp contaminated sand columns meanwhile the separate experiment to test the biodegradation effect determined the role of biodegradation in reducing the h p l ratios with the change from 2 26 0 16 to 1 40 0 39 for pvc dom and from 2 79 0 59 to 2 06 0 23 for eps dom after a seven day incubation fig 3d this change can be explained by the decrease in the protein phenol like peaks after biodegradation in contrast mineral adsorption did not result in significant changes for both mp types with the ratio shifting from 2 26 0 16 to 2 12 0 23 for pvc dom and from 2 79 0 59 to 2 38 0 11 for eps dom after infiltration p 0 062 despite the effectiveness of the h p l ratio in mp dom detection it is ineffective for explaining the occurrence of changes in different mp dom fluorophores driven by biodegradation and mineral adsorption within the sand column or sandy subsurface system thus tracing the independent fluorescent components identified by the eem parafac was necessary 3 3 4 fdom components identified by the parafac modeling the parafac modeling established the efficiency of the two component models in elucidating the dynamics of fluorescence features of the sand infiltration with a core consistency of 99 6 fig s4 and table s3 components 1 c1 and 2 c2 peaked at 305 230 and 413 nm ex em and 220 270 and 308 nm ex em respectively the c1 peak fell within the microbial humic like fluorescence region matching the typical peaks previously observed in the eems of the mp dom samples fig s3 the c2 peak shown at shorter wavelengths was similar to peak b ex of 225 280 em of 305 nm as defined by coble 1996 the peak may represent phenol like substances carstea et al 2016 coble 1996 and is analogous to the fluorescent components previously reported for dom leached from plastic materials such as polymers additives and commercial plastics lee et al 2021a 2020a spagnuolo et al 2017 3 3 5 changes in different fluorescent components during infiltration significant differences were observed in the intensities of c1 and c2 i e fmax values in the infiltration between sand columns with and without mps fig 3b and c for the clean sand infiltration the c1 intensities were between 0 05 to 0 06 r u for the infiltration from the sand columns with pristine mps they were between 0 13 to 0 14 r u a similar trend was observed in c2 0 01 0 02 r u from the clean sand columns versus 0 03 0 04 r u from those contaminated similar to the trend observed in doc concentrations when the mps were previously uv aged the intensities of both fdom components were much more pronounced than those of the corresponding pristine mps for example the intensities of the humic like c1 for uv aged eps were nearly 29 times higher than that for pristine eps fig 3b indicating a simulating effect of uv aging on fdom production from mps in sand infiltration systems the enhancement effect was more pronounced for c1 than for c2 implying a deeper association between humic like c1 and the photo induced production of dom from uv aged mps correspondingly the relative abundance of c1 was higher in the infiltration from sand columns with uv aged versus pristine mps i e 88 2 95 8 versus 76 1 79 8 figs s5b s5e the individual fdom intensities of mp dom were affected to some extent by the two environmental interferences of biodegradation and mineral adsorption figs s6b and s6c the biodegradation induced reductions in the fdom components reached 26 78 5 32 for c1 and 33 55 5 45 for c2 with a higher extent of the change shown in the protein phenol like c2 meanwhile mineral adsorption led to different directions of change depending on the components the c2 only was substantially removed by mineral adsorption 22 43 14 47 indicating the preferable adsorption affinity of sand mineral for the protein phenol like component this result is in line with previous studies on the relatively high adsorption tendency of plastic additives onto mineral surfaces plank and winter 2008 zhang et al 2015 because many additives contained in mps such as bisphenol a bpa and diethylhexyl phthalate dehp feature protein phenol like fluorescence lee et al 2020a spagnuolo et al 2017 it is important to note that despite the occurrence of environmental interference e g biodegradation and mineral adsorption in the infiltration system the fluorescence signatures of mp dom remained steady in sand infiltration with only minor changes 3 4 dbps precursors in the infiltration from mp contaminated sand columns 3 4 1 effects of uv aging compared with clean sand columns 50 30 μg thm l and 11 2 μg haa l higher levels of both dbps i e thms and haas were detected in the infiltration from mp contaminated sand columns student s t test p 0 01 fig s7 chloroform chcl3 was the only thm species identified during the formation potential tests similarly the produced haas mainly consisted of chlorinated species i e mcaa dcaa and tcaa ranging from 92 0 to 99 3 the bromine ions br which are possibly present in plastic flame retardants e g poly brominated diphenyl ethers and hexabromocyclododecan could act as inorganic dbp precursors and the brominated dbps may have higher toxic potencies than the chlorinated counterparts sun et al 2019 yang et al 2014 it is notable that brominated dbp species have been reported only in the mp dom samples obtained from unwashed mps ateia et al 2020 such additives can be easily washed out during pretreatment meanwhile in the infiltration from uv aged mp contaminated sand columns the thm formation potential thmfp was 1 303 1 664 μg thm l for eps and 524 628 μg thm l for pvc which was higher than that of the sand columns with pristine mps ranging between 103 and 120 μg thm l for eps and between 100 and 107 μg thm l for pvc fig s7 the stimulating effect of uv aging on the thmfp of mp dom was also reported in our previous study using polypropylene pp lee et al 2020b similar to the thmfps the haa formation potential haafp were also higher for uv aged mps than for the pristine mps they were 66 70 μg haa l for the aged eps and 65 69 μg haa l for the aged pvc while the values of the pristine ones were 1 282 1 612 μg haa l and 601 648 μg haa l for pvc respectively at the same chlorination condition fig s7 the doc normalized dbpfp i e specific thmfp and haafp of the sand infiltration was compared with that of previously reported naturally occurring dom ndom and other plastic leachates fig 4 and table 1 although the chlorination conditions i e 5 mg mg c for 3 day incubation of the present study differed from those of the previous literature the sand infiltration samples in this study presented greater levels of dbpfp than the ndom sourced from aquifer groundwater 1 5 mg cl2 mg c for 1 7 day incubation 10 2 52 7 μg thm mg c and 11 5 32 7 μg haa mg c chen and westerhoff 2010 molnar et al 2012 stuart et al 2001 tubić et al 2013 or riverside bank filtrate 2 5 mg cl2 mg c for 7 day incubation 54 17 15 96 μg thm mg c romero esquivel et al 2017 in the present study the infiltration from the sand columns containing uv aged mps exhibited a higher value of specific thmfp than that of the pristine mps 128 8 144 3 μg thm mg c for the uv aged mps versus 104 6 112 4 μg thm mg c for the pristine mps fig 4a the specific haafp was 138 8 146 3 μg haa mg c for uv aged mps while it was 117 7 122 7 μg haa mg c for the pristine mps fig 4b the results suggest that dissolved organic byproducts produced by the uv aging of mps may operate as precursors of dbps more actively than the pristine mps the results agreed with the previous reports demonstrating that the leachates from mps has a stronger tendency to generate dbps under uv irradiation than under dark condition ateia et al 2020 lee et al 2020b 3 4 2 changes in infiltration fluorescence with chlorine addition and their association with thmfp differential spectroscopy has been widely utilized as an independent monitoring tool for ndom to predict dbp formation potentials using the spectral differences associated with the amount of chlorine consumed ike et al 2020 korshin et al 2002 in this study to investigate the correlation between two different fdom i e c1 and c2 and thms generated upon chlorination the changes of the fmax values were tracked with an increase in the chlorine added from 0 5 to 5 0 mg cl2 l fig 5 uv aged eps contaminated soil columns were selected as a representative case because it is expected to generate a high thm formation potential due to the presence of benzene ring groups in the mp structures the intensities of both fdom components steadily declined from the initial value i e before chlorination with an increase in chlorine dosage fig 5c for example the fmax values in c1 decreased from 0 3275 0 0539 r u to 0 0004 0 0001 r u with the change of chlorine concentrations from 0 5 to 5 0 mg cl2 l after 3 days of incubation the differential values of c1 and c2 were positively correlated with the generated thmfp fig 5d and e in particular the differential c1 values or fmax of c1 presented a much stronger positive association with the total thms r2 0 9039 p 0 01 n 24 than differential c2 this trend agreed well with the previous reports in which humic like components exhibited much higher correlations with the yields of dbps i e thms and haas compared with the protein like components hua et al 2010 li et al 2016 no significant correlation was observed between the two parameters in the infiltration from the clean sand columns fig s8 these results suggest that c1 may provide an appropriate fluorescence signature with an improved response to the chlorination reaction thus proving to be a practical optical surrogate for predicting thm formation in sandy subsurface systems although potential interactions between the humic like c1 component and sand matrix may occur within the column the humic like substances leached from uv aged mps seemed to retain their potential to form dbps during infiltration however complementary studies need to be conducted in order to extend its applicability to other regulated dbps such as haas because the dbp formation can be rather selective depending on the types of dbp precursors li et al 2016 employing mass spectrometry for identifying individual mp dom compounds brominated additives or oligomers or oxidized oligomers and so on particularly dom leached from uv irradiated mps could establish a link between the fluorescence signature and specific dbp precursors 3 5 environmental implications and limitations this study is the first to explore the spectroscopic signature of dom infiltration in a model sandy subsurface system contaminated with mps and the potential of infiltration in generating dbps upon chlorination based on a simple lab scale sand column system artificially contaminated with mps at a previously reported level and despite possible environmental inferences that may occur in the system mp contamination was found to affect the doc concentration of sand infiltration as evidenced by marked spectroscopic signatures in the infiltration the stable presence of the spectroscopic signature of mp dom in sand infiltration was confirmed by complementary studies on the effects of biodegradation and mineral adsorption on mp dom traces in sand infiltration the mp dom signature in infiltration was more pronounced when the contaminated mps were previously uv aged this finding is significant because most of the wasted plastic debris is easily weathered by uv irradiation before or during deposition in the top layer of such subsurface systems however this study explored a limited range of environmental settings in terms of soil type sand plastic materials pvc and eps and residence time 7 days therefore it is necessary to validate whether the presented results can be generalized to other soil subsurface systems such a generalization will help minimize uncertainties in identifying the fate of mp dom in terrestrial environments contaminated with waste plastics this study clearly demonstrated that the uv aging of mps affected the extent of dbpfps of infiltration water and also provided evidence of the resistance of mp dom in sand infiltration systems and the subsequent impact on enhanced dbp formation in the infiltration as such it raises the awareness of potential environmental risks associated with dbps upon chlorination when infiltrated water or groundwater is used as potable water although humic like fdom revealed its distinctive feature of mp dom in sand infiltration especially from uv aged mps there is a need to derive a more sophisticated optical index to distinguish between ndom and mp dom in natural subsurface systems further studies involving a range of mp contamination levels in various environmental settings including other subsurface systems consisting of different soil textures are recommended finally the use of high resolution mass spectrometry is critical for identifying the individual signature compounds leached from waste mps in complex subsurface systems studies to determine possible linkages between the observed fluorescence signals and individual mp dom compounds in given subsurface systems should also be conducted 4 conclusions in this novel study we used for the first time a set of unique spectroscopic signatures of mp dom to characterize infiltration from mp contaminated subsurface systems despite the interference of both biodegradation and mineral adsorption the following conclusions were drawn based on the results 1 the uv aging process on mps caused substantial changes in the surface properties which favored the release of mp dom into the pore water of sandy subsurface systems contaminated with mps in the top layer the unique spectroscopic features of mp dom revealed by ft ir and fluorescence spectroscopy were still present in the infiltration 2 despite the possible environmental interference of biodegradation and mineral adsorption within the sand columns mp contamination led to a higher doc concentration of sand infiltration the concentration was higher when the mps were subjected to uv irradiation 4 51 to 9 89 mg c l as compared to those of the pristine mps 0 56 to 0 57 mg c l 3 the h p l ratio an mp dom indicator established its efficacy for sand infiltration in mp contaminated systems the protein phenol like c2 was found to be more labile to the environmental interference of biodegradation and mineral adsorption than the humic like c1 although both components remained at higher levels in the infiltration compared to those from clean sand columns 4 regardless of the type of plastic or uv aging treatment the infiltration from mp contaminated systems exhibited a relatively high formation potential of thms 104 4 to 144 3 μg thm mg c and haas 117 7 to 146 3 μg haa mg c which was even greater than previously reported groundwater and lakeside bank filtrates 5 a significant negative correlation was found between the generated thms and decreased humic like c1 suggesting that c1 may be an optical surrogate for carbonaceous dbps in mp contaminated subsurface systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15774,microplastic mp pollution in soil subsurface environments has been increasingly researched given the uncertainties associated with the heterogeneous matrix of these systems in this study we tracked the spectroscopic signatures of mp derived dissolved organic matter mp dom in infiltrated water from mp contaminated sandy subsurface systems and examined their potential to form trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas by chlorination sand packed columns with commercial mps expanded polystyrene and polyvinylchloride on the upper layer were used as the model systems regardless of the plastic type the addition of mps resulted in a higher amount of dom during infiltration compared with the clean sand system this enhancement was more pronounced when the added mps were uv irradiated for 14 days the infiltration was further characterized using ft ir and fluorescence spectroscopy which identified two fluorescent components humic like c1 and protein phenol like c2 compared with pure mp dom c1 was more predominant in sand infiltration than c2 further studies have established that c2 may be more labile in terms of biodegradation and mineral adsorption that may occur within the sand column however both these environmental interferences were inadequate for entirely expanding the spectroscopic signatures of mp dom in sand infiltration the infiltration also exhibited a higher potential in generating carbonaceous disinfection byproducts than natural groundwater and riverside bank filtrates a significant correlation between the generated thms and decreased c1 suggests the possibility of using humic like components as optical precursors of carbonaceous dbps in mp contaminated subsurface systems this study highlighted an overlooked contribution of mps in terms of the infiltration of dom levels in sandy subsurface systems and the potential environmental risk when used as drinking water sources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics dissolved organic matter sand infiltration fluorescence uv aging disinfection byproducts data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction micro sized plastic i e microplastics or mps pollution is widely known to pose one of the greatest anthropogenically induced threats to global ecosystems in both freshwater and marine ecosystems the occurrence of substantial levels of mps is nearly ubiquitous and threatening as recent reports indicate their negative environmental impacts gola et al 2021 li et al 2020 however the effects of residual plastic waste on terrestrial environments remain poorly understood huang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 a few recent studies reported that approximately 79 of plastic waste is deposited in landfills worldwide geyer et al 2017 ng et al 2018 plastic contamination up to a maximum of 67 500 mg kg of soil has also been reported in the natural soil environment including croplands floodplains beaches and industrial grounds fuller and gautam 2016 scheurer and bigalke 2018 zhang and liu 2018 zhou et al 2018 mps in soil can be transported into underground aquifers through vertical migration thereby affecting groundwater quality o connor et al 2019 demonstrated an accelerated vertical mobility of mps in a sandy soil column based on an apparent linear relationship between the penetration depth and the number of wet dry cycles more recently the actual range of mps in natural groundwater in both estuarine and agricultural regions ranged from 4 2 to 90 particles per liter samandra et al 2022 selvam et al 2021 the types of plastic materials accumulated in either the soil or in the aquifer may span from non floating debris with a relatively high density such as polyvinyl chloride pvc fuller and gautam 2016 samandra et al 2022 to buoyant plastics such as expanded polystyrene eps esiukova et al 2021 xie et al 2021 a major portion of wasted mps originates from larger plastic products that might be broken down in situ signifying the extent of natural aging or weathering processes occurring during transport into either terrestrial or aquatic systems plastic leachate or mp dissolved organic matter mp dom has recently been deemed a hidden threat to aquatic environments in terms of ecotoxicity and disinfection byproduct precursors gunaalan et al 2020 lee et al 2020b ultraviolet uv irradiation or uv aging is also considered a robust catalyst for producing mp dom which commonly comprises multiple organic compounds e g additives and various carbon chain scission products gewert et al 2018 potthoff et al 2017 several studies demonstrating enhanced release of dissolved organic substances from mps under uv irradiation support these findings lee et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 although recent studies have focused on the occurrence of mp dom and its effects on aquatic environments issues related to aged mps remain a compelling topic of research alimi et al 2022 many studies have documented the practical applications of fluorescence spectroscopy or excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis eem parafac for monitoring or tracking subsurface water quality nowicki et al 2019 sorensen et al 2018 notable examples include the use of the fluorescence signature of petroleum derived dom for detecting petroleum pollution in groundwater dvorski et al 2016 podgorski et al 2018 only a few attempts to identify the unique spectroscopic features of mp dom from commercial plastics have been undertaken lee et al 2021a 2020a furthermore no effort has been undertaken to track changes in the spectroscopic signature of mp dom in subsurface systems or to examine potential environmental interference during downward transport the fate and environmental behavior of mp dom strongly depends on biogeochemical processes e g microbial degradation and adsorption on minerals through the transport process lee and hur 2020 romera castillo et al 2018 if mp dom remains in subsurface systems mp dom in infiltrated water or groundwater could potentially serve as the precursor of disinfection byproducts upon chlorination as a drinking water source ateia et al 2020 lee et al 2020b the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts dbps following chlorination is an unavoidable consequence and arguably is considered one of the most critical risks of dom to aquatic ecosystems and human health furthermore some mps containing flame retardants can release bromine ions br into surrounding water making the dbp species into more toxic brominated dbp compounds ateia et al 2020 yang et al 2014 previous studies have revealed that fluorescence spectroscopy could be used to predict dbp formation potentials in dom samples with the proper humic like signals chen and westerhoff 2010 li et al 2016 considering these earlier efforts the aims of this study were to 1 compare the amount of dom in the infiltration between clean sand systems and systems artificially contaminated with mps 2 track the spectroscopic signature of mp dom in the infiltration through fluorescence eem and ftir and 3 examine the potential presence of mp dom in the infiltration serving as dbp precursors trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas upon chlorination 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of microplastics expanded polystyrene eps and polyvinylchloride pvc were selected as representative plastics in this study expanded polystyrene eps and polyvinylchloride pvc were selected as the representative plastics in this study eps represents buoyant plastic types with a relatively low density which is likely to be impacted by sunlight in aquatic environments compared to the non floating pvc particles in contrast non floating pvc tends to sink into deep water or the bottom commercial plastics were purchased in sheet form 1 mm in thickness for pvc and as beads 1 mm in diameter for eps from a local market in seoul south korea the pvc sheet was cut into pieces with dimensions of approximately 1 mm 1 mm the prepared pieces were thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove impurities that may have been introduced into the material during sample handling the washing process was sufficient to obtain clean mp pieces a group of mps was subjected to uv irradiation for 14 days to simulate plastic pieces previously exposed to sunlight for an extended period of time i e uv aged mps the irradiation time was determined using the method in a study that reported a significant difference in mps with exposure time lambert and wagner 2016 for the irradiation benchmark 0 9 mg of each mp i e eps and pvc was transferred to six autoclaved cylindrical quartz tubes without water solution i e dry condition a stirrer was placed at the bottom of each tube for homogeneous exposure to uv light and the tubes were placed in the middle of a closed cabinet with 6 8 w uva lamps sankyo denki f8t5bl as a light source inside the cabinet the light intensity in the closed cabinet was equivalent to that of natural solar exposure in seoul south korea which was approximately 4000 μw cm2 based on an ultraviolet meter model 850 009 sper scientific the reactor temperature was maintained at 25 3 c by circulating cooling air 2 2 artificial sand infiltration system sands with a particle size of 210 297 μm 50 70 mesh porosity of approximately 0 37 aadland et al 2018 were purchased from sigma aldrich sufficiently washed with deionized water and oven dried overnight at 60 c prior to use an artificial soil infiltration system was constructed in clean polycarbonate pc transparent columns with an inner diameter of 60 mm and length of 160 mm roughly 450 ml which were then packed with pre washed sand a sand layer 90 g depth of 4 cm was placed at the bottom to ensure uniform infiltration discharge with a depth of 4 cm the upper layer consisted of a mixture of both mp and sand 0 9 g of mp and 90 g of sand which was carefully laid on the top of the sand bottom the added mp dose i e 5 g mp kg sand was within the range of contamination levels previously reported in mp polluted terrestrial environments which were 0 3 g to 67 5 g of mp per kg of soil fuller and gautam 2016 because the mps in soil environments were different in shape e g fibers fragments beats spheres pellets films and foams and size from 1 μm to 5 mm the plastic doses were expressed in mass per sand gram for this study a sand control i e clean sand column was also set following the same procedure described above except for the mp addition in the upper layer such that the whole column contained sand only for infiltration distilled water was spread over the columns until the sand became fully saturated with a corresponding volume of approximately 80 ml considering the volume of sand half of the whole core or 226 ml and its porosity i e 0 37 the amount of water was sufficient enough to saturate the sandy column the top of the column was covered with aluminum foil to prevent external contamination the columns were maintained in a thermostatic chamber at 15 c during the seven day incubation period to simulate natural aquifer conditions calderer et al 2014 a hole with a diameter of 2 5 mm was drilled 2 cm above the bottom of the column at the end of the incubation period a pre washed rhizon sampler was used to extract pore infiltration water the extracted infiltration was immediately filtered through a pre washed whatman gf f filter to remove any particles that might be included during the previous extraction using the rhizon samplers the obtained solution was defined as infiltration from sand systems contaminated with either pristine or uv aged mps to investigate the effects of environmental interference e g biodegradation and mineral adsorption on mp dom concentrations and their spectroscopic signatures during infiltration mp dom was separately obtained through contact of uv irradiated mps with water for 7 days without sand at the same mp to water ratio i e 5 g of mp in 80 ml of water used in the previous column experiments fig 1 the abiotic control was prepared by adding 3 mm sodium azide nan3 to the mp dom samples black et al 2012 mp dom samples without nan3 after incubation were assumed to undergo biodegradation the mp dom solution with nan3 contained i e abiotic control was transferred to a clean sand column to observe mp dom changes driven by mineral adsorption only during infiltration one day long adsorption was sufficient to reach an apparent equilibrium lee and hur 2020 so that the adsorbed amount would be identical to that obtained during the 7 day incubation period in the sand column the infiltration water obtained with the nan3 containing mp dom was assumed to undergo only adsorption process interacting with sand surface infiltration water was extracted as previously described the difference in mp dom before and after infiltration indicates the amount of mp dom adsorbed onto the sand minerals all experiments were performed in triplicate using separate columns information regarding the infiltration system is shown in fig 1 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 dissolved organic carbon doc measurements a toc analyzer based on high temperature catalytic oxidation shimadzu l series tocchp japan was used to determine the concentrations of the dom samples the solutions for doc analyses were collected in pre combusted 40 ml glass vials and stored at 4 c prior to measurement the accuracy of the instrument was checked weekly and was determined 2 with a doc concentration of 0 5 mg c l 2 3 2 fluorescence eem measurements and parallel factor analysis modeling fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were obtained using a luminescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan the eems were scanned at emission wavelengths em of 280 550 nm in 1 nm increments over excitation wavelengths ex of 220 550 nm with a stepwise increase of 5 nm the excitation and emission slits were adjusted to 10 nm and the fluorescence responses to distilled water were subtracted from the measured spectra to obtain the final eem data for the dom samples the fluorescence intensities were normalized to raman units r u based on an integrated raman peak at an emission wavelength em of 350 nm lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the fluorescence index detailed in our earlier study lee et al 2021b the h p l ratio was evaluated to identify the mp signature in the infiltration water the index was calculated as the sum of two excitation intensity areas from 270 to 310 nm at 405 nm em and from 250 to 290 nm at 305 nm em divided by the intensity area from 220 to 260 nm at 405 nm em see the details in the supporting information parafac modeling was performed using matlab 7 0 mathworks natick ma with the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 the number of independent fluorescent dom fdom components was determined using split half validation of the eem results n 83 and the percentage of the explained variance 99 6 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of the peaks of the identified components was used to represent the relative quantities of individual fluorescent components 2 3 3 ft ir spectroscopy and fesem analysis ft ir nicolet is10 thermo scientific was used to identify the various functional groups present in the infiltration samples following a published protocol chen et al 2018 briefly 10 ml of the filtered dom sample was mixed with 100 mg of kbr powder ft ir grade sigma aldrich and freeze dried for further analysis clean kbr pellets were prepared as a blank by drying at 105 c for 2 h the scanned wavenumber ranged from 650 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 each ftir spectrum was corrected for baseline shifts and smoothed using origin 9 0 software 12 points savitzky golay method the ftir peak intensities were normalized to the summed intensities of all the observed peaks yang et al 2015 a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem hitachi su 8000 japan was used to compare the morphologies of the pristine untreated mps and uv aged mps high magnified images of mps were captured with an accelerated voltage of 3 kv at the working distances of 6 8 mm 2 4 disinfection byproducts dbps measurement the dbp formation potential dbpfp of the infiltration water for trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas was determined following standard methods 5710 b 6232 b and 6251 b and us epa methods 552 2 with appropriate modifications lee et al 2018 the infiltration water from the sand systems with uv irradiated mps was diluted with ultrapure water to ensure a constant doc concentration i e 1 mg c l while that from the pristine mp contaminated system and control systems were used as is because of their low doc concentrations the ph was adjusted to 7 0 by adding 1 ml of phosphate buffer 68 1 g of kh2po4 plus 11 7 g of naoh in 1 l of water per 50 ml of sample chlorination was performed by adding sodium hypochlorite to the dom samples to achieve a sufficient chlorine dosage naocl sigma aldrich 6 14 available chlorine of 5 mg cl2 l to further investigate the correlation between the changed fluorescence intensities and the generated thm concentrations the infiltration was subjected to additional chlorination from the sand system containing uv irradiated eps with a stepwise increase of an added chlorine dosage from 0 1 to 5 0 mg cl2 l 10 points section 3 4 2 the samples were incubated head space free at 25 c in the dark for 72 h the chlorination reaction was quenched by adding 10 of sodium sulfite na2so3 to the samples after 72 h of incubation for this study the dbpfp was operationally defined as four thms trichloromethane dichlorobromomethane dibromochloromethane tribromomethane and nine haa species chloroacetic acid bromoacetic acid dichloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid bromochloroacetic acid bromodichloroacetic acid dibromoacetic acid chlorodibromoacetic acid tribromoacetic acid formed upon chlorination the selected dbp species were extracted using liquid liquid extraction based on methyltertbutylether mtbe with 1 3 dipromoprophane 200 μg l as an internal standard for haa measurements diazomethane derivatization was performed to prevent the adsorption of the polarized substances e g oh groups the concentrations of the extracted thms and haas were determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a usa gc μecd with a micro electron capture detector in accordance with modified versions of us epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 following the method described by park et al 2016 the details of the operated gc conditions for dbps measurements are shown in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface characteristics of mp particles ft ir spectra and sem images the two mp plastics used in this study pvc and eps exhibited several distinctive peaks in their ft ir spectra peaks a at 1030 cm 1 c at 1454 cm 1 d at 1493 1494 cm 1 and 1605 1607 cm 1 f at 2858 2864 cm 1 and 2924 2931 cm 1 and g at 3026 3031 cm 1 were observed for eps mp while pvc mp showed peaks at 951 970 cm 1 peak ⅰ 1102 1104 cm 1 peak ⅱ 1258 1269 cm 1 1363 1385 cm 1 peak ⅳ 1428 cm 1 peak ⅴ 2858 2864 cm 1 and 2924 2931 cm 1 peak ⅷ fig s1 and table s2 among the peaks peaks v and ⅷ for pvc mp and peaks c and f for eps mp represent common carbon chains with repeated ch2 units which were also observed in other plastics such as polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp table s2 jung et al 2018 for both uv aged eps and pvc mps additional peaks were observed at 1681 1730 cm 1 which were defined as peaks ⅶ and e respectively as previously reported for oxidized polymers chen et al 2021 lucki and rånby 1979 these peaks were attributed to oxygen containing groups generated by uv irradiation furthermore the feature of peak vi at 1580 cm 1 coo stretch can be assigned to oxygen containing groups in pvc which can be associated with carboxylates of the additives contained in the plastic bodecchi et al 2005 sem images of the pristine and uv aged mp surfaces indicate that see fig s2 irrespective of the plastic type the uv aged mp surfaces were rougher and characterized by more fluffy and porous structures than the pristine mps the observed surface morphologies were similar to those of uv irradiated plastics mao et al 2020 3 2 doc concentrations of infiltration 3 2 1 effects of uv aging the doc concentrations of infiltration from the sand systems were compared with respect to both the plastic type i e pvc versus eps and the uv aging effect pristine mps vs uv aged mps fig 2 a a significantly higher doc concentration was significantly observed in the sand columns containing mps 0 54 0 59 mg c l with pristine mps than in the clean sand columns 0 41 0 44 mg c l student s t test p 0 013 in contrast no significant difference was found in the infiltration between the two different plastic types 0 57 0 02 mg c l for pristine pvc versus 0 56 0 01 mg c l for pristine eps t test p 0 575 the greatest differences in doc concentrations were caused by the uv aging effect on the mps for example doc leaching from sand columns containing uv aged eps was nearly 18 times greater than that containing pristine eps suggesting the critical role of the pre exposure of mps to uv light in determining doc leaching from plastics the enhanced effect of uv irradiation on mp dom leaching in the infiltration was more pronounced for eps than for pvc with doc concentrations corresponding to 9 89 1 39 mg c l versus 4 51 0 13 mg c l these results are consistent with the previous observation of more severe damage on the surface of eps versus pvc after uv aging treatment fig s2 the structural instability of eps caused by uv irradiation has also been previously reported song et al 2017 in which a significant difference was observed in the number of fragmented plastics after six months of exposure to uv light between eps and other plastic types e g pe and pp 3 2 2 environmental interferences on mp dom concentration comparative experiments were conducted to elucidate the substantial effects of biodegradation and mineral adsorption on mp dom concentrations during infiltration fig 2b regardless of the plastic type lower mp dom concentrations were observed after the microbial incubation for example the doc concentrations in the presence versus the absence of nan3 were 4 44 0 05 mg c l vs 3 92 0 12 mg c l for pvc dom paired t test p 0 01 10 32 1 28 mg c l vs 9 15 1 33 mg c l for eps dom p 0 01 fig 2b furthermore similar observations of the bio labile properties of mp dom samples were reported after a five day incubation period romera castillo et al 2018 in this study the additional reduction in mp dom concentration after mineral adsorption was compared with that after biodegradation although a slight decrease in the eps dom concentration was observed 10 32 1 28 mg c l vs 9 36 0 10 mg c l p 0 023 the extent of the difference was smaller than from microbial degradation in addition no significant difference was observed for pvc dom which changed from 4 44 0 05 mg c l to 4 56 0 05 mg c l after infiltration p 0 052 these small changes can be attributed to the inherently low adsorption affinity of sand minerals towards organic compounds lu et al 2012 müller et al 2007 regardless of this weak interference the results suggest that biodegradation is a dominant biogeochemical process in reshaping mp dom in mp contaminated sand systems the reduction of mp dom by both biodegradation and mineral adsorption together was approximately 16 in all sand infiltration systems 11 65 2 10 by biodegradation and 5 43 8 49 by mineral adsorption fig s6a in contrast the increase in the infiltration doc due to mp contamination was evident with the enhancement rates of 34 5 1 7 for pristine mps and 1178 6 689 3 for uv aged mps this finding clearly emphasizes the impact of mp contamination on groundwater quality in sandy subsurface systems especially by uv aged mps 3 3 spectroscopic properties of infiltration from mp contaminated sand system 3 3 1 functional groups of infiltration dom the ft ir spectra of the sand infiltration from mp containing systems indicated traces of mp origins in the solutions as shown by the matched peaks between the infiltration and dom leached solely from mps or mp dom fig s1 irrespective of plastic type ch2 bands such as peaks ⅴ and ⅷ for pvc and peaks c and f for eps were commonly observed in the infiltration water and mp dom samples while no such signals were detected in the infiltration from the clean sand column the results suggest that the ft ir features of mp dom remained stable during the transport through the sand column interestingly several peaks identified from the mp particles were absent in the ftir spectra of the infiltration for example peaks a and g which exclusively appeared in the eps particles were not observed in the infiltration from eps containing sand columns furthermore the infiltration samples exhibited peaks that were not associated with the original mp therefore peaks related to quartz i e peaks iii and b appeared in the spectra of the infiltration from the sand columns either with or without mps for the sand columns containing uv aged mps additional peaks were observed in the infiltration at 1681 1730 cm 1 i e peaks ⅶ and e which were previously observed in plastic particles this result suggests the possibility of incorporating oxygen containing organic structures of mps into infiltration dom when the sandy subsurface system is contaminated with uv aged mps gewert et al 2018 supports this concept by using mass spectrometry to uncover the presence of oxidized structures in the leachate of mps during uv irradiation exposure 3 3 3 fluorescence eems and a fluorescence indicator for mp source discrimination the fluorescence eems of sand infiltration and mp dom or mp leachate are presented in fig s3 no fluorescence peak was detected for the infiltration from the clean sand column fig s3a implying that dom desorbed from the sand minerals may contain a negligible amount of fluorophores during infiltration regardless of the plastic type prominent peaks appeared in the microbial humic like fluorescence region 313 315 nm 393 423 nm ex em in the infiltration eem from mp contaminated sand systems which is similar to peak m as defined by coble 1996 similar peaks have been previously observed in other plastic leachates lee et al 2021b 2020a in this study the doc normalized maximum peak intensity in the humic like fluorescence region was much more pronounced for the infiltration from uv aged eps contaminated systems than pristine eps systems e g 0 56 0 63 r u mg c for uv aged eps vs 0 18 0 23 r u mg c for the pristine eps suggesting a close association of the detected fluorescence with the photo induced structures of eps dom in contrast no significant difference was observed between the sand systems with uv aged pvc versus the pristine pvc 0 18 0 19 r u mg c for uv aged pvc vs 0 15 0 20 r u mg c for pristine pvc t test p 0 241 a separate leaching experiment using mps without infiltration established that pure mp dom was originally characterized by the presence of both protein phenol like and humic like peaks figs s3f s3g s3i and s3j however the protein phenol like peak was negligible or less pronounced when mp dom underwent infiltration through the sand column figs s3h and s3k this signifies the potential effects of environmental interference of microbial degradation or adsorption onto the sand mineral during either residence or transport within the sand columns h p l ratio a fluorescence indicator for mp dom was successful in discriminating between the infiltration of mp contaminated sand columns and the clean sand columns as shown by the higher ratios of the mp contaminated system over the control system 1 39 1 88 versus 0 45 0 57 fig 3 a the increase in the ratio when the mps were previously uv irradiated fig 3a suggests the feasibility of the indicator for detecting mp dom in infiltration from mp contaminated sand columns meanwhile the separate experiment to test the biodegradation effect determined the role of biodegradation in reducing the h p l ratios with the change from 2 26 0 16 to 1 40 0 39 for pvc dom and from 2 79 0 59 to 2 06 0 23 for eps dom after a seven day incubation fig 3d this change can be explained by the decrease in the protein phenol like peaks after biodegradation in contrast mineral adsorption did not result in significant changes for both mp types with the ratio shifting from 2 26 0 16 to 2 12 0 23 for pvc dom and from 2 79 0 59 to 2 38 0 11 for eps dom after infiltration p 0 062 despite the effectiveness of the h p l ratio in mp dom detection it is ineffective for explaining the occurrence of changes in different mp dom fluorophores driven by biodegradation and mineral adsorption within the sand column or sandy subsurface system thus tracing the independent fluorescent components identified by the eem parafac was necessary 3 3 4 fdom components identified by the parafac modeling the parafac modeling established the efficiency of the two component models in elucidating the dynamics of fluorescence features of the sand infiltration with a core consistency of 99 6 fig s4 and table s3 components 1 c1 and 2 c2 peaked at 305 230 and 413 nm ex em and 220 270 and 308 nm ex em respectively the c1 peak fell within the microbial humic like fluorescence region matching the typical peaks previously observed in the eems of the mp dom samples fig s3 the c2 peak shown at shorter wavelengths was similar to peak b ex of 225 280 em of 305 nm as defined by coble 1996 the peak may represent phenol like substances carstea et al 2016 coble 1996 and is analogous to the fluorescent components previously reported for dom leached from plastic materials such as polymers additives and commercial plastics lee et al 2021a 2020a spagnuolo et al 2017 3 3 5 changes in different fluorescent components during infiltration significant differences were observed in the intensities of c1 and c2 i e fmax values in the infiltration between sand columns with and without mps fig 3b and c for the clean sand infiltration the c1 intensities were between 0 05 to 0 06 r u for the infiltration from the sand columns with pristine mps they were between 0 13 to 0 14 r u a similar trend was observed in c2 0 01 0 02 r u from the clean sand columns versus 0 03 0 04 r u from those contaminated similar to the trend observed in doc concentrations when the mps were previously uv aged the intensities of both fdom components were much more pronounced than those of the corresponding pristine mps for example the intensities of the humic like c1 for uv aged eps were nearly 29 times higher than that for pristine eps fig 3b indicating a simulating effect of uv aging on fdom production from mps in sand infiltration systems the enhancement effect was more pronounced for c1 than for c2 implying a deeper association between humic like c1 and the photo induced production of dom from uv aged mps correspondingly the relative abundance of c1 was higher in the infiltration from sand columns with uv aged versus pristine mps i e 88 2 95 8 versus 76 1 79 8 figs s5b s5e the individual fdom intensities of mp dom were affected to some extent by the two environmental interferences of biodegradation and mineral adsorption figs s6b and s6c the biodegradation induced reductions in the fdom components reached 26 78 5 32 for c1 and 33 55 5 45 for c2 with a higher extent of the change shown in the protein phenol like c2 meanwhile mineral adsorption led to different directions of change depending on the components the c2 only was substantially removed by mineral adsorption 22 43 14 47 indicating the preferable adsorption affinity of sand mineral for the protein phenol like component this result is in line with previous studies on the relatively high adsorption tendency of plastic additives onto mineral surfaces plank and winter 2008 zhang et al 2015 because many additives contained in mps such as bisphenol a bpa and diethylhexyl phthalate dehp feature protein phenol like fluorescence lee et al 2020a spagnuolo et al 2017 it is important to note that despite the occurrence of environmental interference e g biodegradation and mineral adsorption in the infiltration system the fluorescence signatures of mp dom remained steady in sand infiltration with only minor changes 3 4 dbps precursors in the infiltration from mp contaminated sand columns 3 4 1 effects of uv aging compared with clean sand columns 50 30 μg thm l and 11 2 μg haa l higher levels of both dbps i e thms and haas were detected in the infiltration from mp contaminated sand columns student s t test p 0 01 fig s7 chloroform chcl3 was the only thm species identified during the formation potential tests similarly the produced haas mainly consisted of chlorinated species i e mcaa dcaa and tcaa ranging from 92 0 to 99 3 the bromine ions br which are possibly present in plastic flame retardants e g poly brominated diphenyl ethers and hexabromocyclododecan could act as inorganic dbp precursors and the brominated dbps may have higher toxic potencies than the chlorinated counterparts sun et al 2019 yang et al 2014 it is notable that brominated dbp species have been reported only in the mp dom samples obtained from unwashed mps ateia et al 2020 such additives can be easily washed out during pretreatment meanwhile in the infiltration from uv aged mp contaminated sand columns the thm formation potential thmfp was 1 303 1 664 μg thm l for eps and 524 628 μg thm l for pvc which was higher than that of the sand columns with pristine mps ranging between 103 and 120 μg thm l for eps and between 100 and 107 μg thm l for pvc fig s7 the stimulating effect of uv aging on the thmfp of mp dom was also reported in our previous study using polypropylene pp lee et al 2020b similar to the thmfps the haa formation potential haafp were also higher for uv aged mps than for the pristine mps they were 66 70 μg haa l for the aged eps and 65 69 μg haa l for the aged pvc while the values of the pristine ones were 1 282 1 612 μg haa l and 601 648 μg haa l for pvc respectively at the same chlorination condition fig s7 the doc normalized dbpfp i e specific thmfp and haafp of the sand infiltration was compared with that of previously reported naturally occurring dom ndom and other plastic leachates fig 4 and table 1 although the chlorination conditions i e 5 mg mg c for 3 day incubation of the present study differed from those of the previous literature the sand infiltration samples in this study presented greater levels of dbpfp than the ndom sourced from aquifer groundwater 1 5 mg cl2 mg c for 1 7 day incubation 10 2 52 7 μg thm mg c and 11 5 32 7 μg haa mg c chen and westerhoff 2010 molnar et al 2012 stuart et al 2001 tubić et al 2013 or riverside bank filtrate 2 5 mg cl2 mg c for 7 day incubation 54 17 15 96 μg thm mg c romero esquivel et al 2017 in the present study the infiltration from the sand columns containing uv aged mps exhibited a higher value of specific thmfp than that of the pristine mps 128 8 144 3 μg thm mg c for the uv aged mps versus 104 6 112 4 μg thm mg c for the pristine mps fig 4a the specific haafp was 138 8 146 3 μg haa mg c for uv aged mps while it was 117 7 122 7 μg haa mg c for the pristine mps fig 4b the results suggest that dissolved organic byproducts produced by the uv aging of mps may operate as precursors of dbps more actively than the pristine mps the results agreed with the previous reports demonstrating that the leachates from mps has a stronger tendency to generate dbps under uv irradiation than under dark condition ateia et al 2020 lee et al 2020b 3 4 2 changes in infiltration fluorescence with chlorine addition and their association with thmfp differential spectroscopy has been widely utilized as an independent monitoring tool for ndom to predict dbp formation potentials using the spectral differences associated with the amount of chlorine consumed ike et al 2020 korshin et al 2002 in this study to investigate the correlation between two different fdom i e c1 and c2 and thms generated upon chlorination the changes of the fmax values were tracked with an increase in the chlorine added from 0 5 to 5 0 mg cl2 l fig 5 uv aged eps contaminated soil columns were selected as a representative case because it is expected to generate a high thm formation potential due to the presence of benzene ring groups in the mp structures the intensities of both fdom components steadily declined from the initial value i e before chlorination with an increase in chlorine dosage fig 5c for example the fmax values in c1 decreased from 0 3275 0 0539 r u to 0 0004 0 0001 r u with the change of chlorine concentrations from 0 5 to 5 0 mg cl2 l after 3 days of incubation the differential values of c1 and c2 were positively correlated with the generated thmfp fig 5d and e in particular the differential c1 values or fmax of c1 presented a much stronger positive association with the total thms r2 0 9039 p 0 01 n 24 than differential c2 this trend agreed well with the previous reports in which humic like components exhibited much higher correlations with the yields of dbps i e thms and haas compared with the protein like components hua et al 2010 li et al 2016 no significant correlation was observed between the two parameters in the infiltration from the clean sand columns fig s8 these results suggest that c1 may provide an appropriate fluorescence signature with an improved response to the chlorination reaction thus proving to be a practical optical surrogate for predicting thm formation in sandy subsurface systems although potential interactions between the humic like c1 component and sand matrix may occur within the column the humic like substances leached from uv aged mps seemed to retain their potential to form dbps during infiltration however complementary studies need to be conducted in order to extend its applicability to other regulated dbps such as haas because the dbp formation can be rather selective depending on the types of dbp precursors li et al 2016 employing mass spectrometry for identifying individual mp dom compounds brominated additives or oligomers or oxidized oligomers and so on particularly dom leached from uv irradiated mps could establish a link between the fluorescence signature and specific dbp precursors 3 5 environmental implications and limitations this study is the first to explore the spectroscopic signature of dom infiltration in a model sandy subsurface system contaminated with mps and the potential of infiltration in generating dbps upon chlorination based on a simple lab scale sand column system artificially contaminated with mps at a previously reported level and despite possible environmental inferences that may occur in the system mp contamination was found to affect the doc concentration of sand infiltration as evidenced by marked spectroscopic signatures in the infiltration the stable presence of the spectroscopic signature of mp dom in sand infiltration was confirmed by complementary studies on the effects of biodegradation and mineral adsorption on mp dom traces in sand infiltration the mp dom signature in infiltration was more pronounced when the contaminated mps were previously uv aged this finding is significant because most of the wasted plastic debris is easily weathered by uv irradiation before or during deposition in the top layer of such subsurface systems however this study explored a limited range of environmental settings in terms of soil type sand plastic materials pvc and eps and residence time 7 days therefore it is necessary to validate whether the presented results can be generalized to other soil subsurface systems such a generalization will help minimize uncertainties in identifying the fate of mp dom in terrestrial environments contaminated with waste plastics this study clearly demonstrated that the uv aging of mps affected the extent of dbpfps of infiltration water and also provided evidence of the resistance of mp dom in sand infiltration systems and the subsequent impact on enhanced dbp formation in the infiltration as such it raises the awareness of potential environmental risks associated with dbps upon chlorination when infiltrated water or groundwater is used as potable water although humic like fdom revealed its distinctive feature of mp dom in sand infiltration especially from uv aged mps there is a need to derive a more sophisticated optical index to distinguish between ndom and mp dom in natural subsurface systems further studies involving a range of mp contamination levels in various environmental settings including other subsurface systems consisting of different soil textures are recommended finally the use of high resolution mass spectrometry is critical for identifying the individual signature compounds leached from waste mps in complex subsurface systems studies to determine possible linkages between the observed fluorescence signals and individual mp dom compounds in given subsurface systems should also be conducted 4 conclusions in this novel study we used for the first time a set of unique spectroscopic signatures of mp dom to characterize infiltration from mp contaminated subsurface systems despite the interference of both biodegradation and mineral adsorption the following conclusions were drawn based on the results 1 the uv aging process on mps caused substantial changes in the surface properties which favored the release of mp dom into the pore water of sandy subsurface systems contaminated with mps in the top layer the unique spectroscopic features of mp dom revealed by ft ir and fluorescence spectroscopy were still present in the infiltration 2 despite the possible environmental interference of biodegradation and mineral adsorption within the sand columns mp contamination led to a higher doc concentration of sand infiltration the concentration was higher when the mps were subjected to uv irradiation 4 51 to 9 89 mg c l as compared to those of the pristine mps 0 56 to 0 57 mg c l 3 the h p l ratio an mp dom indicator established its efficacy for sand infiltration in mp contaminated systems the protein phenol like c2 was found to be more labile to the environmental interference of biodegradation and mineral adsorption than the humic like c1 although both components remained at higher levels in the infiltration compared to those from clean sand columns 4 regardless of the type of plastic or uv aging treatment the infiltration from mp contaminated systems exhibited a relatively high formation potential of thms 104 4 to 144 3 μg thm mg c and haas 117 7 to 146 3 μg haa mg c which was even greater than previously reported groundwater and lakeside bank filtrates 5 a significant negative correlation was found between the generated thms and decreased humic like c1 suggesting that c1 may be an optical surrogate for carbonaceous dbps in mp contaminated subsurface systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
