24835,understanding potential effects of climate warming on biogeochemical cycling in freshwater ecosystems is of pressing importance specifically increasing air and water temperatures could accelerate nutrient cycling in lakes which has major implications for in lake nutrient concentrations water column nutrient stoichiometry and downstream nutrient export lakes may respond differentially to warming based on their current trophic state although direct comparisons of temperature driven changes in nutrient cycling between low and high nutrient lakes are lacking here we used an open source coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model to simulate ecosystem scale changes in water column total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations and tn tp ratios due to potential incremental changes in air temperature from 0 c to 6 c in a low nutrient and a high nutrient lake warming resulted in lower tn and higher tp epilimnetic surface water concentrations in both lakes resulting in reduced molar tn tp ratios in both lakes while the high and low nutrient lakes had similar magnitude reductions in tn tp ratio between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios 30 3 and 34 6 respectively median epilimnetic tn tp in the low nutrient lake significantly decreased with as little as 1 c of warming warming also altered net nutrient retention with decreased downstream export of tn but increased downstream export of tp in both lakes our modeling results suggest that low nutrient lakes may respond to warming at lower levels of temperature increase than high nutrient lakes and that climate warming could intensify effects of nutrient enrichment driven by increased n and p loading due to land use change keywords biogeochemical cycling climate change distributed computing grapler nutrients simulation modeling 1 introduction as sentinels of climate change sensu adrian et al 2009 many lakes are warming rapidly o reilly et al 2015 syntheses of satellite imagery and long term in situ monitoring of lake temperatures worldwide indicate that there is widespread warming of lakes in response to air temperature changes with surface water temperatures increasing in some cases by up to 1 3 c per decade o reilly et al 2015 richardson et al 2017b climate models also suggest that warming air temperatures will increase the proportion of lakes in the continental united states that experience prolonged periods of water temperatures in excess of 30 c butcher et al 2017 2015 with implications for habitat suitability food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling butcher et al 2015 magee et al 2019 sahoo et al 2013 wilhelm and adrian 2008 winder et al 2009 consequently it is important to identify the effects of warming air temperatures on lake ecosystem function warming air temperatures can potentially affect lake nutrient concentrations including nitrogen n and phosphorus p through multiple interacting ecosystem processes previous field survey and lake ecosystem modeling studies have demonstrated that as air temperatures increase density differences between surface and bottom water layers can become more pronounced increasing the stability of the water column and resulting in longer and more intense lake thermal stratification adrian et al 2009 foley et al 2012 kraemer et al 2015 richardson et al 2017b longer and stronger periods of stratification often result in prolonged periods of hypoxia dissolved oxygen 2 mg l 1 in the bottom waters foley et al 2012 jiménez cisneros et al 2014 marcé et al 2010 low oxygen in turn can promote the release of dissolved p and ammonium nh4 from the sediments into the water column while simultaneously decreasing nitrate no3 via denitrification stumm and morgan 1996 wetzel 2001 increasing temperatures can also alter nutrient concentrations more directly as phytoplankton growth rates and corresponding dissolved nutrient uptake generally increase with temperature reynolds 2006 warmer temperatures can also directly accelerate water column mineralization thereby increasing nutrient concentrations stumm and morgan 1996 interacting processes are difficult to disentangle at the ecosystem scale especially across a range of air temperature changes which has motivated two decades of microcosm and mesocosm experiments reviewed by fordham 2015 this work has provided important insights to the effect of warming on individual ecological mechanisms however simultaneous consideration of these interacting processes is needed to understand the balance of n and p at the ecosystem scale necessitating other research approaches process based numerical simulation models allow for specific drivers and pathways to be isolated within complex ecosystems e g gal et al 2009 snortheim et al 2017 for example holding external nutrient loads from the catchment constant under multiple air temperature scenarios isolates the effects of temperature on solely within lake processes similarly setting static arrhenius parameters temperature driven rate constants that control the response of biogeochemical rates to temperature arrhenius 1889 ensures that the temperature dependence of different processes is identical among climate scenarios lakes and nutrients allowing us to study their relative importance in model space finally modeling total n and total p rather than individual constituents incorporates changes in dissolved and particulate nutrients that occur due to phytoplankton uptake and remineralization which are included in the total nutrient fraction because of the multiple interacting mechanisms by which air temperature can alter nutrient transformations it is challenging to predict the net effect of warming on ecosystem scale n and p cycling in lakes which will subsequently alter downstream export of nutrients increasing air temperature will have multiple indirect effects on lakes and their catchments such as changing the water temperature and nutrient mineralization rates of inflow streams jeppesen et al 2010 however examining the direct effects of air temperature change represents an important first step for understanding lake biogeochemical responses to climate change specifically it is possible that nutrient cycling in low nutrient lakes may exhibit greater sensitivity to the direct effects of warming than in high nutrient lakes collins et al 2019 for example as warming increases the duration and intensity of thermal stratification in a low nutrient lake it may induce bottom water hypoxia for the first time which would in turn initiate internal n and p loading from the sediments into the water column representing a fundamental change to the lake s biogeochemistry and ecosystem functioning beutel and horne 2018 in comparison it is possible that any warming induced increase in the duration of hypoxia and intensity of internal loading in high nutrient lakes may primarily reinforce the existing high nutrient state high nutrient lakes tend to already experience hypoxia under current climatic conditions and the baseline nutrient mineralization and sediment release rates are likely already high though we are unaware of any previous study that has directly demonstrated this mechanism here we used eleven years of observational data to calibrate and validate a coupled one dimensional hydrodynamic and biogeochemical lake model for a low nutrient lake and a high nutrient lake we used the calibrated models to estimate the effects of different climate warming scenarios on each lake s n and p cycling and export focusing on ecosystem scale responses specifically we quantified the direct net effects of climate warming on the timing and duration of hypoxia and coincident changes in surface water n and p concentrations to improve our understanding of how nutrient cycling in the two lakes may change with warming temperatures we also quantified how warming may alter lake nutrient retention and downstream export which have important implications for water quality in the larger catchment biogeochemical cycling in low nutrient lakes is generally understudied relative to high nutrient lakes despite a rapid decline in the number of low nutrient lakes across the continental u s stoddard et al 2016 this provides additional motivation to understand how trophic state mediates responses to warming thus comparing n and p dynamics in two lakes of different trophic state under a range of temperature warming scenarios advances our understanding of ecosystem scale responses to future warming beyond a single lake or single scenario study and highlights the importance of historical nutrient baselines for predicting future ecosystem conditions 2 methods 2 1 modeled lakes we modeled lake responses to climate warming based on two well studied north temperate lakes lake mendota wisconsin usa and lake sunapee new hampshire usa fig 1 these two lakes share multiple common characteristics including glacial origin climate seasonality due to similar latitude a dimictic mixing regime and inflows dominated by surface water table 1 cobourn et al 2018 in addition the lakes have similar mean depths and water residence times table 1 the lakes also differ in watershed land use which contributes to substantial differences in lake water nutrient concentrations table 1 the mendota watershed is large relative to the lake area and is dominated by agriculture 67 and urban development 22 which deliver large n and p loads to the lake and contribute to mendota s high nutrient state cobourn et al 2018 snortheim et al 2017 in contrast the sunapee catchment is relatively small compared to the lake surface area and is 80 forested with only 6 currently developed richardson et al 2017a nutrient inputs to the lake are low resulting in sunapee s low nutrient state carey et al 2014 given their contrasting nutrient concentrations these two lakes serve as approximate end members on a continuum of trophic state rather than simulating simplified imaginary model ecosystems e g identical lakes with hemispherical basins and no inflow tributaries we used lakes mendota and sunapee for this study because we needed their rich long term monitoring datasets to ensure that our parameterized models were appropriately capturing baseline conditions for a high and low nutrient lake in addition we used air temperature warming scenarios of up to 6 c based on downscaled data for these two lakes vs simulated air temperature scenarios based on global averages after the models representing mendota and sunapee were calibrated with observational data we focused on these two lake models as idealized high nutrient and low nutrient ecosystems respectively to examine potential responses to climate warming for temperate lakes of different baseline water quality 2 2 model description and driver data we used the open source one dimensional hydrodynamic general lake model glm version 2 1 8 hipsey et al 2014 2019 to model the energy and water budget of each lake the aquatic ecodynamics library aed hipsey et al 2013 was coupled with glm hereafter glm aed to model water quality dynamics including changes in concentrations of dissolved oxygen do n and p we chose glm aed because it has dynamic vertically resolved layers within a lake which allows for comparisons of stratified biogeochemical processes hipsey et al 2019 moreover the heat transfer and mixing algorithms in glm developed by hamilton and schladow 1997 have been found to successfully reproduce observed water temperatures of lakes with varying conditions e g mixing regime climate latitude morphology around the world bruce et al 2018 glm aed is particularly suited for studying how climate warming may alter ecosystem scale lake nutrient cycling because it is able to simultaneously simulate lake stratification dynamics and a suite of interacting n and p processes bruce et al 2018 hipsey et al 2019 2013 these biogeochemical processes include nitrification denitrification sediment fluxes of no3 nh4 phosphate po4 3 dissolved organic p dop dissolved organic n don particulate organic p pop and particulate organic n pon po4 3 adsorption desorption don dop pon and pop water column mineralization no3 nh4 and po4 3 phytoplankton uptake zooplankton excretion of don dop pon and pop and the settling rate of all n and p fractions hipsey et al 2013 all of these processes will directly respond to warming temperatures because the underlying model equations include arrhenius parameters governing their temperature dependence hence the need for an ecosystem modeling approach to address our study s objectives hipsey et al 2019 the glm aed combines lake morphometry with meteorological and inflow driver data to simulate a water budget and thermal profile for each lake we compiled observed hourly meteorological driver data for each lake from the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 these data included air temperature c wind speed m s 1 relative humidity shortwave and longwave radiation w m 2 and precipitation m d 1 for the full model period we used a combination of observational and statistically modeled data to develop a daily time series for the surface inflows to each lake which included tributary inflow rates m3 s 1 inflow water temperature c and inorganic and organic fractions of n and p mmol m 3 see supplement a for lake specific inflow data sources and model simulations we included eight different p and n fractions in our inflow files filterable reactive p frp adsorbed frp dop pop no3 nh4 don and pon inflow data also included two fractions of organic carbon particulate and dissolved each lake model included a single outflow discharge file at a daily time step supplement a we ran each lake model at an hourly time step over an eleven year period from 8 november 2003 to 31 december 2014 we chose this period because it represents the most complete time series of high frequency observational data for both lakes and encompasses a representative range of climatic events for each modeled lake including both flood and drought periods and particularly cool and warm years in addition the length of the model runs allows for integration of background meteorological variability that occurs over time 2 3 baseline calibration and validation we calibrated the baseline glm aed model for each lake using the 7 year period from 1 april 2004 31 december 2010 and validated model state variables using the 4 year period from 1 january 2011 31 december 2014 the model spin up period was from 8 november 2003 through 31 march 2004 meaning we did not analyze model outputs prior to 1 april 2004 during calibration we manually changed model parameters for each lake with the goal of sequentially optimizing goodness of fit gof metrics for a suite of focal state variables water balance water temperature do n p with a focus on reproducing seasonal patterns and peak timing for each state variable following kara et al 2012 lake specific calibration focused on parameters related to lake morphometry and physical mixing nutrient fluxes at the sediment water interface and settling rates of organic c n and p importantly almost all other parameter values governing water column biogeochemical processes e g all arrhenius temperature multipliers half saturation o2 concentrations governing biogeochemical fluxes and maximum aerobic mineralization rates for organic c n and p were set as identical between lakes so that the only parameters that differed between the two models were related to inherent differences in trophic state e g higher sediment po4 3 release rates in the high nutrient lake than the low nutrient lake tables a2 a5 we used a general set of parameters to represent phytoplankton and zooplankton groups in both lakes following hipsey et al 2013 because phytoplankton and zooplankton were not the focus of this analysis model outputs of water temperature do total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were compared to both low frequency manual water samples up to twice monthly and high frequency buoy data hourly from april october each year collected from the deepest point in each lake supplement a lake sunapee buoy data were collected by the lake sunapee protective association lspa richardson et al 2020 and lake mendota data were collected through the north temperate lakes long term ecological research ntl lter site magnuson et al 2010a 2010b 2010c 2010d for both lakes we compared observed maximum daily water temperature and mean daily do concentrations from both manual and buoy measurements to modeled daily noon water temperatures and do concentrations supplement a magnuson et al 2010a 2010b manual samples of tn and tp were available up to twice monthly sunapee carey et al 2014 steiner and titus 2017 mendota magnuson et al 2010a 2010d and were compared to mean daily model outputs for each lake supplement a we calculated four gof metrics to compare model outputs and observational data coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse spearman s rank correlation coefficient spearman s rho ρ and normalized mean absolute error nmae kara et al 2012 using the hydrogof package for r zambrano bigiarini 2017 separate gof calculations were made for the epilimnion 0 4 m both lakes and hypolimnion 16 20 m both lakes we focused on these layers to compare representative epilimnetic and hypolimnetic depths between the two lakes using different layer depths yielded qualitatively similar results we chose to use layers instead of discrete depths for calibration and validation to maximize available manual observational data for comparison with model output evaporation effects on the lakes water levels were negligible relative to precipitation permitting the use of the same layer depths over time and among scenarios within lakes figure a1 2 4 climate warming simulations to model changes in lake nutrient dynamics with climate warming we ran a suite of downscaled climate warming scenarios ranging from 0 to 6 c above 2003 2014 air temperatures for each lake the scenarios were developed to encompass the maximum range of potential warming above historical 1950 1980 conditions projected for the lakes in year 2099 based on macav2 metdata downscaled global climate models abatzoglou 2013 abatzoglou and brown 2012 taylor et al 2012 for lake mendota maximum air temperature warming of approximately 5 4 c is projected by 2099 under rcp8 5 relative to historical conditions while lake sunapee is projected to warm by approximately 5 7 c by 2099 we applied these potential warming air temperature scenarios to the historical 2003 2014 period and held all other meteorological driver variables constant to compare scenario output with the baseline 2004 2014 simulation output while these simplified scenarios did not include the weather variability expected with future climate change e g hayhoe et al 2008 2010 it allowed us to isolate the direct effects of different levels of potential air temperature warming on ecosystem scale lake nutrient cycling because it is computationally intensive to model a range of climate scenarios for multiple lakes we implemented a distributed computing platform grapler www graple org that enables users to run lake model simulations submitted from the r environment on cloud computing and cyber infrastructure resources subratie et al 2017a simulations are distributed across processing nodes that have been aggregated into a peer to peer overlay virtual private network subratie et al 2017b dramatically reducing computation time 2 5 data analysis model outputs of focal state variables in each climate warming scenario were compared to the baseline simulation with a focus on the period between 1 april and 31 october each year henceforth summer which includes spring mixing summer thermal stratification and fall mixing in both lakes figure a2 a3 by comparing the scenario model outputs to the baseline model output not observational data our analyses focused on the temperature responses of idealized high and low nutrient lakes based on mendota and sunapee respectively we focused primarily on the differences between the baseline 0 c and 6 c scenarios to examine the direct effects of a range of warming possibilities on nutrient cycling in the selected lakes we first calculated daily schmidt stability j m 2 for each lake across warming scenarios to test whether air temperature warming increased water column stratification using the lake analyzer tools read et al 2011 in matlab version r2018b mathworks natick ma usa we then summarized daily estimates of stability as summer medians each year in the 2004 2014 modeling period and used those values to compare the range and overall among year summer median stability across scenarios we calculated stratification duration as the number of days for which water temperatures between the surface 0 m and hypolimnion 20 m in mendota 18 m in sunapee differed by more than 1 c following woolway et al 2014 and based on historical monitoring data for both lakes which show that this threshold reasonably delineates mixed vs stratified periods these depths were chosen based on hypsographic curves and represent the hypolimnetic depth that encompasses approximately 80 of the sediment area in each lake to quantify the incidence of hypoxia we calculated the number of days each summer 1 april 31 october for which hypolimnetic do concentrations 20 m in mendota 18 m in sunapee were 2 mg l 1 we then compared the median number of hypoxic do days for each summer and its range among warming scenarios for each lake we calculated median concentrations for epilimnetic 0 m both lakes and hypolimnetic 20 m in mendota 18 m in sunapee tn µg l 1 tp µg l 1 and median molar tn tp each summer we then used anderson darling statistical tests razali and wah 2011 to make pairwise comparisons between the distributions of each response variable tn tp tn tp across the 11 year model period 2004 2014 between each incremental climate warming scenario and the baseline distribution we also compared model outputs of denitrification nh4 mineralization and po4 3 fluxes at the sediment water interface among scenarios to assess potential mechanisms for changes in tn and tp concentrations finally we estimated net fluxes of tn and tp as a percent of inputs each summer for both lakes following powers et al 2015 f net summer 100 outputs inputs inputs where outputs and inputs represent the daily mass of tn or tp leaving and entering the lake respectively during the period of 1 april to 31 october each year daily stream inflow concentrations of tn and tp constituents were summed to calculate daily inflow tn and tp then multiplied by daily inflow volume to yield the daily mass of tn and tp inputs daily median epilimnetic tn and tp concentrations were multiplied by outflow volume to calculate the mass of tn and tp outputs as both lake s outflows are composed of surface water daily inputs and outputs were summed across the 1 april to 31 october period each year to estimate fnet summer with fnet summer 0 signifying that the lake was a net source downstream export of tn or tp and fnet summer 0 indicating that the lake was a net sink retention and or removal of n or p all analyses except for the matlab lake analyzer calculations were conducted in r version 3 5 2 r core team 2019 3 results 3 1 model calibration for both lakes calibrated models of glm aed reasonably simulated observed dynamics in focal physical and chemical state variables in the baseline 2004 2014 simulation table 2 figs 3 and 4 modeled water temperatures were generally within an rmse of 2 c for both lakes with better fits for both manual and buoy data in the epilimnion than the hypolimnion figs 3a 4a dissolved oxygen rmse was 2 5 mg l 1 for all depths and data sources in each lake figs 3b 4b while there were fewer observations of n and p than temperature and do particularly in lake sunapee model fits generally reproduced the seasonality and range of concentrations in both lakes table 2 figs 3c d 4c d although the calibrated sunapee model had higher bias for tp than mendota table 2 fig 4d we deemed the calibration acceptable because it minimized differences in parameterization of biogeochemical processes between the two lakes to enable comparison of temperature scenarios moreover all subsequent analyses were focused on comparison of the scenario model outputs to the baseline model output not observational data 3 2 strength of stratification and duration of hypoxia increase with climate warming climate warming scenarios led to warming of the water column in both lakes fig 5 between the baseline 0 c and 6 c air temperature scenarios among year median summer surface water temperatures increased in both lakes with a 19 1 3 8 c increase from the baseline in the high nutrient lake individual year median change ranging from 3 1 c to 4 1 c and a 19 2 3 6 c increase in the low nutrient lake individual year change 3 3 c to 4 0 c the hypolimnion of each lake experienced less warming than the epilimnion overall between the baseline and 6 c scenarios but was more variable among years with a 5 4 0 7 c increase from the baseline in the high nutrient lake individual year change 1 4 c to 4 0 c and a 12 5 1 3 c increase in the low nutrient lake individual year change 0 2 c to 3 3 c warmer surface water temperatures amplified thermal stratification in both lakes fig 5 among year median schmidt stability between 1 april and 31 october increased 50 in the high nutrient lake individual year change 5 to 95 and 57 in the low nutrient lake individual year change 34 to 105 between the baseline and 6 c scenarios fig 6a in addition the year to year variability in schmidt stability increased with warming with the range of summer medians increasing 2 1 in the high nutrient lake and 1 1 in the low nutrient lake between the baseline and 6 c scenarios fig 6a along with intensifying stratification the duration of stratification increased among scenarios though the amount of change differed between lakes and was highly variable year to year in the high nutrient lake among year median stratification duration increased eight days from 193 to 201 days between the baseline and 6 c scenarios year to year range 35 to 50 days with the average spring onset of stratification occurring seven days sooner and fall turnover occurring one day later in the 6 c scenario than in the baseline in contrast among years the low nutrient lake experienced spring onset three days sooner and turnover four days later resulting in a median change in stratification duration of seven days from 205 to 212 year to year range 24 to 42 days warming induced changes in stability and stratification likely contributed to the observed increase in the extent and duration of low do concentrations in the hypolimnion of both lakes fig 7 6b between the baseline 0 c and 6 c scenarios hypoxic do concentrations in the hypolimnion occurred earlier in the year and lasted longer resulting in more summer days with do concentrations 2 mg l 1 fig 6b in the high nutrient lake there were up to 1 1 as many summer hypoxic days under the 6 c scenario as the baseline maximum 131 vs 119 days per year respectively in the low nutrient lake effects on do were much larger and warming led to the development of prolonged hypolimnetic hypoxia for the first time with up to 39 hypoxic days per summer under 6 c warming compared to a maximum of one hypoxic day per summer in the baseline simulation fig 6b in addition more intense warming resulted in greater hypoxia in the low nutrient lake with 6 c warming summer hypoxia occurred in five of 11 simulation years versus in only one of 11 simulation years for scenarios with up to 2 c warming as with stability the year to year variability of hypoxia duration in the low nutrient lake also increased with warming with the range of medians increasing from one to 39 days between the baseline and 6 c scenarios fig 6b in contrast the range of medians was 41 days in the high nutrient lake for both the baseline and 6 c scenarios fig 6b 3 3 epilimnetic tn and tp concentrations and stoichiometric ratios change with warming climate warming had ecosystem scale effects on nutrient cycling that resulted in altered epilimnetic tn and tp concentrations though the magnitude of responses was lake specific and the direction of change differed between tn and tp in both lakes surface tn decreased between the baseline 0 c and 6 c scenarios in the high nutrient lake the among year median summer epilimnetic tn was 19 2 lower in the 6 c scenario than in the baseline scenario fig 8a with a statistically significant change in the distribution of median summer epilimnetic tn compared to the baseline simulation with warming of at least 5 c table 3 fig 8a the low nutrient lake also exhibited decreased epilimnetic tn with climate warming among year median tn was 30 4 lower in the 6 c scenario than in the baseline scenario importantly in the low nutrient lake there was a statistically significant shift in the distribution of median summer tn relative to the baseline when warming was at least 2 c table 3 fig 8a decreased tn concentrations were likely driven by increased rates of denitrification with warming among year median water column denitrification rates increased 45 0 and 37 6 in the high and low nutrient lakes respectively between the baseline and 6 c scenarios warming also increased n processing rates at the sediment water interface in both lakes nh4 fluxes from the sediments into the water column increased 42 7 and 35 1 in the high and low nutrient lakes respectively among years between the baseline and 6 c scenarios among year median denitrification rates at the sediment water interface also increased up 29 9 in the high nutrient lake and 26 6 in the low nutrient lake between the baseline and 6 c scenarios in contrast to tn both lakes exhibited increased epilimnetic tp concentrations in the 6 c scenario compared to the baseline scenario though the magnitude of change differed between lakes in the high nutrient lake among year median summer epilimnetic tp was 23 1 higher in the 6 c scenario than in the baseline scenario fig 8b with a significant shift in the distribution of summer surface tp with warming of 6 c table 3 in the low nutrient lake among year epilimnetic tp increased 8 9 between the baseline and 6 c scenario fig 8b with significant shifts in the distribution of median summer tp with at least 2 c of warming these changes were attributed to increased p fluxes from the sediments with warming temperatures median sediment fluxes increased 33 5 and 33 6 in the high and low nutrient lakes respectively between the baseline and 6 c scenarios lake specific differences in tn and tp in response to warming led to differences in the epilimnetic n p stoichiometry in both lakes but the low nutrient lake was more sensitive to low levels of warming in the high nutrient lake among year median epilimnetic molar tn tp was 30 3 lower between the baseline and 6 c warming scenarios fig 8c and the distributions of summer median tn tp were significantly lower than the baseline with at least 4 c of warming table 3 in the low nutrient lake the proportional shift in epilimnetic tn tp distribution was similar to that of the high nutrient lake with an among year median reduction of 34 6 between the baseline and 6 c scenarios however the distribution of tn tp in the low nutrient lake was shifted significantly lower than the baseline with as little as 1 c of warming table 3 fig 8c 3 4 warming differentially changes net export of n and p warming generally decreased tn export but increased tp export downstream for both lakes during the summer 1 april 31 october fig 9 in the high nutrient lake among year median summer tn export downstream decreased 2 2 between the baseline and 6 c scenarios individual year change 5 9 to 0 4 while in the low nutrient lake tn export decreased 16 1 between the same scenarios individual year change 24 6 to 3 5 resulting in greater net n retention and or removal in both lakes during the summer in both lakes variability in tn export decreased with warming the year to year range of summer export decreased 22 2 in the high nutrient lake and 28 5 in the low nutrient lake between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios both lakes remained net sinks of n summer fluxes 0 among years and across scenarios both lakes exhibited lower net retention and greater downstream export of tp during the summer with greater changes observed in the high nutrient lake than the low nutrient lake under warming scenarios among year median tp export downstream in the high nutrient lake increased 29 6 between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios individual year change 4 2 to 170 net tp export in the high nutrient lake exhibited high year to year variability in the baseline scenario 71 0 to 16 7 and the year to year range increased 57 8 between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios with at least one year estimated as a net source of p summer export 0 with warming of at least 2 c fig 9 in the low nutrient lake tp export downstream increased but much less than in the high nutrient lake 16 2 between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios individual year change 1 6 to 40 2 baseline year to year variability in tp export was also lower in the low nutrient lake than in the high nutrient lake 38 9 to 18 2 and variability decreased slightly 8 7 between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios unlike the high nutrient lake the low nutrient lake consistently acted as a net sink of p summer export 0 across all warming scenarios and years 4 discussion 4 1 ecosystem scale effects of climate warming our study provides new evidence that ecosystem scale nutrient cycling in both high and low nutrient lakes is sensitive to air temperature warming though sensitivity likely varies by lake trophic state specifically low nutrient lakes may experience significant changes in nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry at lower levels of warming than high nutrient lakes we observed lower tn and higher tp concentrations in both lakes as they warmed but the low nutrient lake exhibited significant changes in epilimnetic nutrients and tn tp ratios at 1 2 c of warming vs 5 6 c of warming in the high nutrient lake consequently as the number of low nutrient lakes is rapidly declining across the continental u s stoddard et al 2016 due to increased n and p loading from ongoing land use change and an increased incidence of extreme events delivering terrestrial nutrients and sediments e g kelly et al 2019 prein et al 2017 our study demonstrates that climate warming may intensify lake eutrophication our modeling study corroborates empirical data from field surveys mesocosm experiments and paleolimnological records that illustrate how climate warming can transform lake ecosystem functioning reviewed by havens and jeppesen 2018 jeppesen et al 2014 moss 2012 other modeling studies that have used process based one dimensional lake simulation models have shown how climate warming alters lake thermal profiles and mixing regimes bueche et al 2017 bueche and vetter 2015 fenocchi et al 2018 woolway and merchant 2019 hypolimnetic anoxia fang et al 2012 ito and momii 2015 snortheim et al 2017 stefan et al 1993 and nutrient cycling arheimer et al 2005 komatsu et al 2007 malmaeus et al 2006 our study builds upon these earlier modeling analyses to add new evidence that lake nutrient concentrations through linked biogeochemical processes may change differentially across a range of potential air temperature warming scenarios depending on lake trophic state 4 2 potential drivers of lake nutrient changes the complexity and non linearity of ecosystem processes makes it challenging to predict how changing external drivers due to altered climate e g warming air temperature may affect ecosystem functioning burkett et al 2005 parrott and meyer 2012 shaver et al 2000 necessitating our modeling approach in lakes n and p concentrations in surface waters are jointly controlled by external loading from the catchment climate forcing and internal nutrient cycling nürnberg 1984 stumm and morgan 1996 wetzel 2001 creating complex patterns in observational data that challenge our ability to link cause and effect in empirical studies reviewed by carpenter 1988 following the precedent of previous modeling studies e g komatsu et al 2007 snortheim et al 2017 we held external nutrient loads constant while manipulating air temperature driver data thereby simplifying the inherent complexity of lake nutrient cycling to isolate the effects of climate warming on epilimnetic nutrients our findings highlight the strong coupling between lake thermal structure and nutrient cycling and how that coupling may vary between lakes of different trophic state warmer air temperatures lead to stronger thermal stratification which further isolates hypolimnetic waters from the atmosphere reducing the availability of oxygen for biogeochemical processing snortheim et al 2017 while previous research has implied the importance of this mechanism for nutrient cycling e g pettersson et al 2003 sahoo et al 2013 our results show that not only will warmer air temperatures promote hypolimnetic hypoxia but will also reduce surface water tn while increasing tp due to the complexity of lake ecosystem simulations these changes in nutrient concentrations cannot be attributed to a single process but rather emerge from interactions of multiple processes in the model we use the lake model as a calibrated experimental tool linking drivers and physical ecological processes that likely lead to the changing nutrient concentrations we observed in the model results we show that the links between thermal structure hypoxia and temperature mediated biogeochemical cycling all are important to n and p concentrations in a warming climate but their importance depends on lake characteristics our data support previous findings that in the absence of changes to hydrology and external nutrient loading warming alone can substantially alter lake thermal structure magee and wu 2017a palmer et al 2014 richardson et al 2017b woolway and merchant 2019 and in turn oxythermal habitat fang et al 2012 magee et al 2019 and nutrient processing komatsu et al 2007 radbourne et al 2019 in our scenarios the hypolimnion warmed less than the epilimnion but lake warming was more variable among years as air temperatures increased this is consistent with previous research on lakes across the northeastern united states that found approximately half of lakes experience deepwater warming as air temperatures increase while others experience deepwater cooling richardson et al 2017b similarly our models indicated that schmidt stability and duration of stratification increased with warming as was found in previous climate warming simulations based on lake archetypes in which model lakes were conceptualized to encompass regionally representative ranges of lake depth surface area and water clarity butcher et al 2015 the observed decreases in tn concentrations associated with warming are likely related to greater hypoxia and subsequent n removal from the lakes by denitrification previous empirical surveys of water chemistry across latitudinal gradients showed greater n limitation in warmer tropical lakes that are thermally stratified most of the year with increased denitrification potential driven by reduced oxygen availability in warmer hypolimnia lewis jr 1996 and references therein lewis jr 2002 talling and lemoalle 1998 our modeling results show that lakes can exhibit a similar change in n cycling in a warming climate in the warmest scenario there were over 10 more days per year with hypoxia in the low nutrient lake than under baseline conditions and 1 1 as many days with hypoxia in the high nutrient lake increasing no3 removal from the water column by 38 in the low nutrient lake and 45 in the high nutrient lake relative to baseline rates this increased rate of n removal exceeded higher rates of nh4 mineralization up 43 and 35 in the high and low nutrient lakes respectively from the sediments due to warmer waters resulting in net tn decreases increased tp concentrations in both lakes in our study likely relate to increases in hypolimnetic hypoxia do 2 mg l 1 while hypolimnetic anoxia do 0 mg l 1 is an established mechanism for stimulating the release of p bound in sediments into the water column nürnberg 1984 wetzel 2001 it is less well understood how changes in hypoxia may affect surface water nutrient concentrations previous empirical studies have shown that hypoxia can increase p fluxes from the sediments and subsequent downstream export gerling et al 2016 even in low nutrient lakes north et al 2014 our modeling results suggest a similar behavior in lakes experiencing warming lakes in our study had increased incidence of hypoxia which created low do conditions in the hypolimnion that increased p fluxes from the sediments into the water column at 6 c warming fluxes of p from the sediments were 34 higher than baseline rates in both lakes interestingly although our analysis focused on the differences between the baseline 0 c scenario and 6 c potential warming scenario the physical and chemical responses of both lakes appeared to be mostly linear for intermediate warming scenarios figs 5 8 and 9 as noted above we cannot precisely quantify the relative importance of thermal stratification decreases in hypolimnetic oxygen or temperature mediated nutrient cycling rates on surface tn and tp as these processes are strongly interconnected and occur simultaneously within the model more empirical data from years with contrasting air temperature and hypolimnetic oxygen conditions could be used to disentangle these drivers additionally future work implementing a two or three dimensional coupled hydrodynamic ecosystem model could be used to identify hotspots of n and p biogeochemical cycling within each lake ecosystem sensu bocaniov et al 2016 cavalcanti et al 2016 thereby informing the relative importance of oxygen thermal stratification and water temperature 4 3 differences in warming response between a high nutrient and a low nutrient lake our models of lake mendota and lake sunapee enable comparisons of idealized high and low nutrient lakes as a first step toward understanding how the net direct effects of warming on tn and tp cycles in lakes may differ across trophic states across our warming scenarios we found that the magnitude of relative changes in tn tp ratios tended to be similar between the two lakes though reductions in tn were substantially higher in the low nutrient lake than the high nutrient lake while tp increases were proportionally larger in the high nutrient lake than the low nutrient lake the most notable difference between lakes was the temperature increase at which nutrient concentrations and ratios exhibited statistically significant changes in the high nutrient lake tn tp and tn tp were significantly different from baseline conditions at 5 c 6 c and 4 c respectively in contrast the low nutrient lake experienced significant changes in tn tp and tn tp at 2 c 2 c and 1 c respectively this consistently lower threshold for responses suggests that ecosystem scale processes in the low nutrient lake may be fundamentally more sensitive to warming air temperatures which aligns with predictions that high nutrient lakes may have more muted responses to climate warming collins et al 2019 these results highlight the value of using decadal scale ecosystem models coupled with long term data to understand potential implications of climate warming on lake ecosystems our 11 year model period allowed for the detection of overall trends in tn and tp cycling in both lakes despite substantial year to year variability in nutrient concentrations and fluxes driven in part by background variability in meteorological and inflow driver data the use of whole ecosystem simulation models to detect relatively small changes in nutrient concentrations can provide important insights into how lake nutrient cycling at the ecosystem scale may change over decadal scales while our focus here was on the glm aed ecosystem model we note that other approaches including mesocosm experiments field surveys and statistical models reviewed by jeppesen et al 2014 also provide valuable context for understanding ecosystem responses to warming indeed a combination of modeling and empirical approaches will likely provide the strongest insights about potential future changes in lake responses to warming 4 4 lake warming in the context of climate change climate change is expected to elicit non linear interconnected changes in lake ecosystem functions while our lake models simulate many interconnected ecosystem scale biogeochemical processes that will change in response to the direct effects of increasing air temperature our relatively simplistic uniform year round air temperature scenarios do not account for potential effects of variability in air temperature warming hayhoe et al 2010 2008 which will affect the onset and intensity of seasonal stratification and in turn nutrient cycling in addition our current approach does not include potential indirect effects of warming and other aspects of climate change that are likely to affect nutrient cycling in lake mendota and lake sunapee for example climate warming is expected to change the timing and intensity of precipitation e g mearns et al 2013 and increase upstream nutrient leaching in temperate lake catchments jeppesen et al 2010 2009 which would affect inflow water volumes and nutrient concentrations for our model lakes such changes could be further compounded by human driven land use change in lake watersheds resulting in dramatically altered nutrient loading to lakes cobourn et al 2018 fraterrigo and downing 2008 in addition warming temperatures will alter the phytoplankton community reviewed by carey et al 2012 such that the current model parameterization of phytoplankton functional groups is unlikely to be representative of future communities further it is likely that warming will also alter lake carbon dynamics in addition to nitrogen and phosphorus cycling bartosiewicz et al 2019 using a coupled catchment lake model and harnessing the power of the grapler distributed computing framework subratie et al 2017a in future work to generate millions of additional scenarios that explore the interactive effects and potential emergent properties of multiple global change variables would greatly improve our understanding of the nuanced ways that climate change will likely affect lakes in addition it is possible that different model parameterizations would result in different nutrient responses however the similarity of relative changes in water temperature thermal stratification denitrification sediment p fluxes and summer tn export between the two lakes calibrated to represent varying trophic states suggests that lake results are robust finally while our analysis focused on the stratified period of lake mendota and lake sunapee 1 april to 31 october as north temperate dimictic lakes both lakes currently experience ice covered periods for multiple months each winter bruesewitz et al 2015 magee et al 2016 across the full year warming may exacerbate changes in nutrient processing and retention in our focal lakes as increased air temperatures reduce ice cover duration and ice thickness e g magee and wu 2017b despite these limitations our study provides evidence that ecosystem scale nutrient concentrations can change sometimes substantially due to increases in air temperature alone thus decreases in inflow nutrients could help alleviate the expected effects of climate warming credit authorship contribution statement kaitlin j farrell conceptualization methodology data curation validation formal analysis

24835,understanding potential effects of climate warming on biogeochemical cycling in freshwater ecosystems is of pressing importance specifically increasing air and water temperatures could accelerate nutrient cycling in lakes which has major implications for in lake nutrient concentrations water column nutrient stoichiometry and downstream nutrient export lakes may respond differentially to warming based on their current trophic state although direct comparisons of temperature driven changes in nutrient cycling between low and high nutrient lakes are lacking here we used an open source coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model to simulate ecosystem scale changes in water column total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations and tn tp ratios due to potential incremental changes in air temperature from 0 c to 6 c in a low nutrient and a high nutrient lake warming resulted in lower tn and higher tp epilimnetic surface water concentrations in both lakes resulting in reduced molar tn tp ratios in both lakes while the high and low nutrient lakes had similar magnitude reductions in tn tp ratio between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios 30 3 and 34 6 respectively median epilimnetic tn tp in the low nutrient lake significantly decreased with as little as 1 c of warming warming also altered net nutrient retention with decreased downstream export of tn but increased downstream export of tp in both lakes our modeling results suggest that low nutrient lakes may respond to warming at lower levels of temperature increase than high nutrient lakes and that climate warming could intensify effects of nutrient enrichment driven by increased n and p loading due to land use change keywords biogeochemical cycling climate change distributed computing grapler nutrients simulation modeling 1 introduction as sentinels of climate change sensu adrian et al 2009 many lakes are warming rapidly o reilly et al 2015 syntheses of satellite imagery and long term in situ monitoring of lake temperatures worldwide indicate that there is widespread warming of lakes in response to air temperature changes with surface water temperatures increasing in some cases by up to 1 3 c per decade o reilly et al 2015 richardson et al 2017b climate models also suggest that warming air temperatures will increase the proportion of lakes in the continental united states that experience prolonged periods of water temperatures in excess of 30 c butcher et al 2017 2015 with implications for habitat suitability food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling butcher et al 2015 magee et al 2019 sahoo et al 2013 wilhelm and adrian 2008 winder et al 2009 consequently it is important to identify the effects of warming air temperatures on lake ecosystem function warming air temperatures can potentially affect lake nutrient concentrations including nitrogen n and phosphorus p through multiple interacting ecosystem processes previous field survey and lake ecosystem modeling studies have demonstrated that as air temperatures increase density differences between surface and bottom water layers can become more pronounced increasing the stability of the water column and resulting in longer and more intense lake thermal stratification adrian et al 2009 foley et al 2012 kraemer et al 2015 richardson et al 2017b longer and stronger periods of stratification often result in prolonged periods of hypoxia dissolved oxygen 2 mg l 1 in the bottom waters foley et al 2012 jiménez cisneros et al 2014 marcé et al 2010 low oxygen in turn can promote the release of dissolved p and ammonium nh4 from the sediments into the water column while simultaneously decreasing nitrate no3 via denitrification stumm and morgan 1996 wetzel 2001 increasing temperatures can also alter nutrient concentrations more directly as phytoplankton growth rates and corresponding dissolved nutrient uptake generally increase with temperature reynolds 2006 warmer temperatures can also directly accelerate water column mineralization thereby increasing nutrient concentrations stumm and morgan 1996 interacting processes are difficult to disentangle at the ecosystem scale especially across a range of air temperature changes which has motivated two decades of microcosm and mesocosm experiments reviewed by fordham 2015 this work has provided important insights to the effect of warming on individual ecological mechanisms however simultaneous consideration of these interacting processes is needed to understand the balance of n and p at the ecosystem scale necessitating other research approaches process based numerical simulation models allow for specific drivers and pathways to be isolated within complex ecosystems e g gal et al 2009 snortheim et al 2017 for example holding external nutrient loads from the catchment constant under multiple air temperature scenarios isolates the effects of temperature on solely within lake processes similarly setting static arrhenius parameters temperature driven rate constants that control the response of biogeochemical rates to temperature arrhenius 1889 ensures that the temperature dependence of different processes is identical among climate scenarios lakes and nutrients allowing us to study their relative importance in model space finally modeling total n and total p rather than individual constituents incorporates changes in dissolved and particulate nutrients that occur due to phytoplankton uptake and remineralization which are included in the total nutrient fraction because of the multiple interacting mechanisms by which air temperature can alter nutrient transformations it is challenging to predict the net effect of warming on ecosystem scale n and p cycling in lakes which will subsequently alter downstream export of nutrients increasing air temperature will have multiple indirect effects on lakes and their catchments such as changing the water temperature and nutrient mineralization rates of inflow streams jeppesen et al 2010 however examining the direct effects of air temperature change represents an important first step for understanding lake biogeochemical responses to climate change specifically it is possible that nutrient cycling in low nutrient lakes may exhibit greater sensitivity to the direct effects of warming than in high nutrient lakes collins et al 2019 for example as warming increases the duration and intensity of thermal stratification in a low nutrient lake it may induce bottom water hypoxia for the first time which would in turn initiate internal n and p loading from the sediments into the water column representing a fundamental change to the lake s biogeochemistry and ecosystem functioning beutel and horne 2018 in comparison it is possible that any warming induced increase in the duration of hypoxia and intensity of internal loading in high nutrient lakes may primarily reinforce the existing high nutrient state high nutrient lakes tend to already experience hypoxia under current climatic conditions and the baseline nutrient mineralization and sediment release rates are likely already high though we are unaware of any previous study that has directly demonstrated this mechanism here we used eleven years of observational data to calibrate and validate a coupled one dimensional hydrodynamic and biogeochemical lake model for a low nutrient lake and a high nutrient lake we used the calibrated models to estimate the effects of different climate warming scenarios on each lake s n and p cycling and export focusing on ecosystem scale responses specifically we quantified the direct net effects of climate warming on the timing and duration of hypoxia and coincident changes in surface water n and p concentrations to improve our understanding of how nutrient cycling in the two lakes may change with warming temperatures we also quantified how warming may alter lake nutrient retention and downstream export which have important implications for water quality in the larger catchment biogeochemical cycling in low nutrient lakes is generally understudied relative to high nutrient lakes despite a rapid decline in the number of low nutrient lakes across the continental u s stoddard et al 2016 this provides additional motivation to understand how trophic state mediates responses to warming thus comparing n and p dynamics in two lakes of different trophic state under a range of temperature warming scenarios advances our understanding of ecosystem scale responses to future warming beyond a single lake or single scenario study and highlights the importance of historical nutrient baselines for predicting future ecosystem conditions 2 methods 2 1 modeled lakes we modeled lake responses to climate warming based on two well studied north temperate lakes lake mendota wisconsin usa and lake sunapee new hampshire usa fig 1 these two lakes share multiple common characteristics including glacial origin climate seasonality due to similar latitude a dimictic mixing regime and inflows dominated by surface water table 1 cobourn et al 2018 in addition the lakes have similar mean depths and water residence times table 1 the lakes also differ in watershed land use which contributes to substantial differences in lake water nutrient concentrations table 1 the mendota watershed is large relative to the lake area and is dominated by agriculture 67 and urban development 22 which deliver large n and p loads to the lake and contribute to mendota s high nutrient state cobourn et al 2018 snortheim et al 2017 in contrast the sunapee catchment is relatively small compared to the lake surface area and is 80 forested with only 6 currently developed richardson et al 2017a nutrient inputs to the lake are low resulting in sunapee s low nutrient state carey et al 2014 given their contrasting nutrient concentrations these two lakes serve as approximate end members on a continuum of trophic state rather than simulating simplified imaginary model ecosystems e g identical lakes with hemispherical basins and no inflow tributaries we used lakes mendota and sunapee for this study because we needed their rich long term monitoring datasets to ensure that our parameterized models were appropriately capturing baseline conditions for a high and low nutrient lake in addition we used air temperature warming scenarios of up to 6 c based on downscaled data for these two lakes vs simulated air temperature scenarios based on global averages after the models representing mendota and sunapee were calibrated with observational data we focused on these two lake models as idealized high nutrient and low nutrient ecosystems respectively to examine potential responses to climate warming for temperate lakes of different baseline water quality 2 2 model description and driver data we used the open source one dimensional hydrodynamic general lake model glm version 2 1 8 hipsey et al 2014 2019 to model the energy and water budget of each lake the aquatic ecodynamics library aed hipsey et al 2013 was coupled with glm hereafter glm aed to model water quality dynamics including changes in concentrations of dissolved oxygen do n and p we chose glm aed because it has dynamic vertically resolved layers within a lake which allows for comparisons of stratified biogeochemical processes hipsey et al 2019 moreover the heat transfer and mixing algorithms in glm developed by hamilton and schladow 1997 have been found to successfully reproduce observed water temperatures of lakes with varying conditions e g mixing regime climate latitude morphology around the world bruce et al 2018 glm aed is particularly suited for studying how climate warming may alter ecosystem scale lake nutrient cycling because it is able to simultaneously simulate lake stratification dynamics and a suite of interacting n and p processes bruce et al 2018 hipsey et al 2019 2013 these biogeochemical processes include nitrification denitrification sediment fluxes of no3 nh4 phosphate po4 3 dissolved organic p dop dissolved organic n don particulate organic p pop and particulate organic n pon po4 3 adsorption desorption don dop pon and pop water column mineralization no3 nh4 and po4 3 phytoplankton uptake zooplankton excretion of don dop pon and pop and the settling rate of all n and p fractions hipsey et al 2013 all of these processes will directly respond to warming temperatures because the underlying model equations include arrhenius parameters governing their temperature dependence hence the need for an ecosystem modeling approach to address our study s objectives hipsey et al 2019 the glm aed combines lake morphometry with meteorological and inflow driver data to simulate a water budget and thermal profile for each lake we compiled observed hourly meteorological driver data for each lake from the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 these data included air temperature c wind speed m s 1 relative humidity shortwave and longwave radiation w m 2 and precipitation m d 1 for the full model period we used a combination of observational and statistically modeled data to develop a daily time series for the surface inflows to each lake which included tributary inflow rates m3 s 1 inflow water temperature c and inorganic and organic fractions of n and p mmol m 3 see supplement a for lake specific inflow data sources and model simulations we included eight different p and n fractions in our inflow files filterable reactive p frp adsorbed frp dop pop no3 nh4 don and pon inflow data also included two fractions of organic carbon particulate and dissolved each lake model included a single outflow discharge file at a daily time step supplement a we ran each lake model at an hourly time step over an eleven year period from 8 november 2003 to 31 december 2014 we chose this period because it represents the most complete time series of high frequency observational data for both lakes and encompasses a representative range of climatic events for each modeled lake including both flood and drought periods and particularly cool and warm years in addition the length of the model runs allows for integration of background meteorological variability that occurs over time 2 3 baseline calibration and validation we calibrated the baseline glm aed model for each lake using the 7 year period from 1 april 2004 31 december 2010 and validated model state variables using the 4 year period from 1 january 2011 31 december 2014 the model spin up period was from 8 november 2003 through 31 march 2004 meaning we did not analyze model outputs prior to 1 april 2004 during calibration we manually changed model parameters for each lake with the goal of sequentially optimizing goodness of fit gof metrics for a suite of focal state variables water balance water temperature do n p with a focus on reproducing seasonal patterns and peak timing for each state variable following kara et al 2012 lake specific calibration focused on parameters related to lake morphometry and physical mixing nutrient fluxes at the sediment water interface and settling rates of organic c n and p importantly almost all other parameter values governing water column biogeochemical processes e g all arrhenius temperature multipliers half saturation o2 concentrations governing biogeochemical fluxes and maximum aerobic mineralization rates for organic c n and p were set as identical between lakes so that the only parameters that differed between the two models were related to inherent differences in trophic state e g higher sediment po4 3 release rates in the high nutrient lake than the low nutrient lake tables a2 a5 we used a general set of parameters to represent phytoplankton and zooplankton groups in both lakes following hipsey et al 2013 because phytoplankton and zooplankton were not the focus of this analysis model outputs of water temperature do total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were compared to both low frequency manual water samples up to twice monthly and high frequency buoy data hourly from april october each year collected from the deepest point in each lake supplement a lake sunapee buoy data were collected by the lake sunapee protective association lspa richardson et al 2020 and lake mendota data were collected through the north temperate lakes long term ecological research ntl lter site magnuson et al 2010a 2010b 2010c 2010d for both lakes we compared observed maximum daily water temperature and mean daily do concentrations from both manual and buoy measurements to modeled daily noon water temperatures and do concentrations supplement a magnuson et al 2010a 2010b manual samples of tn and tp were available up to twice monthly sunapee carey et al 2014 steiner and titus 2017 mendota magnuson et al 2010a 2010d and were compared to mean daily model outputs for each lake supplement a we calculated four gof metrics to compare model outputs and observational data coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse spearman s rank correlation coefficient spearman s rho ρ and normalized mean absolute error nmae kara et al 2012 using the hydrogof package for r zambrano bigiarini 2017 separate gof calculations were made for the epilimnion 0 4 m both lakes and hypolimnion 16 20 m both lakes we focused on these layers to compare representative epilimnetic and hypolimnetic depths between the two lakes using different layer depths yielded qualitatively similar results we chose to use layers instead of discrete depths for calibration and validation to maximize available manual observational data for comparison with model output evaporation effects on the lakes water levels were negligible relative to precipitation permitting the use of the same layer depths over time and among scenarios within lakes figure a1 2 4 climate warming simulations to model changes in lake nutrient dynamics with climate warming we ran a suite of downscaled climate warming scenarios ranging from 0 to 6 c above 2003 2014 air temperatures for each lake the scenarios were developed to encompass the maximum range of potential warming above historical 1950 1980 conditions projected for the lakes in year 2099 based on macav2 metdata downscaled global climate models abatzoglou 2013 abatzoglou and brown 2012 taylor et al 2012 for lake mendota maximum air temperature warming of approximately 5 4 c is projected by 2099 under rcp8 5 relative to historical conditions while lake sunapee is projected to warm by approximately 5 7 c by 2099 we applied these potential warming air temperature scenarios to the historical 2003 2014 period and held all other meteorological driver variables constant to compare scenario output with the baseline 2004 2014 simulation output while these simplified scenarios did not include the weather variability expected with future climate change e g hayhoe et al 2008 2010 it allowed us to isolate the direct effects of different levels of potential air temperature warming on ecosystem scale lake nutrient cycling because it is computationally intensive to model a range of climate scenarios for multiple lakes we implemented a distributed computing platform grapler www graple org that enables users to run lake model simulations submitted from the r environment on cloud computing and cyber infrastructure resources subratie et al 2017a simulations are distributed across processing nodes that have been aggregated into a peer to peer overlay virtual private network subratie et al 2017b dramatically reducing computation time 2 5 data analysis model outputs of focal state variables in each climate warming scenario were compared to the baseline simulation with a focus on the period between 1 april and 31 october each year henceforth summer which includes spring mixing summer thermal stratification and fall mixing in both lakes figure a2 a3 by comparing the scenario model outputs to the baseline model output not observational data our analyses focused on the temperature responses of idealized high and low nutrient lakes based on mendota and sunapee respectively we focused primarily on the differences between the baseline 0 c and 6 c scenarios to examine the direct effects of a range of warming possibilities on nutrient cycling in the selected lakes we first calculated daily schmidt stability j m 2 for each lake across warming scenarios to test whether air temperature warming increased water column stratification using the lake analyzer tools read et al 2011 in matlab version r2018b mathworks natick ma usa we then summarized daily estimates of stability as summer medians each year in the 2004 2014 modeling period and used those values to compare the range and overall among year summer median stability across scenarios we calculated stratification duration as the number of days for which water temperatures between the surface 0 m and hypolimnion 20 m in mendota 18 m in sunapee differed by more than 1 c following woolway et al 2014 and based on historical monitoring data for both lakes which show that this threshold reasonably delineates mixed vs stratified periods these depths were chosen based on hypsographic curves and represent the hypolimnetic depth that encompasses approximately 80 of the sediment area in each lake to quantify the incidence of hypoxia we calculated the number of days each summer 1 april 31 october for which hypolimnetic do concentrations 20 m in mendota 18 m in sunapee were 2 mg l 1 we then compared the median number of hypoxic do days for each summer and its range among warming scenarios for each lake we calculated median concentrations for epilimnetic 0 m both lakes and hypolimnetic 20 m in mendota 18 m in sunapee tn µg l 1 tp µg l 1 and median molar tn tp each summer we then used anderson darling statistical tests razali and wah 2011 to make pairwise comparisons between the distributions of each response variable tn tp tn tp across the 11 year model period 2004 2014 between each incremental climate warming scenario and the baseline distribution we also compared model outputs of denitrification nh4 mineralization and po4 3 fluxes at the sediment water interface among scenarios to assess potential mechanisms for changes in tn and tp concentrations finally we estimated net fluxes of tn and tp as a percent of inputs each summer for both lakes following powers et al 2015 f net summer 100 outputs inputs inputs where outputs and inputs represent the daily mass of tn or tp leaving and entering the lake respectively during the period of 1 april to 31 october each year daily stream inflow concentrations of tn and tp constituents were summed to calculate daily inflow tn and tp then multiplied by daily inflow volume to yield the daily mass of tn and tp inputs daily median epilimnetic tn and tp concentrations were multiplied by outflow volume to calculate the mass of tn and tp outputs as both lake s outflows are composed of surface water daily inputs and outputs were summed across the 1 april to 31 october period each year to estimate fnet summer with fnet summer 0 signifying that the lake was a net source downstream export of tn or tp and fnet summer 0 indicating that the lake was a net sink retention and or removal of n or p all analyses except for the matlab lake analyzer calculations were conducted in r version 3 5 2 r core team 2019 3 results 3 1 model calibration for both lakes calibrated models of glm aed reasonably simulated observed dynamics in focal physical and chemical state variables in the baseline 2004 2014 simulation table 2 figs 3 and 4 modeled water temperatures were generally within an rmse of 2 c for both lakes with better fits for both manual and buoy data in the epilimnion than the hypolimnion figs 3a 4a dissolved oxygen rmse was 2 5 mg l 1 for all depths and data sources in each lake figs 3b 4b while there were fewer observations of n and p than temperature and do particularly in lake sunapee model fits generally reproduced the seasonality and range of concentrations in both lakes table 2 figs 3c d 4c d although the calibrated sunapee model had higher bias for tp than mendota table 2 fig 4d we deemed the calibration acceptable because it minimized differences in parameterization of biogeochemical processes between the two lakes to enable comparison of temperature scenarios moreover all subsequent analyses were focused on comparison of the scenario model outputs to the baseline model output not observational data 3 2 strength of stratification and duration of hypoxia increase with climate warming climate warming scenarios led to warming of the water column in both lakes fig 5 between the baseline 0 c and 6 c air temperature scenarios among year median summer surface water temperatures increased in both lakes with a 19 1 3 8 c increase from the baseline in the high nutrient lake individual year median change ranging from 3 1 c to 4 1 c and a 19 2 3 6 c increase in the low nutrient lake individual year change 3 3 c to 4 0 c the hypolimnion of each lake experienced less warming than the epilimnion overall between the baseline and 6 c scenarios but was more variable among years with a 5 4 0 7 c increase from the baseline in the high nutrient lake individual year change 1 4 c to 4 0 c and a 12 5 1 3 c increase in the low nutrient lake individual year change 0 2 c to 3 3 c warmer surface water temperatures amplified thermal stratification in both lakes fig 5 among year median schmidt stability between 1 april and 31 october increased 50 in the high nutrient lake individual year change 5 to 95 and 57 in the low nutrient lake individual year change 34 to 105 between the baseline and 6 c scenarios fig 6a in addition the year to year variability in schmidt stability increased with warming with the range of summer medians increasing 2 1 in the high nutrient lake and 1 1 in the low nutrient lake between the baseline and 6 c scenarios fig 6a along with intensifying stratification the duration of stratification increased among scenarios though the amount of change differed between lakes and was highly variable year to year in the high nutrient lake among year median stratification duration increased eight days from 193 to 201 days between the baseline and 6 c scenarios year to year range 35 to 50 days with the average spring onset of stratification occurring seven days sooner and fall turnover occurring one day later in the 6 c scenario than in the baseline in contrast among years the low nutrient lake experienced spring onset three days sooner and turnover four days later resulting in a median change in stratification duration of seven days from 205 to 212 year to year range 24 to 42 days warming induced changes in stability and stratification likely contributed to the observed increase in the extent and duration of low do concentrations in the hypolimnion of both lakes fig 7 6b between the baseline 0 c and 6 c scenarios hypoxic do concentrations in the hypolimnion occurred earlier in the year and lasted longer resulting in more summer days with do concentrations 2 mg l 1 fig 6b in the high nutrient lake there were up to 1 1 as many summer hypoxic days under the 6 c scenario as the baseline maximum 131 vs 119 days per year respectively in the low nutrient lake effects on do were much larger and warming led to the development of prolonged hypolimnetic hypoxia for the first time with up to 39 hypoxic days per summer under 6 c warming compared to a maximum of one hypoxic day per summer in the baseline simulation fig 6b in addition more intense warming resulted in greater hypoxia in the low nutrient lake with 6 c warming summer hypoxia occurred in five of 11 simulation years versus in only one of 11 simulation years for scenarios with up to 2 c warming as with stability the year to year variability of hypoxia duration in the low nutrient lake also increased with warming with the range of medians increasing from one to 39 days between the baseline and 6 c scenarios fig 6b in contrast the range of medians was 41 days in the high nutrient lake for both the baseline and 6 c scenarios fig 6b 3 3 epilimnetic tn and tp concentrations and stoichiometric ratios change with warming climate warming had ecosystem scale effects on nutrient cycling that resulted in altered epilimnetic tn and tp concentrations though the magnitude of responses was lake specific and the direction of change differed between tn and tp in both lakes surface tn decreased between the baseline 0 c and 6 c scenarios in the high nutrient lake the among year median summer epilimnetic tn was 19 2 lower in the 6 c scenario than in the baseline scenario fig 8a with a statistically significant change in the distribution of median summer epilimnetic tn compared to the baseline simulation with warming of at least 5 c table 3 fig 8a the low nutrient lake also exhibited decreased epilimnetic tn with climate warming among year median tn was 30 4 lower in the 6 c scenario than in the baseline scenario importantly in the low nutrient lake there was a statistically significant shift in the distribution of median summer tn relative to the baseline when warming was at least 2 c table 3 fig 8a decreased tn concentrations were likely driven by increased rates of denitrification with warming among year median water column denitrification rates increased 45 0 and 37 6 in the high and low nutrient lakes respectively between the baseline and 6 c scenarios warming also increased n processing rates at the sediment water interface in both lakes nh4 fluxes from the sediments into the water column increased 42 7 and 35 1 in the high and low nutrient lakes respectively among years between the baseline and 6 c scenarios among year median denitrification rates at the sediment water interface also increased up 29 9 in the high nutrient lake and 26 6 in the low nutrient lake between the baseline and 6 c scenarios in contrast to tn both lakes exhibited increased epilimnetic tp concentrations in the 6 c scenario compared to the baseline scenario though the magnitude of change differed between lakes in the high nutrient lake among year median summer epilimnetic tp was 23 1 higher in the 6 c scenario than in the baseline scenario fig 8b with a significant shift in the distribution of summer surface tp with warming of 6 c table 3 in the low nutrient lake among year epilimnetic tp increased 8 9 between the baseline and 6 c scenario fig 8b with significant shifts in the distribution of median summer tp with at least 2 c of warming these changes were attributed to increased p fluxes from the sediments with warming temperatures median sediment fluxes increased 33 5 and 33 6 in the high and low nutrient lakes respectively between the baseline and 6 c scenarios lake specific differences in tn and tp in response to warming led to differences in the epilimnetic n p stoichiometry in both lakes but the low nutrient lake was more sensitive to low levels of warming in the high nutrient lake among year median epilimnetic molar tn tp was 30 3 lower between the baseline and 6 c warming scenarios fig 8c and the distributions of summer median tn tp were significantly lower than the baseline with at least 4 c of warming table 3 in the low nutrient lake the proportional shift in epilimnetic tn tp distribution was similar to that of the high nutrient lake with an among year median reduction of 34 6 between the baseline and 6 c scenarios however the distribution of tn tp in the low nutrient lake was shifted significantly lower than the baseline with as little as 1 c of warming table 3 fig 8c 3 4 warming differentially changes net export of n and p warming generally decreased tn export but increased tp export downstream for both lakes during the summer 1 april 31 october fig 9 in the high nutrient lake among year median summer tn export downstream decreased 2 2 between the baseline and 6 c scenarios individual year change 5 9 to 0 4 while in the low nutrient lake tn export decreased 16 1 between the same scenarios individual year change 24 6 to 3 5 resulting in greater net n retention and or removal in both lakes during the summer in both lakes variability in tn export decreased with warming the year to year range of summer export decreased 22 2 in the high nutrient lake and 28 5 in the low nutrient lake between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios both lakes remained net sinks of n summer fluxes 0 among years and across scenarios both lakes exhibited lower net retention and greater downstream export of tp during the summer with greater changes observed in the high nutrient lake than the low nutrient lake under warming scenarios among year median tp export downstream in the high nutrient lake increased 29 6 between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios individual year change 4 2 to 170 net tp export in the high nutrient lake exhibited high year to year variability in the baseline scenario 71 0 to 16 7 and the year to year range increased 57 8 between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios with at least one year estimated as a net source of p summer export 0 with warming of at least 2 c fig 9 in the low nutrient lake tp export downstream increased but much less than in the high nutrient lake 16 2 between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios individual year change 1 6 to 40 2 baseline year to year variability in tp export was also lower in the low nutrient lake than in the high nutrient lake 38 9 to 18 2 and variability decreased slightly 8 7 between the 0 c and 6 c scenarios unlike the high nutrient lake the low nutrient lake consistently acted as a net sink of p summer export 0 across all warming scenarios and years 4 discussion 4 1 ecosystem scale effects of climate warming our study provides new evidence that ecosystem scale nutrient cycling in both high and low nutrient lakes is sensitive to air temperature warming though sensitivity likely varies by lake trophic state specifically low nutrient lakes may experience significant changes in nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry at lower levels of warming than high nutrient lakes we observed lower tn and higher tp concentrations in both lakes as they warmed but the low nutrient lake exhibited significant changes in epilimnetic nutrients and tn tp ratios at 1 2 c of warming vs 5 6 c of warming in the high nutrient lake consequently as the number of low nutrient lakes is rapidly declining across the continental u s stoddard et al 2016 due to increased n and p loading from ongoing land use change and an increased incidence of extreme events delivering terrestrial nutrients and sediments e g kelly et al 2019 prein et al 2017 our study demonstrates that climate warming may intensify lake eutrophication our modeling study corroborates empirical data from field surveys mesocosm experiments and paleolimnological records that illustrate how climate warming can transform lake ecosystem functioning reviewed by havens and jeppesen 2018 jeppesen et al 2014 moss 2012 other modeling studies that have used process based one dimensional lake simulation models have shown how climate warming alters lake thermal profiles and mixing regimes bueche et al 2017 bueche and vetter 2015 fenocchi et al 2018 woolway and merchant 2019 hypolimnetic anoxia fang et al 2012 ito and momii 2015 snortheim et al 2017 stefan et al 1993 and nutrient cycling arheimer et al 2005 komatsu et al 2007 malmaeus et al 2006 our study builds upon these earlier modeling analyses to add new evidence that lake nutrient concentrations through linked biogeochemical processes may change differentially across a range of potential air temperature warming scenarios depending on lake trophic state 4 2 potential drivers of lake nutrient changes the complexity and non linearity of ecosystem processes makes it challenging to predict how changing external drivers due to altered climate e g warming air temperature may affect ecosystem functioning burkett et al 2005 parrott and meyer 2012 shaver et al 2000 necessitating our modeling approach in lakes n and p concentrations in surface waters are jointly controlled by external loading from the catchment climate forcing and internal nutrient cycling nürnberg 1984 stumm and morgan 1996 wetzel 2001 creating complex patterns in observational data that challenge our ability to link cause and effect in empirical studies reviewed by carpenter 1988 following the precedent of previous modeling studies e g komatsu et al 2007 snortheim et al 2017 we held external nutrient loads constant while manipulating air temperature driver data thereby simplifying the inherent complexity of lake nutrient cycling to isolate the effects of climate warming on epilimnetic nutrients our findings highlight the strong coupling between lake thermal structure and nutrient cycling and how that coupling may vary between lakes of different trophic state warmer air temperatures lead to stronger thermal stratification which further isolates hypolimnetic waters from the atmosphere reducing the availability of oxygen for biogeochemical processing snortheim et al 2017 while previous research has implied the importance of this mechanism for nutrient cycling e g pettersson et al 2003 sahoo et al 2013 our results show that not only will warmer air temperatures promote hypolimnetic hypoxia but will also reduce surface water tn while increasing tp due to the complexity of lake ecosystem simulations these changes in nutrient concentrations cannot be attributed to a single process but rather emerge from interactions of multiple processes in the model we use the lake model as a calibrated experimental tool linking drivers and physical ecological processes that likely lead to the changing nutrient concentrations we observed in the model results we show that the links between thermal structure hypoxia and temperature mediated biogeochemical cycling all are important to n and p concentrations in a warming climate but their importance depends on lake characteristics our data support previous findings that in the absence of changes to hydrology and external nutrient loading warming alone can substantially alter lake thermal structure magee and wu 2017a palmer et al 2014 richardson et al 2017b woolway and merchant 2019 and in turn oxythermal habitat fang et al 2012 magee et al 2019 and nutrient processing komatsu et al 2007 radbourne et al 2019 in our scenarios the hypolimnion warmed less than the epilimnion but lake warming was more variable among years as air temperatures increased this is consistent with previous research on lakes across the northeastern united states that found approximately half of lakes experience deepwater warming as air temperatures increase while others experience deepwater cooling richardson et al 2017b similarly our models indicated that schmidt stability and duration of stratification increased with warming as was found in previous climate warming simulations based on lake archetypes in which model lakes were conceptualized to encompass regionally representative ranges of lake depth surface area and water clarity butcher et al 2015 the observed decreases in tn concentrations associated with warming are likely related to greater hypoxia and subsequent n removal from the lakes by denitrification previous empirical surveys of water chemistry across latitudinal gradients showed greater n limitation in warmer tropical lakes that are thermally stratified most of the year with increased denitrification potential driven by reduced oxygen availability in warmer hypolimnia lewis jr 1996 and references therein lewis jr 2002 talling and lemoalle 1998 our modeling results show that lakes can exhibit a similar change in n cycling in a warming climate in the warmest scenario there were over 10 more days per year with hypoxia in the low nutrient lake than under baseline conditions and 1 1 as many days with hypoxia in the high nutrient lake increasing no3 removal from the water column by 38 in the low nutrient lake and 45 in the high nutrient lake relative to baseline rates this increased rate of n removal exceeded higher rates of nh4 mineralization up 43 and 35 in the high and low nutrient lakes respectively from the sediments due to warmer waters resulting in net tn decreases increased tp concentrations in both lakes in our study likely relate to increases in hypolimnetic hypoxia do 2 mg l 1 while hypolimnetic anoxia do 0 mg l 1 is an established mechanism for stimulating the release of p bound in sediments into the water column nürnberg 1984 wetzel 2001 it is less well understood how changes in hypoxia may affect surface water nutrient concentrations previous empirical studies have shown that hypoxia can increase p fluxes from the sediments and subsequent downstream export gerling et al 2016 even in low nutrient lakes north et al 2014 our modeling results suggest a similar behavior in lakes experiencing warming lakes in our study had increased incidence of hypoxia which created low do conditions in the hypolimnion that increased p fluxes from the sediments into the water column at 6 c warming fluxes of p from the sediments were 34 higher than baseline rates in both lakes interestingly although our analysis focused on the differences between the baseline 0 c scenario and 6 c potential warming scenario the physical and chemical responses of both lakes appeared to be mostly linear for intermediate warming scenarios figs 5 8 and 9 as noted above we cannot precisely quantify the relative importance of thermal stratification decreases in hypolimnetic oxygen or temperature mediated nutrient cycling rates on surface tn and tp as these processes are strongly interconnected and occur simultaneously within the model more empirical data from years with contrasting air temperature and hypolimnetic oxygen conditions could be used to disentangle these drivers additionally future work implementing a two or three dimensional coupled hydrodynamic ecosystem model could be used to identify hotspots of n and p biogeochemical cycling within each lake ecosystem sensu bocaniov et al 2016 cavalcanti et al 2016 thereby informing the relative importance of oxygen thermal stratification and water temperature 4 3 differences in warming response between a high nutrient and a low nutrient lake our models of lake mendota and lake sunapee enable comparisons of idealized high and low nutrient lakes as a first step toward understanding how the net direct effects of warming on tn and tp cycles in lakes may differ across trophic states across our warming scenarios we found that the magnitude of relative changes in tn tp ratios tended to be similar between the two lakes though reductions in tn were substantially higher in the low nutrient lake than the high nutrient lake while tp increases were proportionally larger in the high nutrient lake than the low nutrient lake the most notable difference between lakes was the temperature increase at which nutrient concentrations and ratios exhibited statistically significant changes in the high nutrient lake tn tp and tn tp were significantly different from baseline conditions at 5 c 6 c and 4 c respectively in contrast the low nutrient lake experienced significant changes in tn tp and tn tp at 2 c 2 c and 1 c respectively this consistently lower threshold for responses suggests that ecosystem scale processes in the low nutrient lake may be fundamentally more sensitive to warming air temperatures which aligns with predictions that high nutrient lakes may have more muted responses to climate warming collins et al 2019 these results highlight the value of using decadal scale ecosystem models coupled with long term data to understand potential implications of climate warming on lake ecosystems our 11 year model period allowed for the detection of overall trends in tn and tp cycling in both lakes despite substantial year to year variability in nutrient concentrations and fluxes driven in part by background variability in meteorological and inflow driver data the use of whole ecosystem simulation models to detect relatively small changes in nutrient concentrations can provide important insights into how lake nutrient cycling at the ecosystem scale may change over decadal scales while our focus here was on the glm aed ecosystem model we note that other approaches including mesocosm experiments field surveys and statistical models reviewed by jeppesen et al 2014 also provide valuable context for understanding ecosystem responses to warming indeed a combination of modeling and empirical approaches will likely provide the strongest insights about potential future changes in lake responses to warming 4 4 lake warming in the context of climate change climate change is expected to elicit non linear interconnected changes in lake ecosystem functions while our lake models simulate many interconnected ecosystem scale biogeochemical processes that will change in response to the direct effects of increasing air temperature our relatively simplistic uniform year round air temperature scenarios do not account for potential effects of variability in air temperature warming hayhoe et al 2010 2008 which will affect the onset and intensity of seasonal stratification and in turn nutrient cycling in addition our current approach does not include potential indirect effects of warming and other aspects of climate change that are likely to affect nutrient cycling in lake mendota and lake sunapee for example climate warming is expected to change the timing and intensity of precipitation e g mearns et al 2013 and increase upstream nutrient leaching in temperate lake catchments jeppesen et al 2010 2009 which would affect inflow water volumes and nutrient concentrations for our model lakes such changes could be further compounded by human driven land use change in lake watersheds resulting in dramatically altered nutrient loading to lakes cobourn et al 2018 fraterrigo and downing 2008 in addition warming temperatures will alter the phytoplankton community reviewed by carey et al 2012 such that the current model parameterization of phytoplankton functional groups is unlikely to be representative of future communities further it is likely that warming will also alter lake carbon dynamics in addition to nitrogen and phosphorus cycling bartosiewicz et al 2019 using a coupled catchment lake model and harnessing the power of the grapler distributed computing framework subratie et al 2017a in future work to generate millions of additional scenarios that explore the interactive effects and potential emergent properties of multiple global change variables would greatly improve our understanding of the nuanced ways that climate change will likely affect lakes in addition it is possible that different model parameterizations would result in different nutrient responses however the similarity of relative changes in water temperature thermal stratification denitrification sediment p fluxes and summer tn export between the two lakes calibrated to represent varying trophic states suggests that lake results are robust finally while our analysis focused on the stratified period of lake mendota and lake sunapee 1 april to 31 october as north temperate dimictic lakes both lakes currently experience ice covered periods for multiple months each winter bruesewitz et al 2015 magee et al 2016 across the full year warming may exacerbate changes in nutrient processing and retention in our focal lakes as increased air temperatures reduce ice cover duration and ice thickness e g magee and wu 2017b despite these limitations our study provides evidence that ecosystem scale nutrient concentrations can change sometimes substantially due to increases in air temperature alone thus decreases in inflow nutrients could help alleviate the expected effects of climate warming credit authorship contribution statement kaitlin j farrell conceptualization methodology data curation validation formal analysis

24836,aquaculture is an industry with the capacity for further growth that can contribute to sustainable food systems to feed an increasing global population sugar kelp saccharina latissima is of particular interest for farmers as a fast growing species that benefits ecosystems as a primary producer however as a new industry in the u s farmers interested in growing s latissima lack data on growth dynamics to address this gap we calibrated a dynamic energy budget deb model to data from the literature and field based growth experiments in rhode island u s a environmental variables forcing model dynamics include temperature irradiance dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and nitrate and nitrite concentration the modeled estimates for field s latissima blade length were accurate despite underestimation of early season growth in some simulations winter growth was limited by the rate at which the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis the first step of carbon assimilation was performed nitrogen n reserves were also an important limiting factor especially later in the spring season as irradiance increased although the low resolution of n forcing concentrations might restrict the model accuracy since this model is focused on s latissima grown in an aquaculture setting with winter and spring growth no specific assumptions were made to include summer growth patterns such as tissue loss or reproduction the results indicate that this mechanistic model for s latissima captures growth dynamics and blade length at the time of harvest thus it could be used for spatial predictions of s latissima aquaculture production across a range of environmental conditions and locations the model could be a particularly useful tool for further development of sustainable ocean food production systems involving seaweed keywords macroalgae food production bioenergetics synthesizing units rhode island 1 introduction aquaculture is currently the fastest growing food production sector in the world and is likely to become the main seafood supply in the future fao 2018 in open systems of fed species aquaculture activities can cause concentrated fluxes of feces and feed wastage leading to eutrophication wu 1995 and alteration of food webs herbeck et al 2013 open aquaculture systems composed of species that do not require supplemental feed or nutrients i e primary producers and filter feeders avoid these harms and instead can provide important ecosystem services such as removing dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients alleway et al 2019 seaweeds are of particular interest as they mitigate hypoxia from terrestrial food production systems and even protect shorelines through dampening of wave energy duarte et al 2017 outside of these ecosystem services growing seaweed has been proposed as a way to engage a wider public audience with climate change via offsetting carbon emissions froehlich et al 2019 seaweed aquaculture has the potential to generate net positive environmental and social impacts but this industry has been traditionally concentrated in asian countries fao 2018 the u s does not produce enough aquatic plants to even register in the global production statistics 0 1 fao 2018 in the northeast u s sugar kelp saccharina latissima is a local species of recent interest for food biofuel bioremediation and pharmaceutical products forbord et al 2012 in a single season of aquaculture growth s latissima blades can grow up to 60 140 cm depending on the water depth planting time and nutrient availability handå et al 2013 oysters however are the most widely aquacultured species in coastal areas of the u s nmfs 2018 the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica mostly grows during the summer months when water temperatures are above 15 c and is in a state of relative dormancy in the winter dame 1972 it has been suggested that cultivation of s latissima could complement oyster farming because of the differences in growing season with kelp growing mainly when water temperatures are below 15 c therefore kelp could provide an additional source of income without interfering with oyster production this new industry however would benefit from production estimates in order to assess the biological and economic sustainability of s latissima farming bioenergetic models can provide such production estimates by studying energy fluxes and usage between the environment and the organism and within the organism they constitute useful tools in the early development of an aquaculture activity to assess the carrying capacity of a system before installing new farms grant et al 2007 filgueira et al 2014 estimate production and feeding ration cho and bureau 1998 or to optimize integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta systems ren et al 2012 forcing variables in bioenergetic modelling frameworks are of prime importance as they define the system response in the case of s latissima blade growth is mainly influenced by irradiance temperature and nutrient concentration boden 1979 other factors such as wave action buck and buchholz 2005 and ambient light regime gerard 1988 may also determine growth dynamics in a simple predictive model petrell et al 1993 estimated growth of s latissima using a linear relationship with dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration and a temperature correction this model required an assumption that nitrogen dynamics are always limiting growth thus ignoring the potential influence of irradiance while integrating photosynthetic processes into a model can be challenging mechanistic approaches may be more suited to capture the physiological response to environmental variability especially in a changing environment denny and helmuth 2009 dynamic energy budget deb theory provides a sound mechanistic basis for understanding an organism s energetics which is used to model the flow of mass and energy through an organism from uptake to usage for maintenance growth reproduction or excretion kooijman 2010 this theory of metabolic organization provides a framework to examine the interactive effects of environmental nutrient concentrations and irradiance on an organism through parallel systems of nitrogen n and carbon c dynamics modeling autotrophs is a less common direction for the application of deb theory thus multiple reserves are necessary to accurately model matter and energy dynamics because of the different nutrient uptake pathways kooijman 2010 autotroph deb models have been constructed for microalgae lorena et al 2010 livanou et al 2019 phytoplankton zooplankton interactions poggiale et al 2010 calcification of a coccolithophore muller and nisbet 2014 and recently the macroalga ulva lactuca lavaud et al 2020 broch and slagstad 2012 were the first to develop a dynamic bioenergetic model for s latissima borrowing concepts from deb theory with the aim of creating a tool for optimizing aquaculture production of norwegian s latissima these authors based their model structure on a droop s cell quota model completed by numerous empirical and allometric relationships to simulate growth of s latissima but this simplification did not increase parsimony i e reduce the number of model parameters using a deb framework however ensures theoretical coherence i e mechanistic description of metabolic processes and ease of model transference to other regions through less re calibration our objective with this study is to develop a bioenergetic model for s latissima growth using the mechanistic properties of deb theory specifically we aim to calibrate the macroalga deb model presented by lavaud et al 2020 to field data on kelp from rhode island u s a the application of this model to another species from a different environment constitutes an important step in the validation of this model structure the resulting model allows for growth predictions based on environmental inputs and has the potential to support the sustainable aquaculture industry particularly with regard to site selection 2 methods 2 1 dynamic energy budget model assumptions the s latissima model is based on a deb model developed for sea lettuce by lavaud et al 2020 the core structure of the s latissima model tracks the uptake of carbon c and nitrogen n their assimilation into specific reserves and allocation to growth or maintenance or their excretion fig 1 the variables that depict the state of the model are the mass of structure mv in mol v moles of structure nitrogen reserve density m e n in mol n per mol v and carbon reserve density m e c in mol c per mol v the code for this model is freely available at https github com cvenolia sugarkelpdeb a core assumption of deb theory strong homeostasis maintains that reserve and structure have constant chemical compositions kooijman 2010 this does not mean that there are always constant amounts of reserve and structure rather the amount of carbon nitrogen hydrogen and oxygen relative to each other within specific reserves or structures remains constant two substrates and associated reserves were considered in this s latissima model c and n nitrate and nitrite collectively other potential nutrients such as phosphorous or potassium were dismissed based on the fact that in regions where nitrogen is not abundant year round nitrogen availability is what drives accelerated growth in winter and early spring gagné et al 1982 adding further reserves to the model would increase complexity by increasing the number of state variables and parameters with potentially little to no increase in accuracy on the c side of the model since s latissima and other algae use carbonic anhydrase to assimilate bicarbonate and convert it into carbon dioxide axelsson et al 2000 we assumed that assimilating carbon dioxide directly was identical to assimilating carbon dioxide that was formed extracellularly from bicarbonate through a carbon concentrating mechanism another assumption of this deb model is that s latissima is a v1 morph in deb theory v1 morphs are organisms whose surface area is proportional to volume kooijman 2010 s latissima grows as a sheet in both length and width directions at the meristematic blade region near the stipe sjøtun 1993 variation in blade thickness over an individual blade and through time does not have a substantial impact on the surface area to volume ratio vettori and nikora 2017 to preclude the v1 morph assumption drag from water speed has been found to impact blade morphology buck and buchholz 2005 but this difference in appearance should not affect the surface area to volume ratio either other assumptions were grounded in the fact that this model was used to determine aquaculture production which is currently limited in time to november may energy was not used for reproduction or maturity in this model a simplification that allows for a more parsimonious model there is evidence suggesting that kelp produces inhibitors that minimize the formation of reproductive tissue during the rapid growth phase buchholz and lüning 1999 lüning et al 2000 moreover only a small subset of blades show reproductive development by the time the aquaculture harvest occurs in spring towards the end of the first period of rapid growth furthermore the aquaculture season of s latissima is set up to maximize growth while minimizing loss or degradation of tissues due to various stresses apical frond loss in kelp is correlated with temperature stress and wave action krumhansl et al 2014 mechanical stress of biofouling brown et al 1997 and overall blade length sjøtun 1993 a tissue loss function would be necessary to accurately model s latissima growth year round however the exact mechanism for this loss remains context specific in the literature aquaculture farmers generally harvest kelp before biofouling begins which maximizes harvestable blade length and product quality photoinhibition may occur in s latissima when high light conditions are combined with high temperature conditions heinrich et al 2012 but since we limit the application of our model to winter spring seasons photoinhibition was not accounted for photorespiration was not included either to simplify model dynamics kooijman 2010 2 2 model structure all the equations for this model are based on and detailed in lavaud et al 2020 table 1 s latissima blade length lw was calculated via total dry weight wd using an allometric relationship proposed by gevaert et al 2001 table 1 the change in the three state variables reserve density of c and n and mass of structure over time is described by differential equations that where solved using the desolve package soetaert et al 2010 in r r core team 2019 2 3 model calibration the parameters of the s latissima deb model were manually calibrated to fit simultaneously a combination of literature data and field data collected for this study table 2 root mean square error rmse was used as a measure of spread in the residuals for assessing the quality of model predictions compared to each observation data set 2 3 1 literature data information about the locations where literature studies were conducted was also included because there are multiple ecotypes of s latissima gerard 1988 which may influence their physiological response table 3 due to a lack of local information on certain aspects of s latissima life history traits this model was calibrated with data across multiple ecotypes of s latissima the arrhenius relationship parameters were estimated using a least squared non linear regression on compiled physiological rates from the literature prior to the estimation each data set was standardized by dividing by the averaged value found at the reference temperature table

data from espinoza and chapman 1983 to match the dimensions used by these authors µmol n 1 gdw 1 h 1 the volume specific modeled n uptake was multiplied by mv wd structural mass divided by dry weight photosynthesis parameters ρpsu photosynthetic unit psu density αi specific photon arrival cross section b i binding probability of a photon to a free light synthesizing unit and k i dissociation rate of photosynthetic products were calibrated using oxygen production data from johansson and snoeijs 2002 appropriate literature data for calibrating several model parameters were not available for instance air based carbon dioxide uptake data for s latissima ní longphuirt et al 2013 were examined to estimate dissolved inorganic carbon uptake but ultimately were rejected due to likely dissimilarity to submerged uptake carbon uptake parameters maintenance rates the yield factor of c reserve and the rejection flux were estimated during model testing so as to result in predicted length within the observed range in length data table 2 other parameters such as the reserve turnover rates are difficult to compare to measurable physiological data so these parameters were set based on previously assumed values by lorena et al 2010 and lavaud et al 2020 2 3 2 field data s latissima was grown at four oyster farm sites from fall to spring in both 2017 2018 year 1 and 2018 2019 year 2 s latissima seed was raised in aquaria from harvested local reproductive s latissima tissue collected at ft wetherill ri following the methods of redmond et al 2014 and seed lines were attached to ropes held in place by moorings at each of the farms the growing sites were split between narragansett bay and pt judith pond ri fig 2 longlines of s latissima were placed in duplicates at a depth of 1 m at all the growing sites s latissima growth measured as length and width cm was monitored every 20 85 days using a subset of individuals harvested from the longline the variability in monitoring timing was largely driven by the availability of farmers to assist with logistics as well as weather conditions temperature data were collected every fifteen minutes at each site using hobo pendant loggers water samples were collected when s latissima growth measurements were taken to determine the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite in year 1 nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured using a lachat flow injection autoanalyzer lachat 2008 method detection limit 0 3 µm in year 2 nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined using an astoria pacific model 303a segmented continuous flow autoanalyzer astoria pacific inc clackamas or eaton et al 1998 method detection limit 1 43 µm because narragansett bay s data were below the method detection limit for the analysis

we used linear interpolation to create an hourly forcing from source data every three hours fig 3 all sites had the same base irradiance forcing in one year using this method dic concentration data

the three state variables to model parameters using an l1 summary value of sensitivity from the r package fme soetaert and petzoldt 2010 the larger the l1 metric a parameter has the greater the sensitivity of the state variables to that parameter 3 results 3 1 model calibration literature data the arrhenius relationship fit to the compiled literature data table 3 reflected maximum physiological rates at temperatures around 13 c fig 4 the lower boundary of the temperature tolerance range in the arrhenius relationship was 0 c and the upper boundary was 13 39 c the rather low value for the upper boundary indicates that the optimum temperature is close to the upper limit of the tolerance range for this species however the shape of the curve past this point implies that the effects of high temperatures on the metabolism of sugar kelp appear gradually with increasing temperature the adjusted r squared for this relationship was 0 55 p value 2 74 10 11 using the nitrate

the maximum temperature was 15 28 c in may and the minimum temperature was 1 c in january temperature changes were consistent across all four sites for both years the nitrate and nitrite concentration forcing variable had a lower resolution than the temperature forcing because of the linear interpolation between the n measurements fig 6 the mean n concentration at the pt judith pond sites was 4 42

sites studied of 0 87 0 63 cm d 1 in year 1 and 1 18 0 62 cm d 1 in year 2 fig 7 end of season blade length varied but no clear trend based on sites was observed table 4 the s latissima deb model generally underestimated growth observed in the early parts of the season planting to end of march but accurately predicted the length at harvest within one standard deviation of the observed mean length for the majority of sites fig 7 an exception to this trend was the first s latissima line planted at pt judith pond south in year 1 for which final length was overestimated the rmses for the model length prediction to the field length data ranged widely from 4 74 to 53 72 cm fig 7 examining the reject fluxes from the growth su indicate that the c reserve carbohydrates limited model growth after planting for greatly variable time spans across the sites seasons and lines fig 8 a growth limitation by c reserve may result from low c assimilation due to a low specific relaxation rate temperature seemed to be the main factor controlling c assimilation as indicated by the greater similarity of the shape of the temperature correction to that of c assimilation than the shape of the seasonal trend of irradiance fig 9 n limitation seemed to have a strong role in controlling modeled s latissima growth dynamics overall due to the proportion of time c was rejected from the growth su

v k e c ken j c o 2 m and k i fig 10 4 discussion aquaculture development represents a key role in expanding u s sustainable food production and macroalgae can provide high returns when the proper growth conditions exist understanding and predicting the growth dynamics of s latissima can provide the aquaculture industry with a powerful predictive tool for estimating production potential this model is the first attempt to apply dynamic energy budget deb theory to a macroalga of the order laminariales the process based model presented in this study allowed us to better understand growth limitations as they relate to the behavior of the model 4 1 growth limitation in several model simulations predictions of early s latissima growth seemed to indicate a limitation in carbon c assimilation due to a low modeled specific relaxation rate j i by photosynthetic su2 processing the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis there is some evidence that a lack of c reserve occurs in the field during winter due to lower irradiance s latissima individuals older than a year were shown to have a decrease in blade c content mid winter suggesting consumption of stored carbohydrates sjøtun 1993 new sporophytes would not have this carbohydrate pool to draw upon and would exclusively depend on photosynthesis to acquire c the decrease in c content observed by sjøtun 1993 suggests that c dynamics may be limiting s latissima growth but substrate limitation was not directly examined by this author in simulations where irradiance was the initial limiting factor for growth the early season model underestimation of field growth may reflect an outsized impact of the temperature correction of k i on the specific relaxation rate j i in comparison to irradiance as with many deb parameters k i is difficult to estimate directly based on empirical data and our assumption of dependence on temperature as in other algae kooijman 2010 lavaud et al 2020 may not be as relevant to s latissima as ocean temperature seasonal trends trail behind irradiance changes brady campbell et al 1984 s latissima s early season growth could be driven by this early season increase in irradiance rather than water temperature change more data are necessary to confirm why the s latissima deb model underestimates winter growth other than an increase in irradiance day length could also impact seasonal growth patterns broch and slagstad s 2012 s latissima model used the rate of change of day length in a photoperiodic effect function to mimic growth seasonality these authors relied on the hypothesis that s latissima is a seasonal anticipator with endogenous circadian rhythms kain 1989 seasonal anticipators are posited to grow strategically in response to a trigger other kelps such as laminaria hyperborea and laminaria digitata have been shown to have free running seasonal growth patterns which suggests control by endogenous circadian rhythms schaffelke and lüning 1994 species specific evidence for this circadian hypothesis is lacking including the mechanism for what would trigger s latissima s photoperiodic response if this is the case substrate uptake or reserve mobilization parameters may be adjusted in the model in response to a trigger to temporarily favor early winter growth another possible reason for underestimation of early season c dynamics may be a lack of energy gain at night s latissima s carbon dioxide exchange rate is not closely correlated with irradiance because carbon dioxide uptake by the alga continues into the dark mortensen 2017 on average 11 of s latissima s carbon fixation happens in the dark kremer and markham 1979 the linkage between the light dependent and light independent reactions is modeled in our study as an immediate transference in other words when there is no irradiance input the assimilation of carbohydrates to the c reserve is zero however adding this layer of physiological accuracy could reduce model efficiency without increasing predictive capacity in some instances n was the limiting factor to growth as shown by more rejected c by the growth su for example in pt judith pond sites in dec and jan of year 1 resulting in lower predicted length as compared to field observations the low resolution of n forcing could limit our interpretation of the results but our n data show general agreement with long term monitoring at the university of rhode island graduate school of oceanography reed and oviatt 2020 the seasonal dynamics of n in narragansett bay matches that of many sites around new england with higher concentrations of n in the october march and reduced summer n concentrations townsend 1991 reed and oviatt 2020 nitrogen has been well documented as a major force limiting primary production across the ocean duce et al 2008 n limitation of s latissima growth may be a reasonable expectation later in the year as inorganic n availability is thought to facilitate late winter and early spring s latissima growth ahn et al 1998 to increase the ability to accurately understand growth limitation with this deb model localized n uptake data in response to changing n concentrations would be useful ecotypic differences in n nutrition have been observed both in nova scotia canada espinoza and chapman 1983 and when comparing long island sound new york kelps with kelps from maine gerard 1997 in this study espinoza and chapman s 1983 n uptake data from st margaret s bay was chosen for calibration over their bay of fundy data because the april november seasonal depletion of nitrate was more similar to narragansett bay conditions than the year round nitrate replete conditions of the bay of fundy kelp individuals from st margaret s bay also had greater nitrate accumulation ability espinoza and chapman 1983 the seasonal dissolved inorganic nitrogen patterns were comparable for the long island sound and maine kelps that gerard 1997 analyzed but the long island sound plants geographically closer to our kelp from narragansett bay accumulated larger n reserves which allowed for a ramping up of photosynthetic component production such ability to store nitrogen over winter months has been documented nielsen et al 2014 and may explain the observed pattern of c reserve limitation in our model year long simulations would most likely provide different conclusions when n availability in the environment decreases reed and oviatt 2020 the chemical composition of available n for assimilation may have an effect on n limitation nitrate was the primary n source used in this model primarily due to lack of complete ammonium data to include in the forcing including ammonium however may allow for more accurate predictions of growth dynamics as ammonium has been hypothesized to be a more efficient n source for macroalgae especially in low light conditions because it may be assimilated passively through diffusion harrison and hurd 2001 one argument for leaving out ammonium is to simplify dynamics as a different substrate composition would require another reserve pool although pools of different n forms may be combined and uptake rates for different n sources averaged another reason is that s latissima has been shown to have a higher maximum uptake of nitrate compared to ammonium ammonium saturation was observed at concentrations of 10 μm whereas nitrate saturation was not observed until 30 μm ahn et al 1998 the greater variation in nitrate uptake could cause nitrate to have a more important role in shaping s latissima growth dynamics the caveat to using these rates to understand dynamics broadly is that kelp individuals used in this study came from ammonium rich and nitrate poor habitat ahn et al 1998 which may have some effect on the reported uptake rates 4 2 sensitivity analysis the high sensitivity of the state variables to the temperature related parameters is a logical outcome of the central role of temperature in deb theory since the temperature correction is applied to such a large number of rates in the organism the high sensitivity to these values is reasonable it is also an argument for caution in regional calibration of the arrhenius relationship the sensitivity of the s latissima model to the fraction of rejection flux incorporated back in i reserve κ e i contrasts with the lack of sensitivity of lorena et al 2010 s microalgae model to the same parameter different metabolic pathways storage capacities and efficiencies might be responsible for these differences between a phytoplankton species and a macroalgae more experimental work focusing on the dynamics of internal and external n concentration in controlled settings should help confirm the calibration of this parameter the sensitivity of the model to the yield factor of c reserve on photons and on co2 yic and y c o 2 c respectively reflects the generality of photosynthesis reactions a change in these parameters would involve important modifications of the physiological processes involved in photosynthesis since these processes are well known and established it reinforces our confidence in the model the high sensitivity of the model to the yield factor of c reserve to structure y e c v in comparison to the small but nonzero impact of the yield factor of n reserve to structure y e n v might be reflective of the greater amount of c reserve required by the chemical composition of the structure this greater proportion of c may also be the reason the majority of the impactful parameters are related to c dynamics the state variables had a small sensitivity to reserve turnover parameters which calibration may be challenging due to the difficulty to relate these abstract parameters to observed data it is therefore encouraging that the sensitivity to these values was low this analysis should increase our overall confidence in the values of the calibrated parameters and the reliability of the model as the most sensitive parameters are those in which we can have highest assurance 4 3 model application limitations to broader geographic use of this parameter set center around the plasticity of s latissima and the existence of ecotypes in this species the differentiation of ecotypes occurs when individuals have an acclimation range related to their habitat of origin gerard 1988 for instance s latissima individuals from new york have been shown to have a different physiological response to temperature in a lab setting than individuals from maine gerard 1988 in the context of this study narragansett bay ri u s a is located towards the southern boundary of s latissima distribution range taylor 1972 kelps from this location likely have different physiological rates than in northern neighboring states the existence of multiple ecotypes of this species suggests that some parameters such as the temperature parameters or maximum assimilation rates of substrates require regional adjustment particularly in the arctic additionally the model assumption regarding the proportionality of surface area to volume impedes prediction of blade shape plasticity which is a characteristic of s latissima related to drag buck and buchholz 2005 since the blade thickness and amount of blade ruffling could impact the relationship between surface area and volume some adjustments to the model may be warranted in regions where blade plasticity results in thicker thalli as the surface area to volume relationship would be impacted determining a mechanism for how blade type changes in response to hydrodynamic conditions would provide a clearer picture of overall growth dynamics further research on the mechanisms for frond loss blade plasticity and regional parameter information have the potential to improve this deb model a better understanding of the physiological cause for apical frond loss would allow this process to be included in mechanistic models in a more meaningful way than modeling erosion as a response to one correlated variable such as length or age aging mechanisms within deb theory kooijman 2010 based on the production of harmful compounds may also be of interest to model frond loss finally underwater carbon dioxide uptake data and more regionally appropriate oxygen production data in response to variable irradiance would be useful to better calibrate parameters linked to s latissima photosynthesis our model establishes a baseline for s latissima deb parameters and further testing of the model equations from lavaud et al 2020 this tool facilitates analyzing local growth limitations as they relate to modeled responses to changing environmental conditions our s latissima deb model is a first step towards estimating kelp aquaculture production in the u s a in future work this s latissima deb model could be coupled with a deb model for c virginica lavaud et al 2017 and the regional ocean modeling system roms with a carbon silicate nitrogen ecosystem

24836,aquaculture is an industry with the capacity for further growth that can contribute to sustainable food systems to feed an increasing global population sugar kelp saccharina latissima is of particular interest for farmers as a fast growing species that benefits ecosystems as a primary producer however as a new industry in the u s farmers interested in growing s latissima lack data on growth dynamics to address this gap we calibrated a dynamic energy budget deb model to data from the literature and field based growth experiments in rhode island u s a environmental variables forcing model dynamics include temperature irradiance dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and nitrate and nitrite concentration the modeled estimates for field s latissima blade length were accurate despite underestimation of early season growth in some simulations winter growth was limited by the rate at which the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis the first step of carbon assimilation was performed nitrogen n reserves were also an important limiting factor especially later in the spring season as irradiance increased although the low resolution of n forcing concentrations might restrict the model accuracy since this model is focused on s latissima grown in an aquaculture setting with winter and spring growth no specific assumptions were made to include summer growth patterns such as tissue loss or reproduction the results indicate that this mechanistic model for s latissima captures growth dynamics and blade length at the time of harvest thus it could be used for spatial predictions of s latissima aquaculture production across a range of environmental conditions and locations the model could be a particularly useful tool for further development of sustainable ocean food production systems involving seaweed keywords macroalgae food production bioenergetics synthesizing units rhode island 1 introduction aquaculture is currently the fastest growing food production sector in the world and is likely to become the main seafood supply in the future fao 2018 in open systems of fed species aquaculture activities can cause concentrated fluxes of feces and feed wastage leading to eutrophication wu 1995 and alteration of food webs herbeck et al 2013 open aquaculture systems composed of species that do not require supplemental feed or nutrients i e primary producers and filter feeders avoid these harms and instead can provide important ecosystem services such as removing dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients alleway et al 2019 seaweeds are of particular interest as they mitigate hypoxia from terrestrial food production systems and even protect shorelines through dampening of wave energy duarte et al 2017 outside of these ecosystem services growing seaweed has been proposed as a way to engage a wider public audience with climate change via offsetting carbon emissions froehlich et al 2019 seaweed aquaculture has the potential to generate net positive environmental and social impacts but this industry has been traditionally concentrated in asian countries fao 2018 the u s does not produce enough aquatic plants to even register in the global production statistics 0 1 fao 2018 in the northeast u s sugar kelp saccharina latissima is a local species of recent interest for food biofuel bioremediation and pharmaceutical products forbord et al 2012 in a single season of aquaculture growth s latissima blades can grow up to 60 140 cm depending on the water depth planting time and nutrient availability handå et al 2013 oysters however are the most widely aquacultured species in coastal areas of the u s nmfs 2018 the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica mostly grows during the summer months when water temperatures are above 15 c and is in a state of relative dormancy in the winter dame 1972 it has been suggested that cultivation of s latissima could complement oyster farming because of the differences in growing season with kelp growing mainly when water temperatures are below 15 c therefore kelp could provide an additional source of income without interfering with oyster production this new industry however would benefit from production estimates in order to assess the biological and economic sustainability of s latissima farming bioenergetic models can provide such production estimates by studying energy fluxes and usage between the environment and the organism and within the organism they constitute useful tools in the early development of an aquaculture activity to assess the carrying capacity of a system before installing new farms grant et al 2007 filgueira et al 2014 estimate production and feeding ration cho and bureau 1998 or to optimize integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta systems ren et al 2012 forcing variables in bioenergetic modelling frameworks are of prime importance as they define the system response in the case of s latissima blade growth is mainly influenced by irradiance temperature and nutrient concentration boden 1979 other factors such as wave action buck and buchholz 2005 and ambient light regime gerard 1988 may also determine growth dynamics in a simple predictive model petrell et al 1993 estimated growth of s latissima using a linear relationship with dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration and a temperature correction this model required an assumption that nitrogen dynamics are always limiting growth thus ignoring the potential influence of irradiance while integrating photosynthetic processes into a model can be challenging mechanistic approaches may be more suited to capture the physiological response to environmental variability especially in a changing environment denny and helmuth 2009 dynamic energy budget deb theory provides a sound mechanistic basis for understanding an organism s energetics which is used to model the flow of mass and energy through an organism from uptake to usage for maintenance growth reproduction or excretion kooijman 2010 this theory of metabolic organization provides a framework to examine the interactive effects of environmental nutrient concentrations and irradiance on an organism through parallel systems of nitrogen n and carbon c dynamics modeling autotrophs is a less common direction for the application of deb theory thus multiple reserves are necessary to accurately model matter and energy dynamics because of the different nutrient uptake pathways kooijman 2010 autotroph deb models have been constructed for microalgae lorena et al 2010 livanou et al 2019 phytoplankton zooplankton interactions poggiale et al 2010 calcification of a coccolithophore muller and nisbet 2014 and recently the macroalga ulva lactuca lavaud et al 2020 broch and slagstad 2012 were the first to develop a dynamic bioenergetic model for s latissima borrowing concepts from deb theory with the aim of creating a tool for optimizing aquaculture production of norwegian s latissima these authors based their model structure on a droop s cell quota model completed by numerous empirical and allometric relationships to simulate growth of s latissima but this simplification did not increase parsimony i e reduce the number of model parameters using a deb framework however ensures theoretical coherence i e mechanistic description of metabolic processes and ease of model transference to other regions through less re calibration our objective with this study is to develop a bioenergetic model for s latissima growth using the mechanistic properties of deb theory specifically we aim to calibrate the macroalga deb model presented by lavaud et al 2020 to field data on kelp from rhode island u s a the application of this model to another species from a different environment constitutes an important step in the validation of this model structure the resulting model allows for growth predictions based on environmental inputs and has the potential to support the sustainable aquaculture industry particularly with regard to site selection 2 methods 2 1 dynamic energy budget model assumptions the s latissima model is based on a deb model developed for sea lettuce by lavaud et al 2020 the core structure of the s latissima model tracks the uptake of carbon c and nitrogen n their assimilation into specific reserves and allocation to growth or maintenance or their excretion fig 1 the variables that depict the state of the model are the mass of structure mv in mol v moles of structure nitrogen reserve density m e n in mol n per mol v and carbon reserve density m e c in mol c per mol v the code for this model is freely available at https github com cvenolia sugarkelpdeb a core assumption of deb theory strong homeostasis maintains that reserve and structure have constant chemical compositions kooijman 2010 this does not mean that there are always constant amounts of reserve and structure rather the amount of carbon nitrogen hydrogen and oxygen relative to each other within specific reserves or structures remains constant two substrates and associated reserves were considered in this s latissima model c and n nitrate and nitrite collectively other potential nutrients such as phosphorous or potassium were dismissed based on the fact that in regions where nitrogen is not abundant year round nitrogen availability is what drives accelerated growth in winter and early spring gagné et al 1982 adding further reserves to the model would increase complexity by increasing the number of state variables and parameters with potentially little to no increase in accuracy on the c side of the model since s latissima and other algae use carbonic anhydrase to assimilate bicarbonate and convert it into carbon dioxide axelsson et al 2000 we assumed that assimilating carbon dioxide directly was identical to assimilating carbon dioxide that was formed extracellularly from bicarbonate through a carbon concentrating mechanism another assumption of this deb model is that s latissima is a v1 morph in deb theory v1 morphs are organisms whose surface area is proportional to volume kooijman 2010 s latissima grows as a sheet in both length and width directions at the meristematic blade region near the stipe sjøtun 1993 variation in blade thickness over an individual blade and through time does not have a substantial impact on the surface area to volume ratio vettori and nikora 2017 to preclude the v1 morph assumption drag from water speed has been found to impact blade morphology buck and buchholz 2005 but this difference in appearance should not affect the surface area to volume ratio either other assumptions were grounded in the fact that this model was used to determine aquaculture production which is currently limited in time to november may energy was not used for reproduction or maturity in this model a simplification that allows for a more parsimonious model there is evidence suggesting that kelp produces inhibitors that minimize the formation of reproductive tissue during the rapid growth phase buchholz and lüning 1999 lüning et al 2000 moreover only a small subset of blades show reproductive development by the time the aquaculture harvest occurs in spring towards the end of the first period of rapid growth furthermore the aquaculture season of s latissima is set up to maximize growth while minimizing loss or degradation of tissues due to various stresses apical frond loss in kelp is correlated with temperature stress and wave action krumhansl et al 2014 mechanical stress of biofouling brown et al 1997 and overall blade length sjøtun 1993 a tissue loss function would be necessary to accurately model s latissima growth year round however the exact mechanism for this loss remains context specific in the literature aquaculture farmers generally harvest kelp before biofouling begins which maximizes harvestable blade length and product quality photoinhibition may occur in s latissima when high light conditions are combined with high temperature conditions heinrich et al 2012 but since we limit the application of our model to winter spring seasons photoinhibition was not accounted for photorespiration was not included either to simplify model dynamics kooijman 2010 2 2 model structure all the equations for this model are based on and detailed in lavaud et al 2020 table 1 s latissima blade length lw was calculated via total dry weight wd using an allometric relationship proposed by gevaert et al 2001 table 1 the change in the three state variables reserve density of c and n and mass of structure over time is described by differential equations that where solved using the desolve package soetaert et al 2010 in r r core team 2019 2 3 model calibration the parameters of the s latissima deb model were manually calibrated to fit simultaneously a combination of literature data and field data collected for this study table 2 root mean square error rmse was used as a measure of spread in the residuals for assessing the quality of model predictions compared to each observation data set 2 3 1 literature data information about the locations where literature studies were conducted was also included because there are multiple ecotypes of s latissima gerard 1988 which may influence their physiological response table 3 due to a lack of local information on certain aspects of s latissima life history traits this model was calibrated with data across multiple ecotypes of s latissima the arrhenius relationship parameters were estimated using a least squared non linear regression on compiled physiological rates from the literature prior to the estimation each data set was standardized by dividing by the averaged value found at the reference temperature table

data from espinoza and chapman 1983 to match the dimensions used by these authors µmol n 1 gdw 1 h 1 the volume specific modeled n uptake was multiplied by mv wd structural mass divided by dry weight photosynthesis parameters ρpsu photosynthetic unit psu density αi specific photon arrival cross section b i binding probability of a photon to a free light synthesizing unit and k i dissociation rate of photosynthetic products were calibrated using oxygen production data from johansson and snoeijs 2002 appropriate literature data for calibrating several model parameters were not available for instance air based carbon dioxide uptake data for s latissima ní longphuirt et al 2013 were examined to estimate dissolved inorganic carbon uptake but ultimately were rejected due to likely dissimilarity to submerged uptake carbon uptake parameters maintenance rates the yield factor of c reserve and the rejection flux were estimated during model testing so as to result in predicted length within the observed range in length data table 2 other parameters such as the reserve turnover rates are difficult to compare to measurable physiological data so these parameters were set based on previously assumed values by lorena et al 2010 and lavaud et al 2020 2 3 2 field data s latissima was grown at four oyster farm sites from fall to spring in both 2017 2018 year 1 and 2018 2019 year 2 s latissima seed was raised in aquaria from harvested local reproductive s latissima tissue collected at ft wetherill ri following the methods of redmond et al 2014 and seed lines were attached to ropes held in place by moorings at each of the farms the growing sites were split between narragansett bay and pt judith pond ri fig 2 longlines of s latissima were placed in duplicates at a depth of 1 m at all the growing sites s latissima growth measured as length and width cm was monitored every 20 85 days using a subset of individuals harvested from the longline the variability in monitoring timing was largely driven by the availability of farmers to assist with logistics as well as weather conditions temperature data were collected every fifteen minutes at each site using hobo pendant loggers water samples were collected when s latissima growth measurements were taken to determine the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite in year 1 nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured using a lachat flow injection autoanalyzer lachat 2008 method detection limit 0 3 µm in year 2 nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined using an astoria pacific model 303a segmented continuous flow autoanalyzer astoria pacific inc clackamas or eaton et al 1998 method detection limit 1 43 µm because narragansett bay s data were below the method detection limit for the analysis

we used linear interpolation to create an hourly forcing from source data every three hours fig 3 all sites had the same base irradiance forcing in one year using this method dic concentration data were not collected in this study so this forcing was estimated from other sources the pt judith pond sites were held at a constant dic value of 1 836 10 3 mol dic l 1 based on u s environmental protection agency data from ninigret pond j grear unpublished data the narragansett bay sites were held at a constant dic value of 1 956 10 3 mol dic l 1 based on data from brenton point segarra 2002 nitrate and nitrite concentrations were also linearly interpolated on an hourly basis state variable initial conditions were estimated based on approximate length and weight at planting of the kelp blades mv 0 00164 gdw reserve densities had to be assumed but their impact on end results is limited to the first few days of the simulation initial m e c was set at 0 002 mol c mol v 1 and m e n at 0

the three state variables to model parameters using an l1 summary value of sensitivity from the r package fme soetaert and petzoldt 2010 the larger the l1 metric a parameter has the greater the sensitivity of the state variables to that parameter 3 results 3 1 model calibration literature data the arrhenius relationship fit to the compiled literature data table 3 reflected maximum physiological rates at temperatures around 13 c fig 4 the lower boundary of the temperature tolerance range in the arrhenius relationship was 0 c and the upper boundary was 13 39 c the rather low value for the upper boundary indicates that the optimum temperature is close to the upper limit of the tolerance range for this species however the shape of the curve past this point implies that the effects of high temperatures on the metabolism of sugar kelp appear gradually with increasing temperature the adjusted r squared for this relationship was 0 55 p value 2 74 10 11 using the nitrate uptake data from espinoza and chapman s 1983 st margaret s bay site nova scotia canada provided estimates of maximum volume specific nitrate and nitrite assimilation of 1 5 10 4 mol n mol v 1 h 1 and a half saturation concentration of 2 5 10 6 mol no3 and no2 l 1 fig 5 the fit for the data collected at 18 c was slightly better with a rmse of 0 374 µmol n gdw 1 h 1 than the 9 c data at 0 504 µmol n

the maximum temperature was 15 28 c in may and the minimum temperature was 1 c in january temperature changes were consistent across all four sites for both years the nitrate and nitrite concentration forcing variable had a lower resolution than the temperature forcing because of the linear interpolation between the n measurements fig 6 the mean n concentration at the pt judith pond sites was 4 42 10 6 mol no3 and no2 l 1 2 76 10 6 and 2 20 10 6 mol no3 and no2 l 1 2 99 10 6 at the narragansett bay sites in year 1 for year 2 the mean n concentration at the pt judith pond sites was 1 01 10 6 mol

sites studied of 0 87 0 63 cm d 1 in year 1 and 1 18 0 62 cm d 1 in year 2 fig 7 end of season blade length varied but no clear trend based on sites was observed table 4 the s latissima deb model generally underestimated growth observed in the early parts of the season planting to end of march but accurately predicted the length at harvest within one standard deviation of the observed mean length for the majority of sites fig 7 an exception to this trend was the first s latissima line planted at pt judith pond south in year 1 for which final length was overestimated the rmses for the model length prediction to the field length data ranged widely from 4 74 to 53 72 cm fig 7 examining the reject fluxes from the growth su indicate that the c reserve carbohydrates limited model growth after planting for greatly variable time spans across the sites seasons and lines fig 8 a growth limitation by c reserve may result from low c assimilation due to a low specific relaxation rate temperature seemed to be the main factor controlling c assimilation as indicated by the greater similarity of the shape of the temperature correction to that of c assimilation than the shape of the seasonal trend of irradiance fig 9 n limitation seemed to have a strong role in controlling modeled s latissima growth dynamics overall due to the proportion of time c was rejected from the growth su

v k e c ken j c o 2 m and k i fig 10 4 discussion aquaculture development represents a key role in expanding u s sustainable food production and macroalgae can provide high returns when the proper growth conditions exist understanding and predicting the growth dynamics of s latissima can provide the aquaculture industry with a powerful predictive tool for estimating production potential this model is the first attempt to apply dynamic energy budget deb theory to a macroalga of the order laminariales the process based model presented in this study allowed us to better understand growth limitations as they relate to the behavior of the model 4 1 growth limitation in several model simulations predictions of early s latissima growth seemed to indicate a limitation in carbon c assimilation due to a low modeled specific relaxation rate j i by photosynthetic su2 processing the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis there is some evidence that a lack of c reserve occurs in the field during winter due to lower irradiance s latissima individuals older than a year were shown to have a decrease in blade c content mid winter suggesting consumption of stored carbohydrates sjøtun 1993 new sporophytes would not have this carbohydrate pool to draw upon and would exclusively depend on photosynthesis to acquire c the decrease in c content observed by sjøtun 1993 suggests that c dynamics may be limiting s latissima growth but substrate limitation was not directly examined by this author in simulations where irradiance was the initial limiting factor for growth the early season model underestimation of field growth may reflect an outsized impact of the temperature correction of k i on the specific relaxation rate j i in comparison to irradiance as with many deb parameters k i is difficult to estimate directly based on empirical data and our assumption of dependence on temperature as in other algae kooijman 2010 lavaud et al 2020 may not be as relevant to s latissima as ocean temperature seasonal trends trail behind irradiance changes brady campbell et al 1984 s latissima s early season growth could be driven by this early season increase in irradiance rather than water temperature change more data are necessary to confirm why the s latissima deb model underestimates winter growth other than an increase in irradiance day length could also impact seasonal growth patterns broch and slagstad s 2012 s latissima model used the rate of change of day length in a photoperiodic effect function to mimic growth seasonality these authors relied on the hypothesis that s latissima is a seasonal anticipator with endogenous circadian rhythms kain 1989 seasonal anticipators are posited to grow strategically in response to a trigger other kelps such as laminaria hyperborea and laminaria digitata have been shown to have free running seasonal growth patterns which suggests control by endogenous circadian rhythms schaffelke and lüning 1994 species specific evidence for this circadian hypothesis is lacking including the mechanism for what would trigger s latissima s photoperiodic response if this is the case substrate uptake or reserve mobilization parameters may be adjusted in the model in response to a trigger to temporarily favor early winter growth another possible reason for underestimation of early season c dynamics may be a lack of energy gain at night s latissima s carbon dioxide exchange rate is not closely correlated with irradiance because carbon dioxide uptake by the alga continues into the dark mortensen 2017 on average 11 of s latissima s carbon fixation happens in the dark kremer and markham 1979 the linkage between the light dependent and light independent reactions is modeled in our study as an immediate transference in other words when there is no irradiance input the assimilation of carbohydrates to the c reserve is zero however adding this layer of physiological accuracy could reduce model efficiency without increasing predictive capacity in some instances n was the limiting factor to growth as shown by more rejected c by the growth su for example in pt judith pond sites in dec and jan of year 1 resulting in lower predicted length as compared to field observations the low resolution of n forcing could limit our interpretation of the results but our n data show general agreement with long term monitoring at the university of rhode island graduate school of oceanography reed and oviatt 2020 the seasonal dynamics of n in narragansett bay matches that of many sites around new england with higher concentrations of n in the october march and reduced summer n concentrations townsend 1991 reed and oviatt 2020 nitrogen has been well documented as a major force limiting primary production across the ocean duce et al 2008 n limitation of s latissima growth may be a reasonable expectation later in the year as inorganic n availability is thought to facilitate late winter and early spring s latissima growth ahn et al 1998 to increase the ability to accurately understand growth limitation with this deb model localized n uptake data in response to changing n concentrations would be useful ecotypic differences in n nutrition have been observed both in nova scotia canada espinoza and chapman 1983 and when comparing long island sound new york kelps with kelps from maine gerard 1997 in this study espinoza and chapman s 1983 n uptake data from st margaret s bay was chosen for calibration over their bay of fundy data because the april november seasonal depletion of nitrate was more similar to narragansett bay conditions than the year round nitrate replete conditions of the bay of fundy kelp individuals from st margaret s bay also had greater nitrate accumulation ability espinoza and chapman 1983 the seasonal dissolved inorganic nitrogen patterns were comparable for the long island sound and maine kelps that gerard 1997 analyzed but the long island sound plants geographically closer to our kelp from narragansett bay accumulated larger n reserves which allowed for a ramping up of photosynthetic component production such ability to store nitrogen over winter months has been documented nielsen et al 2014 and may explain the observed pattern of c reserve limitation in our model year long simulations would most likely provide different conclusions when n availability in the environment decreases reed and oviatt 2020 the chemical composition of available n for assimilation may have an effect on n limitation nitrate was the primary n source used in this model primarily due to lack of complete ammonium data to include in the forcing including ammonium however may allow for more accurate predictions of growth dynamics as ammonium has been hypothesized to be a more efficient n source for macroalgae especially in low light conditions because it may be assimilated passively through diffusion harrison and hurd 2001 one argument for leaving out ammonium is to simplify dynamics as a different substrate composition would require another reserve pool although pools of different n forms may be combined and uptake rates for different n sources averaged another reason is that s latissima has been shown to have a higher maximum uptake of nitrate compared to ammonium ammonium saturation was observed at concentrations of 10 μm whereas nitrate saturation was not observed until 30 μm ahn et al 1998 the greater variation in nitrate uptake could cause nitrate to have a more important role in shaping s latissima growth dynamics the caveat to using these rates to understand dynamics broadly is that kelp individuals used in this study came from ammonium rich and nitrate poor habitat ahn et al 1998 which may have some effect on the reported uptake rates 4 2 sensitivity analysis the high sensitivity of the state variables to the temperature related parameters is a logical outcome of the central role of temperature in deb theory since the temperature correction is applied to such a large number of rates in the organism the high sensitivity to these values is reasonable it is also an argument for caution in regional calibration of the arrhenius relationship the sensitivity of the s latissima model to the fraction of rejection flux incorporated back in i reserve κ e i contrasts with the lack of sensitivity of lorena et al 2010 s microalgae model to the same parameter different metabolic pathways storage capacities and efficiencies might be responsible for these differences between a phytoplankton species and a macroalgae more experimental work focusing on the dynamics of internal and external n concentration in controlled settings should help confirm the calibration of this parameter the sensitivity of the model to the yield factor of c reserve on photons and on co2 yic and y c o 2 c respectively reflects the generality of photosynthesis reactions a change in these parameters would involve important modifications of the physiological processes involved in photosynthesis since these processes are well known and established it reinforces our confidence in the model the high sensitivity of the model to the yield factor of c reserve to structure y e c v in comparison to the small but nonzero impact of the yield factor of n reserve to structure y e n v might be reflective of the greater amount of c reserve required by the chemical composition of the structure this greater proportion of c may also be the reason the majority of the impactful parameters are related to c dynamics the state variables had a small sensitivity to reserve turnover parameters which calibration may be challenging due to the difficulty to relate these abstract parameters to observed data it is therefore encouraging that the sensitivity to these values was low this analysis should increase our overall confidence in the values of the calibrated parameters and the reliability of the model as the most sensitive parameters are those in which we can have highest assurance 4 3 model application limitations to broader geographic use of this parameter set center around the plasticity of s latissima and the existence of ecotypes in this species the differentiation of ecotypes occurs when individuals have an acclimation range related to their habitat of origin gerard 1988 for instance s latissima individuals from new york have been shown to have a different physiological response to temperature in a lab setting than individuals from maine gerard 1988 in the context of this study narragansett bay ri u s a is located towards the southern boundary of s latissima distribution range taylor 1972 kelps from this location likely have different physiological rates than in northern neighboring states the existence of multiple ecotypes of this species suggests that some parameters such as the temperature parameters or maximum assimilation rates of substrates require regional adjustment particularly in the arctic additionally the model assumption regarding the proportionality of surface area to volume impedes prediction of blade shape plasticity which is a characteristic of s latissima related to drag buck and buchholz 2005 since the blade thickness and amount of blade ruffling could impact the relationship between surface area and volume some adjustments to the model may be warranted in regions where blade plasticity results in thicker thalli as the surface area to volume relationship would be impacted determining a mechanism for how blade type changes in response to hydrodynamic conditions would provide a clearer picture of overall growth dynamics further research on the mechanisms for frond loss blade plasticity and regional parameter information have the potential to improve this deb model a better understanding of the physiological cause for apical frond loss would allow this process to be included in mechanistic models in a more meaningful way than modeling erosion as a response to one correlated variable such as length or age aging mechanisms within deb theory kooijman 2010 based on the production of harmful compounds may also be of interest to model frond loss finally underwater carbon dioxide uptake data and more regionally appropriate oxygen production data in response to variable irradiance would be useful to better calibrate parameters linked to s latissima photosynthesis our model establishes a baseline for s latissima deb parameters and further testing of the model equations from lavaud et al 2020 this tool facilitates analyzing local growth limitations as they relate to modeled responses to changing environmental conditions our s latissima deb model is a first step towards estimating kelp aquaculture production in the u s a in future work this s latissima deb model could be coupled with a deb model for c virginica lavaud et al 2017 and the regional ocean modeling system roms with a carbon silicate nitrogen ecosystem

24837,the objective recognition and scientific evaluation of ecosystem values are essential for sustainable decision making and nature conservation however the ecosystem services value which is the most popular concept measures ecosystem value mainly through an estimation of the willingness to pay of individuals and thus can cause a bias in estimating ecosystem value the ecosystem intrinsic value eiv which has been recognized by the millennium ecosystem assessment and the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity is an objective value of ecosystems in this study the eiv is defined as the objective value of the ecosystem in and for itself irrespective of needs wants and benefits of humans specifically eiv is an integration of matter energy and information of an ecosystem which can be measured by calculating the work capacity furthermore an eiv approach based on exergy eco exergy and development capacity analysis was developed for eiv evaluation and then applied in three marine ecosystems i e northern beibu gulf bohai sea and yangtze estuarine and its adjacent waters in china a comparison among three case studies in different years showed that the eiv density is ranked in the following sequence yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters 2000 northern beibu gulf 2006 yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters 2006 bohai sea 1982 bohai sea 1992 the results of eiv density reflect the intrinsic properties of the ecosystems and is determined only by the ecosystem itself the results have demonstrated to some extent that temperature and nutrients are playing important roles in controlling ecosystem productivity further affecting the work capacity and determining eiv of the ecosystem the approach and methods established in this study provide a stricter and more objective pathway for evaluating ecosystem value compared to our previous study which is expected to improve current decision making processes towards sustainability keywords ecosystem intrinsic value definition evaluation exergy eco exergy development capacity 1 introduction 1 1 scientific background ample evidence demonstrates that human well being is deeply connected with nature although there is much variation in dependency across different regions ipbes 2018a rich biodiversity and ecosystem resources are recognized as vital support for the living species in the world however direct and indirect drivers especially from human activities acting synergistically are accelerating the loss of biodiversity ipbes 2018a ecosystem valuation as an approach that can contribute to sustainable decision making and nature conservation is particularly useful in settings where institutional arrangements such as markets and common property regimes are not functioning well to reflect the social costs of environmental degradation howarth and farber 2002 unfortunately under the guidance of sustainable development whose first essence is the needs of the present and future generations wu et al 2019 many still care more about human s living standards in reality shrimpton et al 2017 ecosystem services are benefits people obtain from ecosystems o connor and kenter 2019 ma 2003 which evaluate ecosystem value according to the anthropocentric perspectives sheng et al 2019 various ecosystem service valuation techniques such as contingent valuation hedonic pricing and travel cost sheng et al 2019 are based either directly or indirectly on attempts to estimate the willingness to pay wtp of individuals for ecosystem services costanza et al 1997 the invest model was also used to integrate ecosystem services into policy and decision making processes nelson et al 2009 goldstein et al 2012 ouyang et al 2016 obviously ecosystem service value esv only reflects human preferences and needs disregarding other species and future generations vassallo et al 2017 most categories of esv are not objective but one sided evaluation of ecosystem value except the ecosystem service of supporting biodiversity an even worse case is that those individuals may be ill informed and their preferences may not be adequately incorporated into ecological sustainability there is no doubt that the existing approach for esv can cause an underestimate of the total value because it ignores the complex interdependencies between services and does not incorporate the ecosystems infrastructure value costanza et al 1997 in our previous studies esv was used to support decision making towards sustainability for example previous studies on marine environmental capacity chen et al 1999 strategic environmental assessment sea of harbor planning zhang et al 2001 sea for marine reclamation planning wang et al 2010 and coastal principal function zoning wu et al 2014 found that most losses of esv were 1 2 80 of the benefits of human development activities with an average of about 10 zhang et al 2015 these results are mostly caused by underestimation of ecosystem value by using the socio economic based methods and thus it would be hard to stop the uneconomical development activities zhang et al 2015 sheng et al 2019 no matter whether in theory or application the limitations of esv mentioned above are difficult to correct within the existing ecosystem service theory framework in fact observing the continual threat of environmental problems and exhaustion of resources in the last few decades people are gradually rethinking the philosophy of development green development as a non anthropocentric concept has broadly emerged since the environmental movement in the 1970s kline 2011 which focuses on nature itself by conserving biodiversity and natural health to maintain natural intrinsic value towards sustainability wu et al 2019 in the reports by the millennium ecosystem assessment ma ma 2003 and the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity teeb teeb 2010 intrinsic value is stated as the value of something in and for itself which is independent of its utility for someone else under these circumstances intrinsic value is a critical notion that holds promise for resolving the dilemma to achieve the full value of ecosystems in past a specific and in depth research on ecosystem intrinsic value eiv was conducted from 2011 to 2015 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 sheng et al 2019 by initially defining eiv and providing a workable approach to quantify it jointly using emergy analysis and eco exergy analysis however some categories of matter energy and information as energy contained in ecological network have not yet been adequately included while some categories such as biotic component are double counted using the exiting approach by modifying the connotation of eiv based on previous studies sheng et al 2019 we propose a more scientific evaluation approach for eiv in an attempt to better fully recognize the ecosystem value three case studies are used to examine the feasibility and science of the approach the results are expected to obtain the objective value of ecosystem 1 2 theory and calculation of ecosystem intrinsic value eiv 1 2 1 goal of ecosystem s development and its relationship with human beings an ecosystem is a thermodynamic system receiving collecting transforming and dissipating solar energy fath 2013 while giving rise to continuous evolution in its internal structures and functions lin 2015 several goal functions were put forward to describe the direction of ecosystem development fath et al 2001 ludovisi et al 2005 including maximum power output maximum biomass optimizing ascendency increasing total energy dissipation yielding the most stored exergy following the law of entropy production and maximizing emergy flux and storage odum 1988 any of the goal functions mentioned above can shed light on the development strategy of an ecosystem which is only related to the intrinsic properties of the ecosystem as a self organizing system far from equilibrium no matter how its initial conditions are the ecosystem always unconsciously trends toward its climax community which is a state with the largest biomass the most abundant trophic level and the minimum total entropy by the constraints of its environmental conditions hao et al 2008 more directly the ecosystem is a purpose system with the basic purpose of survival and reproduction zu 1990 the ecosphere and all life are interdependent while both humans and non humans are dependent on the ecosystem processes that nature provides washington 2013 in a fundamental sense ecosystems are the planet s life support systems for the human species and all other forms of life ma 2005 while continuously receiving a variety of benefits including provisioning regulating cultural and supporting services to sustain its own development humans are actually an integral part of ecosystems depending on ecosystem properties and network of interactions among organisms and within and among ecosystems for sustenance just like all other species ma 2003 washington 2013 although the notion of eiv or ecological value is still much debated between anthropocentric ethic and non anthropocentric ethic the value of natural ecosystems and their components should be recognized in terms of their contribution to maintaining life on earth farber et al 2002 teeb 2010 what is more is that the ecosystem works for human species and all other forms of life which has enabled us to see that esv i e the benefits for human being from ecosystem comes from the total work capacity of the whole ecosystem in other words the esv is part of eiv by acknowledging eiv and protecting them for their own sake selck et al 2017 human health and well being will be gradually improved towards sustainability rea and munns 2017 wu et al 2019 1 2 2 definition and connotation of eiv 1 concept of eiv a value is the importance of something for itself or for others the importance can be considered in three broad classes 1 the importance that something has subjectively 2 the importance that something has in meeting objective needs and 3 the intrinsic value of something ipbes 2018b different types of values are acknowledged and should be promoted in decision making pascual et al 2017 while a value can be a measure ipbes 2018b the recognition of intrinsic natural value which is recognized as a vital aspect of conservation of the biosphere piccolo 2017 has been emphasized in many global or regional reports such as the reports by ma ma 2003 and teeb teeb 2010 as well as the intergovernmental platform on biodiversity and ecosystem service ipbes ipbes 2018b for its nonnegligible role in supporting decision making an ecosystem is a dynamic complex of plant animal and microorganism communities and the nonliving environment interacting as a functional unit ma 2003 in ecological networks through matter cycle energy flow and information transfer in an ecosystem matter is the carrier while energy and information are the driving forces for succession and evolution in the ecological network the resilience and vitality of adaptation development evolution self organization and response to external disturbances are generated jørgensen and lu 2013 an ecosystem is valuable as an objective entity but there is considerable disagreement about how to assess and express these values for centuries intrinsic value was considered as an ethics category being defined as a thing that has in itself or for its own sake or as such or in its own right teeb 2010 wu et al 2019 sheng et al 2019 in recent years intrinsic value has been further defined as the value independent of any human experience and evaluation such a value is viewed as an inherent property of the entity e g an organism and not ascribed or generated by external valuing agents such as human beings pascual et al 2017 ipbes 2018b in addition the eiv was also defined as the value of its contents including the composition structure and ecological processes of the ecosystem xu et al 2014 or the objective value of ecosystems in and for itself irrespective of needs wants and benefits of humans zhang et al 2015 however it is not enough to put forward a definition of the eiv without linking its definition to the assessment methods which is a critical issue in finally realizing the scientific expression of the eiv based on the above understanding of intrinsic value and ecosystem the eiv can be defined in this study as the objective value of the ecosystem in and for itself which includes the total of matter energy and information carried by all the components of ecosystem of note the total does not simply mean the sum but implies holism of the ecosystems with its relationships interactions and integrative ecological networks sheng et al 2019 2 connotation of eiv it has been widely accepted that matter energy and information are the fundamental triad of universe zu 1990 jørgensen and lu 2013 jørgensen 2012 matter is the carrier of energy and information as is well known while energy is defined as a measure of the ability to do work in classical physics jørgensen et al 2016 however it is not energy per se but available energy that can do work or drive a process of transformation in ecosystem processes ayres 2002 essentially energy is a kind of orderly motion of particles when doing work therefore work can be seen as a form of energy with information or a kind of useful energy transformation zu 1990 scienceman 1997 in other words work is a useful valuable process of energy transformation and the comprehensive embodiment of matter energy and information from the ecological perspective matter constitutes the macroscopic and microscopic structure of living and non living components while energy maintains various life activities and information sustains the evolution of life from low to high simple to complex zu 1990 through the process of doing work an ecosystem self maintains its survival reproduction and gradually tendency to the climax community therefore work capacity is actually a counterpart of intrinsic value the intrinsic value of ecosystem including the total of matter energy and information carried by all the components of ecosystem can be fully expressed by work capacity of ecosystem it can be summarized that 1 eiv is an objective value depending solely on its intrinsic properties irrespective of needs wants and benefits of humans zhang et al 2015 2 eiv is the organic integration of matter energy and information of the ecosystems sheng et al 2019 and 3 eiv can be expressed by the work capacity of ecosystem since eiv is equivalent to the work capacity of an ecosystem 1 2 3 content and thermophysical properties of ecosystem uncovering the intrinsic value of ecosystem requires a recognition of all the components in which they carry matter energy and information from both ecological and thermodynamic perspectives according to the eiv definition in section 1 2 2 there have been many formulations and definitions for an ecosystem miedziejko and kędziora 2014 it is commonly believed that an ecosystem includes biotic and abiotic components in terms of their contribution to providing the basic conditions for its survival and reproduction moreover most commentators also agree that ecosystems are structured by integrated and interactive networks jørgensen 2012 in which biotic and abiotic components are the nodes while interactions are the links sheng et al 2019 these links reflect exchanges or transfers of energy matter and information through an ecological network in general biotic component abiotic component as well as ecological network together form a fully functioning ecosystem preferably the work capacity of each of these value components should be evaluated on its own properties 1 biotic component the biotic components of an ecosystem are the life forms that inhabit it teeb 2010 they are grouped in terms of the means they use to get energy michael 2018 producers take in energy from sunlight and convert it into chemical energy forming the base of the food web they also act as an interface with the abiotic components of the ecosystem during nutrient cycles as they incorporate inorganic carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere or the waters andrea 2018 consumers exist on the next levels of the food chain including herbivores carnivores and omnivores they get their energy from consuming other organisms decomposers are the living component of the ecosystem that breaks down waste materials and dead organisms they perform a vital recycling function returning nutrients incorporated in dead organisms to the soil or the waters where plants can take them up again andrea 2018 the biotic component of any ecosystem may be thought of as the functional kingdom of nature since they are based on the type of nutrition and the energy source used mondal 2019 2 abiotic component abiotic components or abiotic factors are non living chemical and physical parts of the environment that affect living organisms and ecosystem functioning fath and müller 2019 water quality vocabulary 1994 it comprises three types of components mondal 2019 a habitat condition of a given reservoir such as air water soil etc b organic and inorganic substances such as detritus carbon nitrogen etc of which all are involved in biogeochemical cycles and c physical factors especially different kinds of energy such as solar energy wind tides precipitations etc sheng 2017 3 ecological network ecosystem components are interconnected and interrelated landi et al 2018 and form an ecological network driven by energy flows and nutrient cycles the ecological network describes the makeup of adjacent direct and separated indirect pathways over which energy matter and information flow li et al 2011 its basic units include compartments and pathways while compartments refer to specific functional units in ecosystem and pathways are the channels of material and energy transfer between compartments landi et al 2018 usually an ecological network refers to the biotic interactions in an ecosystem these interactions can be trophic or non trophic goudard and loreau 2007 in this study however an ecological network is a representation of interactions between biotic and abiotic components as well as within and between organisms and the trophic interactions i e food web are the focus 4 thermophysical properties of ecosystem an open ecosystem has directionality connectivity emergent hierarchies and complex dynamics silow et al 2011 it can be viewed as a thermodynamic system with dissipative structure and open to energy and matter which is self organized towards higher complexity and organization coscieme et al 2013 saint beat et al 2015 all ecosystem processes are irreversible while by capturing energy to maintain a state of low entropy and high exergy relative to its surrounding and thermodynamic equilibrium jørgensen 2006 in these processes ecosystem structure including the ecological network and the individual gene sequence is built in other words an ecosystem structure is built upon energy fath 2013 in addition the specific content of biotic and abiotic components mentioned above is obviously composed of material and or energy moreover eiv is an integration of matter energy and information carried by all the components in the ecosystem and is identical with the work capacity of an ecosystem therefore energy and information based methods capable of calculating the work capacity are the preferred choice in eiv evaluation 2 materials and methods 2 1 methods this study started with proposing a new definition of eiv based on a literature review of ecosystem development ecosystem evaluation intrinsic value and thermophysical properties of an ecosystem then an integrated approach towards sustainability was developed for evaluating eiv according to the concept and its connotation then exergy eco exergy and development capacity were proposed to evaluate the work capacity i e eiv of the abiotic component biotic component and ecological networks respectively finally three case studies were performed to discuss and examine the proposed approach and methodology 2 1 1 approach for eiv evaluation the analytical approach for eiv evaluation must be suitable to the disciplines involved in the thermophysical properties of the ecosystem in section 1 2 3 in addition the work capacity of the biotic component abiotic component and ecological network should be synthesized within the approach there are four major tasks in the framework and process for the eiv evaluation fig 1 ecosystem identification including its type and boundary a well defined ecosystem has strong interactions among its components and weak interactions across its boundaries ma 2003 in identifying the boundary of a given ecosystem the ecosystem based management ebm principle must be adopted while comprehensively considering administrative management which emphasizes to ensure the integrity of the ecosystem as much as possible a useful choice of ecosystem boundary is one where several discontinuities coincide ma 2003 such as in the distribution of organisms depth in a water body recognition of the ecosystem content and data collection the components of the ecosystems including both abiotic and biotic components are identified based on the type and boundary of the given ecosystem and relevant data are collected moreover in order to simulate the ecological network biotic components need to be grouped into functional categories based on food composition and individual size christensen et al 2008 evaluation of the ecosystem s work capacity methods suitable for work capacity or eiv evaluation should be able to integrate the matter energy and information as a whole ecosystem sheng et al 2019 energy and information based methods based on the intrinsic properties of ecosystem can be used to calculate its work capacity synthesis of eiv calculation the work capacity of different components in an ecosystem including the biotic component abiotic component as well as ecological networks was calculated respectively using different methods the total eiv of an ecosystem can be obtained by adding work capacity to the three parts in addition monetization of eiv is a process to express the objective ecosystem value into monetary units this conversion is not part of eiv evaluation process and does not change the biophysical feature of the assessment instead it has the merit of allowing an easier understanding and effective communication of the ecological value of an ecosystem in socio economic contexts vassallo et al 2017 this step will be carried out only in decision making process 2 1 2 methods for eiv evaluation 1 evaluation method selection we conducted a thorough literature review and synthesized the information especially some important methods in the fields of thermodynamics and statistical physics since eiv is a kind of objective value depending solely on an ecosystem s intrinsic properties alternative methods for its evaluation mainly include mass based methods energy based analysis and information based methods that may be able to integrate the matter energy and information by measuring underlying physical parameters among them mass based methods cannot distinguish different values of the same mass with a different form and fail to take all energy and information of the ecosystems into account sheng et al 2019 meanwhile an energy analysis cannot measure the actual work capacity of an ecosystem for the reason that the ability of energy or work energy actually to do work is only possible when a gradient is available for the energy form under consideration jørgensen et al 2016 in addition energy analysis also cannot measure the work capacity of information in ecosystems besides emergy analysis was not adopted for its scientific issues in transformity calculation and also for the reason that emergy does not appear to conform to first law accounting principles brown and ulgiati 2004 among the approaches exergy is shown to have such advantages as a good theoretical basis in thermodynamics and closely related to information theory and relative easiness of computation it was defined as the maximum amount of useful work that the system can perform when it is brought into equilibrium with its environment jørgensen and nielsen 2007 bastianoni et al 2007 jørgensen and lu 2013 eco exergy is derived from exergy using approximations that make it suitable to describe the complexity of an ecosystems bastianoni 2011 which refers to the work capacity of an ecosystem compared to the same system at thermodynamic equilibrium at the same temperature and pressure bastianoni 2011 eco exergy can be used to measure the biomass structure energy and information stored in the biomass marion 2019 exergy and eco exergy can be used to quantify work capacity of abiotic and biotic components respectively as to the work capacity of an ecological network development capacity included in the ecopath model is a perfect candidate for this task it is the upper limit of the size of the ascendency that is a measure of the average mutual information in a system describing the largest space in ecosystem development christensen et al 2008 2 exergy and eco exergy analysis as mentioned earlier exergy measures the degree to which a material is organized relative to a random assemblage of material found at an average concentration in the crust ocean or atmosphere cleveland 2005 it can be used to quantify the work capacity of the abiotic components of an ecosystem like energy of ocean surface waves tides precipitation and substrate component etc scaled by the global average exergy density meanwhile eco exergy analysis measures the exergy of detritus and organisms total ecosystem exergy can be found by summing up the contributions originating from all components of a given ecosystem jørgensen 2012 the following formula was used to calculate eco exergy density of the ecosystems jørgensen and nielsen 2007 jørgensen and lu 2013 1 e x d e n s i t y 18 7 i 1 n β i c i where e x d e n s i t y is the eco exergy density of ecosystems in unit area kj m2 18 7 kj g is the mean eco exergy of bio detritus ci is the biomass of i species in unit area g m2 and βi is the weighting factor of i species relative to bio detritus with the best results of β were proposed by jørgensen et al 2005 to estimate total eco exergy in an entire ecosystems in a given time eq 1 is changed to xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 sheng et al 2019 2 e x 18 7 i 1 n s β i c i r i where ex is the total eco exergy of the entire ecosystems in a given year s is the area of a given ecosystem and ri is the turnover rate of i species in a year times a determined by the biological productivity of the ecosystem which can be calculated by dividing biological productivity p by biomass b note that ri depends on different ecosystems 3 ecopath and development capacity in order to measure the work capacity of an ecological network the ecological network analysis ena is necessary which is a system oriented methodology used to analyze within system interactions to identify holistic properties that are otherwise not evident from empirical observations li et al 2011 in this study the ecopath approach is chosen for constructing food web models of marine ecosystems which is a quantitative modelling technique that describes the biomass flows between functional groups heymans et al 2016 christensen et al 2005 here the functional groups in an ecosystem may be ecologically or taxonomically related to mixed species single species or size age groups christensen et al 2005 it is seen that development capacity c which is used to describe the largest space for ecosystem development christensen et al 2008 is scaled by the product of the total systems throughput tst and statistical entropy h the unit for c is flowbits or the product of flow e g t km2 a and bits here the bit is an information unit corresponding to the amount of uncertainty associated with a single binary decision in this study development capacity was calculated using the ecopath model the relationship of c with tst and h is mathematically expressed by 3 c t s t h where tst is the sum of the energy flow of the ecosystem and h is the statistical entropy the total systems throughput tst reflects the scale of the system and includes the total consumption of food total output total respiration and inflow of debris it is expressed as christensen et al 2008 4 t s t i 1 j 1 n t i j where tij is a measure of the energy flow from j to i the statistical entropy h represents the diversity of the system flows christensen et al 2008 and is estimated from 5 h i j t i j t s t log t i j t s t where the parameters are the same as defined before 2 2 materials in this study the data used in the next three case studies related to calculation of exergy eco exergy and development capacity such as biomass habitat area and parameters e g turnover rate and β were collected from published literatures e g sun et al 2016 lin et al 2009a b jørgensen et al 2005 annual reports and accessible government websites tables 1 6 2 3 case study areas three case studies were performed to examine the approach and methodology for eiv evaluation proposed in this study 2 3 1 the northern beibu gulf beibu gulf surrounded by china and vietnam is a natural semi closed continental sea area in the south china sea with rich marine living resources beibu gulf is a main germplasm resources and important aquaculture base xu et al 2011 the study area is situated in the northern beibu gulf 107 51 04 109 56 07 e 19 44 12 21 27 46 n with a total sea area of 5 21 104 km2 calculated by arcgis fig 2 and a coastline of 1653 km chen et al 2011 in this case study biomass data in habitat area turnover rate calculated by p b and development capacity calculated using ecopath model were derived from the published literature e g sun et al 2016 sun et al 2016 constructed a mass balance ecopath model for northern beibu gulf ecosystem based on four investigations of fishery resources and eco environment in the northern beibu gulf in 2006 and 2007 using ewe ecopath with ecosim software the model is consisted of 24 functional groups including marine mammals and seabirds each representing the organisms with similar roles in the food web and covered the main trophic flow in northern beibu gulf ecosystem sun et al 2016 2 3 2 the bohai sea the bohai sea located in the northeast china and the northwestern pacific ocean is a shallow semi enclosed coastal water body 117 50 122 35 e 37 10 41 n with a sea area of about 7 73 104 km2 calculated by arcgis and a coastline of about 3128 8 km ni 2013 fig 3 the bohai sea is surrounded by fast developing economic zones and populous lands with a mean depth of 18 m this shallow sea is an important spawning nursery and feeding ground for many migratory species from the yellow sea and supports an important penaeid shrimp fishery jin 1996 the third longest river in asia yellow river empties into the bohai sea in its southwest influenced by climate change and human activities the water and sediment flux from the yellow river to the sea has changed dramatically since 1970s the water inflow and sediment supply to the yellow river delta tend to decrease xu et al 2008 in this case study biomass data in habitat area turnover rate calculated by p b and development capacity were derived from a publication on the changes of the bohai sea ecosystem by lin et al 2009a based on investigations of fishery resources and the environment of the bohai sea in 1982 and 1992 conducted by yellow sea fisheries research institute lin et al 2009a with assistance of the ewe modeling software a mass balance model of the bohai sea ecosystem during the two campaign was constructed which includes 17 functional groups covering the main trophic flow of the bohai sea ecosystem 2 3 3 yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters the yangtze river estuary is located in the coast of eastern china the study area includes the yangtze river estuary and its adjacent waters 121 e 126 e and 28 n 34 n fig 4 and covers a marine area of about 3 03 105 km2 calculated by arcgis and a coastline of about 1783 km calculated by arcgis for many years freshwater from the yangtze river and warm oceanic currents from south created favorable environmental conditions including abundant nutrients sufficient light and correct ambient temperature additionally the region around the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters is one of the areas with the fastest economic growth in china compared to other marine areas human activities are increasing in this region leading to significantly high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the seawater liu et al 2013 in this case study data of biomass in habitat area turnover rate calculated by p b and development capacity comes from an article on the structure and energy flow of the yangtze river estuary and adjacent water ecosystem lin et al 2009b the study was based on the investigations of fishery resources of the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters in autumn 2000 and autumn 2006 lin et al 2009b the mass balance model of the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters ecosystem was constructed during the two periods using the ewe modeling software the model consists of 17 functional groups covering the main trophic flow of the whole ecosystem 3 results 3 1 evaluation of eiv for northern beibu gulf ecosystem all relevant parameters including biomass and turnover rate and β were collected and used to perform eco exergy analysis of biotic components in northern beibu gulf ecosystem table 1 calculation based on the ecopath model shows that tst is 4533 t km2 a while the development capacity is 4 14 1011 kj km² a bits the major marine processes are waves and tides together with water temperature and salinity short 2012 waves provide about one half the energy to work against the coast in this study ocean surface waves tides precipitation and substrate were included in abiotic component exergy analysis the original relevant parameters and formulas are listed in table 2 the result of exergy density of abiotic components in northern beibu gulf ecosystem is also calculated table 2 3 2 evaluation of eiv for bohai sea ecosystem table 3 gives all relevant parameters and references used to perform eco exergy analysis of biotic components in the bohai sea ecosystem the results of tst in 1982 and 1992 from ecopath model calculation are 5362 t km2 a and 5362 t km2 a respectively while the results of development capacity are 1 96 1011 kj km² a bits and 1 31 1011 kj km² a bits respectively lin et al 2009a in addition items of abiotic components including ocean surface waves tides precipitation and substrate component and other parameters as well as relevant formulas are listed in table 4 the exergy density of abiotic components in the bohai sea ecosystem are also tabulated table 4 3 3 evaluation of eiv for yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters ecosystem all the relevant information such as biomass turnover rate and β were collected and used to perform the eco exergy analysis of biotic components in the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters ecosystem table 5 the results from the ecopath model calculation show that tst in 2000 and 2006 are 7601 t km2 a and 2953 t km2 a respectively while the development capacity are respectively 3 46 1011 kj km² a bits and 1 85 1011 kj km² a bits corresponding to the same time period lin et al 2009b in this study abiotic parameters including ocean surface waves tides precipitation and substrate component and other parameters as well as formulas are listed in table 6 the results of exergy density of abiotic components in yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters are also calculated and given in table 6 3 4 summary and analysis of the total eiv in three ecosystems in this study the approach based on exergy eco exergy and development capacity analysis has been successfully applied to the three distinct ecosystem studies i e northern beibu gulf bohai sea as well as yangtze estuarine and its adjacent waters the work capacity of different components was calculated respectively and added to get the total eiv density table 7 here the results of work capacity density of different components and the total work capacity density i e eiv density are presented in fig 5 the results from all the case studies indicate that our current estimate of eiv density is approximately at least within the same range 5 76 1011 2 29 1012 kj km² a the results of the three ecosystem assessment show that the contribution from biotic components is dominant in the work capacity followed by ecological network and finally abiotic components specifically the results from the bohai sea ecosystem study indicate that the total eiv density in 1992 was lower than that of 1982 this change could be mainly due to the increase of fishing pressure and the decrease of primary production lin et al 2009a during that time period bottom trawling was popular and pollution increased owing to the coastal mariculture of shrimp jin 1996 as to the yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters ecosystem the results show that the total eiv density of 2006 was about half that of 2000 this change was mainly due to the influence of water closure in the three gorges project in june 2003 lin et al 2009b moreover with industrial and agricultural development a large quantity of pollutants have been discharged into estuaries and adjacent sea areas which aggravates ecosystem pollution and results in fishery resource changes 4 discussion 4 1 case studies comparison and implication a comparison among three case studies shows that the eiv density is ranked as follows yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters 2000 northern beibu gulf 2006 yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters 2006 bohai sea 1982 bohai sea 1992 the results show that there is no obvious difference in the results of eiv in unit area between yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters ecosystem and northern beibu gulf ecosystem in contrast the eiv density of bohai sea ecosystem is significantly less than that of the other two ecosystems just mentioned actually temperature and nutrients which are mainly determined by the geographic location and the hydrodynamic condition respectively are two major environmental characteristics of coastal and oceanic waters that affect ecosystem productivity grobbelaar 1992 located at the mouth of the yangtze river yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters ecosystem have received abundant nutrient supply and sufficient light while northern beibu gulf ecosystem gets far more sunlight since it is located at a more southern lower latitude by comparison bohai sea ecosystem has less nutrient supply and low temperature since it is a shallow semi enclosed coastal water body located at a more northern higher latitude the consistency of the eiv density of the three ecosystems with their own environmental characteristics demonstrates that eiv reflects the intrinsic properties of ecosystems and is determined only by the ecosystem itself in addition the approach and methods which are established in this study and applied in three distinctively different ecosystems are considered viable in valuing eiv for coastal and marine ecosystems the analysis of the eiv results in a unit area and comparison among three case studies have proofed to some extent that temperature and nutrients are playing important roles in controlling ecosystem productivity further affecting the work capacity and deciding eiv of ecosystem 4 2 consistency between definition and methods of eiv it was noted that eiv could be expressed by the existence structures functions and processes of ecosystem in previous studies zhang et al 2015 however those items aforementioned are ambiguous especially with respect to the processes and functions of ecosystem without giving precise and uniform definition in this study the eiv is redefined based on the characteristics of intrinsic value of ecosystem and the work capacity can be used to express eiv because of their common properties as defined methods involved in exergy eco exergy as well as development capacity are used to calculate the work capacity of different components in the ecosystem the work energy of physical environment genetic variability population sizes and biomass are measured through exergy and eco exergy while the work energy of interactions that between organisms and their abiotic environment as well as between and among species are embodied and measured through development capacity in ecopath model the consistency between definition and methods obviously makes it more scientific in the quantitative process of eiv which is a critical improvement compared to previous studies xu et al 2014 sheng et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 4 3 incorporating the information value of ecosystems information is a concept known for its ambiguity in both common everyday use and different fields of research dodig crnkovic 2012 over the last few decades nonetheless there has arisen a growing belief that the concept of information may have a critical role to play in understanding of the workings of the physical world goyal 2012 and has gained a prominent place in biology zenil 2012 szilard 1929 has established a connection between energy and information that information can be exchanged for energy because it can help to extract energy zhang 2020 believes that information is the motion of matter with energy in a complex self organized system such as an ecosystem the three factors of matter energy and information are inseparable a higher level of information is accompanied by a deeper use of matter and energy jørgensen and lu 2013 it has been generally accepted that information is defined as the pattern of organization of matter and energy bates 2006 meanwhile energy is defined as a measure of the ability to do work in classical mechanics zu 1990 scienceman 1997 in an ecosystem it is obvious that the ability to do work is enhanced due to the existence of network structure for its synergistic effect a previous research has shown that hierarchical organization has an important damping effect in the higher levels on disturbances occurring in the lower levels and that the damping effect increases with increasing biodiversity which is consistent with experimental and model results jørgensen et al 2016 usable work energy is required in building up the amino acid sequence and making the organizational work contained in the genome therefore although there is no evidence of real data which cannot be observed as far as now we still have reason to speculate that the energy in ecosystem exists not only in the biotic and abiotic components but also in the ordered structure of ecosystem to move from macroscopic information storage to microscopic information storage the exergetic or work capacity contribution due to information grows and becomes even higher than the physical one in the more complex living systems silow et al 2011 in this study the information value of ecosystems was incorporated in the new framework established to evaluate eiv which is also an important progress compared to previous studies xu et al 2014 sheng et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 here the ecosystem information or the ordered structure of ecosystem is included in both the ecological network and individual gene sequence jørgensen and lu 2013 in detail the work energy of information embodied in the genes is expressed by β jørgensen 2015 the weighting factor in eco exergy analysis function 2 while the work energy of information implied in ecological networks is expressed by development capacity function 3 incorporation of information into ecosystem work capacity and eiv evaluation is an important achievement and innovation in the field of ecosystem evaluation the limitation of this framework is still the definition and calculation of information which limits further research in this field and all other disciplines 4 4 applicability of the new framework this study makes it clear that with the basic purpose of survival and reproduction an ecosystem is an objective entity that maintains the living conditions for human beings and all other forms of life ecosystem value should be evaluated objectively rather than only from the perspective of human beings so we can give it adequate enough weight in the decision making process otherwise the welfare of global species may continue to experience a sharp decrease in this study the eiv is estimated in units of energy to get a natural based and objective ecosystem value although we have not yet converted the result into monetary units since the scientific problem of existing conversion rate a complete and reliable eiv evaluating system to some extent has been established in this study the new framework is applied to three marine ecosystems to estimate the intrinsic value of whole ecosystem here two issues should be noted firstly because ecosystems are usually partially destroyed by many projects in reality how to measure the intrinsic value of the partial loss of ecosystem especially the partial loss of the ecological network becomes fairly important this study recommends that the partial loss of eiv can be measured indirectly by calculating the difference of eiv for the whole ecosystem before and after projects are implemented secondly the new framework is well applied in marine ecosystems while it is also applicable to other types of ecosystems the ecopath model which is incorporated in the approach to construct ecological networks and calculate development capacity can be applied to marine ecosystem freshwater ecosystems as well as terrestrial ecosystems christensen et al 2008 exergy and eco exergy are also appropriate for different kinds of ecosystems in different scales in theory the approach and methodology of eiv evaluation developed in this study can be used in any region and of any type of ecosystem because it is objectively based on natural characteristics of ecosystem instead of social and economic perspectives and methods 5 conclusion this study indicates that an ecosystem has a value depending solely on its intrinsic properties irrespective of needs wants and benefits of humans here the ecosystem intrinsic value eiv is defined as the objective value of the ecosystem in and for itself which can be expressed by the work capacity of the ecosystem furthermore according to the concept and its connotation an approach based on exergy analysis eco exergy analysis and development capacity analysis has been developed to evaluate the work capacity i e eiv of abiotic and biotic components and ecological networks respectively it is worth mentioning that the consistency between eiv definition and its evaluation methods obviously increases its scientific value in the eiv quantitative process the application of the approach and methods established in this study in the three distinct ecosystems bohai sea yangtze estuarine and its adjacent waters and northern beibu gulf demonstrates that these approaches and methods are scientifically feasible in valuing eiv the consistency of eiv density in the three ecosystems with their own environmental characteristics demonstrates that eiv reflects the intrinsic properties of ecosystems and is determined only by the ecosystem itself the comparison and analysis of the eiv results in a unit area in three case studies to some extent have demonstrated that besides playing important roles in determining ecosystem productivity temperature and nutrients can further affect the work capacity and then determine eiv of an ecosystem finally the eiv evaluation is expected to become another powerful bolster to decision support systems after the ecosystem service value evaluation given its wide applicability the eiv evaluation may make important contributions in calculating costs of environmental degradation natural capital accounting ecological compensation cost benefit analysis and other decision making processes declaration of

24837,the objective recognition and scientific evaluation of ecosystem values are essential for sustainable decision making and nature conservation however the ecosystem services value which is the most popular concept measures ecosystem value mainly through an estimation of the willingness to pay of individuals and thus can cause a bias in estimating ecosystem value the ecosystem intrinsic value eiv which has been recognized by the millennium ecosystem assessment and the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity is an objective value of ecosystems in this study the eiv is defined as the objective value of the ecosystem in and for itself irrespective of needs wants and benefits of humans specifically eiv is an integration of matter energy and information of an ecosystem which can be measured by calculating the work capacity furthermore an eiv approach based on exergy eco exergy and development capacity analysis was developed for eiv evaluation and then applied in three marine ecosystems i e northern beibu gulf bohai sea and yangtze estuarine and its adjacent waters in china a comparison among three case studies in different years showed that the eiv density is ranked in the following sequence yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters 2000 northern beibu gulf 2006 yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters 2006 bohai sea 1982 bohai sea 1992 the results of eiv density reflect the intrinsic properties of the ecosystems and is determined only by the ecosystem itself the results have demonstrated to some extent that temperature and nutrients are playing important roles in controlling ecosystem productivity further affecting the work capacity and determining eiv of the ecosystem the approach and methods established in this study provide a stricter and more objective pathway for evaluating ecosystem value compared to our previous study which is expected to improve current decision making processes towards sustainability keywords ecosystem intrinsic value definition evaluation exergy eco exergy development capacity 1 introduction 1 1 scientific background ample evidence demonstrates that human well being is deeply connected with nature although there is much variation in dependency across different regions ipbes 2018a rich biodiversity and ecosystem resources are recognized as vital support for the living species in the world however direct and indirect drivers especially from human activities acting synergistically are accelerating the loss of biodiversity ipbes 2018a ecosystem valuation as an approach that can contribute to sustainable decision making and nature conservation is particularly useful in settings where institutional arrangements such as markets and common property regimes are not functioning well to reflect the social costs of environmental degradation howarth and farber 2002 unfortunately under the guidance of sustainable development whose first essence is the needs of the present and future generations wu et al 2019 many still care more about human s living standards in reality shrimpton et al 2017 ecosystem services are benefits people obtain from ecosystems o connor and kenter 2019 ma 2003 which evaluate ecosystem value according to the anthropocentric perspectives sheng et al 2019 various ecosystem service valuation techniques such as contingent valuation hedonic pricing and travel cost sheng et al 2019 are based either directly or indirectly on attempts to estimate the willingness to pay wtp of individuals for ecosystem services costanza et al 1997 the invest model was also used to integrate ecosystem services into policy and decision making processes nelson et al 2009 goldstein et al 2012 ouyang et al 2016 obviously ecosystem service value esv only reflects human preferences and needs disregarding other species and future generations vassallo et al 2017 most categories of esv are not objective but one sided evaluation of ecosystem value except the ecosystem service of supporting biodiversity an even worse case is that those individuals may be ill informed and their preferences may not be adequately incorporated into ecological sustainability there is no doubt that the existing approach for esv can cause an underestimate of the total value because it ignores the complex interdependencies between services and does not incorporate the ecosystems infrastructure value costanza et al 1997 in our previous studies esv was used to support decision making towards sustainability for example previous studies on marine environmental capacity chen et al 1999 strategic environmental assessment sea of harbor planning zhang et al 2001 sea for marine reclamation planning wang et al 2010 and coastal principal function zoning wu et al 2014 found that most losses of esv were 1 2 80 of the benefits of human development activities with an average of about 10 zhang et al 2015 these results are mostly caused by underestimation of ecosystem value by using the socio economic based methods and thus it would be hard to stop the uneconomical development activities zhang et al 2015 sheng et al 2019 no matter whether in theory or application the limitations of esv mentioned above are difficult to correct within the existing ecosystem service theory framework in fact observing the continual threat of environmental problems and exhaustion of resources in the last few decades people are gradually rethinking the philosophy of development green development as a non anthropocentric concept has broadly emerged since the environmental movement in the 1970s kline 2011 which focuses on nature itself by conserving biodiversity and natural health to maintain natural intrinsic value towards sustainability wu et al 2019 in the reports by the millennium ecosystem assessment ma ma 2003 and the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity teeb teeb 2010 intrinsic value is stated as the value of something in and for itself which is independent of its utility for someone else under these circumstances intrinsic value is a critical notion that holds promise for resolving the dilemma to achieve the full value of ecosystems in past a specific and in depth research on ecosystem intrinsic value eiv was conducted from 2011 to 2015 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 sheng et al 2019 by initially defining eiv and providing a workable approach to quantify it jointly using emergy analysis and eco exergy analysis however some categories of matter energy and information as energy contained in ecological network have not yet been adequately included while some categories such as biotic component are double counted using the exiting approach by modifying the connotation of eiv based on previous studies sheng et al 2019 we propose a more scientific evaluation approach for eiv in an attempt to better fully recognize the ecosystem value three case studies are used to examine the feasibility and science of the approach the results are expected to obtain the objective value of ecosystem 1 2 theory and calculation of ecosystem intrinsic value eiv 1 2 1 goal of ecosystem s development and its relationship with human beings an ecosystem is a thermodynamic system receiving collecting transforming and dissipating solar energy fath 2013 while giving rise to continuous evolution in its internal structures and functions lin 2015 several goal functions were put forward to describe the direction of ecosystem development fath et al 2001 ludovisi et al 2005 including maximum power output maximum biomass optimizing ascendency increasing total energy dissipation yielding the most stored exergy following the law of entropy production and maximizing emergy flux and storage odum 1988 any of the goal functions mentioned above can shed light on the development strategy of an ecosystem which is only related to the intrinsic properties of the ecosystem as a self organizing system far from equilibrium no matter how its initial conditions are the ecosystem always unconsciously trends toward its climax community which is a state with the largest biomass the most abundant trophic level and the minimum total entropy by the constraints of its environmental conditions hao et al 2008 more directly the ecosystem is a purpose system with the basic purpose of survival and reproduction zu 1990 the ecosphere and all life are interdependent while both humans and non humans are dependent on the ecosystem processes that nature provides washington 2013 in a fundamental sense ecosystems are the planet s life support systems for the human species and all other forms of life ma 2005 while continuously receiving a variety of benefits including provisioning regulating cultural and supporting services to sustain its own development humans are actually an integral part of ecosystems depending on ecosystem properties and network of interactions among organisms and within and among ecosystems for sustenance just like all other species ma 2003 washington 2013 although the notion of eiv or ecological value is still much debated between anthropocentric ethic and non anthropocentric ethic the value of natural ecosystems and their components should be recognized in terms of their contribution to maintaining life on earth farber et al 2002 teeb 2010 what is more is that the ecosystem works for human species and all other forms of life which has enabled us to see that esv i e the benefits for human being from ecosystem comes from the total work capacity of the whole ecosystem in other words the esv is part of eiv by acknowledging eiv and protecting them for their own sake selck et al 2017 human health and well being will be gradually improved towards sustainability rea and munns 2017 wu et al 2019 1 2 2 definition and connotation of eiv 1 concept of eiv a value is the importance of something for itself or for others the importance can be considered in three broad classes 1 the importance that something has subjectively 2 the importance that something has in meeting objective needs and 3 the intrinsic value of something ipbes 2018b different types of values are acknowledged and should be promoted in decision making pascual et al 2017 while a value can be a measure ipbes 2018b the recognition of intrinsic natural value which is recognized as a vital aspect of conservation of the biosphere piccolo 2017 has been emphasized in many global or regional reports such as the reports by ma ma 2003 and teeb teeb 2010 as well as the intergovernmental platform on biodiversity and ecosystem service ipbes ipbes 2018b for its nonnegligible role in supporting decision making an ecosystem is a dynamic complex of plant animal and microorganism communities and the nonliving environment interacting as a functional unit ma 2003 in ecological networks through matter cycle energy flow and information transfer in an ecosystem matter is the carrier while energy and information are the driving forces for succession and evolution in the ecological network the resilience and vitality of adaptation development evolution self organization and response to external disturbances are generated jørgensen and lu 2013 an ecosystem is valuable as an objective entity but there is considerable disagreement about how to assess and express these values for centuries intrinsic value was considered as an ethics category being defined as a thing that has in itself or for its own sake or as such or in its own right teeb 2010 wu et al 2019 sheng et al 2019 in recent years intrinsic value has been further defined as the value independent of any human experience and evaluation such a value is viewed as an inherent property of the entity e g an organism and not ascribed or generated by external valuing agents such as human beings pascual et al 2017 ipbes 2018b in addition the eiv was also defined as the value of its contents including the composition structure and ecological processes of the ecosystem xu et al 2014 or the objective value of ecosystems in and for itself irrespective of needs wants and benefits of humans zhang et al 2015 however it is not enough to put forward a definition of the eiv without linking its definition to the assessment methods which is a critical issue in finally realizing the scientific expression of the eiv based on the above understanding of intrinsic value and ecosystem the eiv can be defined in this study as the objective value of the ecosystem in and for itself which includes the total of matter energy and information carried by all the components of ecosystem of note the total does not simply mean the sum but implies holism of the ecosystems with its relationships interactions and integrative ecological networks sheng et al 2019 2 connotation of eiv it has been widely accepted that matter energy and information are the fundamental triad of universe zu 1990 jørgensen and lu 2013 jørgensen 2012 matter is the carrier of energy and information as is well known while energy is defined as a measure of the ability to do work in classical physics jørgensen et al 2016 however it is not energy per se but available energy that can do work or drive a process of transformation in ecosystem processes ayres 2002 essentially energy is a kind of orderly motion of particles when doing work therefore work can be seen as a form of energy with information or a kind of useful energy transformation zu 1990 scienceman 1997 in other words work is a useful valuable process of energy transformation and the comprehensive embodiment of matter energy and information from the ecological perspective matter constitutes the macroscopic and microscopic structure of living and non living components while energy maintains various life activities and information sustains the evolution of life from low to high simple to complex zu 1990 through the process of doing work an ecosystem self maintains its survival reproduction and gradually tendency to the climax community therefore work capacity is actually a counterpart of intrinsic value the intrinsic value of ecosystem including the total of matter energy and information carried by all the components of ecosystem can be fully expressed by work capacity of ecosystem it can be summarized that 1 eiv is an objective value depending solely on its intrinsic properties irrespective of needs wants and benefits of humans zhang et al 2015 2 eiv is the organic integration of matter energy and information of the ecosystems sheng et al 2019 and 3 eiv can be expressed by the work capacity of ecosystem since eiv is equivalent to the work capacity of an ecosystem 1 2 3 content and thermophysical properties of ecosystem uncovering the intrinsic value of ecosystem requires a recognition of all the components in which they carry matter energy and information from both ecological and thermodynamic perspectives according to the eiv definition in section 1 2 2 there have been many formulations and definitions for an ecosystem miedziejko and kędziora 2014 it is commonly believed that an ecosystem includes biotic and abiotic components in terms of their contribution to providing the basic conditions for its survival and reproduction moreover most commentators also agree that ecosystems are structured by integrated and interactive networks jørgensen 2012 in which biotic and abiotic components are the nodes while interactions are the links sheng et al 2019 these links reflect exchanges or transfers of energy matter and information through an ecological network in general biotic component abiotic component as well as ecological network together form a fully functioning ecosystem preferably the work capacity of each of these value components should be evaluated on its own properties 1 biotic component the biotic components of an ecosystem are the life forms that inhabit it teeb 2010 they are grouped in terms of the means they use to get energy michael 2018 producers take in energy from sunlight and convert it into chemical energy forming the base of the food web they also act as an interface with the abiotic components of the ecosystem during nutrient cycles as they incorporate inorganic carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere or the waters andrea 2018 consumers exist on the next levels of the food chain including herbivores carnivores and omnivores they get their energy from consuming other organisms decomposers are the living component of the ecosystem that breaks down waste materials and dead organisms they perform a vital recycling function returning nutrients incorporated in dead organisms to the soil or the waters where plants can take them up again andrea 2018 the biotic component of any ecosystem may be thought of as the functional kingdom of nature since they are based on the type of nutrition and the energy source used mondal 2019 2 abiotic component abiotic components or abiotic factors are non living chemical and physical parts of the environment that affect living organisms and ecosystem functioning fath and müller 2019 water quality vocabulary 1994 it comprises three types of components mondal 2019 a habitat condition of a given reservoir such as air water soil etc b organic and inorganic substances such as detritus carbon nitrogen etc of which all are involved in biogeochemical cycles and c physical factors especially different kinds of energy such as solar energy wind tides precipitations etc sheng 2017 3 ecological network ecosystem components are interconnected and interrelated landi et al 2018 and form an ecological network driven by energy flows and nutrient cycles the ecological network describes the makeup of adjacent direct and separated indirect pathways over which energy matter and information flow li et al 2011 its basic units include compartments and pathways while compartments refer to specific functional units in ecosystem and pathways are the channels of material and energy transfer between compartments landi et al 2018 usually an ecological network refers to the biotic interactions in an ecosystem these interactions can be trophic or non trophic goudard and loreau 2007 in this study however an ecological network is a representation of interactions between biotic and abiotic components as well as within and between organisms and the trophic interactions i e food web are the focus 4 thermophysical properties of ecosystem an open ecosystem has directionality connectivity emergent hierarchies and complex dynamics silow et al 2011 it can be viewed as a thermodynamic system with dissipative structure and open to energy and matter which is self organized towards higher complexity and organization coscieme et al 2013 saint beat et al 2015 all ecosystem processes are irreversible while by capturing energy to maintain a state of low entropy and high exergy relative to its surrounding and thermodynamic equilibrium jørgensen 2006 in these processes ecosystem structure including the ecological network and the individual gene sequence is built in other words an ecosystem structure is built upon energy fath 2013 in addition the specific content of biotic and abiotic components mentioned above is obviously composed of material and or energy moreover eiv is an integration of matter energy and information carried by all the components in the ecosystem and is identical with the work capacity of an ecosystem therefore energy and information based methods capable of calculating the work capacity are the preferred choice in eiv evaluation 2 materials and methods 2 1 methods this study started with proposing a new definition of eiv based on a literature review of ecosystem development ecosystem evaluation intrinsic value and thermophysical properties of an ecosystem then an integrated approach towards sustainability was developed for evaluating eiv according to the concept and its connotation then exergy eco exergy and development capacity were proposed to evaluate the work capacity i e eiv of the abiotic component biotic component and ecological networks respectively finally three case studies were performed to discuss and examine the proposed approach and methodology 2 1 1 approach for eiv evaluation the analytical approach for eiv evaluation must be suitable to the disciplines involved in the thermophysical properties of the ecosystem in section 1 2 3 in addition the work capacity of the biotic component abiotic component and ecological network should be synthesized within the approach there are four major tasks in the framework and process for the eiv evaluation fig 1 ecosystem identification including its type and boundary a well defined ecosystem has strong interactions among its components and weak interactions across its boundaries ma 2003 in identifying the boundary of a given ecosystem the ecosystem based management ebm principle must be adopted while comprehensively considering administrative management which emphasizes to ensure the integrity of the ecosystem as much as possible a useful choice of ecosystem boundary is one where several discontinuities coincide ma 2003 such as in the distribution of organisms depth in a water body recognition of the ecosystem content and data collection the components of the ecosystems including both abiotic and biotic components are identified based on the type and boundary of the given ecosystem and relevant data are collected moreover in order to simulate the ecological network biotic components need to be grouped into functional categories based on food composition and individual size christensen et al 2008 evaluation of the ecosystem s work capacity methods suitable for work capacity or eiv evaluation should be able to integrate the matter energy and information as a whole ecosystem sheng et al 2019 energy and information based methods based on the intrinsic properties of ecosystem can be used to calculate its work capacity synthesis of eiv calculation the work capacity of different components in an ecosystem including the biotic component abiotic component as well as ecological networks was calculated respectively using different methods the total eiv of an ecosystem can be obtained by adding work capacity to the three parts in addition monetization of eiv is a process to express the objective ecosystem value into monetary units this conversion is not part of eiv evaluation process and does not change the biophysical feature of the assessment instead it has the merit of allowing an easier understanding and effective communication of the ecological value of an ecosystem in socio economic contexts vassallo et al 2017 this step will be carried out only in decision making process 2 1 2 methods for eiv evaluation 1 evaluation method selection we conducted a thorough literature review and synthesized the information especially some important methods in the fields of thermodynamics and statistical physics since eiv is a kind of objective value depending solely on an ecosystem s intrinsic properties alternative methods for its evaluation mainly include mass based methods energy based analysis and information based methods that may be able to integrate the matter energy and information by measuring underlying physical parameters among them mass based methods cannot distinguish different values of the same mass with a different form and fail to take all energy and information of the ecosystems into account sheng et al 2019 meanwhile an energy analysis cannot measure the actual work capacity of an ecosystem for the reason that the ability of energy or work energy actually to do work is only possible when a gradient is available for the energy form under consideration jørgensen et al 2016 in addition energy analysis also cannot measure the work capacity of information in ecosystems besides emergy analysis was not adopted for its scientific issues in transformity calculation and also for the reason that emergy does not appear to conform to first law accounting principles brown and ulgiati 2004 among the approaches exergy is shown to have such advantages as a good theoretical basis in thermodynamics and closely related to information theory and relative easiness of computation it was defined as the maximum amount of useful work that the system can perform when it is brought into equilibrium with its environment jørgensen and nielsen 2007 bastianoni et al 2007 jørgensen and lu 2013 eco exergy is derived from exergy using approximations that make it suitable to describe the complexity of an ecosystems bastianoni 2011 which refers to the work capacity of an ecosystem compared to the same system at thermodynamic equilibrium at the same temperature and pressure bastianoni 2011 eco exergy can be used to measure the biomass structure energy and information stored in the biomass marion 2019 exergy and eco exergy can be used to quantify work capacity of abiotic and biotic components respectively as to the work capacity of an ecological network development capacity included in the ecopath model is a perfect candidate for this task it is the upper limit of the size of the ascendency that is a measure of the average mutual information in a system describing the largest space in ecosystem development christensen et al 2008 2 exergy and eco exergy analysis as mentioned earlier exergy measures the degree to which a material is organized relative to a random assemblage of material found at an average concentration in the crust ocean or atmosphere cleveland 2005 it can be used to quantify the work capacity of the abiotic components of an ecosystem like energy of ocean surface waves tides precipitation and substrate component etc scaled by the global average exergy density meanwhile eco exergy analysis measures the exergy of detritus and organisms total ecosystem exergy can be found by summing up the contributions originating from all components of a given ecosystem jørgensen 2012 the following formula was used to calculate eco exergy density of the ecosystems jørgensen and nielsen 2007 jørgensen and lu 2013 1 e x d e n s i t y 18 7 i 1 n β i c i where e x d e n s i t y is the eco exergy density of ecosystems in unit area kj m2 18 7 kj g is the mean eco exergy of bio detritus ci is the biomass of i species in unit area g m2 and βi is the weighting factor of i species relative to bio detritus with the best results of β were proposed by jørgensen et al 2005 to estimate total eco exergy in an entire ecosystems in a given time eq 1 is changed to xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 sheng et al 2019 2 e x 18 7 i 1 n s β i c i r i where ex is the total eco exergy of the entire ecosystems in a given year s is the area of a given ecosystem and ri is the turnover rate of i species in a year times a determined by the biological productivity of the ecosystem which can be calculated by dividing biological productivity p by biomass b note that ri depends on different ecosystems 3 ecopath and development capacity in order to measure the work capacity of an ecological network the ecological network analysis ena is necessary which is a system oriented methodology used to analyze within system interactions to identify holistic properties that are otherwise not evident from empirical observations li et al 2011 in this study the ecopath approach is chosen for constructing food web models of marine ecosystems which is a quantitative modelling technique that describes the biomass flows between functional groups heymans et al 2016 christensen et al 2005 here the functional groups in an ecosystem may be ecologically or taxonomically related to mixed species single species or size age groups christensen et al 2005 it is seen that development capacity c which is used to describe the largest space for ecosystem development christensen et al 2008 is scaled by the product of the total systems throughput tst and statistical entropy h the unit for c is flowbits or the product of flow e g t km2 a and bits here the bit is an information unit corresponding to the amount of uncertainty associated with a single binary decision in this study development capacity was calculated using the ecopath model the relationship of c with tst and h is mathematically expressed by 3 c t s t h where tst is the sum of the energy flow of the ecosystem and h is the statistical entropy the total systems throughput tst reflects the scale of the system and includes the total consumption of food total output total respiration and inflow of debris it is expressed as christensen et al 2008 4 t s t i 1 j 1 n t i j where tij is a measure of the energy flow from j to i the statistical entropy h represents the diversity of the system flows christensen et al 2008 and is estimated from 5 h i j t i j t s t log t i j t s t where the parameters are the same as defined before 2 2 materials in this study the data used in the next three case studies related to calculation of exergy eco exergy and development capacity such as biomass habitat area and parameters e g turnover rate and β were collected from published literatures e g sun et al 2016 lin et al 2009a b jørgensen et al 2005 annual reports and accessible government websites tables 1 6 2 3 case study areas three case studies were performed to examine the approach and methodology for eiv evaluation proposed in this study 2 3 1 the northern beibu gulf beibu gulf surrounded by china and vietnam is a natural semi closed continental sea area in the south china sea with rich marine living resources beibu gulf is a main germplasm resources and important aquaculture base xu et al 2011 the study area is situated in the northern beibu gulf 107 51 04 109 56 07 e 19 44 12 21 27 46 n with a total sea area of 5 21 104 km2 calculated by arcgis fig 2 and a coastline of 1653 km chen et al 2011 in this case study biomass data in habitat area turnover rate calculated by p b and development capacity calculated using ecopath model were derived from the published literature e g sun et al 2016 sun et al 2016 constructed a mass balance ecopath model for northern beibu gulf ecosystem based on four investigations of fishery resources and eco environment in the northern beibu gulf in 2006 and 2007 using ewe ecopath with ecosim software the model is consisted of 24 functional groups including marine mammals and seabirds each representing the organisms with similar roles in the food web and covered the main trophic flow in northern beibu gulf ecosystem sun et al 2016 2 3 2 the bohai sea the bohai sea located in the northeast china and the northwestern pacific ocean is a shallow semi enclosed coastal water body 117 50 122 35 e 37 10 41 n with a sea area of about 7 73 104 km2 calculated by arcgis and a coastline of about 3128 8 km ni 2013 fig 3 the bohai sea is surrounded by fast developing economic zones and populous lands with a mean depth of 18 m this shallow sea is an important spawning nursery and feeding ground for many migratory species from the yellow sea and supports an important penaeid shrimp fishery jin 1996 the third longest river in asia yellow river empties into the bohai sea in its southwest influenced by climate change and human activities the water and sediment flux from the yellow river to the sea has changed dramatically since 1970s the water inflow and sediment supply to the yellow river delta tend to decrease xu et al 2008 in this case study biomass data in habitat area turnover rate calculated by p b and development capacity were derived from a publication on the changes of the bohai sea ecosystem by lin et al 2009a based on investigations of fishery resources and the environment of the bohai sea in 1982 and 1992 conducted by yellow sea fisheries research institute lin et al 2009a with assistance of the ewe modeling software a mass balance model of the bohai sea ecosystem during the two campaign was constructed which includes 17 functional groups covering the main trophic flow of the bohai sea ecosystem 2 3 3 yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters the yangtze river estuary is located in the coast of eastern china the study area includes the yangtze river estuary and its adjacent waters 121 e 126 e and 28 n 34 n fig 4 and covers a marine area of about 3 03 105 km2 calculated by arcgis and a coastline of about 1783 km calculated by arcgis for many years freshwater from the yangtze river and warm oceanic currents from south created favorable environmental conditions including abundant nutrients sufficient light and correct ambient temperature additionally the region around the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters is one of the areas with the fastest economic growth in china compared to other marine areas human activities are increasing in this region leading to significantly high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the seawater liu et al 2013 in this case study data of biomass in habitat area turnover rate calculated by p b and development capacity comes from an article on the structure and energy flow of the yangtze river estuary and adjacent water ecosystem lin et al 2009b the study was based on the investigations of fishery resources of the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters in autumn 2000 and autumn 2006 lin et al 2009b the mass balance model of the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters ecosystem was constructed during the two periods using the ewe modeling software the model consists of 17 functional groups covering the main trophic flow of the whole ecosystem 3 results 3 1 evaluation of eiv for northern beibu gulf ecosystem all relevant parameters including biomass and turnover rate and β were collected and used to perform eco exergy analysis of biotic components in northern beibu gulf ecosystem table 1 calculation based on the ecopath model shows that tst is 4533 t km2 a while the development capacity is 4 14 1011 kj km² a bits the major marine processes are waves and tides together with water temperature and salinity short 2012 waves provide about one half the energy to work against the coast in this study ocean surface waves tides precipitation and substrate were included in abiotic component exergy analysis the original relevant parameters and formulas are listed in table 2 the result of exergy density of abiotic components in northern beibu gulf ecosystem is also calculated table 2 3 2 evaluation of eiv for bohai sea ecosystem table 3 gives all relevant parameters and references used to perform eco exergy analysis of biotic components in the bohai sea ecosystem the results of tst in 1982 and 1992 from ecopath model calculation are 5362 t km2 a and 5362 t km2 a respectively while the results of development capacity are 1 96 1011 kj km² a bits and 1 31 1011 kj km² a bits respectively lin et al 2009a in addition items of abiotic components including ocean surface waves tides precipitation and substrate component and other parameters as well as relevant formulas are listed in table 4 the exergy density of abiotic components in the bohai sea ecosystem are also tabulated table 4 3 3 evaluation of eiv for yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters ecosystem all the relevant information such as biomass turnover rate and β were collected and used to perform the eco exergy analysis of biotic components in the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters ecosystem table 5 the results from the ecopath model calculation show that tst in 2000 and 2006 are 7601 t km2 a and 2953 t km2 a respectively while the development capacity are respectively 3 46 1011 kj km² a bits and 1 85 1011 kj km² a bits corresponding to the same time period lin et al 2009b in this study abiotic parameters including ocean surface waves tides precipitation and substrate component and other parameters as well as formulas are listed in table 6 the results of exergy density of abiotic components in yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters are also calculated and given in table 6 3 4 summary and analysis of the total eiv in three ecosystems in this study the approach based on exergy eco exergy and development capacity analysis has been successfully applied to the three distinct ecosystem studies i e northern beibu gulf bohai sea as well as yangtze estuarine and its adjacent waters the work capacity of different components was calculated respectively and added to get the total eiv density table 7 here the results of work capacity density of different components and the total work capacity density i e eiv density are presented in fig 5 the results from all the case studies indicate that our current estimate of eiv density is approximately at least within the same range 5 76 1011 2 29 1012 kj km² a the results of the three ecosystem assessment show that the contribution from biotic components is dominant in the work capacity followed by ecological network and finally abiotic components specifically the results from the bohai sea ecosystem study indicate that the total eiv density in 1992 was lower than that of 1982 this change could be mainly due to the increase of fishing pressure and the decrease of primary production lin et al 2009a during that time period bottom trawling was popular and pollution increased owing to the coastal mariculture of shrimp jin 1996 as to the yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters ecosystem the results show that the total eiv density of 2006 was about half that of 2000 this change was mainly due to the influence of water closure in the three gorges project in june 2003 lin et al 2009b moreover with industrial and agricultural development a large quantity of pollutants have been discharged into estuaries and adjacent sea areas which aggravates ecosystem pollution and results in fishery resource changes 4 discussion 4 1 case studies comparison and implication a comparison among three case studies shows that the eiv density is ranked as follows yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters 2000 northern beibu gulf 2006 yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters 2006 bohai sea 1982 bohai sea 1992 the results show that there is no obvious difference in the results of eiv in unit area between yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters ecosystem and northern beibu gulf ecosystem in contrast the eiv density of bohai sea ecosystem is significantly less than that of the other two ecosystems just mentioned actually temperature and nutrients which are mainly determined by the geographic location and the hydrodynamic condition respectively are two major environmental characteristics of coastal and oceanic waters that affect ecosystem productivity grobbelaar 1992 located at the mouth of the yangtze river yangtze estuarine and adjacent waters ecosystem have received abundant nutrient supply and sufficient light while northern beibu gulf ecosystem gets far more sunlight since it is located at a more southern lower latitude by comparison bohai sea ecosystem has less nutrient supply and low temperature since it is a shallow semi enclosed coastal water body located at a more northern higher latitude the consistency of the eiv density of the three ecosystems with their own environmental characteristics demonstrates that eiv reflects the intrinsic properties of ecosystems and is determined only by the ecosystem itself in addition the approach and methods which are established in this study and applied in three distinctively different ecosystems are considered viable in valuing eiv for coastal and marine ecosystems the analysis of the eiv results in a unit area and comparison among three case studies have proofed to some extent that temperature and nutrients are playing important roles in controlling ecosystem productivity further affecting the work capacity and deciding eiv of ecosystem 4 2 consistency between definition and methods of eiv it was noted that eiv could be expressed by the existence structures functions and processes of ecosystem in previous studies zhang et al 2015 however those items aforementioned are ambiguous especially with respect to the processes and functions of ecosystem without giving precise and uniform definition in this study the eiv is redefined based on the characteristics of intrinsic value of ecosystem and the work capacity can be used to express eiv because of their common properties as defined methods involved in exergy eco exergy as well as development capacity are used to calculate the work capacity of different components in the ecosystem the work energy of physical environment genetic variability population sizes and biomass are measured through exergy and eco exergy while the work energy of interactions that between organisms and their abiotic environment as well as between and among species are embodied and measured through development capacity in ecopath model the consistency between definition and methods obviously makes it more scientific in the quantitative process of eiv which is a critical improvement compared to previous studies xu et al 2014 sheng et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 4 3 incorporating the information value of ecosystems information is a concept known for its ambiguity in both common everyday use and different fields of research dodig crnkovic 2012 over the last few decades nonetheless there has arisen a growing belief that the concept of information may have a critical role to play in understanding of the workings of the physical world goyal 2012 and has gained a prominent place in biology zenil 2012 szilard 1929 has established a connection between energy and information that information can be exchanged for energy because it can help to extract energy zhang 2020 believes that information is the motion of matter with energy in a complex self organized system such as an ecosystem the three factors of matter energy and information are inseparable a higher level of information is accompanied by a deeper use of matter and energy jørgensen and lu 2013 it has been generally accepted that information is defined as the pattern of organization of matter and energy bates 2006 meanwhile energy is defined as a measure of the ability to do work in classical mechanics zu 1990 scienceman 1997 in an ecosystem it is obvious that the ability to do work is enhanced due to the existence of network structure for its synergistic effect a previous research has shown that hierarchical organization has an important damping effect in the higher levels on disturbances occurring in the lower levels and that the damping effect increases with increasing biodiversity which is consistent with experimental and model results jørgensen et al 2016 usable work energy is required in building up the amino acid sequence and making the organizational work contained in the genome therefore although there is no evidence of real data which cannot be observed as far as now we still have reason to speculate that the energy in ecosystem exists not only in the biotic and abiotic components but also in the ordered structure of ecosystem to move from macroscopic information storage to microscopic information storage the exergetic or work capacity contribution due to information grows and becomes even higher than the physical one in the more complex living systems silow et al 2011 in this study the information value of ecosystems was incorporated in the new framework established to evaluate eiv which is also an important progress compared to previous studies xu et al 2014 sheng et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 here the ecosystem information or the ordered structure of ecosystem is included in both the ecological network and individual gene sequence jørgensen and lu 2013 in detail the work energy of information embodied in the genes is expressed by β jørgensen 2015 the weighting factor in eco exergy analysis function 2 while the work energy of information implied in ecological networks is expressed by development capacity function 3 incorporation of information into ecosystem work capacity and eiv evaluation is an important achievement and innovation in the field of ecosystem evaluation the limitation of this framework is still the definition and calculation of information which limits further research in this field and all other disciplines 4 4 applicability of the new framework this study makes it clear that with the basic purpose of survival and reproduction an ecosystem is an objective entity that maintains the living conditions for human beings and all other forms of life ecosystem value should be evaluated objectively rather than only from the perspective of human beings so we can give it adequate enough weight in the decision making process otherwise the welfare of global species may continue to experience a sharp decrease in this study the eiv is estimated in units of energy to get a natural based and objective ecosystem value although we have not yet converted the result into monetary units since the scientific problem of existing conversion rate a complete and reliable eiv evaluating system to some extent has been established in this study the new framework is applied to three marine ecosystems to estimate the intrinsic value of whole ecosystem here two issues should be noted firstly because ecosystems are usually partially destroyed by many projects in reality how to measure the intrinsic value of the partial loss of ecosystem especially the partial loss of the ecological network becomes fairly important this study recommends that the partial loss of eiv can be measured indirectly by calculating the difference of eiv for the whole ecosystem before and after projects are implemented secondly the new framework is well applied in marine ecosystems while it is also applicable to other types of ecosystems the ecopath model which is incorporated in the approach to construct ecological networks and calculate development capacity can be applied to marine ecosystem freshwater ecosystems as well as terrestrial ecosystems christensen et al 2008 exergy and eco exergy are also appropriate for different kinds of ecosystems in different scales in theory the approach and methodology of eiv evaluation developed in this study can be used in any region and of any type of ecosystem because it is objectively based on natural characteristics of ecosystem instead of social and economic perspectives and methods 5 conclusion this study indicates that an ecosystem has a value depending solely on its intrinsic properties irrespective of needs wants and benefits of humans here the ecosystem intrinsic value eiv is defined as the objective value of the ecosystem in and for itself which can be expressed by the work capacity of the ecosystem furthermore according to the concept and its connotation an approach based on exergy analysis eco exergy analysis and development capacity analysis has been developed to evaluate the work capacity i e eiv of abiotic and biotic components and ecological networks respectively it is worth mentioning that the consistency between eiv definition and its evaluation methods obviously increases its scientific value in the eiv quantitative process the application of the approach and methods established in this study in the three distinct ecosystems bohai sea yangtze estuarine and its adjacent waters and northern beibu gulf demonstrates that these approaches and methods are scientifically feasible in valuing eiv the consistency of eiv density in the three ecosystems with their own environmental characteristics demonstrates that eiv reflects the intrinsic properties of ecosystems and is determined only by the ecosystem itself the comparison and analysis of the eiv results in a unit area in three case studies to some extent have demonstrated that besides playing important roles in determining ecosystem productivity temperature and nutrients can further affect the work capacity and then determine eiv of an ecosystem finally the eiv evaluation is expected to become another powerful bolster to decision support systems after the ecosystem service value evaluation given its wide applicability the eiv evaluation may make important contributions in calculating costs of environmental degradation natural capital accounting ecological compensation cost benefit analysis and other decision making processes declaration of

24838,phosphorus p loading to lakes is degrading the quality and usability of water globally accurate predictions of lake p dynamics are needed to understand whole ecosystem p budgets as well as the consequences of changing lake p concentrations for water quality however complex biophysical processes within lakes along with limited observational data challenge our capacity to reproduce short term lake dynamics needed for water quality predictions as well as long term dynamics needed to understand broad scale controls over lake p here we use an emerging paradigm in modeling process guided machine learning pgml to produce a phosphorus budget for lake mendota wisconsin usa and to accurately predict epilimnetic phosphorus over a time range of days to decades in our implementation of pgml which we term a process guided recurrent neural network pgrnn we combine a process based model for lake p with a recurrent neural network and then constrain the predictions with ecological principles we test independently the process based model the recurrent neural network and the pgrnn to evaluate the overall approach the process based model accounted for most of the observed pattern in lake p however it missed the long term trend in lake p and had the worst performance in predicting winter and summer p in surface waters the root mean square error rmse for the process based model the recurrent neural network and the pgrnn was 33 0 μg p l 1 22 7 μg p l 1 and 20 7 μg p l 1 respectively all models performed better during summer with rmse values for the three models same order equal to 14 3 μg p l 1 10 9 μg p l 1 and 10 7 μg p l 1 although the pgrnn had only marginally better rmse during summer it had lower bias and reproduced long term decreases in lake p missed by the other two models for all seasons and all years the recurrent neural network had better predictions than process alone with root mean square error rmse of 23 8 μg p l 1 and 28 0 μg p l 1 respectively the output of pgrnn indicated that new processes related to water temperature thermal stratification and long term changes in external loads are needed to improve the process model by using ecological knowledge as well as the information content of complex data pgml shows promise as a technique for accurate prediction in messy real world ecological dynamics while providing valuable information that can improve our understanding of process keywords phosphorus lake mendota model machine learning lake long term 1 introduction phosphorus p is a critical limiting nutrient for phytoplankton and microbes schindler et al 2016 and thus is an important driver of water quality in many lakes and reservoirs wetzel 2001 where lakes and reservoir water quality is driven by phosphorus p dynamics long term p budgets can be used to understand lake responses to land use and climate change motew et al 2017 however predicting lake p dynamics is challenging because of the variety of factors that control p cycling and the time scales at which they occur chapra 2008 for example rapid p uptake by organisms with high turnover rates sedimentation of those organisms release of p from anoxic nutrient rich sediments and hydrologic load and export all are important processes that operate on minute to annual time scales cooke et al 2005 in response to the challenges of predicting aquatic ecosystem processes such as p cycling new modeling approaches are being developed that leverage recent increases in the availability of observational data porter et al 2012 however taking advantage of the information content of complex data remains difficult in part due to the lack of integration between differing approaches to modeling ecosystems e g karpatne et al 2017 fig 1 traditionally ecologists have focused on empirical and mechanistic approaches which range in complexity from relatively simple statistical and process models to highly complex numerical simulations fig 1 y axis process based models are commonly built to capture physical chemical and biological interactions governing natural systems starfield et al 1994 despite extensive use the majority of process based models implement approximate forms of relationships either due to incomplete knowledge of certain processes or for practical computing purposes clark et al 2016 robson 2014 this commonly introduces biases in predictions and significantly impacts the accuracy and the generalizability of the models allen hoekstra 2015 arhonditsis brett 2004 with advances in computing infrastructure and data availability there is opportunity to incorporate machine learning into the ecological modeler s toolbox fig 1 x axis machine learning has shown tremendous success in many commercial applications such as natural language processing due to the capacity of computer algorithms to detect complex patterns in large volumes of data wang deng 2019 in ecology machine learning approaches are sometimes regarded with skepticism because as a black box approach they lack the ability to interpret the relationships between input drivers and the targeted responses and therefore cannot resolve underlying mechanism jia et al 2018 2019 lazer et al 2014 moreover since the algorithms training processes are ignorant of any theoretical principles there is no guarantee that the predictions are consistent with physical laws or ecological theory peters et al 2014 an emerging modeling approach process guided machine learning pgml karpatne et al 2017 shows promise for improving model skill and ecological inference by exploiting the strengths of both mechanistic models and machine learning fig 1 by combining ecological process with machine learning pgml improves prediction accuracy while ensuring that predictions do not violate relevant physical laws or ecological principles for example jia et al 2018 has demonstrated that combining machine learning with a hydrodynamic lake model leads to predictions that are more accurate than either of the two approaches used independently while remaining true to lake thermodynamics pgml has also been used effectively to reduce the amount of environmental observations necessary for using powerful machine learning tools jia et al 2019 read et al 2019 which is an important consideration given that most ecosystems have a sparsity of observational data read et al 2017 in this work we advance both prediction accuracy and scientific discovery of p cycling in eutrophic lake mendota wisconsin usa by comparing three different modeling approaches a process based model machine learning and a third approach that implements pgml as a hybrid of process based and machine learning models and that are constrained by ecological principles by comparing the three modeling approaches we address three objectives 1 develop a lake p budget that includes p inputs and outputs and p exchange between lake sediments and the water column an accurate p budget will help us better understand the controls of water column p assess the water quality implications of factors affecting external loading and weigh those against factors controlling internal p loading 2 compare the ability of the three models to produce accurate and unbiased predictions for epilimnetic p concentration over scales ranging from days to decades because p is a limiting nutrient for primary production and the formation of harmful algal blooms in lake mendota and 3 use the pgml to identify what processes might be missing from what we assume to be the dominant controls over lake p cycling as instantiated in the process model by addressing these objectives we aim to gain a better understanding of whether pgml may be generalizable to other ecosystem applications as well as compare its ability to predict p versus other methods 2 methods 2 1 study site and model objectives we used lake mendota wisconsin a 40 km2 25 m deep eutrophic lake fig 2 as our study system because of the extensive long term data available through the north temperate lakes long term ecological research program ntl lter magnuson et al 2006 and past work focused on understanding catchment p dynamics and long term water quality kara heimerl et al 2012 lathrop carpenter 2013 lake mendota exhibits high p concentrations as a result of agricultural and urban runoff in its catchment high p leads to summer cyanobacterial blooms and degraded water quality which negatively impact recreational use and produce adverse effects on wildlife and human health lathrop 2007 morphometric hydrologic and biogeochemical information including data sets and their sources is available in tables 1 2 given our objectives of producing a whole lake p budget and surface water p predictions we devised a time dynamic approach for predicting lake surface p concentrations over scales ranging from days to decades short time scales are necessary to address the summer months of july and august when water quality is at its worst and to capture critical transitions that occur during spring and fall turnover i e when the lake fully mixes longer time scales are necessary for addressing slow changes due to interannual and long term variation in precipitation p loads and temperature as well as possible influences of changing p mass storage in lake sediments our analytical approach blends an ecosystem process model hereafter referred to as process with the machine learning technology recurrent neural networks hereafter referred to as rnn when combined they are an implementation of pgml that we term a process guided recurrent neural network pgrnn after jia et al 2018 the purposes of the pgrnn are to improve overall prediction accuracy reduce bias of process and reduce over fitting of rnn while providing insights into the design of process 2 2 process model description we developed a simple process based model to predict water column total phosphorus p on a daily time step over a period of decades we prioritized summer epilimnetic p concentration as well as reproducing the annual signal there were few examples in the literature of ecosystem scale p models applied over decades and that used relatively simple approaches jensen et al 2006 formulated a model with most of the features that interested us was relatively simple and had been used on multi year data we devised process as a time dynamic model after jensen et al 2006 with the processes we assumed to represent the dominant fluxes of water column p external load sedimentation recycling and export hakanson bryhn 2008 process fig 3 is a mass balance model that tracks three different pools of p within the lake system epilimnetic p pepi eq 1 hypolimnetic p phypo eq 2 and sediment p psed eq 3 we used a mass balance approach so that we could estimate p retention the relative contributions of internal versus external loads of p to the water column and so that we could potentially run scenarios of changing lake condition or changing p load we also felt a simple model could be applied to other lakes data requirements and parameter values are in tables 1 and 2 p load in the epilimnion is described by the mass balance

natural resources we note that this value is simply a scalar that does not affect the time dynamics of lake p hydrological inflow was obtained from the usgs gage on the yahara river at windsor wi usgs

increasing in depth growing the entrainment is calculated by multiplying the change in epilimnion volume by the phosphorus concentration of the hypolimnion as shown in equation 1b1 1b1 e n t r a i n m

recycling four parameters for process were estimated as part of an optimization routine optimization used the predictions of pepi converted to concentration units and the observations of p concentration that were taken from surface waters of lake mendota over the study period hypolimnetic p observations were not used during optimization because phypo from process was sensitive to our estimates of the hypolimnetic volume especially when hypolimnetic volumes were small moreover our primary concern was accurate estimates of pepi because of its importance to water quality process was optimized using the levenberg marquardt algorithm which is a least squares method in the fme package soetaert petzoldt 2010 parameters estimated in model fitting are based on values referenced with

potentially important processes unaccounted in the model that may explain important variance in the observed p which we explored below with the machine learning approaches 2 3 rnn model descriptions a standard rnn model aims to learn a mapping relation from a series of input drivers x x 1 x 2 x t on a total of t consecutive dates to a series of target variables y y 1 y 2 y t i e phosphorus concentration on corresponding dates through a black box function frnn the power of rnn lies in its ability to capture the data dependencies across time specifically the rnn model introduces hidden representation ht at each time step t which summarizes the information at both current time step and previous time steps the hidden representation ht can be computed using a transition function as follows 4 h t σ w h x t u h h t 1 b h where σ denotes the sigmoid function wh uh and bh are model parameters that need to be tuned using true observations it can be seen from this equation that the hidden representation ht at time t not only depends on input drivers at the same step i e xt but also depends on the hidden representation from the previous time step i e ht once obtaining the hidden representation we can compute the final model outputs as 5 y t σ w y h t b y where wy and by are another set of model parameters while standard rnn can model the dependency across time eq 4 it can hardly memorize long term patterns as the model will gradually lose its memory towards long history to address this problem various black box transition functions have been used to replace the transition function used in the standard rnn eq 4 gated recurrent unit gru chung gulcehre cho bengio 2014 is one of the most widely structures to define transition functions which has shown promising results to memorize both short term and long term patterns in a variety of real world applications in our problem successfully modeling surface p is contingent on capturing dynamics at both short time scale and long time scale and thus we adopt the gru to define transition functions in this work however due to the sole dependence on the training data this model is likely to produce results that are inconsistent with our knowledge of ecological process the tuning of model parameters within each machine learning model requires a training process that optimizes toward a specific loss function in the rnn model we use a supervised loss function that minimizes the rmse between the predicted values y t and the observed values yt at each time step this supervised loss function can be defined as follows 6 l r n n t y t y t 2 t where yt and y t denote the observed target value and the predicted target value at time t respectively the t operation takes the summation over all the time steps when the observed data are available 2 4 pgrnn model description the process guided recurrent neural network pgrnn model makes two important advancements beyond process and rnn the first is to combine process and rnn in a hybridized model and the second is to use ecological principles to constrain predictions from the hybrid model together these techniques are the pgrnn hybrid process data hpd model we can use the process based model fprocess described in 2 2 to simulate the value of the target variable yprocess yprocess will provide an incomplete representation of the target variable due to simplified or missing processes in fprocess thus resulting in model discrepancies with respect to observations to overcome the model deficiencies we combine frnn and fprocess to leverage information in both ecological process and data fig 4 the pgrnn architecture makes it possible to leverage the knowledge embedded in traditional process based models by using the process based model output yprocess as additional inputs to the machine learning for training this results in the hybrid process data hpd model fhpd x yprocess y the hpd model goes far beyond that of many traditional approaches e g eq 4 to fitting observational data for example a common approach to leveraging the simulated outputs from process based models is through residual modeling which is widely used in ecological research hamilton lloyd flores 2017 xu valocchi 2015 in residual modeling an additional function g is fitted to close the gap between the simulated output yprocess and the true observations y the residual modeling can be summarized as 7 f r e s i d u a l x f p r o c e s s x g x hpd improves upon eq 7 since the deep neural networks can serve as a universal learner with sufficient layers hornik stinchcombe white 1989 the hpd model has the potential to capture complex relationships between x yprocess and y in other words hpd model has the capacity to learn arbitrary functions to map the input x yprocess to the true observations y here we consider a case when the learned fhpd x yprocess function can be decomposed into two separate parts g x y p r o c e s s this is equivalent to the residual modeling method however the hybrid process data model can also learn coupled relation between x and yprocess which cannot be easily decomposed into separate modeling components on x and on yprocess hence the hpd model goes far beyond the capacity of many traditional approaches such as the residual modeling method ecological constraints another major innovation of our pgrnn modeling approach is to incorporate constraining principles into the traditional loss function that guide the learning of weights of the rnn for instance in the implementation of pgrnn to hydrodynamic modeling the laws of energy conservation were used to constrain thermal profile predictions jia et al 2018 however for p cycling the constraining physical principle is mass balance which is already incorporated in fprocess as an alternative to physical constraint for fitting the pgrnn we use an ecological principle common to data from natural systems we consider the power scaling laws which dictate that power in lower frequencies exceeds power in higher frequencies e g kara et al 2012 fig 5 as an application to lake data in our case this means that changes in p will tend to be smaller at short time scales such as daily than at longer time scales such as monthly this rule is useful in regularizing the daily change of model predictions and eliminating spuriously high or low values that in the real world would require an unrealistic p flux specifically the pgrnn model makes predictions at daily scale which is at a higher frequency than the observed data therefore we include an additional term in the loss function of the pgrnn to penalize any daily prediction changes that are larger than the 80 percentile of the changes of the first differences of the observed values as follows 8 l d e l t a s t r e l u y t 1 y t p 0 8 δ y t where p 0 8 δy denotes the 80 percentile of the changes of the first differences of the observed values the first difference was used to eliminate long term signals in the observational data the function relu is the rectified linear unit which is expressed as relu x max 0 x the 80 percentile was chosen through manual tuning to ensure that daily predictions had variability that conformed to reasonable expectations of daily mass change in epilimnetic p an additional constraint to pgrnn is applied and that also relates to ecological scaling even if the predicted data and the observed data are sampled at different frequency they should maintain similar statistical property over the spectrogram therefore we apply the short time fourier transform with a window length 256 on predicted outputs and observed data to generate their spectrogram over time represented as s and s respectively then we penalize large power discrepancy between them as follows 9 l s t f t t f s t f s t f t f where tf is the total number of frequency levels s and s represent the obtained spectrogram from y and y respectively s t f and s t f represent the power of the spectrum at time t and frequency f combining the eqs 5 7 we have the final training loss function as follows 10 l t r a i n i n g l r n n λ l d e l t a s μ l s t f t where λ and μ are hyper parameters to control the weight of each component in the training objective function in our test we set λ as 400 and μ as 0 05 based on a cross validation test the learning model is trained using the standard back propagation algorithm with the adam optimizer kingma ba 2015 in summary the pgrnn incorporates ecological knowledge from two aspects first it indirectly incorporates process knowledge hidden in the existing process based model through hpd model second it directly includes known ecological principles e g power scaling by generalizing the loss function of standard rnn to include ecological constraints we fit all models to epilimnetic p concentration which was sampled approximately monthly for 20 years hypolimnetic p observations were not used for model fitting because our primary concern was accurate estimates of pepi because of its importance to water quality moreover phypo from process was sensitive to our estimates of the hypolimnetic volume especially when hypolimnetic volumes were small in this work we implement a one layer rnn model with the gru structure the model has 10 units in the hidden layer i e the dimension of ht is 10 during the training process we create data chunks with 100 time steps each i e t 100 and 15 input drivers table 2 for each time step hence the input data for each chunk is a 100 by 15 matrix we preprocess the input data by standardizing the data along each of 15 feature dimensions the output is a 100 dimension vector for the predicts outputs at every time step we conducted a 6 fold cross validation test by dividing our study period for a single data set equally into six parts each time we trained the pgrnn and rnn using the data from five selected sections and then tested the model on the remaining section in particular we divide 7 200 samples into six parts in each test we train the model using 6 000 samples and test on the remaining 1 200 samples we repeat this process for six time periods so as to eliminate the possibility that the model is biased towards specific parts we chose to use section 1 as the validation section for model comparison because it provided overall best model performance direct interpretation of neural network parameters i e nodes in the network is not informative given their large numbers and the abstract nature of layering in rnns thus we determined the relative importance of 15 drivers table 2 in pgrnn by comparing the average absolute weights of network parameters that connect drivers to hidden network layers cho et al 2014 fig 6 for the most important drivers we determined the effect on epilimnetic p by setting all but one driver to their mean values and plotting epilimnetic p as a function of the remaining unaltered driver comparison of drivers in this way including process as a potential driver provides insights into the design of process and our understanding of how p cycling works in lake mendota we evaluated all three models process rnn and pgrnn for goodness of fit using root mean squared error rmse and visual inspection of predictions and observations over annual and decadal time scales for the entire time series as well as for summer only mean of july and august and winter only mean of january and february periods we evaluated long term trends using mann kendall mk a i mcleod 2011 statistics for observed and modeled data residuals were analyzed for long term trends using mk statistics and for auto correlation using auto correlation function acf r core team 2015 3 results 3 1 lake phosphorus budget process produced an ecosystem scale balanced p budget with predictions that reproduced the annual surface water p dynamics reasonably well fig 7 a each year pepi rises rapidly during fall turnover i e when the water column mixes and remains high during winter in spring there is gradual decrease in pepi followed by a precipitous decrease in summer due to settling of p presumably in the form of particulate organic phosphorus pom mostly phytoplankton from the epilimnion through the hypolimnion to the sediments during the summer stratified period pepi remains low while p builds rapidly in the hypolimnion not shown due to efflux of p from the sediments and capture of fallout from the epilimnion we note that in our model p sedimenting from the epilimnion is added to the sediment p pool for simplicity mean annual load was 1 80 g m 2 lake area y 1 the lake retained 72 3 of the load burial 1 29 g m 2 y 1 and exported the remainder 0 51 g m 2 y 1 on average p in the epilimnion due to external and internal loads was 22 6 and 77 4 respectively indicating the importance of the large lake sediment p pool to surface water concentrations the magnitudes of these fluxes should be treated with caution given the issues with model fit identified immediately below 3 2 model evaluation overall the pgrnn performed better than process and rnn in reproducing both long term fig 7 and seasonal p cycling fig 8 in winter epilimnetic p is under predicted by process early in the time series and over predicted later in the time series fig 8a rnn nearly matches the winter slope of the observed data but is biased high fig 8b and pgrnn better reproduces the trend and has less overall bias fig 8c in summer process has no long term trend fig 8d and rnn has a modest decreasing trend fig 8e while pgrnn reproduces the long term trend and captures some of the large interannual changes missed by the other two models fig 8f trends for observations model predictions and residuals are quantified in tables 3 and 4 residual error for process was lowest of the three models for the validation segment highest for the overall time series and had the greatest downward trend fig 9 a table 3 rnn improved fits over process for the whole time series with lower and less downward trend in the residuals fig 9b although fit improved rnn introduced high variance at the daily scale and occasionally spuriously high or low predictions fig 7b the pgrnn provided better fit to the data over rnn and like the rnn captured additional scales of variability missed by process fig 9c tables 3 4 the pgrnn did not produce spuriously high or low predictions for p for both winter and summer pgrnn fig 10 c f respectively had best overall model performance tables 3 4 with the least biased residuals the pgrnn improved prediction by using additional features i e explainable patterns in the driving data as well as adjusting predictions from process the five most significant drivers for pgrnn model prediction were determined to be process epilimnetic temperature p load lake level and thermocline depth fig 6 mann kendall statistics for trends in the five predictors are as follows process mk τ 0 0122 p 0 1 t mk τ 0 0118 p 0 1 p load mk τ 0 069 p 0 001 lake level mk τ 0 093 p 0 001 and z mk τ 0 059 p 0 001 because parameters in neural networks have no directly interpretable values we show the importance of predictors through their influence on the predictions in figure 11 a high frequency variability shows the recurrent nature of the pgrnn the influence of process on the predictions fig 11b red line is approximately double that of temperature fig 11c which is approximately double that of the remaining predictors fig 11d the difference between the pink and red lines in figure 11b shows that pgrnn reassigns some of the variance from process pink line to the other predictors figure 11e shows for a few years how the pgrnn predictions purple line are the result of the additive effects shown in panels a d with the final predictions shown in purple to be consistent in color with other figures the long term downward trend in the observational data and missed by process was partially described by pgrnn which assigned significant negative trends for p load lake level and thermocline depth notably pgrnn indicates that neither temperature nor process contribute to long term downward trends 4 discussion process guided machine learning pgml shows promise in accurately predicting lake surface water p dynamics our implementation of pgml the pgrnn model melds process and rnn and outperforms both of those models in a number of ways pgrnn provides better accuracy and it rarely predicts outside the range of magnitudes of realistic biogeochemical fluxes fig 5 the improvement in mean error for summer predictions from process to pgrnn table 4 fig 10 is about 4 μg l 1 which is approximately 10 of the mean long term summer p concentration in the lake 39 8 μg l 1 model performance in previous lake p modeling work rarely is documented e g bennett et al 2013 and there are few examples of models applied for more than about a decade making it challenging to compare our performance with the literature however our rmse values were about half those of the model on which process was based jensen et al 2006 our application of a common ecological principle spectral power scaling improved the quality of the predictions for the pgrnn in part by eliminating outlier predictions while a similar smoothing of the predictions could have been accomplished by post processing them it would not have fed back to improve the estimation of the pgrnn parameters thus we argue that building such principles into the model s loss function eq 10 provides for a better model calibration previous work on pgml used physical laws of water density to constrain lake temperature predictions for the machine learning components jia et al 2018 and the pgml approach outperformed the original physical model in prediction accuracy while maintaining fidelity to physical laws it could be argued for lake p however that occasional spurious predictions could better represent the observational data features in this case a different principle could be applied that would force predictions to conform to statistical characteristics of the observed distributions which might work particularly well for extreme value distributions carpenter booth kucharik lathrop 2015 the use of ecological knowledge as part of pgml helped us learn about process and guides future work on that model although we were encouraged that the predictions from process were the most important input to pgrnn for surface water p predictions fig 11b e the pgrnn suggests that process could be improved in predicting annual cycles by including an additional temperature component fig 11c pgrnn also selected p load lake level and thermocline depth fig 11d to improve the annual cycle interestingly pgrnn uses these last three terms to create a downward trend missed by process over the time series while our confidence in lake level and thermocline depth is high because they are directly measured with high frequency sensors our confidence in p load is lower suggesting the downward trend lies in that variable there are many reasons to suspect the p load there are challenges in developing the rating curve for p load via surface inflows because inflow from big storms is difficult to characterize even though a few storms might account for half of the annual p load to lake mendota carpenter et al 2015 inter annual variability of loads is high as well ranging from about 0 5 2 0 g p m 2 y 1 carpenter et al 2015 and our long term estimate of 1 8 g p m 2 y 1 is at the high end of that range furthermore p measurements in the inflows are sparse through time and not all inflows have observed p data the results of pgrnn suggest we investigate further a possible downward trend in p load to the system over the past few decades the inclusion of these factors could improve both the predictions of the annual cycle and the long term downward trend there is some evidence that a downward step change in the observational data for epilimnetic p around 2010 may be real and that the inaccuracies from model predictions appear to be due to over prediction in winter fig 10 all models over predict p concentrations from 2010 onward fig 9 suggesting that neither the driving data nor process can account for the change food web changes may be the answer introduction of spiny water fleas to lake mendota high concentrations beginning 2010 has perturbed the zooplankton community in ways that alter nutrient dynamics walsh et al 2016 by preying on daphnia that consume phytoplankton spiny water fleas potentially support higher phytoplankton biomass and therefore additional sedimentation recent invasion by zebra mussels discovered in year 2015 has likely altered the phytoplankton community in ways that affect p cycling mellina et al 1995 however given their low densities and the narrow littoral zone the effects on water clarity are likely too small to detect other catchment changes such as increased plant biomass capturing p in river outlets may be decreasing p loading into lake mendota but these have yet to be well studied and documented and are important topics for future work recommended modifications to process thus far would be relevant to modeling lake mendota but what about application of process to other lakes for dimictic temperate lakes it may be important to discriminate between processes related to iron in lake sediments because iron can have strong control over p exchange between lake sediments and the water column alternative mechanisms between high iron and low iron p cycling were described by hoffman et al 2013 in high iron lakes hypolimnetic buildup of p results primarily from the dissociation of p and fe under anoxic conditions but also from mineralization of pop from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion during fall turnover the water column becomes oxygenated fe binds p and the precipitate settles back to the sediments campbell torgersen 1980 however in low iron lakes such as lake mendota efflux of p from the sediments is dominated by mineralization of pop sedimented from the epilimnion as well as legacy p for lake mendota specifically an empirical study showed that approximately 2 3 of the hypolimnetic p buildup can be attributed to epilimnetic pop sources hoffman et al 2013 this corresponds closely to our modeling results in which annual sedimentation is roughly 65 of annual recycling in our model we do not discriminate alternative sediment water column biogeochemical processes we lump them all into recycling under the assumption that particulate p settles to the sediments whether bound to fe or organic matter while this simplification conceptually blurs the separation of water column and sediments we argue that in practice that line is blurred in mendota by a substantial layer of loose flocculent matter that rests between the sediment and the hypolimnion if we were to apply process to a high iron lake we might consider adding a p scavenging process that would occur during mixing or oxygenation events while our application of pgml shows promise many avenues of pgml evaluation have yet to be explored pgrnn has provided useful information about process and its model structure which can be the greatest source of error in predictions arhonditsis brett 2004 however we have not evaluated the parameter uncertainties for process nor have we assessed the importance of observational uncertainty in addition the relative contributions of two defining features of pgrnn process as an input to rnn and the ecological principle in constraining predictions have not been fully assessed it may be the case that an rnn with ecological principles built into the loss function i e pgrnn without process as an input predicts nearly as accurately as pgrnn however in cases where observational data are sparse training the rnn with process i e putting process back into pgrnn may reduce the amount of data needed for accurate predictions jia et al 2018 and for most lakes and reservoirs we have sparse data for important characteristics such as water quality read et al 2017 pgml offers a framework to both improve prediction accuracy and update understanding both of which are at the heart of the scientific endeavor often in ecology we have insufficient data to exploit the most powerful machine learning techniques we can relieve machine learning of the burden of capturing ecological signals by essentially training them with known process lee ros li gaidon 2018 this allows the machine learning to attribute remaining ecosystem variance to a set of drivers we find it heartening that in an era of big data and deep learning ecological knowledge retains an important role at the same time we must be cautious in our predictions because the largest source of error tends to be in our assumptions of which processes are most important and therefore included in our models arhonditsis brett 2004 predicting p dynamics is a critical aspect of understanding lake water quality and as we apply our process models to predicting p dynamics in a much broader suite of lakes we will need techniques that leverage both our knowledge and the growing data from earth observing systems 4 conclusions process guided machine learning implemented as a process guided recurrent neural network pgrnn in this study is a particularly valuable approach to modeling the lake phosphorus problem because it helped in overcoming challenges in both understanding and predicting surface water phosphorus accurately pgrnn made the most accurate predictions outperforming the process based model and the recurrent neural network in prediction accuracy reducing prediction bias and reproducing both short term and long term variability in observed lake phosphorus as importantly the pgrnn provided additional valuable information relevant to ecosystem process the process model was designed to be parsimonious and to reproduce ecological processes known to be relevant to the annual dynamics of surface water phosphorus concentration the pgrnn identified scales of variability missed by the process based model there was a long term downward trend in lake phosphorus that occurred over decades which the process model did not predict but that pgrnn attributed to a long and slow change in the phosphorus loads to the lake there was a small but significant annual cycle related to water temperature that was identified by the machine learning but not predicted by the process model these insights resulted from the

24838,phosphorus p loading to lakes is degrading the quality and usability of water globally accurate predictions of lake p dynamics are needed to understand whole ecosystem p budgets as well as the consequences of changing lake p concentrations for water quality however complex biophysical processes within lakes along with limited observational data challenge our capacity to reproduce short term lake dynamics needed for water quality predictions as well as long term dynamics needed to understand broad scale controls over lake p here we use an emerging paradigm in modeling process guided machine learning pgml to produce a phosphorus budget for lake mendota wisconsin usa and to accurately predict epilimnetic phosphorus over a time range of days to decades in our implementation of pgml which we term a process guided recurrent neural network pgrnn we combine a process based model for lake p with a recurrent neural network and then constrain the predictions with ecological principles we test independently the process based model the recurrent neural network and the pgrnn to evaluate the overall approach the process based model accounted for most of the observed pattern in lake p however it missed the long term trend in lake p and had the worst performance in predicting winter and summer p in surface waters the root mean square error rmse for the process based model the recurrent neural network and the pgrnn was 33 0 μg p l 1 22 7 μg p l 1 and 20 7 μg p l 1 respectively all models performed better during summer with rmse values for the three models same order equal to 14 3 μg p l 1 10 9 μg p l 1 and 10 7 μg p l 1 although the pgrnn had only marginally better rmse during summer it had lower bias and reproduced long term decreases in lake p missed by the other two models for all seasons and all years the recurrent neural network had better predictions than process alone with root mean square error rmse of 23 8 μg p l 1 and 28 0 μg p l 1 respectively the output of pgrnn indicated that new processes related to water temperature thermal stratification and long term changes in external loads are needed to improve the process model by using ecological knowledge as well as the information content of complex data pgml shows promise as a technique for accurate prediction in messy real world ecological dynamics while providing valuable information that can improve our understanding of process keywords phosphorus lake mendota model machine learning lake long term 1 introduction phosphorus p is a critical limiting nutrient for phytoplankton and microbes schindler et al 2016 and thus is an important driver of water quality in many lakes and reservoirs wetzel 2001 where lakes and reservoir water quality is driven by phosphorus p dynamics long term p budgets can be used to understand lake responses to land use and climate change motew et al 2017 however predicting lake p dynamics is challenging because of the variety of factors that control p cycling and the time scales at which they occur chapra 2008 for example rapid p uptake by organisms with high turnover rates sedimentation of those organisms release of p from anoxic nutrient rich sediments and hydrologic load and export all are important processes that operate on minute to annual time scales cooke et al 2005 in response to the challenges of predicting aquatic ecosystem processes such as p cycling new modeling approaches are being developed that leverage recent increases in the availability of observational data porter et al 2012 however taking advantage of the information content of complex data remains difficult in part due to the lack of integration between differing approaches to modeling ecosystems e g karpatne et al 2017 fig 1 traditionally ecologists have focused on empirical and mechanistic approaches which range in complexity from relatively simple statistical and process models to highly complex numerical simulations fig 1 y axis process based models are commonly built to capture physical chemical and biological interactions governing natural systems starfield et al 1994 despite extensive use the majority of process based models implement approximate forms of relationships either due to incomplete knowledge of certain processes or for practical computing purposes clark et al 2016 robson 2014 this commonly introduces biases in predictions and significantly impacts the accuracy and the generalizability of the models allen hoekstra 2015 arhonditsis brett 2004 with advances in computing infrastructure and data availability there is opportunity to incorporate machine learning into the ecological modeler s toolbox fig 1 x axis machine learning has shown tremendous success in many commercial applications such as natural language processing due to the capacity of computer algorithms to detect complex patterns in large volumes of data wang deng 2019 in ecology machine learning approaches are sometimes regarded with skepticism because as a black box approach they lack the ability to interpret the relationships between input drivers and the targeted responses and therefore cannot resolve underlying mechanism jia et al 2018 2019 lazer et al 2014 moreover since the algorithms training processes are ignorant of any theoretical principles there is no guarantee that the predictions are consistent with physical laws or ecological theory peters et al 2014 an emerging modeling approach process guided machine learning pgml karpatne et al 2017 shows promise for improving model skill and ecological inference by exploiting the strengths of both mechanistic models and machine learning fig 1 by combining ecological process with machine learning pgml improves prediction accuracy while ensuring that predictions do not violate relevant physical laws or ecological principles for example jia et al 2018 has demonstrated that combining machine learning with a hydrodynamic lake model leads to predictions that are more accurate than either of the two approaches used independently while remaining true to lake thermodynamics pgml has also been used effectively to reduce the amount of environmental observations necessary for using powerful machine learning tools jia et al 2019 read et al 2019 which is an important consideration given that most ecosystems have a sparsity of observational data read et al 2017 in this work we advance both prediction accuracy and scientific discovery of p cycling in eutrophic lake mendota wisconsin usa by comparing three different modeling approaches a process based model machine learning and a third approach that implements pgml as a hybrid of process based and machine learning models and that are constrained by ecological principles by comparing the three modeling approaches we address three objectives 1 develop a lake p budget that includes p inputs and outputs and p exchange between lake sediments and the water column an accurate p budget will help us better understand the controls of water column p assess the water quality implications of factors affecting external loading and weigh those against factors controlling internal p loading 2 compare the ability of the three models to produce accurate and unbiased predictions for epilimnetic p concentration over scales ranging from days to decades because p is a limiting nutrient for primary production and the formation of harmful algal blooms in lake mendota and 3 use the pgml to identify what processes might be missing from what we assume to be the dominant controls over lake p cycling as instantiated in the process model by addressing these objectives we aim to gain a better understanding of whether pgml may be generalizable to other ecosystem applications as well as compare its ability to predict p versus other methods 2 methods 2 1 study site and model objectives we used lake mendota wisconsin a 40 km2 25 m deep eutrophic lake fig 2 as our study system because of the extensive long term data available through the north temperate lakes long term ecological research program ntl lter magnuson et al 2006 and past work focused on understanding catchment p dynamics and long term water quality kara heimerl et al 2012 lathrop carpenter 2013 lake mendota exhibits high p concentrations as a result of agricultural and urban runoff in its catchment high p leads to summer cyanobacterial blooms and degraded water quality which negatively impact recreational use and produce adverse effects on wildlife and human health lathrop 2007 morphometric hydrologic and biogeochemical information including data sets and their sources is available in tables 1 2 given our objectives of producing a whole lake p budget and surface water p predictions we devised a time dynamic approach for predicting lake surface p concentrations over scales ranging from days to decades short time scales are necessary to address the summer months of july and august when water quality is at its worst and to capture critical transitions that occur during spring and fall turnover i e when the lake fully mixes longer time scales are necessary for addressing slow changes due to interannual and long term variation in precipitation p loads and temperature as well as possible influences of changing p mass storage in lake sediments our analytical approach blends an ecosystem process model hereafter referred to as process with the machine learning technology recurrent neural networks hereafter referred to as rnn when combined they are an implementation of pgml that we term a process guided recurrent neural network pgrnn after jia et al 2018 the purposes of the pgrnn are to improve overall prediction accuracy reduce bias of process and reduce over fitting of rnn while providing insights into the design of process 2 2 process model description we developed a simple process based model to predict water column total phosphorus p on a daily time step over a period of decades we prioritized summer epilimnetic p concentration as well as reproducing the annual signal there were few examples in the literature of ecosystem scale p models applied over decades and that used relatively simple approaches jensen et al 2006 formulated a model with most of the features that interested us was relatively simple and had been used on multi year data we devised process as a time dynamic model after jensen et al 2006 with the processes we assumed to represent the dominant fluxes of water column p external load sedimentation recycling and export hakanson bryhn 2008 process fig 3 is a mass balance model that tracks three different pools of p within the lake system epilimnetic p pepi eq 1 hypolimnetic p phypo eq 2 and sediment p psed eq 3 we used a mass balance approach so that we could estimate p retention the relative contributions of internal versus external loads of p to the water column and so that we could potentially run scenarios of changing lake condition or changing p load we also felt a simple model could be applied to other lakes data requirements and parameter values are in tables 1 and 2 p load in the epilimnion is described by the mass balance

natural resources we note that this value is simply a scalar that does not affect the time dynamics of lake p hydrological inflow was obtained from the usgs gage on the yahara river at windsor wi usgs

increasing in depth growing the entrainment is calculated by multiplying the change in epilimnion volume by the phosphorus concentration of the hypolimnion as shown in equation 1b1 1b1 e n t r a i n m

concentration that were taken from surface waters of lake mendota over the study period hypolimnetic p observations were not used during optimization because phypo from process was sensitive to our estimates of the hypolimnetic volume especially when hypolimnetic volumes were small moreover our primary concern was accurate estimates of pepi because of its importance to water quality process was

potentially important processes unaccounted in the model that may explain important variance in the observed p which we explored below with the machine learning approaches 2 3 rnn model descriptions a standard rnn model aims to learn a mapping relation from a series of input drivers x x 1 x 2 x t on a total of t consecutive dates to a series of target variables y y 1 y 2 y t i e phosphorus concentration on corresponding dates through a black box function frnn the power of rnn lies in its ability to capture the data dependencies across time specifically the rnn model introduces hidden representation ht at each time step t which summarizes the information at both current time step and previous time steps the hidden representation ht can be computed using a transition function as follows 4 h t σ w h x t u h h t 1 b h where σ denotes the sigmoid function wh uh and bh are model parameters that need to be tuned using true observations it can be seen from this equation that the hidden representation ht at time t not only depends on input drivers at the same step i e xt but also depends on the hidden representation from the previous time step i e ht once obtaining the hidden representation we can compute the final model outputs as 5 y t σ w y h t b y where wy and by are another set of model parameters while standard rnn can model the dependency across time eq 4 it can hardly memorize long term patterns as the model will gradually lose its memory towards long history to address this problem various black box transition functions have been used to replace the transition function used in the standard rnn eq 4 gated recurrent unit gru chung gulcehre cho bengio 2014 is one of the most widely structures to define transition functions which has shown promising results to memorize both short term and long term patterns in a variety of real world applications in our problem successfully modeling surface p is contingent on capturing dynamics at both short time scale and long time scale and thus we adopt the gru to define transition functions in this work however due to the sole dependence on the training data this model is likely to produce results that are inconsistent with our knowledge of ecological process the tuning of model parameters within each machine learning model requires a training process that optimizes toward a specific loss function in the rnn model we use a supervised loss function that minimizes the rmse between the predicted values y t and the observed values yt at each time step this supervised loss function can be defined as follows 6 l r n n t y t y t 2 t where yt and y t denote the observed target value and the predicted target value at time t respectively the t operation takes the summation over all the time steps when the observed data are available 2 4 pgrnn model description the process guided recurrent neural network pgrnn model makes two important advancements beyond process and rnn the first is to combine process and rnn in a hybridized model and the second is to use ecological principles to constrain predictions from the hybrid model together these techniques are the pgrnn hybrid process data hpd model we can use the process based model fprocess described in 2 2 to simulate the value of the target variable yprocess yprocess will provide an incomplete representation of the target variable due to simplified or missing processes in fprocess thus resulting in model discrepancies with respect to observations to overcome the model deficiencies we combine frnn and fprocess to leverage information in both ecological process and data fig 4 the pgrnn architecture makes it possible to leverage the knowledge embedded in traditional process based models by using the process based model output yprocess as additional inputs to the machine learning for training this results in the hybrid process data hpd model fhpd x yprocess y the hpd model goes far beyond that of many traditional approaches e g eq 4 to fitting observational data for example a common approach to leveraging the simulated outputs from process based models is through residual modeling which is widely used in ecological research hamilton lloyd flores 2017 xu valocchi 2015 in residual modeling an additional function g is fitted to close the gap between the simulated output yprocess and the true observations y the residual modeling can be summarized as 7 f r e s i d u a l x f p r o c e s s x g x hpd improves upon eq 7 since the deep neural networks can serve as a universal learner with sufficient layers hornik stinchcombe white 1989 the hpd model has the potential to capture complex relationships between x yprocess and y in other words hpd model has the capacity to learn arbitrary functions to map the input x yprocess to the true observations y here we consider a case when the learned fhpd x yprocess function can be decomposed into two separate parts g x y p r o c e s s this is equivalent to the residual modeling method however the hybrid process data model can also learn coupled relation between x and yprocess which cannot be easily decomposed into separate modeling components on x and on yprocess hence the hpd model goes far beyond the capacity of many traditional approaches such as the residual modeling method ecological constraints another major innovation of our pgrnn modeling approach is to incorporate constraining principles into the traditional loss function that guide the learning of weights of the rnn for instance in the implementation of pgrnn to hydrodynamic modeling the laws of energy conservation were used to constrain thermal profile predictions jia et al 2018 however for p cycling the constraining physical principle is mass balance which is already incorporated in fprocess as an alternative to physical constraint for fitting the pgrnn we use an ecological principle common to data from natural systems we consider the power scaling laws which dictate that power in lower frequencies exceeds power in higher frequencies e g kara et al 2012 fig 5 as an application to lake data in our case this means that changes in p will tend to be smaller at short time scales such as daily than at longer time scales such as monthly this rule is useful in regularizing the daily change of model predictions and eliminating spuriously high or low values that in the real world would require an unrealistic p flux specifically the pgrnn model makes predictions at daily scale which is at a higher frequency than the observed data therefore we include an additional term in the loss function of the pgrnn to penalize any daily prediction changes that are larger than the 80 percentile of the changes of the first differences of the observed values as follows 8 l d e l t a s t r e l u y t 1 y t p 0 8 δ y t where p 0 8 δy denotes the 80 percentile of the changes of the first differences of the observed values the first difference was used to eliminate long term signals in the observational data the function relu is the rectified linear unit which is expressed as relu x max 0 x the 80 percentile was chosen through manual tuning to ensure that daily predictions had variability that conformed to reasonable expectations of daily mass change in epilimnetic p an additional constraint to pgrnn is applied and that also relates to ecological scaling even if the predicted data and the observed data are sampled at different frequency they should maintain similar statistical property over the spectrogram therefore we apply the short time fourier transform with a window length 256 on predicted outputs and observed data to generate their spectrogram over time represented as s and s respectively then we penalize large power discrepancy between them as follows 9 l s t f t t f s t f s t f t f where tf is the total number of frequency levels s and s represent the obtained spectrogram from y and y respectively s t f and s t f represent the power of the spectrum at time t and frequency f combining the eqs 5 7 we have the final training loss function as follows 10 l t r a i n i n g l r n n λ l d e l t a s μ l s t f t where λ and μ are hyper parameters to control the weight of each component in the training objective function in our test we set λ as 400 and μ as 0 05 based on a cross validation test the learning model is trained using the standard back propagation algorithm with the adam optimizer kingma ba 2015 in summary the pgrnn incorporates ecological knowledge from two aspects first it indirectly incorporates process knowledge hidden in the existing process based model through hpd model second it directly includes known ecological principles e g power scaling by generalizing the loss function of standard rnn to include ecological constraints we fit all models to epilimnetic p concentration which was sampled approximately monthly for 20 years hypolimnetic p observations were not used for model fitting because our primary concern was accurate estimates of pepi because of its importance to water quality moreover phypo from process was sensitive to our estimates of the hypolimnetic volume especially when hypolimnetic volumes were small in this work we implement a one layer rnn model with the gru structure the model has 10 units in the hidden layer i e the dimension of ht is 10 during the training process we create data chunks with 100 time steps each i e t 100 and 15 input drivers table 2 for each time step hence the input data for each chunk is a 100 by 15 matrix we preprocess the input data by standardizing the data along each of 15 feature dimensions the output is a 100 dimension vector for the predicts outputs at every time step we conducted a 6 fold cross validation test by dividing our study period for a single data set equally into six parts each time we trained the pgrnn and rnn using the data from five selected sections and then tested the model on the remaining section in particular we divide 7 200 samples into six parts in each test we train the model using 6 000 samples and test on the remaining 1 200 samples we repeat this process for six time periods so as to eliminate the possibility that the model is biased towards specific parts we chose to use section 1 as the validation section for model comparison because it provided overall best model performance direct interpretation of neural network parameters i e nodes in the network is not informative given their large numbers and the abstract nature of layering in rnns thus we determined the relative importance of 15 drivers table 2 in pgrnn by comparing the average absolute weights of network parameters that connect drivers to hidden network layers cho et al 2014 fig 6 for the most important drivers we determined the effect on epilimnetic p by setting all but one driver to their mean values and plotting epilimnetic p as a function of the remaining unaltered driver comparison of drivers in this way including process as a potential driver provides insights into the design of process and our understanding of how p cycling works in lake mendota we evaluated all three models process rnn and pgrnn for goodness of fit using root mean squared error rmse and visual inspection of predictions and observations over annual and decadal time scales for the entire time series as well as for summer only mean of july and august and winter only mean of january and february periods we evaluated long term trends using mann kendall mk a i mcleod 2011 statistics for observed and modeled data residuals were analyzed for long term trends using mk statistics and for auto correlation using auto correlation function acf r core team 2015 3 results 3 1 lake phosphorus budget process produced an ecosystem scale balanced p budget with predictions that reproduced the annual surface water p dynamics reasonably well fig 7 a each year pepi rises rapidly during fall turnover i e when the water column mixes and remains high during winter in spring there is gradual decrease in pepi followed by a precipitous decrease in summer due to settling of p presumably in the form of particulate organic phosphorus pom mostly phytoplankton from the epilimnion through the hypolimnion to the sediments during the summer stratified period pepi remains low while p builds rapidly in the hypolimnion not shown due to efflux of p from the sediments and capture of fallout from the epilimnion we note that in our model p sedimenting from the epilimnion is added to the sediment p pool for simplicity mean annual load was 1 80 g m 2 lake area y 1 the lake retained 72 3 of the load burial 1 29 g m 2 y 1 and exported the remainder 0 51 g m 2 y 1 on average p in the epilimnion due to external and internal loads was 22 6 and 77 4 respectively indicating the importance of the large lake sediment p pool to surface water concentrations the magnitudes of these fluxes should be treated with caution given the issues with model fit identified immediately below 3 2 model evaluation overall the pgrnn performed better than process and rnn in reproducing both long term fig 7 and seasonal p cycling fig 8 in winter epilimnetic p is under predicted by process early in the time series and over predicted later in the time series fig 8a rnn nearly matches the winter slope of the observed data but is biased high fig 8b and pgrnn better reproduces the trend and has less overall bias fig 8c in summer process has no long term trend fig 8d and rnn has a modest decreasing trend fig 8e while pgrnn reproduces the long term trend and captures some of the large interannual changes missed by the other two models fig 8f trends for observations model predictions and residuals are quantified in tables 3 and 4 residual error for process was lowest of the three models for the validation segment highest for the overall time series and had the greatest downward trend fig 9 a table 3 rnn improved fits over process for the whole time series with lower and less downward trend in the residuals fig 9b although fit improved rnn introduced high variance at the daily scale and occasionally spuriously high or low predictions fig 7b the pgrnn provided better fit to the data over rnn and like the rnn captured additional scales of variability missed by process fig 9c tables 3 4 the pgrnn did not produce spuriously high or low predictions for p for both winter and summer pgrnn fig 10 c f respectively had best overall model performance tables 3 4 with the least biased residuals the pgrnn improved prediction by using additional features i e explainable patterns in the driving data as well as adjusting predictions from process the five most significant drivers for pgrnn model prediction were determined to be process epilimnetic temperature p load lake level and thermocline depth fig 6 mann kendall statistics for trends in the five predictors are as follows process mk τ 0 0122 p 0 1 t mk τ 0 0118 p 0 1 p load mk τ 0 069 p 0 001 lake level mk τ 0 093 p 0 001 and z mk τ 0 059 p 0 001 because parameters in neural networks have no directly interpretable values we show the importance of predictors through their influence on the predictions in figure 11 a high frequency variability shows the recurrent nature of the pgrnn the influence of process on the predictions fig 11b red line is approximately double that of temperature fig 11c which is approximately double that of the remaining predictors fig 11d the difference between the pink and red lines in figure 11b shows that pgrnn reassigns some of the variance from process pink line to the other predictors figure 11e shows for a few years how the pgrnn predictions purple line are the result of the additive effects shown in panels a d with the final predictions shown in purple to be consistent in color with other figures the long term downward trend in the observational data and missed by process was partially described by pgrnn which assigned significant negative trends for p load lake level and thermocline depth notably pgrnn indicates that neither temperature nor process contribute to long term downward trends 4 discussion process guided machine learning pgml shows promise in accurately predicting lake surface water p dynamics our implementation of pgml the pgrnn model melds process and rnn and outperforms both of those models in a number of ways pgrnn provides better accuracy and it rarely predicts outside the range of magnitudes of realistic biogeochemical fluxes fig 5 the improvement in mean error for summer predictions from process to pgrnn table 4 fig 10 is about 4 μg l 1 which is approximately 10 of the mean long term summer p concentration in the lake 39 8 μg l 1 model performance in previous lake p modeling work rarely is documented e g bennett et al 2013 and there are few examples of models applied for more than about a decade making it challenging to compare our performance with the literature however our rmse values were about half those of the model on which process was based jensen et al 2006 our application of a common ecological principle spectral power scaling improved the quality of the predictions for the pgrnn in part by eliminating outlier predictions while a similar smoothing of the predictions could have been accomplished by post processing them it would not have fed back to improve the estimation of the pgrnn parameters thus we argue that building such principles into the model s loss function eq 10 provides for a better model calibration previous work on pgml used physical laws of water density to constrain lake temperature predictions for the machine learning components jia et al 2018 and the pgml approach outperformed the original physical model in prediction accuracy while maintaining fidelity to physical laws it could be argued for lake p however that occasional spurious predictions could better represent the observational data features in this case a different principle could be applied that would force predictions to conform to statistical characteristics of the observed distributions which might work particularly well for extreme value distributions carpenter booth kucharik lathrop 2015 the use of ecological knowledge as part of pgml helped us learn about process and guides future work on that model although we were encouraged that the predictions from process were the most important input to pgrnn for surface water p predictions fig 11b e the pgrnn suggests that process could be improved in predicting annual cycles by including an additional temperature component fig 11c pgrnn also selected p load lake level and thermocline depth fig 11d to improve the annual cycle interestingly pgrnn uses these last three terms to create a downward trend missed by process over the time series while our confidence in lake level and thermocline depth is high because they are directly measured with high frequency sensors our confidence in p load is lower suggesting the downward trend lies in that variable there are many reasons to suspect the p load there are challenges in developing the rating curve for p load via surface inflows because inflow from big storms is difficult to characterize even though a few storms might account for half of the annual p load to lake mendota carpenter et al 2015 inter annual variability of loads is high as well ranging from about 0 5 2 0 g p m 2 y 1 carpenter et al 2015 and our long term estimate of 1 8 g p m 2 y 1 is at the high end of that range furthermore p measurements in the inflows are sparse through time and not all inflows have observed p data the results of pgrnn suggest we investigate further a possible downward trend in p load to the system over the past few decades the inclusion of these factors could improve both the predictions of the annual cycle and the long term downward trend there is some evidence that a downward step change in the observational data for epilimnetic p around 2010 may be real and that the inaccuracies from model predictions appear to be due to over prediction in winter fig 10 all models over predict p concentrations from 2010 onward fig 9 suggesting that neither the driving data nor process can account for the change food web changes may be the answer introduction of spiny water fleas to lake mendota high concentrations beginning 2010 has perturbed the zooplankton community in ways that alter nutrient dynamics walsh et al 2016 by preying on daphnia that consume phytoplankton spiny water fleas potentially support higher phytoplankton biomass and therefore additional sedimentation recent invasion by zebra mussels discovered in year 2015 has likely altered the phytoplankton community in ways that affect p cycling mellina et al 1995 however given their low densities and the narrow littoral zone the effects on water clarity are likely too small to detect other catchment changes such as increased plant biomass capturing p in river outlets may be decreasing p loading into lake mendota but these have yet to be well studied and documented and are important topics for future work recommended modifications to process thus far would be relevant to modeling lake mendota but what about application of process to other lakes for dimictic temperate lakes it may be important to discriminate between processes related to iron in lake sediments because iron can have strong control over p exchange between lake sediments and the water column alternative mechanisms between high iron and low iron p cycling were described by hoffman et al 2013 in high iron lakes hypolimnetic buildup of p results primarily from the dissociation of p and fe under anoxic conditions but also from mineralization of pop from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion during fall turnover the water column becomes oxygenated fe binds p and the precipitate settles back to the sediments campbell torgersen 1980 however in low iron lakes such as lake mendota efflux of p from the sediments is dominated by mineralization of pop sedimented from the epilimnion as well as legacy p for lake mendota specifically an empirical study showed that approximately 2 3 of the hypolimnetic p buildup can be attributed to epilimnetic pop sources hoffman et al 2013 this corresponds closely to our modeling results in which annual sedimentation is roughly 65 of annual recycling in our model we do not discriminate alternative sediment water column biogeochemical processes we lump them all into recycling under the assumption that particulate p settles to the sediments whether bound to fe or organic matter while this simplification conceptually blurs the separation of water column and sediments we argue that in practice that line is blurred in mendota by a substantial layer of loose flocculent matter that rests between the sediment and the hypolimnion if we were to apply process to a high iron lake we might consider adding a p scavenging process that would occur during mixing or oxygenation events while our application of pgml shows promise many avenues of pgml evaluation have yet to be explored pgrnn has provided useful information about process and its model structure which can be the greatest source of error in predictions arhonditsis brett 2004 however we have not evaluated the parameter uncertainties for process nor have we assessed the importance of observational uncertainty in addition the relative contributions of two defining features of pgrnn process as an input to rnn and the ecological principle in constraining predictions have not been fully assessed it may be the case that an rnn with ecological principles built into the loss function i e pgrnn without process as an input predicts nearly as accurately as pgrnn however in cases where observational data are sparse training the rnn with process i e putting process back into pgrnn may reduce the amount of data needed for accurate predictions jia et al 2018 and for most lakes and reservoirs we have sparse data for important characteristics such as water quality read et al 2017 pgml offers a framework to both improve prediction accuracy and update understanding both of which are at the heart of the scientific endeavor often in ecology we have insufficient data to exploit the most powerful machine learning techniques we can relieve machine learning of the burden of capturing ecological signals by essentially training them with known process lee ros li gaidon 2018 this allows the machine learning to attribute remaining ecosystem variance to a set of drivers we find it heartening that in an era of big data and deep learning ecological knowledge retains an important role at the same time we must be cautious in our predictions because the largest source of error tends to be in our assumptions of which processes are most important and therefore included in our models arhonditsis brett 2004 predicting p dynamics is a critical aspect of understanding lake water quality and as we apply our process models to predicting p dynamics in a much broader suite of lakes we will need techniques that leverage both our knowledge and the growing data from earth observing systems 4 conclusions process guided machine learning implemented as a process guided recurrent neural network pgrnn in this study is a particularly valuable approach to modeling the lake phosphorus problem because it helped in overcoming challenges in both understanding and predicting surface water phosphorus accurately pgrnn made the most accurate predictions outperforming the process based model and the recurrent neural network in prediction accuracy reducing prediction bias and reproducing both short term and long term variability in observed lake phosphorus as importantly the pgrnn provided additional valuable information relevant to ecosystem process the process model was designed to be parsimonious and to reproduce ecological processes known to be relevant to the annual dynamics of surface water phosphorus concentration the pgrnn identified scales of variability missed by the process based model there was a long term downward trend in lake phosphorus that occurred over decades which the process model did not predict but that pgrnn attributed to a long and slow change in the phosphorus loads to the lake there was a small but significant annual cycle related to water temperature that was identified by the machine learning but not predicted by the process model these insights resulted from the

24839,in this model we considered the population density effect based on the evolutionary maintainable strategy ems for optimal sex ratio strategy analysis instead of the evolutionary stable strategy ess under the population equilibrium we used a cellular automaton model to simulate population dynamics using the birth death process to monitor the effect of space structure on the optimal sex ratio in ems the simulation showed that when the whole population was a panmixia the optimal sex ratio would be 1 1 male female which conforms to the fisher s theory prediction however in a structured population the ratio favoured a female bias sexratio which conforms to the local mate competition theory prediction with the decreased dispersal range the sex ratio strategy tended towards a higher male proportion which is similar to the local resource competition prediction the predictions of our model partly conformed to classical theories and explained some gaps in the ess model however the driving force differed from the classical sex ratio model the sex ratio was selected by population fitness rather than mother s fitness the optimal sex ratio strategy for a population is to guarantee mating success indicating that population survival may provide a complementary explanation for the sex ratio evolution keywords sex ratio cellular automaton spatially explicit limited dispersal evolutionarily maintainable strategy 1 introduction explaining evolution of the sex ratio remains one of the greatest challenges in evolutionary biology werren 1980 fisher pointed out that natural selection favours a 1 1 male female sex ratio when populations are large and individuals within the population mate at random fisher 1958 the 1 1 sex ratio isfavoured with the explanation that parents will invest in the scarcer sex if the sex ratio departures from 1 1 however the sex ratio deviates from 1 1 in many species hamilton first proposed that organisms could adjust their offspring to a female biased sex ratio in isolated sub populations due to inbreeding and local mate competition lmc wherein sons would contribute less gene frequency to the offspring hamilton 1967 trivers and willard 1973 subsequently charnov developed another hypothesis local resource competition lrc which states that offspring sex ratios should be biased in favour of the sex that disperses from the natal area wherever philopatric offspring compete for resources with their parents charnov 1983 based on fisher s principle maynard smith proposed the evolutionarily stable strategy ess derived from r h macarthurand w d hamilton swork on sex ratios ess is a strategy which if adopted by a population in a given environment cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy that is initially rare smith and price 1973 it is widely accepted and used in evolution however some blind spots remain for example the ess sex ratio s in form of male proportion the same below of amphiploid species conforms to hamilton s lmc theory s n 1 2n where n is the number of fertilised females that invade a new habitat patch hamilton 1967 the challenge is that the predicted sex ratio is 0 when n 1 however it is also fabulous how female offspring can propagate by themselves in this isolated structure space the contradiction also exists in the lrc hypothesis whose ess sex ratio is s n 2n 1 similarly the question remains that it is diffcut for the all male strategy s 1 to maintain population breeding when n 1 many sex ratio models under the ess frame mainly pay attention to the game between counter or partners and disregards whether the winner is vulnerable or not pen et al 2002 seger and stubblefield 2002 tainaka and araki 1999 thus often take less account of selective forces to the whole population from the environment nowak 1990 as well as to simplifying the life history characteristics of the organisms e g age structure various number of offspring and overlapping of generations cockburn et al 2002 the winner under ess frame may be endangerd if the population size in stationary state is less than minimum viable population when species go extinct this sex ratio strategy is eliminated in evolution another method understanding population viability which was determined by evolutionary maintainable strategy ems may help to consider the above mentioned problem ems is a strategy that can achieve maximum population density in a steady state itoh et al 2004 tainaka 1997 2003 tainaka and araki 1999 that is ems measures fitness of the population rather than fitness of one individual in the game for a population with few founders the population density will grow up with the time and then get to a steady state when reach to the environmental capacity an ems sex ratio is strategy which made population density in steady state larger than adopting any other sex ratio strategy the simplification of the game process made it easy to consider the complex life histories of organisms and population persistence to construct a spatially explicit two sex individual based model ibm and derive a spatially homogeneous model shm berec et al 2001 boukal and berec 2002 we considered an amphimictic species with generation overlaps fixed home range and that lives alone except for in the mating season accordingly individuals are only active near their territory and contact with their neighbours the offspring also disperse to the habitat patch in the mother s neighbourhood it is too complicated to develop an analytic model that combines the complex lifecycle and spatial structure therefore we modelled dynamics of a spatially explicit sexual populationby cellular automaton the automaton was built to obey the basic birth death process of a natural populationto easily simulate the influence of specific parameters e g dispersal parameter lifetime fecundity birth probability mortality etc on population dynamics we then analysed how these various demographic parameters affected the optimal sex ratio within the ems framework 2 model and simulation our model incorporates space explicitly as a two dimensional grid whose size is n n n cells one individual can inhabit each cell maximally the grid has periodic boundaries i e individuals can cross the border on any side and re enter the grid on the opposite side hailey and willemsen 2000 we mainly adopted the moore neighbourhood structure which comprises eightcells surrounding the centre cell fig 1 a extreme local dispersal was simulated by the vonneumann neighbourhood which the centrecell contacted with the surrounding four cells fig 1b the model is also built to consider a sexual population with overlapping generations each individual is divided into three stages young adult and elder therefore each cell has seven potential states empty o occupied by young male ym adult male am elder male em young female yf adult female af and elder female ef these seven states transform according to certain rules i e the state of each cell is updated by birth and death processes over time fig 1 c if there are am in the neighbourhood of anaf the female produces a certain number of offspring with the birth probability per capita and the offspring disperse to the empty cell in the neighbourhood of the female if an individual occupied a cell the cell would change to an empty cell with a certain death probability of that individual the mathematical model is as follows 1 p y m m y m p y m r b q a f o q a m o a f p o 2 p y f m y f p y f 1 r q a f o q a m o a f p o 3 p a m m a m a a m p a m 1 m y m p

mate with 10 females the mating system is promiscuous that is monogamy polygamy and polyandry may all exist in the population simultaneously to find factors that affect sex ratio evolution we investigated elements as follows 1 initial distribution and initial population density we investigated whether different patterns of initial distribution random and clump and initial population size affected the sex ratio strategy of the population 2 dispersal ability we defined dispersal range d to investigate the relationship between dispersal ability and optimal sex ratio salathé et al 2006 the value of d was equal to the range r of moore neighbourhood when d 1 the neighbourhood comprised the eight cells surrounding the focal cell on the two dimensional square lattice the number of neighbourhood cell was 24 two layer cells when d 2 and global dispersal a panmixia was represented by d n 2 1 salathé et al 2006 d 0 5 was an exception specifically the focal cell could contact with four cells that is r 1 in the vonneumannneighbourhood 3 lifetime fecundity fecundity is a key factor to maintain the population but its role in the evolution of sex ratio is unclear we characterised lifetime fecundity of species by ageing probability a a lower ageing probability of individuals indicated a smaller probability of adults to lose their reproductive ability the total breeding period was relatively longer i e longer reproductive duration and a larger number of expected offspring could be generated within the life history the total lifetime fecundity was stronger in this case and vice versa 4 birth probability and mortality an individual s birth and death probability significantly influences population dynamics in this model the birth probability was represented by the probability that a mother gives birth to babies mortality of a population could be characterised by death probability of an individual when all individuals were equal sensitivity analysis were conducted to measure whether and what the ems sex ratio response to the input parameters initial distribution and founders number were tested by one way variance test as the two parameters can be recognised as classification variables non linear regression were conduct to measure the sensitivity of dispersal parameter birth probability ageing probability and death probability were tested by correlation analysis simulation implementated in matlab r 2016b spss software version 20 0 was used for statistical analyses and graphs were drawn and data fitted using origin 2017 3 result 3 1 initial state and single simulation we simulated the spatial and temporal dynamics of populations in the two initial distributions when the dispersal parameter d was equal to 1 the initial distribution of clump or random did not affect sex ratio strategy t 0 978 df 198 p 0 330 when the dispersal ability of an individual within a population was limited d 1 random distribution gradually became a clump distribution over time due to the advantage of this distribution for seeking a spouse fig 2 a this may help to explain why most species distributed aggregately the mate resoureces is one of the vital factors in addition for clump species the size of the initial population size does not affect the optimal sex ratio strategy in our model the ems sex ratio with under 20 100 and 400 founders shows no significant difference anova test f 1 180 df 2 p 0 309 the ems sex ratio is insensitive with the initial distribution and founders number nevertheless too small number of founders invariably leads to extinction of the population as the predicted by the allee effect we chose one of the 100 repeated simulation fig 2b and observe the population dynamic under the ems sex ratio fig

increased as theageing probability increased r 0 964 n 7 p 0 fig 4 a specifically strong lifetime fecundity led to a more female biased sex ratio in the structured space further asymmetric lifetime fecundity between males and females greatly influenced the sex ratio when the ageing probability of male and female was 0 1 and 0 3 respectively the sex ratio was female biased at 0 248 0 030 further a balanced sex ratio of 0 487 0 039 was achieved when the male s ageing probability was 0 3 and the female s was 0 1 with the ratio increase of male to female s ageing probability the ems sex ratio tend to favors more males strategy r 0 964 n 7 p 0 fig 4b we can postulate that if the lifetime fecundity of males is stronger than females fewer males are required to inseminate all females thus favouring a female biased sex ratio to achieve a maximum population in contrast when females have a stronger lifetime fecundity i e longer reproductive duration more males are needed to fully

do not have reproductive ability the resources for young and adults are then reduced causing a decrease in the probability of females encountering males a greater number of males are beneficial to

ability of individuals is limited i e individuals live within limited space and only come into contact with a limited number of other individuals a female biased sex ratio is favoured however when individuals can disperse in a whole population i e a random mating population the optimal sex ratio is 0 5 this is consistent with the prediction of lmc and fisher s theories however the driving force of this ems model is different in the ess frame mothers maximise the gene frequency to offspring by avoiding mate and resource competition between individuals the primary consideration of the ems sex ratio strategyis to maximise population fitness this is an implication of the effect of group selection which has been proposed by colwellr k and developed by harvey harvey et al 1985 wilson and colwell 1981 furthermore lmc theory predicted an all female strategy s 0 when one fertilisedfemale invades a new habitat patch hamilton 1967 while in the lrc hypothesis the ess sex ratio is anall male strategy s 1 in this situation charnov 1982 in our simulation the sex ratio strategy wasa comprehensive result between lmc and lrc when individualswere extremely limited in a small structure space for example d 0 5 the sex ratio strategyr ems 0 45 0 021wouldbe close to balance this is more feasible in nature for dioecious plants which have no migratoryability the sex ratio convey of six species of lindera lauraceae shows a tendency towards a 1 1sex ratio rather than extreme male or female bias dupont and kato 2010 comparing sex ratios survival may be the most important factor for species and should be considered in the sex ratio evolution therefore considering colony survival and proliferation the evolution of biased sex ratios may have resulted as a balance between the opposing forces of group and individual selection the ems sex ratio model also predicted the sex ratio variations in relation to dispersal parameter d the dispersal ability of individuals is the response of population connectivity and group size when dispersal parameter d 1 the group size is 8 when d 2 the group size is 16 and so on the larger the dispersal parameter the higher the connectivity in the population most models often assumethat all females are fertilised while it has been shown that sex ratio evolution would encounterthe risk of incomplete fertilisation lehtonen and schwanz 2018 according to the prediction of the ems sex ratio model the mate limitation which influence fertilisation played an important role in the sex ratio variations in extreme structure population a female encounters a limited number in her lifetime therefore greater male proportion promotes success mate probability of females with the increasing range of activities mating opportunities for female increase a lower male proportion can guarantee that all females can still be fertilised a more female biased sex ratio is conducive to maximum utilisation of resources for population amplification in this situation therefore the ems sex ratio decreased with the increasing dispersal parameter d fig 3 however the mating ability of any given male is limited such that a sufficient number of males are needed to ensure that all females are mated due to the mate limitation of males mate competition between females will occur and increase with the expanding mate range of females therefore mate competition not only occurs between males but also females in a panmixia all females have an equal mate probability and the probability is positively correlated with male density in this situation the mate success or reproduction of whole population will be in a low level if the male density is low therefore it is advantageous for the male proportion to obtain a high population density as presentedin our simulation the sex ratio did not decrease with the further increase in dispersal range an equal male to female number withglobal dispersal mate limitation refers to the difficulty of finding a compatible and receptive mate for sexual reproduction at lower population density and population connectivity berec et al 2007 this is generally a problem encountered by species that utilise passive reproduction and possess low mobility such as plants sessile invertebrates and less migratory vertebrates berec et al 2007 most reptiles which have home range and search for neighbours in mate season have highly female biased sex ratios burke 1993 such as chinese alligator alligator sinensis zhao et al 2013 american alligator a mississippiensis ferguson and joanen 1983 mugger crocodile crocodylus palustris lang et al 1989 the empirical data from hummingbird flower mites that the sex ratio changes in relation to breeding group size for 11 species wilson and colwell 1981 corroborates predictions of the ems sex ratio model as well as the unique structure and population dynamics of the social spider anelosimuseximius aviles 1986 4 2 lifetime fecundity according to the ems model prediction individuals have stronger lifetime fecundity i e throughout the life cycle individuals have lower ageing probability due to longer duration of reproductive ability and more offspring meaning that the sexually mature individuals increase in the structured space likewise the probability of af encountering am increases the mate competition of males increases but decreases for females in this case a small number of males can not only reduce the intensity of competition but also leave females more resources to produce more offspring cross species analysis of 19 species of bethylid wasps showed that sex ratio proportion of males is strongly and negatively correlated with clutch size i e the more offspring the lower male proportion griffiths and godfray 1988 hardy and mayhew 1998 whichcorresponds with our simulation result a comprehensive analysis from 40 empirical studies on odocoileus also revealed astrong negative correlation between progeny sex ratio and fecundity rate verme 1983 which showed the same trend asour result 4 3 environment stress we also found that populations with high birth rate low juvenile mortality low adult mortality and high elderly mortality i e a population wherein good living conditions are available achieved maximum population density at a lower sex ratio we conclude that a low sex ratio is favoured when good living conditions are available while a high sex ratio occurs when a population experiences a harsh environment a synthesis of data on wild and captive primate populations van schaik and van noordwijk 1982 suggests that stressful conditions yield a higher sex ratio proportion of males at birth data from six ungulates also showed a distorted sex ratio of neonates favouring females which provided high quality supplementary feed hoefs and nowlan 1994 some observation data from ungulates and insects support this result sachdeva et al 1973 van schaik 1983 verme 1969 salix arctica a dioecious dwarf willow exhibits significant spatial segregation of the sexes the overall sex ratio is female biased and female plants are especially common in wet higher nutrient but lower soil temperature habitats in contrast male plants predominate in more xeric and lower nutrient habitats with higher soil temperatures that can be drought prone dawson and bliss 1989 boxelder acer negundovar interior which is a dioecious tree also exhibits significant habitat specific sex ratio biases the sex ratio male female is significantly male biased 1 62 in drought prone habitats while it is significantly female biased 0 65 in moist streamside habitats dawson and ehleringer 1993 pistaciachinensisis a deciduous wind pollinated large shrub and has limited population connectivity which conforms to the assumption of our model a study containing more than 1500 individuals and 31 populations showed poor soil nitrogen areas fostered male biased populations and the degree of sex ratio bias increased with decreasing population connectivity fukuda et al 2011 5 conclusion we developed an ems sex ratio model by cellular automaton and examined the effect of life history parameters on sex ratio strategies fisher s balance sex ratio under panmixia was confirmed in this ems model as well as the female biased sex ratio in a structured population according to the lmc theory different from the ess model the ems sex ratio strategy considered more about population viability which interpreted some blind spots of lmc or lrc predictions in a population an optimal sex ratio should be the balance of population viability and individual fitness for a specific population more than one life history parameter affects the sex ratio and the action of these parameters largely depends on environmental conditions it is then necessary to consider simultaneously the influence of variable selection pressures and variable constraints when conducting analyses on specific cases and populations ethics our study does not

the computer model basic simulation process 1 initially we distributed the seven states to each cell and set a group of parameters 2 to update we chose a target cell from 1 to 10 000 i if the cell was occupied by k k ym yf then the death process was performed namely the site k was changed into o with the death rate mk if survival then changed to adult ii if the cell was occupied by k k am af the site kwas changed into o with the death rate mk if survival then changed to f f em ef with the ageing rate ak iii if the cell was occupied by k k em ef the site kwas changed into o with the death rate mk iv if the cell was o we performed the birth process local disperse if the focal cell was at location i j then we searched for af in its local neighbourhood i d j d if cell x y was occupied by an af then we had to find anam in the female s neighbourhood if no af or male was available no reproduction could occur otherwise the female could produce n offspring with birth rate b therefore the mathematical expectation offspring number nexp of the female was bn count empty cell number ne in the neighbourhood of the female if nexp ne the resource was limited therefore the survival nsur was ne otherwise nsur nexp the focal cell was not occupied by offspring of the female with the rate 1 nsur ne if the total number of the females that had am in the neighbourhood around the focal cell wasnfm the focal cell stayed empty with the rate re a 1 r e i 1 n f m 1 n s u r i n e i the focal cell was occupied by offspring with the probability rb a 2 r b 1 i 1 n f m 1 n s u r i n e i if the offspring

24839,in this model we considered the population density effect based on the evolutionary maintainable strategy ems for optimal sex ratio strategy analysis instead of the evolutionary stable strategy ess under the population equilibrium we used a cellular automaton model to simulate population dynamics using the birth death process to monitor the effect of space structure on the optimal sex ratio in ems the simulation showed that when the whole population was a panmixia the optimal sex ratio would be 1 1 male female which conforms to the fisher s theory prediction however in a structured population the ratio favoured a female bias sexratio which conforms to the local mate competition theory prediction with the decreased dispersal range the sex ratio strategy tended towards a higher male proportion which is similar to the local resource competition prediction the predictions of our model partly conformed to classical theories and explained some gaps in the ess model however the driving force differed from the classical sex ratio model the sex ratio was selected by population fitness rather than mother s fitness the optimal sex ratio strategy for a population is to guarantee mating success indicating that population survival may provide a complementary explanation for the sex ratio evolution keywords sex ratio cellular automaton spatially explicit limited dispersal evolutionarily maintainable strategy 1 introduction explaining evolution of the sex ratio remains one of the greatest challenges in evolutionary biology werren 1980 fisher pointed out that natural selection favours a 1 1 male female sex ratio when populations are large and individuals within the population mate at random fisher 1958 the 1 1 sex ratio isfavoured with the explanation that parents will invest in the scarcer sex if the sex ratio departures from 1 1 however the sex ratio deviates from 1 1 in many species hamilton first proposed that organisms could adjust their offspring to a female biased sex ratio in isolated sub populations due to inbreeding and local mate competition lmc wherein sons would contribute less gene frequency to the offspring hamilton 1967 trivers and willard 1973 subsequently charnov developed another hypothesis local resource competition lrc which states that offspring sex ratios should be biased in favour of the sex that disperses from the natal area wherever philopatric offspring compete for resources with their parents charnov 1983 based on fisher s principle maynard smith proposed the evolutionarily stable strategy ess derived from r h macarthurand w d hamilton swork on sex ratios ess is a strategy which if adopted by a population in a given environment cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy that is initially rare smith and price 1973 it is widely accepted and used in evolution however some blind spots remain for example the ess sex ratio s in form of male proportion the same below of amphiploid species conforms to hamilton s lmc theory s n 1 2n where n is the number of fertilised females that invade a new habitat patch hamilton 1967 the challenge is that the predicted sex ratio is 0 when n 1 however it is also fabulous how female offspring can propagate by themselves in this isolated structure space the contradiction also exists in the lrc hypothesis whose ess sex ratio is s n 2n 1 similarly the question remains that it is diffcut for the all male strategy s 1 to maintain population breeding when n 1 many sex ratio models under the ess frame mainly pay attention to the game between counter or partners and disregards whether the winner is vulnerable or not pen et al 2002 seger and stubblefield 2002 tainaka and araki 1999 thus often take less account of selective forces to the whole population from the environment nowak 1990 as well as to simplifying the life history characteristics of the organisms e g age structure various number of offspring and overlapping of generations cockburn et al 2002 the winner under ess frame may be endangerd if the population size in stationary state is less than minimum viable population when species go extinct this sex ratio strategy is eliminated in evolution another method understanding population viability which was determined by evolutionary maintainable strategy ems may help to consider the above mentioned problem ems is a strategy that can achieve maximum population density in a steady state itoh et al 2004 tainaka 1997 2003 tainaka and araki 1999 that is ems measures fitness of the population rather than fitness of one individual in the game for a population with few founders the population density will grow up with the time and then get to a steady state when reach to the environmental capacity an ems sex ratio is strategy which made population density in steady state larger than adopting any other sex ratio strategy the simplification of the game process made it easy to consider the complex life histories of organisms and population persistence to construct a spatially explicit two sex individual based model ibm and derive a spatially homogeneous model shm berec et al 2001 boukal and berec 2002 we considered an amphimictic species with generation overlaps fixed home range and that lives alone except for in the mating season accordingly individuals are only active near their territory and contact with their neighbours the offspring also disperse to the habitat patch in the mother s neighbourhood it is too complicated to develop an analytic model that combines the complex lifecycle and spatial structure therefore we modelled dynamics of a spatially explicit sexual populationby cellular automaton the automaton was built to obey the basic birth death process of a natural populationto easily simulate the influence of specific parameters e g dispersal parameter lifetime fecundity birth probability mortality etc on population dynamics we then analysed how these various demographic parameters affected the optimal sex ratio within the ems framework 2 model and simulation our model incorporates space explicitly as a two dimensional grid whose size is n n n cells one individual can inhabit each cell maximally the grid has periodic boundaries i e individuals can cross the border on any side and re enter the grid on the opposite side hailey and willemsen 2000 we mainly adopted the moore neighbourhood structure which comprises eightcells surrounding the centre cell fig 1 a extreme local dispersal was simulated by the vonneumann neighbourhood which the centrecell contacted with the surrounding four cells fig 1b the model is also built to consider a sexual population with overlapping generations each individual is divided into three stages young adult and elder therefore each cell has seven potential states empty o occupied by young male ym adult male am elder male em young female yf adult female af and elder female ef these seven states transform according to certain rules i e the state of each cell is updated by birth and death processes over time fig 1 c if there are am in the neighbourhood of anaf the female produces a certain number of offspring with the birth probability per capita and the offspring disperse to the empty cell in the neighbourhood of the female if an individual occupied a cell the cell would change to an empty cell with a certain death probability of that individual the mathematical model is as follows 1 p y m m y m p y m r b q a f o q a m o a f p o 2 p y f m y f p y f 1 r q a f o q a m o a f p o 3 p a m m a m a a m p a m 1 m y m p

af mate with the am in her neighbourhood 2 resource limited resources for offspring are limited i e the offspring who exceed the carrying capacity of resources die automatically 3 promiscuity if there are am in the neighbourhood of an af the female can reproduce offspring regardless of the total number of am considering the realistic case we created a restriction that any one male can maximally mate with 10 females the mating system is promiscuous that is monogamy polygamy and polyandry may all exist in the population simultaneously to find factors that affect sex ratio evolution we investigated elements as follows 1 initial distribution and initial population density we investigated whether different patterns of initial distribution random and clump and initial population size affected the sex ratio strategy of the population 2 dispersal ability we defined dispersal range d to investigate the relationship between dispersal ability and optimal sex ratio salathé et al 2006 the value of d was equal to the range r of moore neighbourhood when d 1 the neighbourhood comprised the eight cells surrounding the focal cell on the two dimensional square lattice the number of neighbourhood cell was 24 two layer cells when d 2 and global dispersal a panmixia was represented by d n 2 1 salathé et al 2006 d 0 5 was an exception specifically the focal cell could contact with four cells that is r 1 in the vonneumannneighbourhood 3 lifetime fecundity fecundity is a key factor to maintain the population but its role in the evolution of sex ratio is unclear we characterised lifetime fecundity of species by ageing probability a a lower ageing probability of individuals indicated a smaller probability of adults to lose their reproductive ability the total breeding period was relatively longer i e longer reproductive duration and a larger number of expected offspring could be generated within the life history the total lifetime fecundity was stronger in this case and vice versa 4 birth probability and mortality an individual s birth and death probability significantly influences population dynamics in this model the birth probability was represented by the probability that a mother gives birth to babies mortality of a population could be characterised by death probability of an individual when all individuals were equal sensitivity analysis were conducted to measure whether and what the ems sex ratio response to the input parameters initial distribution and founders number were tested by one way variance test as the two parameters can be recognised as classification variables non linear regression were conduct to measure the sensitivity of dispersal parameter birth probability ageing probability and death probability were tested by correlation analysis simulation implementated in matlab r 2016b spss software version 20 0 was used for statistical analyses and graphs were drawn and data fitted using origin 2017 3 result 3 1 initial state and single simulation we simulated the spatial and temporal dynamics of populations in the two initial distributions when the dispersal parameter d was equal to 1 the initial distribution of clump or random did not affect sex ratio strategy t 0 978 df 198 p 0 330 when the dispersal ability of an individual within a population was limited d 1 random distribution gradually became a clump distribution over time due to the advantage of this distribution for seeking a spouse fig 2 a this may help to explain why most species distributed aggregately the mate resoureces is one of the vital factors in addition for clump species the size of the initial population size does not affect the optimal sex ratio strategy in our model the ems sex ratio with under 20 100 and 400 founders shows no significant difference anova test f 1 180 df 2 p 0 309 the ems sex ratio is insensitive with the initial distribution and founders number nevertheless too small number of founders invariably leads to extinction of the population as the predicted by the allee effect we chose one of the 100 repeated simulation fig 2b and observe the population dynamic under the ems sex ratio fig

increased as theageing probability increased r 0 964 n 7 p 0 fig 4 a specifically strong lifetime fecundity led to a more female biased sex ratio in the structured space further asymmetric lifetime

a balanced sex ratio of 0 487 0 039 was achieved when the male s ageing probability was 0 3 and the female s was 0 1 with the ratio increase of male to female s ageing probability the ems sex ratio tend to favors more males strategy r 0 964 n 7 p 0 fig 4b we can postulate that if the lifetime fecundity of males is stronger than females fewer males are required to inseminate all females thus favouring a female biased sex ratio to achieve a maximum population in contrast when females have a stronger lifetime fecundity i e longer reproductive duration more males are needed to fully

probability r 0 982 n 7 p 0 fig 5 a which leads to a large number of offspring therefore intense mate competition between male offspring can be expected see 3 3 lifetime fecundity the optimal sex

however increasing elderly mortality also favour a higher sex ratio r 0 975 n 5 p 0 005 fig 5d declines in elderly mortalitycan lead to a large amount of resources occupied by elderly individuals who do not have reproductive ability the resources for young and adults are then reduced causing a decrease in the probability of females encountering males a greater number of males are beneficial to

ability of individuals is limited i e individuals live within limited space and only come into contact with a limited number of other individuals a female biased sex ratio is favoured however when individuals can disperse in a whole population i e a random mating population the optimal sex ratio is 0 5 this is consistent with the prediction of lmc and fisher s theories however the driving force of this ems model is different in the ess frame mothers maximise the gene frequency to offspring by avoiding mate and resource competition between individuals the primary consideration of the ems sex ratio strategyis to maximise population fitness this is an implication of the effect of group selection which has been proposed by colwellr k and developed by harvey harvey et al 1985 wilson and colwell 1981 furthermore lmc theory predicted an all female strategy s 0 when one fertilisedfemale invades a new habitat patch hamilton 1967 while in the lrc hypothesis the ess sex ratio is anall male strategy s 1 in this situation charnov 1982 in our simulation the sex ratio strategy wasa comprehensive result between lmc and lrc when individualswere extremely limited in a small structure space for example d 0 5 the sex ratio strategyr ems 0 45 0 021wouldbe close to balance this is more feasible in nature for dioecious plants which have no migratoryability the sex ratio convey of six species of lindera lauraceae shows a tendency towards a 1 1sex ratio rather than extreme male or female bias dupont and kato 2010 comparing sex ratios survival may be the most important factor for species and should be considered in the sex ratio evolution therefore considering colony survival and proliferation the evolution of biased sex ratios may have resulted as a balance between the opposing forces of group and individual selection the ems sex ratio model also predicted the sex ratio variations in relation to dispersal parameter d the dispersal ability of individuals is the response of population connectivity and group size when dispersal parameter d 1 the group size is 8 when d 2 the group size is 16 and so on the larger the dispersal parameter the higher the connectivity in the population most models often assumethat all females are fertilised while it has been shown that sex ratio evolution would encounterthe risk of incomplete fertilisation lehtonen and schwanz 2018 according to the prediction of the ems sex ratio model the mate limitation which influence fertilisation played an important role in the sex ratio variations in extreme structure population a female encounters a limited number in her lifetime therefore greater male proportion promotes success mate probability of females with the increasing range of activities mating opportunities for female increase a lower male proportion can guarantee that all females can still be fertilised a more female biased sex ratio is conducive to maximum utilisation of resources for population amplification in this situation therefore the ems sex ratio decreased with the increasing dispersal parameter d fig 3 however the mating ability of any given male is limited such that a sufficient number of males are needed to ensure that all females are mated due to the mate limitation of males mate competition between females will occur and increase with the expanding mate range of females therefore mate competition not only occurs between males but also females in a panmixia all females have an equal mate probability and the probability is positively correlated with male density in this situation the mate success or reproduction of whole population will be in a low level if the male density is low therefore it is advantageous for the male proportion to obtain a high population density as presentedin our simulation the sex ratio did not decrease with the further increase in dispersal range an equal male to female number withglobal dispersal mate limitation refers to the difficulty of finding a compatible and receptive mate for sexual reproduction at lower population density and population connectivity berec et al 2007 this is generally a problem encountered by species that utilise passive reproduction and possess low mobility such as plants sessile invertebrates and less migratory vertebrates berec et al 2007 most reptiles which have home range and search for neighbours in mate season have highly female biased sex ratios burke 1993 such as chinese alligator alligator sinensis zhao et al 2013 american alligator a mississippiensis ferguson and joanen 1983 mugger crocodile crocodylus palustris lang et al 1989 the empirical data from hummingbird flower mites that the sex ratio changes in relation to breeding group size for 11 species wilson and colwell 1981 corroborates predictions of the ems sex ratio model as well as the unique structure and population dynamics of the social spider anelosimuseximius aviles 1986 4 2 lifetime fecundity according to the ems model prediction individuals have stronger lifetime fecundity i e throughout the life cycle individuals have lower ageing probability due to longer duration of reproductive ability and more offspring meaning that the sexually mature individuals increase in the structured space likewise the probability of af encountering am increases the mate competition of males increases but decreases for females in this case a small number of males can not only reduce the intensity of competition but also leave females more resources to produce more offspring cross species analysis of 19 species of bethylid wasps showed that sex ratio proportion of males is strongly and negatively correlated with clutch size i e the more offspring the lower male proportion griffiths and godfray 1988 hardy and mayhew 1998 whichcorresponds with our simulation result a comprehensive analysis from 40 empirical studies on odocoileus also revealed astrong negative correlation between progeny sex ratio and fecundity rate verme 1983 which showed the same trend asour result 4 3 environment stress we also found that populations with high birth rate low juvenile mortality low adult mortality and high elderly mortality i e a population wherein good living conditions are available achieved maximum population density at a lower sex ratio we conclude that a low sex ratio is favoured when good living conditions are available while a high sex ratio occurs when a population experiences a harsh environment a synthesis of data on wild and captive primate populations van schaik and van noordwijk 1982 suggests that stressful conditions yield a higher sex ratio proportion of males at birth data from six ungulates also showed a distorted sex ratio of neonates favouring females which provided high quality supplementary feed hoefs and nowlan 1994 some observation data from ungulates and insects support this result sachdeva et al 1973 van schaik 1983 verme 1969 salix arctica a dioecious dwarf willow exhibits significant spatial segregation of the sexes the overall sex ratio is female biased and female plants are especially common in wet higher nutrient but lower soil temperature habitats in contrast male plants predominate in more xeric and lower nutrient habitats with higher soil temperatures that can be drought prone dawson and bliss 1989 boxelder acer negundovar interior which is a dioecious tree also exhibits significant habitat specific sex ratio biases the sex ratio male female is significantly male biased 1 62 in drought prone habitats while it is significantly female biased 0 65 in moist streamside habitats dawson and ehleringer 1993 pistaciachinensisis a deciduous wind pollinated large shrub and has limited population connectivity which conforms to the assumption of our model a study containing more than 1500 individuals and 31 populations showed poor soil nitrogen areas fostered male biased populations and the degree of sex ratio bias increased with decreasing population connectivity fukuda et al 2011 5 conclusion we developed an ems sex ratio model by cellular automaton and examined the effect of life history parameters on sex ratio strategies fisher s balance sex ratio under panmixia was confirmed in this ems model as well as the female biased sex ratio in a structured population according to the lmc theory different from the ess model the ems sex ratio strategy considered more about population viability which interpreted some blind spots of lmc or lrc predictions in a population an optimal sex ratio should be the balance of population viability and individual fitness for a specific population more than one life history parameter affects the sex ratio and the action of these parameters largely depends on environmental conditions it is then necessary to consider simultaneously the influence of variable selection pressures and variable constraints when conducting analyses on specific cases and populations ethics our study does not

the computer model basic simulation process 1 initially we distributed the seven states to each cell and set a group of parameters 2 to update we chose a target cell from 1 to 10 000 i if the cell was occupied by k k ym yf then the death process was performed namely the site k was changed into o with the death rate mk if survival then changed to adult ii if the cell was occupied by k k am af the site kwas changed into o with the death rate mk if survival then changed to f f em ef with the ageing rate ak iii if the cell was occupied by k k em ef the site kwas changed into o with the death rate mk iv if the cell was o we performed the birth process local disperse if the focal cell was at location i j then we searched for af in its local neighbourhood i d j d if cell x y was occupied by an af then we had to find anam in the female s neighbourhood if no af or male was available no reproduction could occur otherwise the female could produce n offspring with birth rate b therefore the mathematical expectation offspring number nexp of the female was bn count empty cell number ne in the neighbourhood of the female if nexp ne the resource was limited therefore the survival nsur was ne otherwise nsur nexp the focal cell was not occupied by offspring of the female with the rate 1 nsur ne if the total number of the females that had am in the neighbourhood around the focal cell wasnfm
