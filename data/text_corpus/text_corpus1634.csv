8170,study region the catchment area of lakes titicaca and poopó is located in the peruvian bolivian altiplano in the central andes of south america study focus we quantified the impact of irrigation and climate variability on the range of fluctuation of water levels in lakes titicaca and poopó by applying the weap model to dynamically represents the hydrology of the catchment area irrigation and water storage in the lakes the model is implemented with observed climate datasets for the region processed at a monthly time step for the historical period 1980 2015 new hydrological insights for the region fluctuations in water levels are mainly controlled by climate variability irrigation withdrawals aggravate unfavorable conditions thus amplifying water level fluctuations in lake titicaca the climate explains about 80 of the fluctuation range and the remaining 20 is due to irrigation in lake poopó the role of climate also prevails with a contribution of about 65 while the remaining 35 is attributed to irrigation the difference in the relative contribution of irrigation between the lakes is due to the fact that the net inputs in lake poopó depend mostly on regional flows and on the contributions of lake titicaca while in the much larger lake titicaca there are net inputs due to precipitation on the lake surface in addition to the contributions of the tributaries keywords lake titicaca lake poopó lake level changes irrigation management catchment modeling water balance 1 introduction many lakes around the world have experienced a reduction in their water levels wurtsbaugh et al 2017 with consequences for the loss of the ecosystem services they provide locally and regionally such as fisheries water regulation biodiversity drinking water nutrient and sediment processing and recreation schallenberg et al 2013 lakes are sensitive to variations in inflows precipitation and evaporation setegn et al 2011 water withdrawals for different uses alter the temporal regime of lake inflows and levels wurtsbaugh et al 2017 and therefore outflows also land use change modifies the regulatory capacity of the contributing areas of lakes guo et al 2008 with the effects of climate change these could worsen with further reductions in inflows changes in the temporal regime of precipitation and increased evaporation due to higher temperatures research in recent years has paid much attention to separating the relative contributions of climate impacts and human intervention to changing hydrological conditions dey and mishra 2017 wang 2014 many research approaches have been proposed which according to dey and mishra 2017 can be described as i hydrological modeling under natural and impacted conditions li et al 2009 ii experimental approaches that are based on observations and analysis of temporal trends through comparisons across pairs of basins iii conceptual approaches that include applications of budyko s hypothesis jiang et al 2015 and the tomer schilling framework tomer and schilling 2009 and iv analytics that include climate elasticity yang and yang 2011 and hydrological sensitivity methods li et al 2012 in the case of lakes in addition to hydrological alterations studies pay attention to the physical and biological changes that climate and human activities can generate with these water bodies for example the role of climate in the decline of three lakes in australia was analyzed by jones et al 2001 based on a hydrological modeling approach determining that climate change was the main driver for the decline in water levels schulz et al 2020 studied the role of irrigation and climate in the decline of lake urmia water levels using an approach based on the quantification of water balance components the results showed that the variation of lake volume would have been mainly caused by changes in climatic conditions in the central andes of south america lakes titicaca and poopó have experienced extreme water level fluctuations pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 ronchail et al 2014 these lakes are connected by the desaguadero river and are key features of the most important hydrological system of the peruvian bolivian altiplano this system is characterized by a semi arid climate where 70 of the total annual precipitation is concentrated in the austral summer canedo rosso et al 2019 garreaud et al 2003 it is also characterized by extreme interannual climate variability fluctuating between periods of drought and heavy precipitation garreaud and aceituno 2001 historical records of lake titicaca s water levels show that it has a range of variation of 5 m with the lowest levels occurring in 1944 and the highest in 1986 ronchail et al 2014 these fluctuations have primarily been attributed to climate variability where repeated el niño events led to a dramatic reduction in water levels martin et al 1993 these fluctuations also impact discharges to the desaguadero river and thus water levels in the downstream lake poopó which being shallow is very sensitive to climate variability and input from lake titicaca pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 in the last three decades lake poopó dried up in a few months in 1994 1995 and 2015 satgé et al 2017 the very low levels in the 1990s were attributed to el niño events pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 while what happened in 2015 was primarily attributed to agricultural activity satgé et al 2017 uncertainty remains however as to the specific causes of fluctuating levels in both lakes previous studies using remote sensing approaches focused on investigating the causes of the shrinking of lake poopó suggest an increase in actual evapotranspiration in agricultural areas over the last two decades satgé et al 2017 torres batlló et al 2020 due to a significant increase in the extent of quinoa cultivation since 2001 although it cannot be considered as the only driver of regional water scarcity and desertification satgé et al 2019 as other crops could also be increasing the increase in cropland area may also result in increased water withdrawals for irrigation however none of the previous studies have quantified the impact of irrigation water withdrawals on the temporal regime of flows due to the lack of information regarding historical irrigation withdrawals irrigation systems in the region are self managed according to acquired use rights and uses and customs that establish a relationship between water management and local governance bustamante and vega 2006 our main objective in the study is to quantify the distinct role that irrigation and climate variability have had in the observed range of fluctuation in water levels in lakes titicaca and poopó to achieve this main objective we formulated the following research questions i at the basin scale what are the potential magnitudes and temporal patterns of irrigation withdrawals ii what is the impact of withdrawals on the temporal regime of contributing river flows to the lakes and iii what is the relative contribution of irrigation and climate to the fluctuation of water levels to answer these research questions we set the following specific objectives i to implement a semi distributed water balance model that allows for the joint simulation of runoff from contributing basins irrigation management and lake water levels ii to quantify and analyze the temporal patterns of irrigation and the impact it generates on the temporal flow regime and iii to estimate the relative contribution of irrigation and climate to the observed range of fluctuating lake water levels the approach used for this study is based on hydrological modelling for the historical period 1980 2015 with a monthly time step 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area includes the titicaca and poopó lake basins fig 1 whose surface area is 110 969 km2 44 of which lies in peru 55 in bolivia and 1 in chile this geographical space includes important cities like el alto oruro puno and juliaca the urban and rural population in 2012 was approximately 3 million people the relief is a plateau within the central andes formed by coalescent sedimentary basins hippe et al 2012 the basin can be subdivided into four sub basins titicaca mauri desaguadero and poopó the first is a bi national sub basin and the second is a tri national one although the chilean portion is very small lake titicaca is classified as the largest freshwater lake in south america and the highest of the world s great lakes at 3 812 m above sea level according to the bathymetry of the lake for an elevation of 3 810 m the lake area is 8399 km2 and a volume of 932 km3 intecsa et al 1993 according to a study conducted for the year 2002 the area of lake poopó is 3 010 km2 the maximum depth is 2 37 m and the volume is 3 4 km3 pillco zolá and bengtsson 2007 the study area exhibits a semiarid climate the interannual variability of precipitation in the region is related to the el niño southern oscillation enso where the warm phase el niño conditions tend to be dry while the cold phase la niña is associated with wet conditions in the altiplano garreaud et al 2003 garreaud and aceituno 2001 in addition to enso variability would also be influenced by the pacific decadal oscillation garreaud et al 2009 north atlantic oscillation nao antarctic meridional mode amm and atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo canedo rosso et al 2019 at the seasonal level the rainy season starts in december and ends in march and concentrates 70 of annual precipitation within these months roche et al 1992 the onset of rainy conditions is related to the southward inflection of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the bolivian high which is a warm core anticyclone established on the altiplano garreaud et al 2003 lenters and cook 1997 in the dry season may to august 5 of the annual precipitation occurs with the remaining 25 coming in the transition season april september to november roche et al 1992 the spatial distribution of precipitation follows a decreasing pattern along a north south direction where the northern region receives approximately three times more precipitation than the southern region andrade et al 2018 in the central and southern regions of the basin there is also secondary east to west decreasing trend the spatial distribution of annual precipitation in the period 1980 2010 varies between 300 and 1400 mm andrade et al 2018 the highest values are recorded over lake titicaca as observed by roche et al 1992 precipitation is influenced by the lake as a result of its large surface area and significant volume that allows the absorption of solar radiation and induces higher water temperatures than those observed in surrounding areas this would favor convection and generate more frequent storms over the lake mainly towards the center where annual values exceed 1000 mm 2 2 water balance model the bolivian ministry of environment and water has developed water balance studies using weap yates et al 2005 in national and transnational basins based on this experience a methodology guide was developed for modeling using this tool ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2016 in this study we applied weap because it allows us to dynamically simulate the hydrology irrigation management and volume variations of the primary lakes in addition it offers the possibility of exploring different scenarios to better assess the impact of climate variability and irrigation management on lake level fluctuations 2 2 1 hydrological model catchment runoff was modeled with weap s soil moisture model smm yates et al 2005 which is a semi distributed representation of hydrology smm is a one dimensional model which represents the notion of water transfer between two buckets capturing the dynamics between surface runoff infiltration evapotranspiration interflow and base flow the model is forced by climatic data that includes precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours of which the last four are used to estimate reference evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith equation modified for a standardized grass cultivation of 0 12 m height and with a surface resistance of 69 s m maidment 1993 in the smm crop water demand is determined by the evapotranspiration of the reference crop the crop coefficient kc and an irrigation threshold corresponding to the volumetric percentage of soil moisture below which irrigation should occur losses associated with conveyance and application of irrigation water are also considered this method has been successfully applied in other studies to determine crop water demand using smm joyce et al 2011 mehta et al 2013 2 2 2 lake water balance model the water balance in the lakes was modeled with weap s reservoir object and its associated routines where water level variation can be expressed according to the following equation 1 d h d t p e q i n q g w n e t q o u t a l a k e h where h is the lake level t is the time p e is expressed as net evaporation precipitation minus evaporation q i n and q o u t are surface water inflows and outflows q g w n e t is the net groundwater exchange with the lake and a l a k e is the lake area this area changes dynamically at each time step according to the bathymetry of the lakes evaporation was calculated by the penman method penman and keen 1948 which is more practical considering the meteorological data available in the region pillco zolá et al 2019 penman s equation as given in kebede et al 2006 is 2 e δ k l γ k e ρ w λ v v a e a 1 w a ρ w λ v δ γ 1000 where e is the free evaporation in mm day for the modeling it was summed to a monthly time step δ is the slope of the vapor saturation pressure curve in kpa k k and l are net short wave radiation and net long wave radiation in mj m2 d γ is a psychometric constant in kpa c k e is a coefficient that reflects the vertical transport efficiency ρ w is the water density 1000 kg m3 λ v is the latent heat of water vaporization in mj kg v a is the wind speed in m day e a is the saturation vapor pressure in kpa and w a is the relative humidity the terms k allen et al 1998 and l dingman 1994 were estimated using the following equations 3 k 1 α a s b s n n r a 4 l ε w ε a t σ t a 273 15 4 ε w σ t s 273 15 4 where r a is the extraterrestrial solar radiation mj m2 d n is the actual length of sunshine hours and n is potential sunshine hours the regression constant a s and b s were defined as 0 25 and 0 5 allen et al 1998 respectively also α is the albedo and σ is stefan boltzmann s constant 4 903 10 9 mj m² d k4 the terms t a and t s are the mean air temperature and evaporation surface temperature in c respectively due to the limitations in the observed data t s was estimated as t a δ t and δ t was calculated with data from previous studies carmouze 1992 as the difference between evaporation surface temperature and air temperature the water surface emissivity ε w was defined as 0 95 and finally ε a t is the effective emissivity of the atmosphere the q i n is modeled surface runoff by the smm and the q g w n e t is not considered significant because net groundwater exchange with the lake is minimal over time in fact previous studies have found that losses due to infiltration in lake titicaca would only represent only 2 of total losses carmouze and aquize jaen 1981 in the poopó lake previous studies which we used as a reference point also ignored q g w n e t pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 in weap a reservoir which is the model object used to model fluctuations within laves is divided into four storage areas fig 2 the flood control and conservation zone were used to simulate the impact of release work operations on the lake water levels the top of conservation equals the river level downstream of the lake as this impacts the operation of the release works the discharge when storage rises into the flood zone is a function of the maximum hydraulic outflow mho variable which depends on the lake water level and the hydraulic capacity of the release works and the downstream river in lake titicaca the mho was defined based on the potential function q o u t a h b where a and b are calibrated constants 2 3 input data 2 3 1 catchments delimitation the catchments were delimited with the weap catchment delineation mode application yates et al 2005 using the hydrosheds digital elevation model lehner et al 2008 at a spatial resolution of 15 arcseconds the criteria used for the basin subdivision were sub basins titicaca mauri desaguadero y poopó flow measurement stations fig 1 confluence of major rivers and lake outflow points 2 3 2 climate data the climate data was collected from the study water balance of bolivia ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2018 which contains a database of the main climate variables at a daily temporal resolution and for the historical hydrological horizon 1980 81 2015 16 for precipitation and temperature there is a gridded product in netcdf format network common data form at a spatial resolution of 0 05 wickel et al 2019 generated with the gridded meteorological ensemble tool gmet algorithm clark and slater 2006 newman et al 2015 with the catchment delineation mode application the weap model can read precipitation and temperature data from a gridded data set in netcdf format with respect to other meteorological variables relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours the data is limited and few stations have continuous and complete records in this case grids were generated with the inverse distance weighted method idw from multiannual monthly average observed records 2 3 3 land cover and irrigable area the national maps of bolivia ministerio de desarrollo rural y tierras 2010 and peru ministerio del ambiente 2015 were used to define vegetation coverage both maps have a scale of 1 100 000 but with different classification systems for the parameterization of the smm the vegetation cover classes of each map were grouped into the following categories andean forest shrublands wetlands pastures dispersed vegetation bare soil agriculture water bodies snow and urban area in both the bolivia and peru land cover maps the agriculture category does not distinguish between irrigated and rainfed agriculture area to estimate the agricultural area under irrigation an approach has been adopted based on data from the bolivian irrigation system inventory ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2012 and previous studies in the peru autoridad nacional del agua 2010 2009 instituto nacional de recursos naturales 2008 the bolivian irrigation system inventory database contains information on two types of area which are irrigable area and irrigated area the irrigable area is defined as the area with agricultural vocation within the area of influence of the irrigation system and that can eventually receive irrigation i e it is a physical area of permanent character apa proagro giz 2011 the irrigated area is defined as the area that receives irrigation at least once in an agricultural cycle within the area of influence of the irrigation system and is a function of water availability and its management apa proagro giz 2011 a limitation of the inventory of irrigation systems is that it does not have a map that spatially shows the areas however it contains geographic coordinates that give a point reference to the location of each irrigation system since weap is not a distributed model this limitation does not represent an impediment to modeling based on these considerations the percentage of the agricultural area that can potentially receive irrigation was estimated as p a i r r a r a a g 100 where a r is the irrigable area in each catchment obtained from the inventory of irrigation systems and a a g is the agricultural area in a catchment obtained from the land cover map the a r for the contributing area of peru was obtained from previous studies in lake titicaca contributing basins autoridad nacional del agua 2010 2009 instituto nacional de recursos naturales 2008 an assumption of this study is that the p a i r r does not vary in the modeling period 1980 2015 recall that the irrigable area is a permanent physical area and only under very favorable conditions of climate and water availability could the irrigated area be equal to the irrigable area in practice the irrigated area is always less than the irrigable area for example according to the inventory the irrigable area is about 108 705 ha and the irrigated area about 50 428 ha 46 irrigation coverage therefore the new projects to improve and develop the irrigation systems aim to reduce the gap between the irrigable area and the irrigated area another assumption to consider is that the land cover map was used for the entire historical modeling period thus it was assumed that existing changes in the watershed are not of considerable magnitude to support this assumption a multi temporal land cover analysis was performed using the european space agency climate change initiative land cover esa cci lc global dataset at a spatial resolution of 300 m esa 2017 the analysis was performed for the available period from 1992 2015 according to the results 3 7 4106 km2 of the watershed area has experienced land cover changes in the mentioned period fig 3 the same figure shows that between 1992 and 2000 the change was 1 1 up to 2005 the cumulative change was 2 2 and up to 2010 it was 2 9 in terms of change in land cover types fig 4 shows the cumulative change for each type the results show that the type of land cover that has increased the most is settlements between 1992 and 2015 settlements have increased by 43 the same figure shows a still increasing trend the agricultural area has increased by approximately 8 of which 5 happened in the years 2000 2008 and 2012 3 in the remaining years from 2012 onwards an almost constant line of change is shown due to the increase of the mentioned types and others forests and grasslands the coverage of bare sparse vegetation has been reduced in the case of forest there is an abrupt change in 1999 and then it remains constant this may be associated with problems in the classification of small areas of andean forests 2 3 4 irrigation water demand the data collected to estimate irrigation water demand were predominant crops agricultural calendar crop coefficient kc and irrigable area the predominant crops and agricultural calendar data were obtained from the bolivian national agricultural census database instituto nacional de estadística 2015 and previous studies in watersheds in peru autoridad nacional del agua 2010 2009 instituto nacional de recursos naturales 2008 for the kc of each crop the database of the programa nacional de riego 2002 was adopted the irrigable area has already been described in section 2 3 3 in weap irrigation withdrawals can be restricted by two possibilities i a maximum volume mv that can be associated with physical or contractual capacity constraints and ii a percentage of water demand pwd for this study we have adopted the pwd 2 3 5 measured flows for the calibration of the smm measured flows processed by previous studies were collected ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2018 the peruvian measurement stations used in the analysis were puente ramis puente huancané puente maravillas and puente ilave fig 1 the bolivian stations are escoma achacachi desaguadero calacoto mauri calacoto tambillo ulloma and chuquiña fig 1 the data from the stations in peru covers the period 1980 1998 and those in bolivia cover 1980 2012 2 3 6 bathymetry and water levels the bathymetry of lake titicaca was obtained from the lake titicaca binational autonomous authority alt and that of the poopó from previous studies pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 pillco zolá and bengtsson 2007 in titicaca measured water levels for the modeling period 1980 2015 are also available which were used in the calibration process in poopó there are no measured lake level data only estimated data based on remote sensing products arsen et al 2014 available on the hydroweb website http hydroweb theia land fr 2 4 model calibration the smm model was calibrated 1980 1998 and validated 1999 2015 at the flow measurement stations mentioned in section 2 3 5 the initial parameters of the smm were defined with reference values of the bolivian water balance guide ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2016 these values were manually adjusted to achieve a good goodness of fit using measures typical in hydrology such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias in terms of calibration sequence we first calibrated the hydrometric stations located on the lake titicaca tributaries puente ramis puente ilave puente huancané escoma achacachi and tambillo second the water levels modeled in lake titicaca were calibrated by adjusting the constants of the mho function a and b lake discharge flows were verified at the desaguadero calacoto and ulloma stations third calibration of the catchments was performed with measurement at the chuquiña station finally the results of the modeling in lake poopó were compared with water levels estimated by previous studies based on water balance methods pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 and remote sensing data arsen et al 2014 the smm calibration process included adjusting the irrigation threshold and the pwd as a proxy for the specific unknown irrigation management practices carried out in the system 2 5 approach to quantify the impact of irrigation and climate variability the proposed approach to estimating impacts from climate variability and irrigation management can be formulated mathematically as 5 δ h t δ h c δ h i r r h m a x t h m i n t 6 δ h c h m a x c h m i n c 7 δ h i r r δ h t δ h c 8 c c δ h c δ h t 100 9 c i r r δ h i r r δ h t 100 where δ h t is the range of total lake fluctuation between the maximum water level h m a x t and the minimum water level h m i n t during the entire modeling period the terms δ h c and δ h i r r are the range of fluctuation attributed to climate variability and irrigation respectively also h m a x c and h m i n c are the maximum and minimum water levels in the no irrigation scenario c c is the relative contribution of climate variability to lake level fluctuations and c i r r is the fluctuation attributed to irrigation to estimate the maximum and minimum water level for each case model runs were made for the following scenarios i with irrigation scenario that corresponds to the irrigation area and calibrated extractions for the historical period with this we estimated h m a x t and h m i n t ii without irrigation scenario where no extractions are modeled therefore approximating input flow under natural condition with the results of the simulated water levels used to estimate h m a x c and h m i n c 3 results 3 1 model performance according to the measures of goodness of fit and criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2015 the model for the calibration period performs between satisfactory and very good table 1 fig 5 shows a good correspondence between observed and simulated flows the smm performance obtained is also reflected in the simulation of water levels where there is a very good correspondence between observed and simulated values table 1 and fig 6 however between 1993 and 1998 the model overestimates lake levels by as much as 0 98 m although it shows a seasonal and interannual pattern very similar to that observed except in 1993 which has a lingering effect on model performance in subsequent years the simulated water levels for lake poopó compared to the water levels estimated by pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 show a good correspondence in the validation period 1999 2015 in some stations the yield measured by nse is 0 5 table 1 in the case of desaguadero calacoto and ulloma there is an underestimation of the simulated flows fig 5 which is directly related to the discharge flows from lake titicaca since between 2003 2007 there is an underestimation of the simulated water levels of up to 0 94 m fig 6 which also results in an underestimation of the discharge flows in lake poopó for the validation period there are data generated by arsen et al 2014 the simulated levels compared to that data source show a good correspondence fig 6 likewise goodness of fit measures were estimated for a more recent data set 2008 2015 table 1 this in order to verify the performance of the model given that for this period the same pwd value obtained in the calibration period is maintained assuming that there was a significant increase in irrigation withdrawals the model should have a very low performance with a substantial overestimation of the simulated flows and water levels table 1 shows that in puente ramis and puente huancane there is a 16 overestimation of the simulated flows likewise from the good correspondence between the simulated and observed water levels we can also affirm that the possible increase in irrigation withdrawals has not been of significant magnitude 3 2 water balance in sub basins the annual water balance results for the period studied are shown in table 2 precipitation p in the basin is 565 mm the wettest sub basin is titicaca and the driest is mauri the potential evapotranspiration pet presents a spatial pattern where there is an increase in a north south direction which is determined by the spatial and temporal patterns of the meteorological variables used for the application of the penman monteith method actual evapotranspiration et ranges between 79 and 93 of precipitation the comparison between pet and et shows the semi arid conditions of the sub basins since the magnitude of the deficit is considerable simulated irrigation irr varies between 0 3 and 8 8 mm per year regarding the monthly results table 3 between 71 and 84 of the precipitation is concentrated in the rainy season the rainiest month is january and the driest month is july the highest values of pet are observed in october and november and the lowest in june and july high pet is mainly due to high values of insolation while low pet is related to low temperatures the high values of et occur in the rainy season where the average deficit reaches 40 and in some months of the dry season june november and in the transition seasons the deficit rises to 84 these deficit months coincide with the sowing and germination season of agricultural crops that likely require irrigation irrigation is mainly concentrated between the months of june and november dry season and transition and in absolute terms represents between 67 and 91 of the total annual irrigation in the rainy season irrigation represents between 7 and 28 of the total annual irrigation in the transition from the rainy to the dry season april irrigation represents between 2 and 6 the seasonal patterns of runoff in the sub basins are similar to those of precipitation 3 3 water balance of the lakes the annual free evaporation estimated with the penman method in the titicaca and poopó lakes is 1646 and 1777 mm respectively on a monthly scale the lowest value occurs in june and the highest in november regarding precipitation in titicaca it is approximately 826 mm and in poopó it is 350 mm the seasonal precipitation pattern is similar to that observed in the contributing sub basins but there are differences in the magnitudes especially in titicaca with respect to the inflows in titicaca the annual contribution of the tributaries is 878 mm 233 m3 s of which 68 occurs during the rainy season 13 in the second transition season april 14 in the dry season and 5 in the first transition season september to november in january and february there are net evaporation inputs fig 7 that is precipitation is higher than evaporation in poopó the annual inflow is 1585 mm 80 m3 s with 55 of total annual inflow occurring in the rainy season 13 in the second transition season 24 in the dry season and 8 in the first transition season the annual flow at the chuquiña station is 63 m3 s so the contribution from the desaguadero river represents 79 of the total inflow to the poopó in this lake evaporation in all months is greater than precipitation so the net evaporation in fig 7 in all months is an output of the water balance regarding the outflows in titicaca the annual discharge flow to the downstream river system is 86 mm 23 m3 s in the dry season 45 of the discharges occur in the rainy season 25 and the remaining 30 in the transition seasons the net evaporation loss is 820 mm 213 m3 s in the poopó the modeled discharges to the laka jawuira river occur only between 1984 and 1988 which were not directly corroborated because no measurements were available the annual net evaporation rate is 1427 mm 66 m3 s of which 42 occurs in the transition season 0 3 in the dry season and 57 7 in the wet season increases in water levels occur in the rainy season fig 7 and consequently the highest levels occur in march and april the mann kendall kendall 1948 mann 1945 test was used to analyze the monotonic trend of the main components of the water balance in the lakes and the basin the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 was used to calculate the magnitude of the trends based on the results shown in table 4 and considering p 0 05 as the significance level the annual evaporation in lake poopó increased significantly this can be directly associated to the increase in the mean annual temperature which at the basin level is also significant this annual trend is mainly due to the significant increase in mean temperature during the rainy season the inflows into lake poopó during the dry season decreased significantly this may be associated with the combined effect of changes in the basin and discharges from lake titicaca taking p 0 1 as the significance level there is a trend of increased evaporation in lake poopó in the three rainfall seasons in lake titicaca there are no significant changes for both significance levels considered in its water balance components 3 4 impact of irrigation on the temporal regime of flows the extractions for irrigation alter the temporal regime of the inflows of the lakes to analyze these changes the flow duration curves of inflows for the with irrigation qai and without irrigation qni scenarios were constructed fig 8 the relative change in flow rate at each percentile was calculated as qai qni qni the results for high flows i e flows exceeded 5 of the time in titicaca show no change with irrigation while in poopó the reduction is 10 regarding the medium flows ie flows that exceed 50 of the time in titicaca they decrease by 19 and in poopó the reduction is 50 under with irrigation scenario regarding the minimum flows ie flows that exceed 95 of the time in titicaca declines reached 89 and in poopó all low flow conditions ceased 3 5 impacts on water level fluctuation over the studied historical period the modeled water levels in titicaca presented a range of variation of 4 m table 5 this fluctuation corresponds to the combined effect of climate variability and irrigation the contribution of climate variability and irrigation management on lake level fluctuations is estimated with eqs 8 and 9 respectively in this way model results suggest that 82 5 3 3 m of the fluctuation is attributed to climatic variability and the remaining 17 5 0 7 m is caused by irrigation withdrawals in the case of lake poopó the range of variation caused by both climate and irrigation is 2 3 m the climatic variability explains 65 2 1 5 m with the remaining 34 8 0 8 m by irrigation in comparison to lake titicaca the relative contribution of irrigation to the fluctuation of water levels is almost double lake poopó being shallow is instead very sensitive to changes in the components of the water balance and mainly to inflows from the titicaca mauri and desaguadero sub basins representing 79 of total inflows 4 discussion 4 1 implications of the findings the low levels in lake poopó in some years in the last decade are often attributed to the increase in agricultural areas and evapotranspiration satgé et al 2019 2017 this may also be associated with an increase in irrigation however this hypothesis was not corroborated by a system wide water balance our study by modeling the key components of the water balance has determined that the range of fluctuation in water levels is largely controlled by climate variability table 5 lakes in the past have already had lower levels than those observed in the last four decades measurements in lake titicaca show that the lowest levels occurred in 1944 ronchail et al 2014 as a result of continuous years of el niño events martin et al 1993 low levels in lake poopó in the 1960s 1980s and 1990s were also associated with el niño pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 dry years caused by el niño have direct and substantial effects on lake water levels also according to the trends of some components of the water balance of lake poopó evaporation has increased due to the increase in temperature table 4 this contributes unfavorably to the reduction of lake water levels according to the database of the main irrigation investment programs in bolivia such as mi riego and mi agua between 2011 and 2017 the incremental area of irrigated area was 9708 ha fig 9 considering only the mi agua program between 2011 and 2015 the incremental area of irrigated area was 6779 ha which represents approximately 6 of the irrigable area in the bolivian territory these data support that the increase in irrigated area was not of significant magnitude the increase in some crops such as quinoa may be contributing to water scarcity although much of this production is rain fed and adapted to semi arid conditions deficit irrigation application can help ensure stable yields geerts et al 2009 thus depending on the degree deficit irrigation is implemented agriculture can be a factor contributing to the process of water scarcity in the region satgé et al 2019 nonetheless although the magnitude of the contribution of irrigation to water levels is small it aggravates the unfavorable conditions generated by the climate the consequences are more alarming in lake poopó as it is shallow and highly dependent on contributions from lake titicaca in terms of area fluctuation range irrigation controls 52 of its variation in dry years the demand for water increases and therefore irrigation this has led to very low levels eventually leading to the lake drying out completely in consecutive dry years in lake titicaca water levels decrease drastically and therefore discharge into the desaguadero river is reduced between 1997 and 1998 in some months the water level was below the discharge level to the desaguadero river it is important to note that the agricultural calendar in the region is adapted to the weather conditions the interval from the flowering stage to the maturity of the fruit coincides with the rainy season agricultural production in the dry season is limited to only a few forage crops such as alfalfa therefore irrigation extractions are mostly concentrated in the dry season and the first transition season table 3 in some months of the dry season june and july irrigation is necessary to prepare the soil for planting that occurs between july and october in the transition season september to november initial crop development depends mostly on irrigation in these months of greater water demand the available and accessible flow in the rivers is used to the maximum the base flow in these months represents between 60 and 80 of the total flow according to the results shown in fig 8 they show that the impact of irrigation on low flow is very high the margin for new uses is very low in the middle flow range the effect is greater in poopó due to the reduction of discharges from lake titicaca and also to drier conditions in the desaguadero mauri and poopó sub basins linked to a greater demand for water the same reasons explain the reduction in the maximum input flows in poopó 4 2 limitations of the water balance model the model is based on climatic and hydrological data measured in the region which have limitations in terms of temporal and spatial records these limitations generate uncertainties not only due to the input data but also associated with intrinsic aspects of the smm and some assumptions in some components of the water balance regarding precipitation and temperature data in this study we have used the gridded gmet product from bolivia generated with the available observed data to the north of the basin there is a higher density of observation stations while to the south the data are very limited which generates uncertainties with respect to the input data likewise in lake titicaca there is an influence of the lake itself on precipitation and it is presumed that precipitation could be underestimated due to the few observation stations in the lake another limitation related to input data in our study is the lack of temporal resolution of the meteorological data the evaporation estimated with monthly average values may differ from the daily ones as observed by pillco zolá et al 2019 also using monthly average data on some meteorological variables wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours for the entire period studied may not adequately capture the interannual variability of evaporation the same considerations apply to reference evapotranspiration as far as measured flows are concerned our study only considered data available up to 2012 except for the mauri calacoto station up to 2015 then in most of the gauging stations it was not possible to verify the performance of the smm in the period 2013 2015 although the performance evaluated with the water levels of lake titicaca indicate a good performance of the model in general for the case of lake poopó only compared with previous studies there are no measurements of water levels as such with respect to groundwater modeling in this study groundwater extractions for different uses such as irrigation human consumption and others were not considered instead only the available flow in rivers is considered in the water demand and supply model for irrigation although major cities such as oruro gómez et al 2016 and el alto depend on groundwater supply and withdrawals are almost constant there is no historical data on volumes of irrigation water extraction since most irrigation systems are self managed by the communities themselves bustamante and vega 2006 according to the inventory of irrigation systems ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2012 2 of the irrigable area of irrigation systems in the territory corresponding to bolivia have groundwater as a source this value may have increased since the year of the inventory 2012 the approach adopted to estimate the irrigable area was based on data from the bolivian irrigation system inventory and previous studies in peru with this area the water demand was determined with the smm the proportion of water demand that receives supply was calibrated pwd in the basin irrigation is self managed by each community or association of irrigation systems and therefore there are no measurements of irrigation withdrawals future research could advance in determining the temporal evolution of the irrigated area based on remote sensing images and validated with field work 5 conclusions in this article we have presented a hydrological modeling approach to analyze and quantify the impact of irrigation management and climate variability on lake water level fluctuations in lake titicaca and lake poopó the tool and the modeling approach employed allowed for the dynamic simulation of the catchment hydrology including irrigation management and its interconnection with the water balance of the lakes the modeling using the somewhat limited but best data available has allowed us to fill the information gaps with novel analysis that can help in the planning of water and ecosystem management in these lakes the results suggest that the fluctuation is largely controlled by climate variability in lake titicaca climate variability explains about 80 of the fluctuation range while the remaining 20 corresponds to irrigation in lake poopó the role of climate variability also prevails with a contribution of about 65 with the remaining 35 attributed to irrigation management since lake poopó is shallow irrigation controls about 52 of the fluctuation range of its area these results represent a substantial advance in knowledge about the hydrological functioning of lakes in relation to the dynamics of their contributing watersheds the limitations of the model used in this study offer opportunities for future research the model does not consider the scale of operation and self management of irrigation systems based on usos y costumbres uses and customs within these basins nor does it consider the temporal evolution of the irrigable area the incorporation of these features in addition to other sources of water supply such as small reservoirs and groundwater in the modeling tool could provide a more resolved and detailed assessment of the regional irrigation system in future work with this tool different management options can thus be evaluated at the basin scale to inform policies for the sustainability of water resources management actions in terms of their ability to maintain lake water levels to restore and or conserve their unique ecosystem services this study provides an opportunity for strategic planning around irrigation management in the altiplano and a point of reference for other similar studies both in the andes and globally the dominance of climatic variability in causing lake level fluctuations in both lake poopó and lake titicaca highlights the vulnerability of the region and local irrigation dependent agriculture and livelihoods to changes in precipitation patterns so the use of tools such as the one developed in this study in strategic planning processes related to regional water resources will make it possible to make comprehensive assessments and to recognize the interconnectedness of the impacts of management options that will allow for agricultural development without generating negative impacts on the lakes funding this work was supported by the bolivian ministry of environment and water through the program mas inversión para riego ucep mi riego 239 2016 credit authorship

8170,study region the catchment area of lakes titicaca and poopó is located in the peruvian bolivian altiplano in the central andes of south america study focus we quantified the impact of irrigation and climate variability on the range of fluctuation of water levels in lakes titicaca and poopó by applying the weap model to dynamically represents the hydrology of the catchment area irrigation and water storage in the lakes the model is implemented with observed climate datasets for the region processed at a monthly time step for the historical period 1980 2015 new hydrological insights for the region fluctuations in water levels are mainly controlled by climate variability irrigation withdrawals aggravate unfavorable conditions thus amplifying water level fluctuations in lake titicaca the climate explains about 80 of the fluctuation range and the remaining 20 is due to irrigation in lake poopó the role of climate also prevails with a contribution of about 65 while the remaining 35 is attributed to irrigation the difference in the relative contribution of irrigation between the lakes is due to the fact that the net inputs in lake poopó depend mostly on regional flows and on the contributions of lake titicaca while in the much larger lake titicaca there are net inputs due to precipitation on the lake surface in addition to the contributions of the tributaries keywords lake titicaca lake poopó lake level changes irrigation management catchment modeling water balance 1 introduction many lakes around the world have experienced a reduction in their water levels wurtsbaugh et al 2017 with consequences for the loss of the ecosystem services they provide locally and regionally such as fisheries water regulation biodiversity drinking water nutrient and sediment processing and recreation schallenberg et al 2013 lakes are sensitive to variations in inflows precipitation and evaporation setegn et al 2011 water withdrawals for different uses alter the temporal regime of lake inflows and levels wurtsbaugh et al 2017 and therefore outflows also land use change modifies the regulatory capacity of the contributing areas of lakes guo et al 2008 with the effects of climate change these could worsen with further reductions in inflows changes in the temporal regime of precipitation and increased evaporation due to higher temperatures research in recent years has paid much attention to separating the relative contributions of climate impacts and human intervention to changing hydrological conditions dey and mishra 2017 wang 2014 many research approaches have been proposed which according to dey and mishra 2017 can be described as i hydrological modeling under natural and impacted conditions li et al 2009 ii experimental approaches that are based on observations and analysis of temporal trends through comparisons across pairs of basins iii conceptual approaches that include applications of budyko s hypothesis jiang et al 2015 and the tomer schilling framework tomer and schilling 2009 and iv analytics that include climate elasticity yang and yang 2011 and hydrological sensitivity methods li et al 2012 in the case of lakes in addition to hydrological alterations studies pay attention to the physical and biological changes that climate and human activities can generate with these water bodies for example the role of climate in the decline of three lakes in australia was analyzed by jones et al 2001 based on a hydrological modeling approach determining that climate change was the main driver for the decline in water levels schulz et al 2020 studied the role of irrigation and climate in the decline of lake urmia water levels using an approach based on the quantification of water balance components the results showed that the variation of lake volume would have been mainly caused by changes in climatic conditions in the central andes of south america lakes titicaca and poopó have experienced extreme water level fluctuations pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 ronchail et al 2014 these lakes are connected by the desaguadero river and are key features of the most important hydrological system of the peruvian bolivian altiplano this system is characterized by a semi arid climate where 70 of the total annual precipitation is concentrated in the austral summer canedo rosso et al 2019 garreaud et al 2003 it is also characterized by extreme interannual climate variability fluctuating between periods of drought and heavy precipitation garreaud and aceituno 2001 historical records of lake titicaca s water levels show that it has a range of variation of 5 m with the lowest levels occurring in 1944 and the highest in 1986 ronchail et al 2014 these fluctuations have primarily been attributed to climate variability where repeated el niño events led to a dramatic reduction in water levels martin et al 1993 these fluctuations also impact discharges to the desaguadero river and thus water levels in the downstream lake poopó which being shallow is very sensitive to climate variability and input from lake titicaca pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 in the last three decades lake poopó dried up in a few months in 1994 1995 and 2015 satgé et al 2017 the very low levels in the 1990s were attributed to el niño events pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 while what happened in 2015 was primarily attributed to agricultural activity satgé et al 2017 uncertainty remains however as to the specific causes of fluctuating levels in both lakes previous studies using remote sensing approaches focused on investigating the causes of the shrinking of lake poopó suggest an increase in actual evapotranspiration in agricultural areas over the last two decades satgé et al 2017 torres batlló et al 2020 due to a significant increase in the extent of quinoa cultivation since 2001 although it cannot be considered as the only driver of regional water scarcity and desertification satgé et al 2019 as other crops could also be increasing the increase in cropland area may also result in increased water withdrawals for irrigation however none of the previous studies have quantified the impact of irrigation water withdrawals on the temporal regime of flows due to the lack of information regarding historical irrigation withdrawals irrigation systems in the region are self managed according to acquired use rights and uses and customs that establish a relationship between water management and local governance bustamante and vega 2006 our main objective in the study is to quantify the distinct role that irrigation and climate variability have had in the observed range of fluctuation in water levels in lakes titicaca and poopó to achieve this main objective we formulated the following research questions i at the basin scale what are the potential magnitudes and temporal patterns of irrigation withdrawals ii what is the impact of withdrawals on the temporal regime of contributing river flows to the lakes and iii what is the relative contribution of irrigation and climate to the fluctuation of water levels to answer these research questions we set the following specific objectives i to implement a semi distributed water balance model that allows for the joint simulation of runoff from contributing basins irrigation management and lake water levels ii to quantify and analyze the temporal patterns of irrigation and the impact it generates on the temporal flow regime and iii to estimate the relative contribution of irrigation and climate to the observed range of fluctuating lake water levels the approach used for this study is based on hydrological modelling for the historical period 1980 2015 with a monthly time step 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area includes the titicaca and poopó lake basins fig 1 whose surface area is 110 969 km2 44 of which lies in peru 55 in bolivia and 1 in chile this geographical space includes important cities like el alto oruro puno and juliaca the urban and rural population in 2012 was approximately 3 million people the relief is a plateau within the central andes formed by coalescent sedimentary basins hippe et al 2012 the basin can be subdivided into four sub basins titicaca mauri desaguadero and poopó the first is a bi national sub basin and the second is a tri national one although the chilean portion is very small lake titicaca is classified as the largest freshwater lake in south america and the highest of the world s great lakes at 3 812 m above sea level according to the bathymetry of the lake for an elevation of 3 810 m the lake area is 8399 km2 and a volume of 932 km3 intecsa et al 1993 according to a study conducted for the year 2002 the area of lake poopó is 3 010 km2 the maximum depth is 2 37 m and the volume is 3 4 km3 pillco zolá and bengtsson 2007 the study area exhibits a semiarid climate the interannual variability of precipitation in the region is related to the el niño southern oscillation enso where the warm phase el niño conditions tend to be dry while the cold phase la niña is associated with wet conditions in the altiplano garreaud et al 2003 garreaud and aceituno 2001 in addition to enso variability would also be influenced by the pacific decadal oscillation garreaud et al 2009 north atlantic oscillation nao antarctic meridional mode amm and atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo canedo rosso et al 2019 at the seasonal level the rainy season starts in december and ends in march and concentrates 70 of annual precipitation within these months roche et al 1992 the onset of rainy conditions is related to the southward inflection of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the bolivian high which is a warm core anticyclone established on the altiplano garreaud et al 2003 lenters and cook 1997 in the dry season may to august 5 of the annual precipitation occurs with the remaining 25 coming in the transition season april september to november roche et al 1992 the spatial distribution of precipitation follows a decreasing pattern along a north south direction where the northern region receives approximately three times more precipitation than the southern region andrade et al 2018 in the central and southern regions of the basin there is also secondary east to west decreasing trend the spatial distribution of annual precipitation in the period 1980 2010 varies between 300 and 1400 mm andrade et al 2018 the highest values are recorded over lake titicaca as observed by roche et al 1992 precipitation is influenced by the lake as a result of its large surface area and significant volume that allows the absorption of solar radiation and induces higher water temperatures than those observed in surrounding areas this would favor convection and generate more frequent storms over the lake mainly towards the center where annual values exceed 1000 mm 2 2 water balance model the bolivian ministry of environment and water has developed water balance studies using weap yates et al 2005 in national and transnational basins based on this experience a methodology guide was developed for modeling using this tool ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2016 in this study we applied weap because it allows us to dynamically simulate the hydrology irrigation management and volume variations of the primary lakes in addition it offers the possibility of exploring different scenarios to better assess the impact of climate variability and irrigation management on lake level fluctuations 2 2 1 hydrological model catchment runoff was modeled with weap s soil moisture model smm yates et al 2005 which is a semi distributed representation of hydrology smm is a one dimensional model which represents the notion of water transfer between two buckets capturing the dynamics between surface runoff infiltration evapotranspiration interflow and base flow the model is forced by climatic data that includes precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours of which the last four are used to estimate reference evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith equation modified for a standardized grass cultivation of 0 12 m height and with a surface resistance of 69 s m maidment 1993 in the smm crop water demand is determined by the evapotranspiration of the reference crop the crop coefficient kc and an irrigation threshold corresponding to the volumetric percentage of soil moisture below which irrigation should occur losses associated with conveyance and application of irrigation water are also considered this method has been successfully applied in other studies to determine crop water demand using smm joyce et al 2011 mehta et al 2013 2 2 2 lake water balance model the water balance in the lakes was modeled with weap s reservoir object and its associated routines where water level variation can be expressed according to the following equation 1 d h d t p e q i n q g w n e t q o u t a l a k e h where h is the lake level t is the time p e is expressed as net evaporation precipitation minus evaporation q i n and q o u t are surface water inflows and outflows q g w n e t is the net groundwater exchange with the lake and a l a k e is the lake area this area changes dynamically at each time step according to the bathymetry of the lakes evaporation was calculated by the penman method penman and keen 1948 which is more practical considering the meteorological data available in the region pillco zolá et al 2019 penman s equation as given in kebede et al 2006 is 2 e δ k l γ k e ρ w λ v v a e a 1 w a ρ w λ v δ γ 1000 where e is the free evaporation in mm day for the modeling it was summed to a monthly time step δ is the slope of the vapor saturation pressure curve in kpa k k and l are net short wave radiation and net long wave radiation in mj m2 d γ is a psychometric constant in kpa c k e is a coefficient that reflects the vertical transport efficiency ρ w is the water density 1000 kg m3 λ v is the latent heat of water vaporization in mj kg v a is the wind speed in m day e a is the saturation vapor pressure in kpa and w a is the relative humidity the terms k allen et al 1998 and l dingman 1994 were estimated using the following equations 3 k 1 α a s b s n n r a 4 l ε w ε a t σ t a 273 15 4 ε w σ t s 273 15 4 where r a is the extraterrestrial solar radiation mj m2 d n is the actual length of sunshine hours and n is potential sunshine hours the regression constant a s and b s were defined as 0 25 and 0 5 allen et al 1998 respectively also α is the albedo and σ is stefan boltzmann s constant 4 903 10 9 mj m² d k4 the terms t a and t s are the mean air temperature and evaporation surface temperature in c respectively due to the limitations in the observed data t s was estimated as t a δ t and δ t was calculated with data from previous studies carmouze 1992 as the difference between evaporation surface temperature and air temperature the water surface emissivity ε w was defined as 0 95 and finally ε a t is the effective emissivity of the atmosphere the q i n is modeled surface runoff by the smm and the q g w n e t is not considered significant because net groundwater exchange with the lake is minimal over time in fact previous studies have found that losses due to infiltration in lake titicaca would only represent only 2 of total losses carmouze and aquize jaen 1981 in the poopó lake previous studies which we used as a reference point also ignored q g w n e t pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 in weap a reservoir which is the model object used to model fluctuations within laves is divided into four storage areas fig 2 the flood control and conservation zone were used to simulate the impact of release work operations on the lake water levels the top of conservation equals the river level downstream of the lake as this impacts the operation of the release works the discharge when storage rises into the flood zone is a function of the maximum hydraulic outflow mho variable which depends on the lake water level and the hydraulic capacity of the release works and the downstream river in lake titicaca the mho was defined based on the potential function q o u t a h b where a and b are calibrated constants 2 3 input data 2 3 1 catchments delimitation the catchments were delimited with the weap catchment delineation mode application yates et al 2005 using the hydrosheds digital elevation model lehner et al 2008 at a spatial resolution of 15 arcseconds the criteria used for the basin subdivision were sub basins titicaca mauri desaguadero y poopó flow measurement stations fig 1 confluence of major rivers and lake outflow points 2 3 2 climate data the climate data was collected from the study water balance of bolivia ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2018 which contains a database of the main climate variables at a daily temporal resolution and for the historical hydrological horizon 1980 81 2015 16 for precipitation and temperature there is a gridded product in netcdf format network common data form at a spatial resolution of 0 05 wickel et al 2019 generated with the gridded meteorological ensemble tool gmet algorithm clark and slater 2006 newman et al 2015 with the catchment delineation mode application the weap model can read precipitation and temperature data from a gridded data set in netcdf format with respect to other meteorological variables relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours the data is limited and few stations have continuous and complete records in this case grids were generated with the inverse distance weighted method idw from multiannual monthly average observed records 2 3 3 land cover and irrigable area the national maps of bolivia ministerio de desarrollo rural y tierras 2010 and peru ministerio del ambiente 2015 were used to define vegetation coverage both maps have a scale of 1 100 000 but with different classification systems for the parameterization of the smm the vegetation cover classes of each map were grouped into the following categories andean forest shrublands wetlands pastures dispersed vegetation bare soil agriculture water bodies snow and urban area in both the bolivia and peru land cover maps the agriculture category does not distinguish between irrigated and rainfed agriculture area to estimate the agricultural area under irrigation an approach has been adopted based on data from the bolivian irrigation system inventory ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2012 and previous studies in the peru autoridad nacional del agua 2010 2009 instituto nacional de recursos naturales 2008 the bolivian irrigation system inventory database contains information on two types of area which are irrigable area and irrigated area the irrigable area is defined as the area with agricultural vocation within the area of influence of the irrigation system and that can eventually receive irrigation i e it is a physical area of permanent character apa proagro giz 2011 the irrigated area is defined as the area that receives irrigation at least once in an agricultural cycle within the area of influence of the irrigation system and is a function of water availability and its management apa proagro giz 2011 a limitation of the inventory of irrigation systems is that it does not have a map that spatially shows the areas however it contains geographic coordinates that give a point reference to the location of each irrigation system since weap is not a distributed model this limitation does not represent an impediment to modeling based on these considerations the percentage of the agricultural area that can potentially receive irrigation was estimated as p a i r r a r a a g 100 where a r is the irrigable area in each catchment obtained from the inventory of irrigation systems and a a g is the agricultural area in a catchment obtained from the land cover map the a r for the contributing area of peru was obtained from previous studies in lake titicaca contributing basins autoridad nacional del agua 2010 2009 instituto nacional de recursos naturales 2008 an assumption of this study is that the p a i r r does not vary in the modeling period 1980 2015 recall that the irrigable area is a permanent physical area and only under very favorable conditions of climate and water availability could the irrigated area be equal to the irrigable area in practice the irrigated area is always less than the irrigable area for example according to the inventory the irrigable area is about 108 705 ha and the irrigated area about 50 428 ha 46 irrigation coverage therefore the new projects to improve and develop the irrigation systems aim to reduce the gap between the irrigable area and the irrigated area another assumption to consider is that the land cover map was used for the entire historical modeling period thus it was assumed that existing changes in the watershed are not of considerable magnitude to support this assumption a multi temporal land cover analysis was performed using the european space agency climate change initiative land cover esa cci lc global dataset at a spatial resolution of 300 m esa 2017 the analysis was performed for the available period from 1992 2015 according to the results 3 7 4106 km2 of the watershed area has experienced land cover changes in the mentioned period fig 3 the same figure shows that between 1992 and 2000 the change was 1 1 up to 2005 the cumulative change was 2 2 and up to 2010 it was 2 9 in terms of change in land cover types fig 4 shows the cumulative change for each type the results show that the type of land cover that has increased the most is settlements between 1992 and 2015 settlements have increased by 43 the same figure shows a still increasing trend the agricultural area has increased by approximately 8 of which 5 happened in the years 2000 2008 and 2012 3 in the remaining years from 2012 onwards an almost constant line of change is shown due to the increase of the mentioned types and others forests and grasslands the coverage of bare sparse vegetation has been reduced in the case of forest there is an abrupt change in 1999 and then it remains constant this may be associated with problems in the classification of small areas of andean forests 2 3 4 irrigation water demand the data collected to estimate irrigation water demand were predominant crops agricultural calendar crop coefficient kc and irrigable area the predominant crops and agricultural calendar data were obtained from the bolivian national agricultural census database instituto nacional de estadística 2015 and previous studies in watersheds in peru autoridad nacional del agua 2010 2009 instituto nacional de recursos naturales 2008 for the kc of each crop the database of the programa nacional de riego 2002 was adopted the irrigable area has already been described in section 2 3 3 in weap irrigation withdrawals can be restricted by two possibilities i a maximum volume mv that can be associated with physical or contractual capacity constraints and ii a percentage of water demand pwd for this study we have adopted the pwd 2 3 5 measured flows for the calibration of the smm measured flows processed by previous studies were collected ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2018 the peruvian measurement stations used in the analysis were puente ramis puente huancané puente maravillas and puente ilave fig 1 the bolivian stations are escoma achacachi desaguadero calacoto mauri calacoto tambillo ulloma and chuquiña fig 1 the data from the stations in peru covers the period 1980 1998 and those in bolivia cover 1980 2012 2 3 6 bathymetry and water levels the bathymetry of lake titicaca was obtained from the lake titicaca binational autonomous authority alt and that of the poopó from previous studies pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 pillco zolá and bengtsson 2007 in titicaca measured water levels for the modeling period 1980 2015 are also available which were used in the calibration process in poopó there are no measured lake level data only estimated data based on remote sensing products arsen et al 2014 available on the hydroweb website http hydroweb theia land fr 2 4 model calibration the smm model was calibrated 1980 1998 and validated 1999 2015 at the flow measurement stations mentioned in section 2 3 5 the initial parameters of the smm were defined with reference values of the bolivian water balance guide ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2016 these values were manually adjusted to achieve a good goodness of fit using measures typical in hydrology such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias in terms of calibration sequence we first calibrated the hydrometric stations located on the lake titicaca tributaries puente ramis puente ilave puente huancané escoma achacachi and tambillo second the water levels modeled in lake titicaca were calibrated by adjusting the constants of the mho function a and b lake discharge flows were verified at the desaguadero calacoto and ulloma stations third calibration of the catchments was performed with measurement at the chuquiña station finally the results of the modeling in lake poopó were compared with water levels estimated by previous studies based on water balance methods pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 and remote sensing data arsen et al 2014 the smm calibration process included adjusting the irrigation threshold and the pwd as a proxy for the specific unknown irrigation management practices carried out in the system 2 5 approach to quantify the impact of irrigation and climate variability the proposed approach to estimating impacts from climate variability and irrigation management can be formulated mathematically as 5 δ h t δ h c δ h i r r h m a x t h m i n t 6 δ h c h m a x c h m i n c 7 δ h i r r δ h t δ h c 8 c c δ h c δ h t 100 9 c i r r δ h i r r δ h t 100 where δ h t is the range of total lake fluctuation between the maximum water level h m a x t and the minimum water level h m i n t during the entire modeling period the terms δ h c and δ h i r r are the range of fluctuation attributed to climate variability and irrigation respectively also h m a x c and h m i n c are the maximum and minimum water levels in the no irrigation scenario c c is the relative contribution of climate variability to lake level fluctuations and c i r r is the fluctuation attributed to irrigation to estimate the maximum and minimum water level for each case model runs were made for the following scenarios i with irrigation scenario that corresponds to the irrigation area and calibrated extractions for the historical period with this we estimated h m a x t and h m i n t ii without irrigation scenario where no extractions are modeled therefore approximating input flow under natural condition with the results of the simulated water levels used to estimate h m a x c and h m i n c 3 results 3 1 model performance according to the measures of goodness of fit and criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2015 the model for the calibration period performs between satisfactory and very good table 1 fig 5 shows a good correspondence between observed and simulated flows the smm performance obtained is also reflected in the simulation of water levels where there is a very good correspondence between observed and simulated values table 1 and fig 6 however between 1993 and 1998 the model overestimates lake levels by as much as 0 98 m although it shows a seasonal and interannual pattern very similar to that observed except in 1993 which has a lingering effect on model performance in subsequent years the simulated water levels for lake poopó compared to the water levels estimated by pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 show a good correspondence in the validation period 1999 2015 in some stations the yield measured by nse is 0 5 table 1 in the case of desaguadero calacoto and ulloma there is an underestimation of the simulated flows fig 5 which is directly related to the discharge flows from lake titicaca since between 2003 2007 there is an underestimation of the simulated water levels of up to 0 94 m fig 6 which also results in an underestimation of the discharge flows in lake poopó for the validation period there are data generated by arsen et al 2014 the simulated levels compared to that data source show a good correspondence fig 6 likewise goodness of fit measures were estimated for a more recent data set 2008 2015 table 1 this in order to verify the performance of the model given that for this period the same pwd value obtained in the calibration period is maintained assuming that there was a significant increase in irrigation withdrawals the model should have a very low performance with a substantial overestimation of the simulated flows and water levels table 1 shows that in puente ramis and puente huancane there is a 16 overestimation of the simulated flows likewise from the good correspondence between the simulated and observed water levels we can also affirm that the possible increase in irrigation withdrawals has not been of significant magnitude 3 2 water balance in sub basins the annual water balance results for the period studied are shown in table 2 precipitation p in the basin is 565 mm the wettest sub basin is titicaca and the driest is mauri the potential evapotranspiration pet presents a spatial pattern where there is an increase in a north south direction which is determined by the spatial and temporal patterns of the meteorological variables used for the application of the penman monteith method actual evapotranspiration et ranges between 79 and 93 of precipitation the comparison between pet and et shows the semi arid conditions of the sub basins since the magnitude of the deficit is considerable simulated irrigation irr varies between 0 3 and 8 8 mm per year regarding the monthly results table 3 between 71 and 84 of the precipitation is concentrated in the rainy season the rainiest month is january and the driest month is july the highest values of pet are observed in october and november and the lowest in june and july high pet is mainly due to high values of insolation while low pet is related to low temperatures the high values of et occur in the rainy season where the average deficit reaches 40 and in some months of the dry season june november and in the transition seasons the deficit rises to 84 these deficit months coincide with the sowing and germination season of agricultural crops that likely require irrigation irrigation is mainly concentrated between the months of june and november dry season and transition and in absolute terms represents between 67 and 91 of the total annual irrigation in the rainy season irrigation represents between 7 and 28 of the total annual irrigation in the transition from the rainy to the dry season april irrigation represents between 2 and 6 the seasonal patterns of runoff in the sub basins are similar to those of precipitation 3 3 water balance of the lakes the annual free evaporation estimated with the penman method in the titicaca and poopó lakes is 1646 and 1777 mm respectively on a monthly scale the lowest value occurs in june and the highest in november regarding precipitation in titicaca it is approximately 826 mm and in poopó it is 350 mm the seasonal precipitation pattern is similar to that observed in the contributing sub basins but there are differences in the magnitudes especially in titicaca with respect to the inflows in titicaca the annual contribution of the tributaries is 878 mm 233 m3 s of which 68 occurs during the rainy season 13 in the second transition season april 14 in the dry season and 5 in the first transition season september to november in january and february there are net evaporation inputs fig 7 that is precipitation is higher than evaporation in poopó the annual inflow is 1585 mm 80 m3 s with 55 of total annual inflow occurring in the rainy season 13 in the second transition season 24 in the dry season and 8 in the first transition season the annual flow at the chuquiña station is 63 m3 s so the contribution from the desaguadero river represents 79 of the total inflow to the poopó in this lake evaporation in all months is greater than precipitation so the net evaporation in fig 7 in all months is an output of the water balance regarding the outflows in titicaca the annual discharge flow to the downstream river system is 86 mm 23 m3 s in the dry season 45 of the discharges occur in the rainy season 25 and the remaining 30 in the transition seasons the net evaporation loss is 820 mm 213 m3 s in the poopó the modeled discharges to the laka jawuira river occur only between 1984 and 1988 which were not directly corroborated because no measurements were available the annual net evaporation rate is 1427 mm 66 m3 s of which 42 occurs in the transition season 0 3 in the dry season and 57 7 in the wet season increases in water levels occur in the rainy season fig 7 and consequently the highest levels occur in march and april the mann kendall kendall 1948 mann 1945 test was used to analyze the monotonic trend of the main components of the water balance in the lakes and the basin the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 was used to calculate the magnitude of the trends based on the results shown in table 4 and considering p 0 05 as the significance level the annual evaporation in lake poopó increased significantly this can be directly associated to the increase in the mean annual temperature which at the basin level is also significant this annual trend is mainly due to the significant increase in mean temperature during the rainy season the inflows into lake poopó during the dry season decreased significantly this may be associated with the combined effect of changes in the basin and discharges from lake titicaca taking p 0 1 as the significance level there is a trend of increased evaporation in lake poopó in the three rainfall seasons in lake titicaca there are no significant changes for both significance levels considered in its water balance components 3 4 impact of irrigation on the temporal regime of flows the extractions for irrigation alter the temporal regime of the inflows of the lakes to analyze these changes the flow duration curves of inflows for the with irrigation qai and without irrigation qni scenarios were constructed fig 8 the relative change in flow rate at each percentile was calculated as qai qni qni the results for high flows i e flows exceeded 5 of the time in titicaca show no change with irrigation while in poopó the reduction is 10 regarding the medium flows ie flows that exceed 50 of the time in titicaca they decrease by 19 and in poopó the reduction is 50 under with irrigation scenario regarding the minimum flows ie flows that exceed 95 of the time in titicaca declines reached 89 and in poopó all low flow conditions ceased 3 5 impacts on water level fluctuation over the studied historical period the modeled water levels in titicaca presented a range of variation of 4 m table 5 this fluctuation corresponds to the combined effect of climate variability and irrigation the contribution of climate variability and irrigation management on lake level fluctuations is estimated with eqs 8 and 9 respectively in this way model results suggest that 82 5 3 3 m of the fluctuation is attributed to climatic variability and the remaining 17 5 0 7 m is caused by irrigation withdrawals in the case of lake poopó the range of variation caused by both climate and irrigation is 2 3 m the climatic variability explains 65 2 1 5 m with the remaining 34 8 0 8 m by irrigation in comparison to lake titicaca the relative contribution of irrigation to the fluctuation of water levels is almost double lake poopó being shallow is instead very sensitive to changes in the components of the water balance and mainly to inflows from the titicaca mauri and desaguadero sub basins representing 79 of total inflows 4 discussion 4 1 implications of the findings the low levels in lake poopó in some years in the last decade are often attributed to the increase in agricultural areas and evapotranspiration satgé et al 2019 2017 this may also be associated with an increase in irrigation however this hypothesis was not corroborated by a system wide water balance our study by modeling the key components of the water balance has determined that the range of fluctuation in water levels is largely controlled by climate variability table 5 lakes in the past have already had lower levels than those observed in the last four decades measurements in lake titicaca show that the lowest levels occurred in 1944 ronchail et al 2014 as a result of continuous years of el niño events martin et al 1993 low levels in lake poopó in the 1960s 1980s and 1990s were also associated with el niño pillco zola and bengtsson 2006 dry years caused by el niño have direct and substantial effects on lake water levels also according to the trends of some components of the water balance of lake poopó evaporation has increased due to the increase in temperature table 4 this contributes unfavorably to the reduction of lake water levels according to the database of the main irrigation investment programs in bolivia such as mi riego and mi agua between 2011 and 2017 the incremental area of irrigated area was 9708 ha fig 9 considering only the mi agua program between 2011 and 2015 the incremental area of irrigated area was 6779 ha which represents approximately 6 of the irrigable area in the bolivian territory these data support that the increase in irrigated area was not of significant magnitude the increase in some crops such as quinoa may be contributing to water scarcity although much of this production is rain fed and adapted to semi arid conditions deficit irrigation application can help ensure stable yields geerts et al 2009 thus depending on the degree deficit irrigation is implemented agriculture can be a factor contributing to the process of water scarcity in the region satgé et al 2019 nonetheless although the magnitude of the contribution of irrigation to water levels is small it aggravates the unfavorable conditions generated by the climate the consequences are more alarming in lake poopó as it is shallow and highly dependent on contributions from lake titicaca in terms of area fluctuation range irrigation controls 52 of its variation in dry years the demand for water increases and therefore irrigation this has led to very low levels eventually leading to the lake drying out completely in consecutive dry years in lake titicaca water levels decrease drastically and therefore discharge into the desaguadero river is reduced between 1997 and 1998 in some months the water level was below the discharge level to the desaguadero river it is important to note that the agricultural calendar in the region is adapted to the weather conditions the interval from the flowering stage to the maturity of the fruit coincides with the rainy season agricultural production in the dry season is limited to only a few forage crops such as alfalfa therefore irrigation extractions are mostly concentrated in the dry season and the first transition season table 3 in some months of the dry season june and july irrigation is necessary to prepare the soil for planting that occurs between july and october in the transition season september to november initial crop development depends mostly on irrigation in these months of greater water demand the available and accessible flow in the rivers is used to the maximum the base flow in these months represents between 60 and 80 of the total flow according to the results shown in fig 8 they show that the impact of irrigation on low flow is very high the margin for new uses is very low in the middle flow range the effect is greater in poopó due to the reduction of discharges from lake titicaca and also to drier conditions in the desaguadero mauri and poopó sub basins linked to a greater demand for water the same reasons explain the reduction in the maximum input flows in poopó 4 2 limitations of the water balance model the model is based on climatic and hydrological data measured in the region which have limitations in terms of temporal and spatial records these limitations generate uncertainties not only due to the input data but also associated with intrinsic aspects of the smm and some assumptions in some components of the water balance regarding precipitation and temperature data in this study we have used the gridded gmet product from bolivia generated with the available observed data to the north of the basin there is a higher density of observation stations while to the south the data are very limited which generates uncertainties with respect to the input data likewise in lake titicaca there is an influence of the lake itself on precipitation and it is presumed that precipitation could be underestimated due to the few observation stations in the lake another limitation related to input data in our study is the lack of temporal resolution of the meteorological data the evaporation estimated with monthly average values may differ from the daily ones as observed by pillco zolá et al 2019 also using monthly average data on some meteorological variables wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours for the entire period studied may not adequately capture the interannual variability of evaporation the same considerations apply to reference evapotranspiration as far as measured flows are concerned our study only considered data available up to 2012 except for the mauri calacoto station up to 2015 then in most of the gauging stations it was not possible to verify the performance of the smm in the period 2013 2015 although the performance evaluated with the water levels of lake titicaca indicate a good performance of the model in general for the case of lake poopó only compared with previous studies there are no measurements of water levels as such with respect to groundwater modeling in this study groundwater extractions for different uses such as irrigation human consumption and others were not considered instead only the available flow in rivers is considered in the water demand and supply model for irrigation although major cities such as oruro gómez et al 2016 and el alto depend on groundwater supply and withdrawals are almost constant there is no historical data on volumes of irrigation water extraction since most irrigation systems are self managed by the communities themselves bustamante and vega 2006 according to the inventory of irrigation systems ministerio de medio ambiente y agua 2012 2 of the irrigable area of irrigation systems in the territory corresponding to bolivia have groundwater as a source this value may have increased since the year of the inventory 2012 the approach adopted to estimate the irrigable area was based on data from the bolivian irrigation system inventory and previous studies in peru with this area the water demand was determined with the smm the proportion of water demand that receives supply was calibrated pwd in the basin irrigation is self managed by each community or association of irrigation systems and therefore there are no measurements of irrigation withdrawals future research could advance in determining the temporal evolution of the irrigated area based on remote sensing images and validated with field work 5 conclusions in this article we have presented a hydrological modeling approach to analyze and quantify the impact of irrigation management and climate variability on lake water level fluctuations in lake titicaca and lake poopó the tool and the modeling approach employed allowed for the dynamic simulation of the catchment hydrology including irrigation management and its interconnection with the water balance of the lakes the modeling using the somewhat limited but best data available has allowed us to fill the information gaps with novel analysis that can help in the planning of water and ecosystem management in these lakes the results suggest that the fluctuation is largely controlled by climate variability in lake titicaca climate variability explains about 80 of the fluctuation range while the remaining 20 corresponds to irrigation in lake poopó the role of climate variability also prevails with a contribution of about 65 with the remaining 35 attributed to irrigation management since lake poopó is shallow irrigation controls about 52 of the fluctuation range of its area these results represent a substantial advance in knowledge about the hydrological functioning of lakes in relation to the dynamics of their contributing watersheds the limitations of the model used in this study offer opportunities for future research the model does not consider the scale of operation and self management of irrigation systems based on usos y costumbres uses and customs within these basins nor does it consider the temporal evolution of the irrigable area the incorporation of these features in addition to other sources of water supply such as small reservoirs and groundwater in the modeling tool could provide a more resolved and detailed assessment of the regional irrigation system in future work with this tool different management options can thus be evaluated at the basin scale to inform policies for the sustainability of water resources management actions in terms of their ability to maintain lake water levels to restore and or conserve their unique ecosystem services this study provides an opportunity for strategic planning around irrigation management in the altiplano and a point of reference for other similar studies both in the andes and globally the dominance of climatic variability in causing lake level fluctuations in both lake poopó and lake titicaca highlights the vulnerability of the region and local irrigation dependent agriculture and livelihoods to changes in precipitation patterns so the use of tools such as the one developed in this study in strategic planning processes related to regional water resources will make it possible to make comprehensive assessments and to recognize the interconnectedness of the impacts of management options that will allow for agricultural development without generating negative

8171,study region the sudd wetland located in south sudan within the nile river basin study focus this study combines limited in situ data with satellite based estimates of wetland inundation extents precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to develop a hydrologic model of the sudd wetland holistic water balance assessments were integrated into the model development process to balance data uncertainty with model complexity an existing model grounded in historical observations served as the foundation for an alternative model that simulates the sudd flooded area and outflow model improvements were formulated and tested incrementally through an iterative procedure resulting in new insights on the sudd hydrology and ideas for future model improvements new hydrological insights for the region the recent satellite derived hydrologic data suggests that the existing sudd model over predicts the areal flood extents and does not accurately capture the storage attenuation characteristics of the wetland however the remotely sensed information is highly uncertainty and somewhat inconsistent in terms of the sudd water balance limiting the complexity of an alternative model model simulations and analyses suggest that the model structure and performance could be substantially improved if more accurate estimates of the sudd inflows and wetland inundation extents could be derived a significant challenge is the need to distinguish between areas that are physically connected to the sudd water body but likely not hydrologically connected and contributing to the main water body that regulates the outflows keywords wetlands hydrologic modeling nile river basin remote sensing satellites uncertainty assessments modeling framework 1 introduction and background despite their highly valued services costanza et al 2014 mitsch et al 2009 wetland areas have disappeared at an alarming rate over the twentieth century millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 and future degradation is expected to continue considering population growth rates and climate induced water scarcity fao 2016 wwap 2018 water resources managers should consider social economic and environmental wetland services when evaluating alternative infrastructure development and water management plans that impact wetland areas however wetlands are rarely integrated into decision support tools that stakeholders use for basin wide planning and decision making a significant challenge for integrating wetlands into these tools is the limited availability and accuracy of process based hydrologic models that simulate how wetlands respond to variations in flows and environmental conditions the need for a reliable wetland model that can be applied to basin wide planning is especially true for the sudd wetland in south sudan part of the nile river basin the sudd plays a critical role in water quality and quantity within the basin but its representation is limited in basin planning tools such as the nile decision support tool dst georgakakos et al 2003 stakeholders use the nile dst to develop long term management strategies and determine reservoir operating rules that control water supply throughout the basin the nile dst estimates river flows associated with alternative scenarios and translates flow quantities into socio economic metrics the metrics represent the perceived benefits from competing water uses including hydropower irrigation and municipal use and facilitate stakeholder conversations on trade offs to enable data driven decision making in this sensitive world region the nile dst currently quantifies the amount of water flowing through the sudd using statistical models calibrated to historic inflow and outflow data however the tool lacks a process based model of the sudd that simulates hydrologic variables that are important to local stakeholders such as the time variable flood extents a more comprehensive and process based wetland model would allow decision makers to more carefully consider the sudd response to alternative management and climate scenarios the nile river and sudd wetland were studied extensively throughout most of the twentieth century and in situ flow records throughout the basin are available from 1905 to 1984 a proposed canal project that would have diverted significant portions of the nile flows around the sudd motivated field campaigns howell et al 1988 and supported the development of a hydrologic model of the wetland sutcliffe parks 1987 1999 this lumped mass balance model used historical measurements of flow and precipitation to simulate the wetland inundated area and was used to assess the potential impact of the canal on areal flood extents the resulting multi decadal monthly flooded area time series 1905 1980 was validated using flooded area estimates derived from four individual aerial and satellite images acquired in 1931 1952 1973 and 1980 sutcliffe and brown 2018 later applied this model to delineated sub basins within the sudd using historical flow data that was available at stations between the sudd entrance and exit the sub basin models could not be extended past 1964 due to inconsistent flow records and significant changes to the wetland geomorphology a result of hydrologic changes in region during this period and a drastic increase in the sudd flows a comparison between the historical simulated areas for each sub basin and inundated areas derived from a 1983 satellite image led sutcliffe and brown to believe that the increased flows caused backwater effects at the sudd exit and larger inundated areas in the downstream portions of the sudd this existing model of the sudd is grounded in historical in situ data and was developed by expert hydrologists however the availability of satellite information presents new opportunities to thoroughly evaluate the existing model using more recently available data this study uses satellite derived estimates of the sudd hydrologic variables to evaluate the existing model and to explore alternative model formulations satellite based information can be integrated into the hydrologic model development and calibration process in various ways most often it is used for model inputs i e precipitation or for extracting basin information i e land cover maps xu et al 2014 satellite data can also be used to calibrate model parameters by minimizing differences between model simulations and satellite observations of state variables salvucci entekhabi 2011 alternatively it can be used to more accurately estimate state variables using data assimilation techniques that consider model and observation errors jointly crow et al 2017 crow ryu 2009 draper et al 2012 reichle et al 2002 these applications are often implemented in rainfall runoff models some of which have embedded wetland modeling components hattermann et al 2006 liu et al 2008 muhammad et al 2019 rahman et al 2016 wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 although model calibration is generally focused on matching outflows as opposed to the wetland processes satellite information can also support reservoir release and river discharge modeling if it is used to derive area elevation curves from satellite altimetry and satellite estimated open water extents eldardiry hossain 2019 muala et al 2014 these elevation and areal inundation estimates can also be applied to spatially distributed hydrodynamic wetland models when combined with digital elevation models dems a hydrodynamic model was developed for a portion of the sudd but inaccuracies in the dem limited its utility for quantitative analyses petersen 2005 petersen fohrer 2010 the lisflood fp hydrodynamic model bates de roo 2000 was designed to run seamlessly with satellite based data and has been applied to the niger delta using in situ flow measurements water surface elevations estimated from satellite altimetry and inundation extents estimated from landsat imagery neal et al 2012 however discrepancies between the satellite and modeled inundation extents were significant and manual adjustments were made to the dem to ensure connectivity across the delta this study demonstrated that satellite based information can support the calibration of complex process based models but developers should assess whether simulations are consistent with existing knowledge of a wetland s behavior the goal of this study is to explore the potential for using satellite data to develop a hydrologic model of the sudd wetland that can inform water resources planning the uncertainty of the satellite derived information is carefully considered throughout an iterative model development process to identify model limitations determine an appropriate level of model complexity and to prioritize areas for future research the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief background on the sudd wetland section 3 describes our methods which includes i an extensive explanation of how the sudd fluxes and flows were estimated ii a comparison of the fluxes and flows to conceptualize the sudd hydrology and limitations imposed by data uncertainties and iii a summary of the model development process section 4 reports and illustrates the calibrated model simulations and the ongoing model limitations induced by data uncertainties section 5 provides a discussion of the results and makes recommendations for future research 2 sudd wetland the sudd wetland is downstream of lake victoria and lake albert in the nile river basin the sudd contains a large permanently flooded area that expands when water is released from upstream lakes that are primarily regulated according to hydropower demands the inflows to the sudd are further augmented from seasonal runoff known as the torrents that enter just upstream of the sudd entrance during the wet season the sudd nearly doubles in size as the increased flow spills outside of the permanently flooded area and continues outward fig 1 shows the location of the sudd within the nile river basin and the extents of the permanently and seasonally flooded areas due to the high evaporation rates and a lack of rainfall for extended periods only about half of the inflows reach the sudd exit during these high flow periods howell et al 1988 sutcliffe parks 1987 the wetland flooding regime has defined the livelihoods of over 1 million people who live in the sudd region unep 2018 these nomadic communities have come to rely on the seasonal flooding to regenerate the grasslands that support their cattle their primary source of food and income howell et al 1988 the nile basin countries are already using most of the consumable water in their watershed the majority of which meets irrigation needs in downstream arid countries sudan and egypt based on forecasted population growth water demand is expected to increase five fold by 2030 fao 2016 as water scarcity increases in severity the nile countries might consider altering the sudd hydrology through development initiatives to augment downstream flows such as the jonglei canal project the jonglei canal was designed to divert a significant amount of the nile flow around the sudd to reduce evaporative losses construction of the canal began in the late 1970s but was canceled due to the second sudanese civil war sutcliffe parks 1999 the potential social economic and environmental impacts of the canal were studied through field data collection campaigns howell et al 1988 and modeling initiatives sutcliffe and parks 1987 1999 simulated potential jonglei canal operating scenarios using their hydrologic model and found that a 15 reduction of average annual flow could reduce the areal extent of seasonal flooding by up to 21 this reduction in flooded area is significant considering it reduces the area that is available for grazing the life support of the local community therefore development initiatives should be carefully assessed in terms of the trade offs between local and downstream benefits and how they are impacted if the sudd hydrology is altered while new hydrologic data sources are globally available due to the advancement of satellite technology the amount of in situ data in the sudd region has declined as a result of ongoing political conflict many of the nile countries no longer publicly share flow data and in situ measurements in the sudd region have been abandoned since the 1980 s the global runoff data center https grdc bafg de illustrates that flows are unavailable throughout the basin after 1985 in situ measurements of precipitation and evaporation ceased when the jonglei canal project came to a halt unfortunately the country of south sudan is still economically and politically stressed and has little incentive to re invest in data collection for water management using satellite information to fill spatial and temporal gaps in hydrologic information is therefore critical to advancing water resources planning in this region 3 methodology 3 1 estimation of fluxes and flows based on previous research estimates of the wetland flooded areas precipitation evapotranspiration inflows and outflows are required to realistically model the sudd these flux estimates were obtained from a variety of data sources and methods described here in sufficient detail to provide insight on the data uncertainties that were a key consideration during the hydrologic model development 3 1 1 flooded area extents quantifying the time variable flood extents of the sudd is critical to understanding the wetland s hydrology and socio economic benefits large seasonal flood pulses support the livelihoods of local inhabitants but also increase evaporation rates and reduce downstream flows in situ monitoring of the sudd inundation patterns is infeasible considering the size and accessibility of the area however satellite data can be leveraged to estimate the flooded area with consistent spatial and temporal resolutions that can be integrated into hydrologic models toward this goal a novel multi temporal wetland land cover classification and inundation mapping algorithm was developed in a previous study and applied to the sudd di vittorio georgakakos 2018 the method uses 18 years of moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis land surface reflectance data to first classify land cover types and identify areas that are likely to flood before producing monthly flood maps considering optical remote sensing reflectance measurements are dominated by vegetation as opposed to water gao 1996 pulvirenti et al 2011 a key challenge of the monthly flood detection algorithm was detecting flooding beneath vegetation canopies flooded areas were therefore detected by comparing the satellite derived wetness index of a pixel to those of an ensemble of nearby pixels that have the same vegetation cover and have received similar amounts of rainfall the flood detection classification algorithm was performed on a pixel by pixel basis throughout the area and pixels that were physically connected through adjacent pixels to the main wetland water body were considered part of the sudd water balance assuming a physical connection indicates whether a hydrologic connection is present this connectivity algorithm should distinguish between pixels that are temporarily flooded from large rain events and those that are connected to the water body that regulates the sudd outflows this distinction is necessary to formulate a hydrologic model that can simulate both the flooded areas and the outflows however the ability to make this distinction using modis satellite imagery was revisited during the model development process the final time series of the modis derived sudd flooded areas is shown in fig 2 since the original study was published di vittorio georgakakos 2018 the time series has been extended to march 2019 and an algorithm was added to identify when permanently flooded pixels are temporarily dry slightly reducing the minimum flood extents of the sudd during very dry years these areal estimates also incorporate the corrections described in section 3 2 implemented during the hydrologic model development process the accuracy of the monthly sudd flooded areas was evaluated using limited in situ observations and a statistical time series comparison between the flooded area and the estimated net storage changes in the wetland the resulting performance metrics were strong and the time series behavior of the flooded area was consistent with qualitative descriptions of the sudd hydrology from previous studies howell et al 1988 petersen fohrer 2010 sutcliffe parks 1987 however limitations of the inundation algorithm should be considered while developing the sudd hydrologic model to assess potential impacts of data uncertainty on model simulations these limitations are briefly described next and opportunities to address them are described in section 5 an inability to fully detect when areas with dense vegetation that are typically flooded year round temporarily become dry the algorithm might be detecting differences in vegetation growth cycles in addition to flooding beneath vegetation considering satellite derived wetness indices measure moisture content in vegetation in addition to flooding beneath the vegetation the algorithm does not consider the impact of human controlled burning practices howell et al 1988 on the satellite derived wetness index that is used for flood detection the spatial resolution of modis imagery 500 meters limits the ability to determine whether adjacent pixels that are flooded are truly connected 3 1 2 precipitation the sudd region has distinct wet and dry seasons with precipitation generally occurring from april to october and peaking in july august the average net annual precipitation over the sudd from 1941 to 1970 was estimated as 871 mm sutcliffe parks 1999 calculated from measurements at 9 in situ stations in the sudd region the global surface summary of day gsod and the global precipitation climatology center gpcc databases show that current gauge data is available at two remaining locations in the sudd region juba just south of mongalla and malakal near the sudd exit this gauge data is used to develop and bias correct gridded precipitation data products but the sparsity of gauges in this region introduces large uncertainties several global gridded precipitation data products exist that use in situ gauges satellite observations and interpolation strategies global and regional accuracy assessments of these products vary widely and are sensitive to variations in geography and climate multiple studies conducted in sparsely gauged areas of africa have found that the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm products perform well awange et al 2016 cattani et al 2016 thiemig et al 2012 although cattani et al cautioned that results may be biased towards trmm since the same gauges that are used to calibrate trmm products are often used in accuracy assessments cattani et al evaluated the signal to noise ratio of six products without using gauge data and found that precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann africa rainfall climatology version 2 0 arcv2 and trmm were the top three performers in that order another reliable product is climate hazards infrared precipitation with stations chirps found to outperform trmm when compared to independent weather stations in the serengeti mahony et al 2021 a comparison of independent gauges with multiple satellite based products in the ethiopian highlands showed that chirps performed best overall followed by trmm arcv2 and then persiann bayissa et al 2017 based on results from these regional studies five different data products were used to estimate precipitation rates over the sudd flooded area including trmm 3b43 persiann arcv2 and chirps in addition to the satellite based products the climate research unit cru was chosen as a comparison product that relies entirely on a robust in situ database a description of each of these products and their data dependencies is provided in the supplemental materials section s1 each data product was clipped to the modis derived sudd flooded area and averaged to obtain time series of monthly cumulative precipitation rates the monthly mean estimates over the 2000 to 2018 period are compared to the historical monthly mean climatology precipitation estimates sutcliffe parks 1999 in the left panel of fig 3 persiann estimates are significantly greater than all others and appear to have a significant bias trmm and cru estimates are most similar to the monthly climatology calculated from the in situ gauges since current gauge data recorded at juba and malakal are used in the development of some of these products they should not be used to assess relative accuracies however a study on the sudd performed by petersen and fohrer 2010 included daily in situ precipitation measurements recorded from april 2004 to november 2005 at a station in the southern portion of the sudd this data was provided to us by petersen and compared to the corresponding pixel in the gridded precipitation data products the five data products evaluated in this study are compared with these in situ measurements in the right panel of fig 3 statistical metrics comparing the differences between products are displayed in table 1 trmm produced the lowest mean absolute error 24 mm and a high correlation coefficient 0 85 although less than that of arcv2 0 87 and cru has the lowest mean bias surprisingly chirps did not perform well compared to the other products spatial maps of monthly precipitation in august 2004 and average net annual precipitation are included in the supplemental materials section s1 to show how the different products compare spatially the gauge comparison is limited considering the spatial aggregation from point to pixel and the unknown accuracy of the gauge measurements however there are general consistencies between the independent gauge data and data products that cover the full sudd area suggesting that the gridded products can reliably inform a hydrologic model of the sudd this limited comparison was not used to determine the most accurate product but rather to provide general insights on the strengths and limitations of different estimates and to conceptualize the range of uncertainty ingrained in available gridded precipitation products 3 1 3 evapotranspiration et previous studies have demonstrated the importance of the et flux in the sudd hydrologic balance et rates in the sudd have been studied since the early 1900 s and estimates have varied widely early experiments focused on measuring water losses from papyrus samples in tanks leading to a wide range of annual rates from 1533 mm to 2760 mm sutcliffe parks 1999 in the sutcliffe and parks study an annual et rate of 2150 mm was estimated using the penman equation for open water informed with in situ data this et rate generally agreed with a water budget analysis using historical flow data and precipitation measurements petersen and fohrer 2010 collected data during their 2005 study and applied the penman monteith equation to grasslands to produce an annual et rate of 2077 mm mohammed 2006 rebelo 2012 and wilusz et al 2017 used satellite and weather station data to inform surface energy balance models and estimated annual et rates of 1636 mm 1697 mm and 1210 mm respectively in this study four alternative estimates of the sudd et rates were calculated or extracted from existing databases including the cru refence crop et hargreaves estimated et potential et calculated from the maximum entropy production mep method and actual et from the global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam a description of the algorithms and data sources for each product is provided in the supplemental materials section s1 the data sources and approaches were chosen to capture the large range of potential values and seasonal trends that have been reported in previous studies the cru et product and the cru informed hargreaves estimates leverage a large historical in situ database and should therefore reliably capture consistent seasonal trends the hargreaves formulation is the simplest approach and only requires temperature to estimate et the more complex maximum entropy production mep method uses an energy balance approach and the global land surface evaporation the amsterdam method gleam is the most complex as it relies on both energy and water balance models similar to the precipitation analysis each gridded et estimate was clipped to the sudd flooded area and averaged to obtain monthly et estimates from 2000 to 2018 the monthly mean et rates are displayed and compared to the sutcliffe and parks 1999 climatology et in fig 4 fig 4 highlights the substantial differences between et estimates the sutcliffe and parks and cru monthly mean estimates are most correlated an unsurprising result considering they are both based on the penman and penman monteith formulations however there is a significant bias of 50 100 mm per month due to the assumptions of open water versus short grass many et formulations reduce loss rates when vegetation is present however et in densely vegetated wetland areas could be twice as high as that in open water areas lott hunt 2001 the hargreaves estimates are also based on grassy vegetation but are of similar magnitude to that of sutcliffe and park with a different intra annual trend the mep values are similar in magnitude to those of the cru however the time series lacks a distinct seasonal fluctuation the gleam estimates contrast greatly with the others a consequence of the water limitation calculated in the soil moisture accounting module of the gleam model considering et was averaged over areas known to be flooded the gleam estimates are not considered appropriate for the sudd model and demonstrate that et data sources must be carefully assessed prior to application the large amount of variability shown in fig 4 is consistent with results from et comparison studies jimenez et al 2011 mueller et al 2013 all estimates except gleam were considered during the modelling process to identify those that are most consist with other input data sources and the logic underlying the process based model a calibration factor was also be applied to each et estimate to account for the different types of vegetation in the sudd that impact actual et rates the calibrated parameter adjusts the magnitude of the et flux to ensure that the sudd water fluxes can be balanced but does not impact the seasonality of the estimates shown in fig 4 3 1 4 inflows and outflows the nile river stations that are relevant to the sudd inflow and outflow estimation methods are displayed in fig 1 the sub basin areas between stations were derived from the hydrosheds database www hydrosheds org mongalla is considered the entrance to the sudd and malakal is the location closest to the sudd exit where historical nile flows have been measured just upstream of malakal the sobat river enters the white nile therefore the sobat flows must be subtracted from malakal flows to obtain the sudd outflows the area to the west of the sudd known as the bahr el ghazal is delineated from lake no and is also characterized as an area that contains wetlands and a very flat topography in situ hydrologic data in this region is not available however historical field measurements and observations at lake no suggest that flows from the bahr el ghazal into the sudd are negligible sutcliffe parks 1987 1999 countries within the nile basin have not shared flow data publicly since the 1980 s and the limited in situ data records that exist are often not well maintained especially in conflict prone countries such as south sudan the sudd inflows and outflows that align with the satellite based areal flood extents therefore had to be estimated using relationships derived from historical data and limited flow records at upstream stations historical flow records throughout the nile river basin are listed in the nile basin volumes hurst et al 1932 a slightly modified version of these records that is believed to contain more accurate values was provided to us by egyptian ministry of water resources and irrigation the inflows from 2000 to 2015 were largely derived from measured flows at laropi provided to us by the ugandan ministry of water and environment the dataset was available from february 2000 to march 2011 on a daily temporal resolution although there were some temporal gaps in situ lake albert levels were also provided by the uganda ministry along with reservoir release rules that can be used to translate lake levels to flow at packwach between laropi and the sudd entrance at mongalla the white nile receives runoff from seasonal rainfall known as the torrents based on historical flow data from 1961 1980 the torrents account for approximately 10 of the total annual sudd inflows the seasonality of the torrents aligns with the period of extensive flooding within the sudd and this additional inflow is believed to impact the extent of the seasonally flooded wetland area sutcliffe parks 1999 the following steps summarize the procedures implemented to derive the sudd inflows for the 2000 to 2015 period a timeline summary of the data sources is provided in fig 5 1 lake albert levels were gap filled using satellite altimetry observations available from jan 2000 to april 2015 from hydroweb crétaux et al 2011 and a fitted linear relationship between the in situ and satellite based observations 2 the gap filled lake levels were converted to flows at packwach using the provided reservoir release rules 3 the missing laropi flows were estimated from the packwach flows using a third order polynomial regression model that was calibrated using historical flow records 4 the torrents flow that enters between laropi and mongalla was produced using a simple lumped rainfall runoff model calibrated with historical torrents estimates the model was informed by the cru precipitation and et database the calibrated model produced a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 621 and a spearman s rank correlation coefficient of 0 892 similar to most rainfall runoff models model errors are largest during peak flow periods a more thorough explanation and presentation of this model is presented in the supplemental material section s2 5 the sudd inflows at mongalla were estimated using an autoregressive model that depends on the laropi and torrent flows shown in equation 1 the model root mean square error is 11 64 mcm day the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 777 the model r squared is 0 57 and the lag 1 autocorrelation of the residuals is 0 13 a comparison between the historical and simulated mongalla flows was leveraged to derive month error distributions assumed normally distributed and shown in fig 6 the most significant uncertainty occurs during months with the highest amounts of rainfall 1 q i n k 0 060643 0 19474 q n i m k 0 13171 q n i m k 1 0 93112 q i n k 1 0 99677 q t o r k 0

an autoregressive model for the sudd losses inflows outflows shown in equation 2 the sudd outflows can then be computed by subtracting the losses from the inflows this approach for estimating the outflows is identical to that of the nile dst a statistical analysis was also performed to derive the sudd outflows from in situ malakal flow records available from 2000 to 2011 but uncertainties were larger than that of the autoregressive model similar to the inflow uncertainty analysis the simulated outflows were compared to the historical outflows to derive monthly error distributions 2 q l s s

laropi and torrent flows for the 2000 to 2015 period are displayed in the upper panel of fig 6 the monthly error distributions have been applied to the estimated inflows and outflows in the lower panel of fig 6 these distributions were employed for ensemble simulations of the hydrologic model to assess the impact of data uncertainty 3 2 comparison of fluxes and flows for data uncertainty and model structure assessments prior to formulating a hydrologic model of the sudd the time series estimates of the sudd fluxes and flows were evaluated and compared in order to i assess the alignment between data and historical descriptions of the sudd hydrology ii conceptualize a model structure that is appropriate for the sudd hydrology iii identify which precipitation and et estimates are most consistent with the sudd flooded areas and flows and iv hypothesize the challenges and limitations of modeling the sudd using uncertain satellite based information using the sudd flooded area a precipitation p et and flow estimates derived in section 3 1 a time series of the storage change in the sudd can be estimated as δ s k q i n k q o u t k a k p k e t k for each time step k based on the foundational concept that the wetland area should increase as the net hydrologic flux increases the storage change δ s and the satellite derived flooded area time series a should be correlated a maximum correlation coefficient of 0 83 was found if the flooded area is shifted back four months this lag is consistent with historical data assessments within the sudd sutcliffe parks 1999 and reflects the flat topography and slow travel time petersen fohrer 2010 of water that is stored within the wetland the existing hydrologic model sutcliffe parks 1987 1999 assumes a linear relationship between the wetland storage and area for each month formulated as s k d a k where d is a constant parameter that represents the average water depth considering the four month lag required to achieve a high correlation between the storage and flooded area the existing model is not expected to capture the timing of the seasonal flood pulse observed with satellite imagery this analysis supported the conceptualization of an alternative model that contains a routing compartment and a temporal lag in the storage area relationship presented in section 3 3 the significance of this 0 83 correlation coefficient was tested by comparing it to a distribution of correlation coefficients that were generated from randomly sampled flooded area time series the artificial flooded areas were created by separating the original time series by each hydrologic year april to march and piecing together randomly selected years with replacement thereby maintaining the seasonal behavior of the original data the resulting p value was 0 4 suggesting that the consistency between the storage change and flooded area is significant despite limitations of the satellite derived fluxes in addition to the time series comparison the net annual storage change and flooded areas were calculated to compare the data without the influence of intra annual trends conceptually years with larger net annual storage changes should also contain larger flooded areas the annual sums were calculated from april to march to align with the dry season minimums and the minimum flooded area was subtracted from the area time series to emphasize differences between years the comparison is presented in fig 8 and shows that some years have very high correspondence but the years 2002 to 2003 and 2004 to 2008 show large differences in magnitude based on this observation the satellite derived flooded area maps were closely analyzed to identify patterns and differences across the time series that might explain this behavior this analysis resulted in an adjustment procedure to the flooded area time series that is described in section s3 of the supplemental material the resulting revised net annual flooded area and storage change for the 2003 to 2008 period are shown in fig 8 illustrating a slight reduction in the differences the exploratory analysis described in the supplemental material largely focused on evaluating the connectivity of the satellite derived flooded areas patterns in time series animations of the areal flood and precipitation maps were studied to develop a more comprehensive data adjustment procedure however the patterns were inconsistent and sometimes illogical suggesting that that the sudd flooded area and precipitation maps likely contain significant errors this conclusion greatly influenced the hydrologic model development where the achievement of high model performance metrics was balanced against the potential for overfitting a model to uncertain data the comparisons depicted in figs 7 and 8 were implemented for each combination of the precipitation and et estimates described in section 3 1 to identify which products produced a net storage change that was most consistent with the satellite derived flooded area estimates the chirps precipitation and the hargreaves et estimates resulted in the highest linear correlation coefficient 0 83 and the smallest p value 0 4 for the full time series comparison the trmm and hargreaves combination also had a high correlation coefficient 0 81 and low p value 0 7 the net annual flux correlation coefficient was highest for the trmm and hargreaves combination 0 58 followed closely by the chirps and hargreaves combination 0 56 considering only a general comparison can be implemented to infer which data products are most accurate in the absence of more in situ data the analysis presented here suggests that both chirps and trmm precipitation and hargreaves et will support the development of a hydrologic model that is most consistent with available information both precipitation datasets were therefore used to develop and calibrate the hydrologic model 3 3 hydrologic model development conceptualizing a hydrologic model of the sudd should be begin with historical data and field observations reported in the literature previous studies howell et al 1988 petersen fohrer 2010 sutcliffe parks 1999 highlight the following key features of the wetland i the area is very flat and lacks prominent ridgelines resulting in an unbounded flood region ii the vertisol soils limit the magnitude and depth of groundwater flows but deep surface cracks develop on the ground surface during the dry season that must be filled before surface flooding occurs iii the rainy season within the sudd typically begins in march and ends in november iv the maximum areal extent of flooding in the sudd is believed to be primarily controlled by the sudd inflows which are augmented from august to december and v et rates are extremely important in the wetland water balance and are also highly uncertain although they are most significant during the dry season november to march and net et rates must exceed precipitation rates to explain the differences between the sudd inflows and outflows the sutcliffe and parks model 1987 1999 continues to be referenced in more recent studies mohamed et al 2006 petersen fohrer 2010 rebelo et al 2012 sutcliffe brown 2018 and appears to be the most widely accepted hydrologic representation of the sudd a conceptual schematic of the model is provided in fig 9 model inputs consisted of measured flow at the sudd entrance and precipitation that occurs over the flooded area model outputs consisted of the sudd exit flows estimated from in situ data at downstream gauges climatology et rates multiplied by the flooded area extents and vertical infiltration into the ground surface cracks over newly flooded areas the sudd flooded area was then calculated from the monthly storage volume assuming a linear relationship between area and volume and a constant depth of water in the wetland this simple area storage relationship is based on observations of the topography and the idea that the wetland area continues to expand outward instead of filling up a bounded area the sutcliffe and parks model parameters were calibrated by comparing flooded area estimates from the model to estimates that were derived from aerial imagery on four individual dates the calibrated parameters yielded a stable water mass balance and a reasonable fit according to the four data points however the continuous time series of the satellite derived flooded area can be leveraged to more thoroughly evaluate the sutcliffe and parks model and assess whether additional hydrologic processes or alternative representations of them should be implemented because the existing model was conceptualized from in situ data and field observations it serves as an excellent foundation to build upon the flooded area time series animation analysis and net hydrologic flux comparison summarized in section 3 2 provided valuable insights that guided the development of an alternative model the temporal lag between the net hydrologic flux and the flooded area extents indicates that additional storage compartments may be needed to capture the storage and attenuation characteristics of the wetland the temporal lag might also be resolved if additional hydrologic processes were integrated such as allowing water from previously flooded areas to re enter the main sudd water body through surface water or groundwater exchanges non linear relationships between the storage and area and the fluxes between storage compartments might also yield improved accuracy metrics each of these potential model adjustments were conceptualized formulated and implemented and improved accuracy metrics were balanced against model complexity in the context of the known limitations and uncertainties of the input data a broad overview of the mathematical models that were formulated and simulated in this study is provided next more detailed derivations of these models and explanations of how they were implemented computationally are provided in the supplemental materials section s4 the sutcliffe and parks 1987 1999 water balance of the sudd was formulated as follows d s q i n q o u t a p e d t r d a where s storage m3 q i n sudd inflows m3 month q o u t sudd outflows m3 month a flooded area of wetland m2 p precipitation over flooded area m month e evaporation over flooded area m month t time month r soil water recharge depth m the differential equation was discretized the area term a was replaced with the linear area storage relationship and terms were re arranged to derive an explicit expression for the storage at time k 1 s k 1 as follows 3 s k 1 s k 1 1 d r k 1 2 e k p k q i n k q o u t k 1 1 d r k 1 2 e k p k sutcliffe and parks simulated this model from 1905 to 1983 with measured inflows and outflows monthly rainfall records averaged over eight stations within the sudd area and the climatology monthly evaporation rates the soil moisture recharge depth represents the depth of water that infiltrates into the clay soil over newly flooded areas and was calculated as the difference between the maximum recharge depth and the cumulative depth of precipitation that has occurred over the current year this model has only two parameters k and the maximum soil recharge depth rmax by manually adjusting the parameters sutcliffe and parks found that values of k 1 meter and rmax 0 2 meters provided the best fit between the estimated and simulated flooded areas the original model requires direct estimates of the sudd outflows limiting its utility for alternative management and climate scenario assessments the statistical relationship between the sudd inflows and outflows equation 2 could be applied to simulate the outflows however this relationship is not physically based and may no longer be valid if the sudd hydrodynamics are significantly altered in future scenarios in our proposed alternative model the empirically estimated outflows are used to calibrate a process based model of the sudd that can simulate outflows as an exploratory modeling exercise the sutcliffe and parks model was simulated and calibrated using our empirically estimated outflows for the 2000 to 2014 period that aligns with the satellite derived flood maps the hydrologic fluxes resulting from this simulation presented in section 4 1 were then compared to identify alternative model structures and relationships between variables that would support a process based model that aligns with the satellite observations of flooded area multiple versions of hydrologic processes were mathematically formulated and tested but only those that yielded significant improvements in model performance were maintained the final model that is proposed in this study is summarized next in our proposed model the original water balance equation largely remains the same except instead of the outflows discharging directly to the sudd exit water is transferred into a routing compartment therefore there are two coupled storage compartments described as follows d s 1 q i n q 12 a p e d t r d a d s 2 q 12 q o u t d t the differential terms were discretized into monthly increments to obtain equations 4 and 5 the storage simulation equations the modified area storage relationship is presented in equation 6 the flux between the two storage compartments is estimated according to equation 7 and is a function of the storage in s1 equation 8 estimates the sudd outflows and is a function of the storage in the routing compartment s2 4 s 1 k 1

difference in our proposed model is that both the flooded areas and the outflows are simulated jointly requiring the introduction of outflow storage relationships assumed linear the modified area storage relationship is still linear but has an intercept term and depends on the storage in the previous month our proposed model has six parameters that can be calibrated s1min d rmax αe αq12 and αqout s2min is not included as a parameter because it was calculated directly from the routing compartment storage requiring additional computations to ensure convergence to facilitate the calibration of the proposed model the area storage and storage flow relationships were substituted into the water balance equations which were then reformulated to obtain an interpretable linear system that could be efficiently computed an objective function was defined that quantifies the error between the simulated and estimated flooded areas and outflows additional terms quantify the differences in timing of intra annual fluctuations in the simulated and satellite observed flooded areas a final term was added to ensure that the storage in s1 and s2 is balanced over the simulation period the parameters that minimize the objective function were determined using an iterative global search approach starting with coarse discretizations of the parameters and moving to finer discretizations that were identified through a sensitivity analysis the computational model formulation objective function and calibration discretizations are presented in the supplemental material section s4 4 results 4 1 sutcliffe and parks model simulation a comparison between the simulated and satellite estimated flooded area estimates using the original sutcliffe and parks hydrologic model is presented in fig 10 the depth d and maximum soil water recharge depth rmax parameters were kept the same as the original values k 1 meter rmax 0 2 meters to be consistent with the existing model the same climatology et rates and the trmm precipitation estimates were applied to estimate the net flux over the flooded area extents and time variable depth of water that can infiltrate into the soil based on the satellite estimates of flooded area the existing model over estimates the extent of flooding especially from 2006 to 2009 and 2012 to 2014 additionally the maximum flood extent typically occurs one month too early according to the recent sutcliffe and brown study 2018 the earlier peak in areal extent might be more consistent with the historical sudd hydrodynamics before flooding expanded in the lower region and potentially caused backwater effects that impact the wetland storage and attenuation features however the simulated areas appear to adequately capture the 2009 to 2010 drought and the minimum flood extent for most years the estimated sudd outflows are also shown in fig 10 to illustrate that the relationship between the outflow and area is very weak because the area and storage are assumed linearly related the existing model cannot accurately simulate both the sudd flooded area and outflows from the single storage compartment 4 2 alternative model calibrations the proposed model summarized in equations 4 8 was calibrated according to the computational procedures outlined in the supplemental material section s4 both the trmm and chirps precipitation estimates were tested and the model was calibrated using alternative versions of the objective function to be minimized individual terms of the objective function were turned on and off using weights the general model behavior was similar for both precipitation datasets but chirps consistently resulted in lower objective function values matching the timing of the maximum and minimum flooded area was challenging in all simulations and these objective function terms appeared to dominate the calibration alternative calibrations that neglected the timing penalties were therefore implemented and the resulting flooded area time series more accurately captured the satellite observed intra annual fluctuations to evaluate the trade offs between simulating the flooded areas and outflows the model was also calibrated to each time series individually the optimal parameters and objective function values associated with these alternative simulations is provided in the supplemental material section s5 a visual summary and comparison of the most successful simulations is presented in fig 11 time series comparisons are shown for both the joint and individual flooded area and outflow calibrations although differences from alternative calibrations are relatively minor compared to the original sutcliffe and parks model the magnitude of errors associated with the simulated flooded area time series are much smaller and the timing of the peaks are more closely aligned despite neglecting these terms in the objective function however the new model often underestimates the magnitude of the intra annual fluctuation of the flooded area time series differences between the simulated and observed areas are very minor for some years especially 2006 to 2009 but the storage in s1 cannot recover for multiple years following the 2009 10 drought the reduced storage following the drought supports the outflow simulation again suggesting that some of the satellite based flooded area estimates are not truly connected to the main sudd water body that regulates the outflows scatter plots between the simulated and estimated areas and outflows and the fitted area storage and outflow storage relationships are presented in fig 12 and illustrate that the outflows can be simulated more accurately compared to the flooded areas non linear area storage and outflow storage relationships might yield some improvement in model performance but the scatter plots do not provide strong justification for this added complexity an additional measure of the accuracy of the outflow simulation is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient which compares the magnitude of the model residuals to the total variance of the observed flows nash sutcliffe 1970 values of 0 77 and 0 83 were achieved for the full model calibration and outflow only calibration respectively considered acceptable based on values that have been reported for many standard rainfall runoff models moriasi et al 2007 the outflow simulation would be improved if the flows were increased from 2003 to 2006 and 2012 to 2014 but this would come at the expense of over predicting outflows from 2000 to 2002 and 2009 to 2011 additional improvements are therefore believed to be limited by the hydrologic data that controls the inter annual trends the mild seasonal fluctuation in the simulated flooded area time series is largely controlled by the depth parameter found to be 1 2 meters from the joint calibration this is slightly larger than the 1 0 meter depth assumed by sutcliffe and parks fig 13 illustrates that the flooded area fluctuations increase for a depth parameter of 0 7 meters however the improved alignment in some years comes at the cost of overestimating the flooded area in other years including 2003 2007 and 2014 additionally the minimum flooded area is too high in many years and the storage still cannot recover in the years immediately following the drought the increased seasonal fluctuations in the surface water storage compartment s1 will carry over into the storage compartment that regulates the outflow s2 and reduce the alignment between estimated and simulated outflows 4 3 impact of data uncertainty on model simulations the impact of data uncertainty was assessed by simulating alternative flux estimates and evaluating the resulting variation in the simulated flooded area and outflow this analysis could not be implemented for the satellite derived flooded areas because the uncertainty cannot be quantified given currently available information additional research is needed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the connectivity algorithm that delineates the outer extents of flooding a priority area for future research the impact of the inflow uncertainty was evaluated using the monthly error distributions derived in section 3 1 4 an ensemble of inflow time series was produced by adding randomly sampled error from the distributions to the deterministic values the ensemble estimates were then applied to the calibrated hydrologic model to simulate the sudd flooded areas and outflows twelve of these simulations are displayed in fig 14 and are compared to the flooded areas and outflows used for the optimal model calibration the spread of the flooded area and outflow ensemble simulations demonstrates the significant impact of the inflow uncertainty on the modeled areas and outflows the variability of the simulated outflow ensemble is especially concerning when compared to the temporal variation of the outflows used to calibrate the model suggesting that the current parameterized model has limited predictive power the monthly distributions of the estimated outflows can be compared to the simulated outflows to qualitatively compare uncertainties associated with the outflow estimates with those ingrained in the model structure fig 15 includes the alternative calibration approaches and shows that the simulation often surpasses the 95 confidence interval of the distributions this result suggests that reducing the uncertainty of the outflow estimates would yield relatively minor improvements in model performance compared to improving the model structure each of the precipitation and et estimates presented in figs 3 and 4 were applied to evaluate the model sensitivity to these data inputs the resulting variations were relatively minor compared to the overall model discrepancies however these simulations likely misrepresent the true impact of the data uncertainty the precipitation data sources are dependent on the same in situ gauges for calibration and bias correction introducing correlations and reducing the range of these estimates in the absence of a significant amount of independent gauge data the true uncertainty of the precipitation data products cannot be quantified to simulate the alternate et estimates the model parameter αet was adjusted for each dataset to produce realistic water storage volumes and simulations that are consistent with the modeling approach this required re calibration limited the magnitude of variation in the simulated flooded areas and outflows the perceived uncertainty of the precipitation and pet data is also mitigated by the model structure considering these fluxes are weighted and therefore largely controlled by the simulated flooded area extents these analyses suggest that the most influential source of uncertainty in the proposed alternative model is the estimated sudd inflows and potentially the satellite derived flooded areas the results depicted in figure 16 illustrate that a stochastic model of the sudd would be more appropriate than the deterministic model with singular parameter values presented here the model parameter uncertainty was partially assessed through a seven fold model cross validation exercise described and presented in the supplement material section s5 however a more holistic analysis of parameter uncertainty could be achieved using a stochastic model that includes ensemble simulations of inflow precipitation and et and incorporates uncertainties of the estimated flooded areas and outflows using bayesian statistics the development of this stochastic model is another priority area for future research 4 4 attempted iterative model improvements potential improvements to the proposed alternative model were conceptualized formulated and tested but were ultimately not adopted based on their modest impact on the model performance measured with the objective function these experimental adjustments are described next to provide important insights on the current data and model limitations and to guide future research efforts 1 alternative forms of the storage area relationship were formulated and calibrated including a non linear relationship a multi variate linear model that depends on the area from multiple temporal lags and a non constant depth parameter the power term in the non linear model was optimal at a value close to one and the multivariate model more accurately captured the timing of the peak flooded area but severely attenuated the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations the merit of a non constant depth parameter was evaluated by simulating the model and calculating the time variable depth that would exactly match the observations however a significant pattern in the depth time series could not be identified 2 a two way groundwater flux was tested by introducing a term that is similar to the original groundwater recharge term but allows water to flow into the wetland as it is receding however the optimal parameter applied to this term was consistently zero 3 a third storage compartment for the area surrounding the sudd was formulated and tested to assess whether infiltration and surface runoff across the extents of the sudd basin play a significant role in the water balance previous studies on the sudd suggest that the soil type prevents significant lateral groundwater fluxes and that ponded water along the sudd s perimeter evaporates before it can travel into the main wetland water body petersen fohrer 2010 sutcliffe parks 1999 however the current model performance suggests that this physical process may be missing the third storage compartment tracked precipitation and et outside of the sudd flooded area using an approach similar to that of the main storage compartment excess rainfall could then enter the sudd according to a linear flux storage relationship that has one parameter this flux was only significant if a two or three month lag was applied which seems unrealistic considering the high et rates that would reduce the runoff volume additionally the magnitude of rainfall over the surrounding area was similar to that of the main sudd area so this additional flux cannot amplify the flooded area simulations for years that are underestimated without causing larger differences during years that are overestimated 4 a more complex representation of a third storage compartment for the area surrounding the sudd was then tested that allowed for a continuous two way flux between the main and outer compartments the magnitude and direction of the flux was based on a relative comparison between the simulated storages and the maximum storage in the outer compartment treated as a model parameter the calibrated model significantly improved the alignment between the observed and simulated flooded areas however the optimal parameters made the storage in the outer compartment unstable and the water volume was forced into a negative range the barriers associated with each of the model prototypes highlight limitations of the hydrologic data the three compartment model might prove to be physically sound if the satellite based flooded area maps separated areas that flood seasonally but do not contribute to the sudd outflow supporting the delineation of an inner storage compartment that regulates the outflow and an outer compartment that controls the peak seasonal flood extent gridded precipitation data that more accurately captures the spatial variability of rainfall in the sudd would support a model that simulates regional flooding and runoff processes within and around the wetland 5 discussion and conclusion recall that the overarching goal of this study was to explore the potential for using satellite data to develop a hydrologic model of the sudd wetland that can inform water resources planning the approach to achieving this goal emphasized i careful consideration of the uncertainty in satellite derived estimates of hydrologic variables ii evaluating data and results in the context of existing field level knowledge and fundamental water balance analyses iii an iterative model development process where adjustments are introduced and assessed incrementally and iv balancing model complexity with data uncertainty a significant focus of this study was the estimation of the sudd fluxes and flows during the 2000 to 2018 period that aligns with the satellite derived flooded area time series the hydrologic variables could not be assessed for accuracy individually using currently available in situ data however their consistency was evaluated by comparing the net wetland water storage to the satellite flood maps this analysis highlighted significant differences in magnitude between the storage and flooded area that cannot be resolved with a process based model regardless of its complexity these differences may be partially attributed to flooded areas that appear to be connected to the main wetland area from satellite imagery but are not be hydrologically connected to the water body that regulates the outflows considering that the precipitation and et fluxes are weighted by the areal flood extents errors in the flood maps have a significant impact on the monthly fluxes the flooded area estimates therefore have a significant impact on model simulations and improving them is a priority for future research toward this goal additional satellite data sources could be integrated into the modis based inundation classification algorithm di vittorio georgakakos 2018 synthetic aperture radar sar has been used classify flooded vegetation hess et al 2003 whitcomb et al 2009 although the sensitivity of reflectance to inundation depends on the sensor wavelength geometric and textural characteristics of the vegetation and the depth of underlying water bourgeau chavez et al 2005 pulvirenti et al 2011 l band rebelo et al 2012 and c band wilusz et al 2017 sar have been applied to the sudd to map inundated areas during the 2007 to 2011 period this data is not available for the full 2000 to 2019 period of interest in this study but combining concurrent optical and radar imagery could support more accurate flood maps for the sudd more recent flood detection algorithms are combining sentinel 1 c band launched in 2014 with landsat 8 optical imagery launched in 2013 devries et al 2020 in addition the connectivity of the flood maps could be studied using imagery with a higher spatial resolution than modis 500 meter such as landsat 30 meter the existing algorithm could be applied to cloud free landsat imagery that is concurrent with modis to identify spatial patterns and assess whether they are discernable in modis if these patterns are identifiable and consistent over time a new algorithm could be developed to more accurately capture the monthly inundated areas that are hydrologically connected to the sudd another significant limitation in this study was the lack of in situ flow records at the sudd entrance and exit during the 2000 to 2018 period recall that the sudd inflows were primarily derived from upstream flow records at laropi that were gap filled using satellite altimetry and regression models flows that enter the nile between laropi and the sudd entrance were produced using a lumped rainfall runoff model for the torrents basin introducing more uncertainty into the final inflow estimates inflow ensembles were produced to conceptualize the impact of flow uncertainty on the hydrologic model the resulting flooded areas and outflow simulations showed a wide range of variability demonstrating the need for accurate in situ flow records at the sudd entrance flow records near the sudd exit were also not available so the outflows were estimated directly from the inflows using a statistical autoregressive model that was calibrated to historical flows considering the dependence between inflows and outflows the sudd outflow estimates are also highly uncertain independent observations of the sudd exit flows would provide a valuable calibration dataset and support the development of a more reliable hydrologic model this study leveraged multiple satellite and gauge based precipitation and et datasets and compared them through the exploratory water balance assessments and alternative model calibration scenarios these analyses suggested that chirps precipitation and the hargreaves et estimates were most consistent with the other hydrologic fluxes but none of the products nor their combinations resolved larger inconsistencies between the flooded area and net flux estimates in addition neither chirps nor trmm seemed to capture the spatial variability needed to develop a more complex hydrologic model that simulates runoff in regions surrounding the wetland this idea is supported by the inconsistencies observed between the gridded precipitation estimates and the satellite inundation maps see supplemental material section s3 while improved precipitation and et estimates could improve the final hydrologic model differences in model behavior would be relatively minor considering the uncertainty in the estimated inflows and outflows that drive the sudd hydrology recall that the precipitation and et uncertainty are mitigated in the proposed alternative hydrologic model with the actual et calibration parameter that enables a stable multi year hydrologic simulation prior to developing an alternative hydrologic model the existing sutcliffe and parks model was simulated with the estimated precipitation et flooded areas and flows this simulation served as a benchmark and a tool the storage flooded area and flow time series were analyzed and compared to identify alternative flux relationships observations from the existing model simulation led us to implement the following structural changes in the final alternative model i introduce a routing storage compartment that controls the outflows allowing the first compartment to regulate the flooded area only ii modify the area storage relationship to include an intercept term and a one month lag that captures the time required for flood waters to reach the outer extents of the wetland and iii construct storage flow relationships that allow the model to simulate the sudd outflows as opposed to requiring them as a model input more complex model structures that include additional storage compartments non linear relationships and additional parameters were conceptualized mathematically and computationally formulated and tested however these modifications could not be justified with a significant improvement in model accuracy considering known data uncertainties this exploratory analysis provides guidance on the development of a more complex model and suggests performance metrics might increase with the addition of a third storage compartment that allows for the exchange of surface water and shallow groundwater flows along the sudd boundary the ability to develop and calibrate this model depends on the availability of flood maps that more accurately delineate areas that are hydrologically connected to the main sudd storage compartment that regulates the outflows precipitation estimates that include more spatial variability would also support the development of a three compartment model in the absence of better data and a more complex model the uncertainty of each hydrologic variable could be quantified to enable the development of a stochastic model that uses distributions of the model parameters to capture the full potential range of flooded area and outflow simulations this approach would better communicate unresolved data model structure and parameter uncertainties compared to the deterministic model presented in this study in conclusion the satellite based estimates of flooded area precipitation and et allowed alternative models with increasing levels of complexity to be formulated and compared however the complexity of the final proposed model was limited by low confidence in the hydrologic data this research demonstrated the importance of integrating prior conceptual knowledge and holistic water balance assessments into the model development process to avoid overfitting a physically complex model that misrepresents the true wetland hydrology despite ongoing limitations and the need for future research the model introduced in this study improves upon the current representation of the sudd in the nile dst and would support long

8171,study region the sudd wetland located in south sudan within the nile river basin study focus this study combines limited in situ data with satellite based estimates of wetland inundation extents precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to develop a hydrologic model of the sudd wetland holistic water balance assessments were integrated into the model development process to balance data uncertainty with model complexity an existing model grounded in historical observations served as the foundation for an alternative model that simulates the sudd flooded area and outflow model improvements were formulated and tested incrementally through an iterative procedure resulting in new insights on the sudd hydrology and ideas for future model improvements new hydrological insights for the region the recent satellite derived hydrologic data suggests that the existing sudd model over predicts the areal flood extents and does not accurately capture the storage attenuation characteristics of the wetland however the remotely sensed information is highly uncertainty and somewhat inconsistent in terms of the sudd water balance limiting the complexity of an alternative model model simulations and analyses suggest that the model structure and performance could be substantially improved if more accurate estimates of the sudd inflows and wetland inundation extents could be derived a significant challenge is the need to distinguish between areas that are physically connected to the sudd water body but likely not hydrologically connected and contributing to the main water body that regulates the outflows keywords wetlands hydrologic modeling nile river basin remote sensing satellites uncertainty assessments modeling framework 1 introduction and background despite their highly valued services costanza et al 2014 mitsch et al 2009 wetland areas have disappeared at an alarming rate over the twentieth century millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 and future degradation is expected to continue considering population growth rates and climate induced water scarcity fao 2016 wwap 2018 water resources managers should consider social economic and environmental wetland services when evaluating alternative infrastructure development and water management plans that impact wetland areas however wetlands are rarely integrated into decision support tools that stakeholders use for basin wide planning and decision making a significant challenge for integrating wetlands into these tools is the limited availability and accuracy of process based hydrologic models that simulate how wetlands respond to variations in flows and environmental conditions the need for a reliable wetland model that can be applied to basin wide planning is especially true for the sudd wetland in south sudan part of the nile river basin the sudd plays a critical role in water quality and quantity within the basin but its representation is limited in basin planning tools such as the nile decision support tool dst georgakakos et al 2003 stakeholders use the nile dst to develop long term management strategies and determine reservoir operating rules that control water supply throughout the basin the nile dst estimates river flows associated with alternative scenarios and translates flow quantities into socio economic metrics the metrics represent the perceived benefits from competing water uses including hydropower irrigation and municipal use and facilitate stakeholder conversations on trade offs to enable data driven decision making in this sensitive world region the nile dst currently quantifies the amount of water flowing through the sudd using statistical models calibrated to historic inflow and outflow data however the tool lacks a process based model of the sudd that simulates hydrologic variables that are important to local stakeholders such as the time variable flood extents a more comprehensive and process based wetland model would allow decision makers to more carefully consider the sudd response to alternative management and climate scenarios the nile river and sudd wetland were studied extensively throughout most of the twentieth century and in situ flow records throughout the basin are available from 1905 to 1984 a proposed canal project that would have diverted significant portions of the nile flows around the sudd motivated field campaigns howell et al 1988 and supported the development of a hydrologic model of the wetland sutcliffe parks 1987 1999 this lumped mass balance model used historical measurements of flow and precipitation to simulate the wetland inundated area and was used to assess the potential impact of the canal on areal flood extents the resulting multi decadal monthly flooded area time series 1905 1980 was validated using flooded area estimates derived from four individual aerial and satellite images acquired in 1931 1952 1973 and 1980 sutcliffe and brown 2018 later applied this model to delineated sub basins within the sudd using historical flow data that was available at stations between the sudd entrance and exit the sub basin models could not be extended past 1964 due to inconsistent flow records and significant changes to the wetland geomorphology a result of hydrologic changes in region during this period and a drastic increase in the sudd flows a comparison between the historical simulated areas for each sub basin and inundated areas derived from a 1983 satellite image led sutcliffe and brown to believe that the increased flows caused backwater effects at the sudd exit and larger inundated areas in the downstream portions of the sudd this existing model of the sudd is grounded in historical in situ data and was developed by expert hydrologists however the availability of satellite information presents new opportunities to thoroughly evaluate the existing model using more recently available data this study uses satellite derived estimates of the sudd hydrologic variables to evaluate the existing model and to explore alternative model formulations satellite based information can be integrated into the hydrologic model development and calibration process in various ways most often it is used for model inputs i e precipitation or for extracting basin information i e land cover maps xu et al 2014 satellite data can also be used to calibrate model parameters by minimizing differences between model simulations and satellite observations of state variables salvucci entekhabi 2011 alternatively it can be used to more accurately estimate state variables using data assimilation techniques that consider model and observation errors jointly crow et al 2017 crow ryu 2009 draper et al 2012 reichle et al 2002 these applications are often implemented in rainfall runoff models some of which have embedded wetland modeling components hattermann et al 2006 liu et al 2008 muhammad et al 2019 rahman et al 2016 wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 although model calibration is generally focused on matching outflows as opposed to the wetland processes satellite information can also support reservoir release and river discharge modeling if it is used to derive area elevation curves from satellite altimetry and satellite estimated open water extents eldardiry hossain 2019 muala et al 2014 these elevation and areal inundation estimates can also be applied to spatially distributed hydrodynamic wetland models when combined with digital elevation models dems a hydrodynamic model was developed for a portion of the sudd but inaccuracies in the dem limited its utility for quantitative analyses petersen 2005 petersen fohrer 2010 the lisflood fp hydrodynamic model bates de roo 2000 was designed to run seamlessly with satellite based data and has been applied to the niger delta using in situ flow measurements water surface elevations estimated from satellite altimetry and inundation extents estimated from landsat imagery neal et al 2012 however discrepancies between the satellite and modeled inundation extents were significant and manual adjustments were made to the dem to ensure connectivity across the delta this study demonstrated that satellite based information can support the calibration of complex process based models but developers should assess whether simulations are consistent with existing knowledge of a wetland s behavior the goal of this study is to explore the potential for using satellite data to develop a hydrologic model of the sudd wetland that can inform water resources planning the uncertainty of the satellite derived information is carefully considered throughout an iterative model development process to identify model limitations determine an appropriate level of model complexity and to prioritize areas for future research the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief background on the sudd wetland section 3 describes our methods which includes i an extensive explanation of how the sudd fluxes and flows were estimated ii a comparison of the fluxes and flows to conceptualize the sudd hydrology and limitations imposed by data uncertainties and iii a summary of the model development process section 4 reports and illustrates the calibrated model simulations and the ongoing model limitations induced by data uncertainties section 5 provides a discussion of the results and makes recommendations for future research 2 sudd wetland the sudd wetland is downstream of lake victoria and lake albert in the nile river basin the sudd contains a large permanently flooded area that expands when water is released from upstream lakes that are primarily regulated according to hydropower demands the inflows to the sudd are further augmented from seasonal runoff known as the torrents that enter just upstream of the sudd entrance during the wet season the sudd nearly doubles in size as the increased flow spills outside of the permanently flooded area and continues outward fig 1 shows the location of the sudd within the nile river basin and the extents of the permanently and seasonally flooded areas due to the high evaporation rates and a lack of rainfall for extended periods only about half of the inflows reach the sudd exit during these high flow periods howell et al 1988 sutcliffe parks 1987 the wetland flooding regime has defined the livelihoods of over 1 million people who live in the sudd region unep 2018 these nomadic communities have come to rely on the seasonal flooding to regenerate the grasslands that support their cattle their primary source of food and income howell et al 1988 the nile basin countries are already using most of the consumable water in their watershed the majority of which meets irrigation needs in downstream arid countries sudan and egypt based on forecasted population growth water demand is expected to increase five fold by 2030 fao 2016 as water scarcity increases in severity the nile countries might consider altering the sudd hydrology through development initiatives to augment downstream flows such as the jonglei canal project the jonglei canal was designed to divert a significant amount of the nile flow around the sudd to reduce evaporative losses construction of the canal began in the late 1970s but was canceled due to the second sudanese civil war sutcliffe parks 1999 the potential social economic and environmental impacts of the canal were studied through field data collection campaigns howell et al 1988 and modeling initiatives sutcliffe and parks 1987 1999 simulated potential jonglei canal operating scenarios using their hydrologic model and found that a 15 reduction of average annual flow could reduce the areal extent of seasonal flooding by up to 21 this reduction in flooded area is significant considering it reduces the area that is available for grazing the life support of the local community therefore development initiatives should be carefully assessed in terms of the trade offs between local and downstream benefits and how they are impacted if the sudd hydrology is altered while new hydrologic data sources are globally available due to the advancement of satellite technology the amount of in situ data in the sudd region has declined as a result of ongoing political conflict many of the nile countries no longer publicly share flow data and in situ measurements in the sudd region have been abandoned since the 1980 s the global runoff data center https grdc bafg de illustrates that flows are unavailable throughout the basin after 1985 in situ measurements of precipitation and evaporation ceased when the jonglei canal project came to a halt unfortunately the country of south sudan is still economically and politically stressed and has little incentive to re invest in data collection for water management using satellite information to fill spatial and temporal gaps in hydrologic information is therefore critical to advancing water resources planning in this region 3 methodology 3 1 estimation of fluxes and flows based on previous research estimates of the wetland flooded areas precipitation evapotranspiration inflows and outflows are required to realistically model the sudd these flux estimates were obtained from a variety of data sources and methods described here in sufficient detail to provide insight on the data uncertainties that were a key consideration during the hydrologic model development 3 1 1 flooded area extents quantifying the time variable flood extents of the sudd is critical to understanding the wetland s hydrology and socio economic benefits large seasonal flood pulses support the livelihoods of local inhabitants but also increase evaporation rates and reduce downstream flows in situ monitoring of the sudd inundation patterns is infeasible considering the size and accessibility of the area however satellite data can be leveraged to estimate the flooded area with consistent spatial and temporal resolutions that can be integrated into hydrologic models toward this goal a novel multi temporal wetland land cover classification and inundation mapping algorithm was developed in a previous study and applied to the sudd di vittorio georgakakos 2018 the method uses 18 years of moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis land surface reflectance data to first classify land cover types and identify areas that are likely to flood before producing monthly flood maps considering optical remote sensing reflectance measurements are dominated by vegetation as opposed to water gao 1996 pulvirenti et al 2011 a key challenge of the monthly flood detection algorithm was detecting flooding beneath vegetation canopies flooded areas were therefore detected by comparing the satellite derived wetness index of a pixel to those of an ensemble of nearby pixels that have the same vegetation cover and have received similar amounts of rainfall the flood detection classification algorithm was performed on a pixel by pixel basis throughout the area and pixels that were physically connected through adjacent pixels to the main wetland water body were considered part of the sudd water balance assuming a physical connection indicates whether a hydrologic connection is present this connectivity algorithm should distinguish between pixels that are temporarily flooded from large rain events and those that are connected to the water body that regulates the sudd outflows this distinction is necessary to formulate a hydrologic model that can simulate both the flooded areas and the outflows however the ability to make this distinction using modis satellite imagery was revisited during the model development process the final time series of the modis derived sudd flooded areas is shown in fig 2 since the original study was published di vittorio georgakakos 2018 the time series has been extended to march 2019 and an algorithm was added to identify when permanently flooded pixels are temporarily dry slightly reducing the minimum flood extents of the sudd during very dry years these areal estimates also incorporate the corrections described in section 3 2 implemented during the hydrologic model development process the accuracy of the monthly sudd flooded areas was evaluated using limited in situ observations and a statistical time series comparison between the flooded area and the estimated net storage changes in the wetland the resulting performance metrics were strong and the time series behavior of the flooded area was consistent with qualitative descriptions of the sudd hydrology from previous studies howell et al 1988 petersen fohrer 2010 sutcliffe parks 1987 however limitations of the inundation algorithm should be considered while developing the sudd hydrologic model to assess potential impacts of data uncertainty on model simulations these limitations are briefly described next and opportunities to address them are described in section 5 an inability to fully detect when areas with dense vegetation that are typically flooded year round temporarily become dry the algorithm might be detecting differences in vegetation growth cycles in addition to flooding beneath vegetation considering satellite derived wetness indices measure moisture content in vegetation in addition to flooding beneath the vegetation the algorithm does not consider the impact of human controlled burning practices howell et al 1988 on the satellite derived wetness index that is used for flood detection the spatial resolution of modis imagery 500 meters limits the ability to determine whether adjacent pixels that are flooded are truly connected 3 1 2 precipitation the sudd region has distinct wet and dry seasons with precipitation generally occurring from april to october and peaking in july august the average net annual precipitation over the sudd from 1941 to 1970 was estimated as 871 mm sutcliffe parks 1999 calculated from measurements at 9 in situ stations in the sudd region the global surface summary of day gsod and the global precipitation climatology center gpcc databases show that current gauge data is available at two remaining locations in the sudd region juba just south of mongalla and malakal near the sudd exit this gauge data is used to develop and bias correct gridded precipitation data products but the sparsity of gauges in this region introduces large uncertainties several global gridded precipitation data products exist that use in situ gauges satellite observations and interpolation strategies global and regional accuracy assessments of these products vary widely and are sensitive to variations in geography and climate multiple studies conducted in sparsely gauged areas of africa have found that the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm products perform well awange et al 2016 cattani et al 2016 thiemig et al 2012 although cattani et al cautioned that results may be biased towards trmm since the same gauges that are used to calibrate trmm products are often used in accuracy assessments cattani et al evaluated the signal to noise ratio of six products without using gauge data and found that precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann africa rainfall climatology version 2 0 arcv2 and trmm were the top three performers in that order another reliable product is climate hazards infrared precipitation with stations chirps found to outperform trmm when compared to independent weather stations in the serengeti mahony et al 2021 a comparison of independent gauges with multiple satellite based products in the ethiopian highlands showed that chirps performed best overall followed by trmm arcv2 and then persiann bayissa et al 2017 based on results from these regional studies five different data products were used to estimate precipitation rates over the sudd flooded area including trmm 3b43 persiann arcv2 and chirps in addition to the satellite based products the climate research unit cru was chosen as a comparison product that relies entirely on a robust in situ database a description of each of these products and their data dependencies is provided in the supplemental materials section s1 each data product was clipped to the modis derived sudd flooded area and averaged to obtain time series of monthly cumulative precipitation rates the monthly mean estimates over the 2000 to 2018 period are compared to the historical monthly mean climatology precipitation estimates sutcliffe parks 1999 in the left panel of fig 3 persiann estimates are significantly greater than all others and appear to have a significant bias trmm and cru estimates are most similar to the monthly climatology calculated from the in situ gauges since current gauge data recorded at juba and malakal are used in the development of some of these products they should not be used to assess relative accuracies however a study on the sudd performed by petersen and fohrer 2010 included daily in situ precipitation measurements recorded from april 2004 to november 2005 at a station in the southern portion of the sudd this data was provided to us by petersen and compared to the corresponding pixel in the gridded precipitation data products the five data products evaluated in this study are compared with these in situ measurements in the right panel of fig 3 statistical metrics comparing the differences between products are displayed in table 1 trmm produced the lowest mean absolute error 24 mm and a high correlation coefficient 0 85 although less than that of arcv2 0 87 and cru has the lowest mean bias surprisingly chirps did not perform well compared to the other products spatial maps of monthly precipitation in august 2004 and average net annual precipitation are included in the supplemental materials section s1 to show how the different products compare spatially the gauge comparison is limited considering the spatial aggregation from point to pixel and the unknown accuracy of the gauge measurements however there are general consistencies between the independent gauge data and data products that cover the full sudd area suggesting that the gridded products can reliably inform a hydrologic model of the sudd this limited comparison was not used to determine the most accurate product but rather to provide general insights on the strengths and limitations of different estimates and to conceptualize the range of uncertainty ingrained in available gridded precipitation products 3 1 3 evapotranspiration et previous studies have demonstrated the importance of the et flux in the sudd hydrologic balance et rates in the sudd have been studied since the early 1900 s and estimates have varied widely early experiments focused on measuring water losses from papyrus samples in tanks leading to a wide range of annual rates from 1533 mm to 2760 mm sutcliffe parks 1999 in the sutcliffe and parks study an annual et rate of 2150 mm was estimated using the penman equation for open water informed with in situ data this et rate generally agreed with a water budget analysis using historical flow data and precipitation measurements petersen and fohrer 2010 collected data during their 2005 study and applied the penman monteith equation to grasslands to produce an annual et rate of 2077 mm mohammed 2006 rebelo 2012 and wilusz et al 2017 used satellite and weather station data to inform surface energy balance models and estimated annual et rates of 1636 mm 1697 mm and 1210 mm respectively in this study four alternative estimates of the sudd et rates were calculated or extracted from existing databases including the cru refence crop et hargreaves estimated et potential et calculated from the maximum entropy production mep method and actual et from the global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam a description of the algorithms and data sources for each product is provided in the supplemental materials section s1 the data sources and approaches were chosen to capture the large range of potential values and seasonal trends that have been reported in previous studies the cru et product and the cru informed hargreaves estimates leverage a large historical in situ database and should therefore reliably capture consistent seasonal trends the hargreaves formulation is the simplest approach and only requires temperature to estimate et the more complex maximum entropy production mep method uses an energy balance approach and the global land surface evaporation the amsterdam method gleam is the most complex as it relies on both energy and water balance models similar to the precipitation analysis each gridded et estimate was clipped to the sudd flooded area and averaged to obtain monthly et estimates from 2000 to 2018 the monthly mean et rates are displayed and compared to the sutcliffe and parks 1999 climatology et in fig 4 fig 4 highlights the substantial differences between et estimates the sutcliffe and parks and cru monthly mean estimates are most correlated an unsurprising result considering they are both based on the penman and penman monteith formulations however there is a significant bias of 50 100 mm per month due to the assumptions of open water versus short grass many et formulations reduce loss rates when vegetation is present however et in densely vegetated wetland areas could be twice as high as that in open water areas lott hunt 2001 the hargreaves estimates are also based on grassy vegetation but are of similar magnitude to that of sutcliffe and park with a different intra annual trend the mep values are similar in magnitude to those of the cru however the time series lacks a distinct seasonal fluctuation the gleam estimates contrast greatly with the others a consequence of the water limitation calculated in the soil moisture accounting module of the gleam model considering et was averaged over areas known to be flooded the gleam estimates are not considered appropriate for the sudd model and demonstrate that et data sources must be carefully assessed prior to application the large amount of variability shown in fig 4 is consistent with results from et comparison studies jimenez et al 2011 mueller et al 2013 all estimates except gleam were considered during the modelling process to identify those that are most consist with other input data sources and the logic underlying the process based model a calibration factor was also be applied to each et estimate to account for the different types of vegetation in the sudd that impact actual et rates the calibrated parameter adjusts the magnitude of the et flux to ensure that the sudd water fluxes can be balanced but does not impact the seasonality of the estimates shown in fig 4 3 1 4 inflows and outflows the nile river stations that are relevant to the sudd inflow and outflow estimation methods are displayed in fig 1 the sub basin areas between stations were derived from the hydrosheds database www hydrosheds org mongalla is considered the entrance to the sudd and malakal is the location closest to the sudd exit where historical nile flows have been measured just upstream of malakal the sobat river enters the white nile therefore the sobat flows must be subtracted from malakal flows to obtain the sudd outflows the area to the west of the sudd known as the bahr el ghazal is delineated from lake no and is also characterized as an area that contains wetlands and a very flat topography in situ hydrologic data in this region is not available however historical field measurements and observations at lake no suggest that flows from the bahr el ghazal into the sudd are negligible sutcliffe parks 1987 1999 countries within the nile basin have not shared flow data publicly since the 1980 s and the limited in situ data records that exist are often not well maintained especially in conflict prone countries such as south sudan the sudd inflows and outflows that align with the satellite based areal flood extents therefore had to be estimated using relationships derived from historical data and limited flow records at upstream stations historical flow records throughout the nile river basin are listed in the nile basin volumes hurst et al 1932 a slightly modified version of these records that is believed to contain more accurate values was provided to us by egyptian ministry of water resources and irrigation the inflows from 2000 to 2015 were largely derived from measured flows at laropi provided to us by the ugandan ministry of water and environment the dataset was available from february 2000 to march 2011 on a daily temporal resolution although there were some temporal gaps in situ lake albert levels were also provided by the uganda ministry along with reservoir release rules that can be used to translate lake levels to flow at packwach between laropi and the sudd entrance at mongalla the white nile receives runoff from seasonal rainfall known as the torrents based on historical flow data from 1961 1980 the torrents account for approximately 10 of the total annual sudd inflows the seasonality of the torrents aligns with the period of extensive flooding within the sudd and this additional inflow is believed to impact the extent of the seasonally flooded wetland area sutcliffe parks 1999 the following steps summarize the procedures implemented to derive the sudd inflows for the 2000 to 2015 period a timeline summary of the data sources is provided in fig 5 1 lake albert levels were gap filled using satellite altimetry observations available from jan 2000 to april 2015 from hydroweb crétaux et al 2011 and a fitted linear relationship between the in situ and satellite based observations 2 the gap filled lake levels were converted to flows at packwach using the provided reservoir release rules 3 the missing laropi flows were estimated from the packwach flows using a third order polynomial regression model that was calibrated using historical flow records 4 the torrents flow that enters between laropi and mongalla was produced using a simple lumped rainfall runoff model calibrated with historical torrents estimates the model was informed by the cru precipitation and et database the calibrated model produced a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 621 and a spearman s rank correlation coefficient of 0 892 similar to most rainfall runoff models model errors are largest during peak flow periods a more thorough explanation and presentation of this model is presented in the supplemental material section s2 5 the sudd inflows at mongalla were estimated using an autoregressive model that depends on the laropi and torrent flows shown in equation 1 the model root mean square error is 11 64 mcm day the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 777 the model r squared is 0 57 and the lag 1 autocorrelation of the residuals is 0 13 a comparison between the historical and simulated mongalla flows was leveraged to derive month error distributions assumed normally distributed and

an autoregressive model for the sudd losses inflows outflows shown in equation 2 the sudd outflows can then be computed by subtracting the losses from the inflows this approach for estimating the outflows is identical to that of the nile dst a statistical analysis was also performed to derive the sudd outflows from in situ malakal flow records available from 2000 to 2011 but uncertainties were larger than that of the autoregressive model similar to the inflow uncertainty analysis the simulated outflows were compared to the historical outflows to derive monthly error distributions 2 q l s s

panel of fig 6 these distributions were employed for ensemble simulations of the hydrologic model to assess the impact of data uncertainty 3 2 comparison of fluxes and flows for data uncertainty and model structure assessments prior to formulating a hydrologic model of the sudd the time series estimates of the sudd fluxes and flows were evaluated and compared in order to i assess the alignment between data and historical descriptions of the sudd hydrology ii conceptualize a model structure that is appropriate for the sudd hydrology iii identify which precipitation and et estimates are most consistent with the sudd flooded areas and flows and iv hypothesize the challenges and limitations of modeling the sudd using uncertain satellite based information using the sudd flooded area a precipitation p et and flow estimates derived in section 3 1 a time series of the storage change in the sudd can be estimated as δ s k q i n k q o u t k a k p k e t k for each time step k based on the foundational concept that the wetland area should increase as the net hydrologic flux increases the storage change δ s and the satellite derived flooded area time series a should be correlated a maximum correlation coefficient of 0 83 was found if the flooded area is shifted back four months this lag is consistent with historical data assessments within the sudd sutcliffe parks 1999 and reflects the flat topography and slow travel time petersen fohrer 2010 of water that is stored within the wetland the existing hydrologic model sutcliffe parks 1987 1999 assumes a linear relationship between the wetland storage and area for each month formulated as s k d a k where d is a constant parameter that represents the average water depth considering the four month lag required to achieve a high correlation between the storage and flooded area the existing model is not expected to capture the timing of the seasonal flood pulse observed with satellite imagery this analysis supported the conceptualization of an alternative model that contains a routing compartment and a temporal lag in the storage area relationship presented in section 3 3 the significance of this 0 83 correlation coefficient was tested by comparing it to a distribution of correlation coefficients that were generated from randomly sampled flooded area time series the artificial flooded areas were created by separating the original time series by each hydrologic year april to march and piecing together randomly selected years with replacement thereby maintaining the seasonal behavior of the original data the resulting p value was 0 4 suggesting that the consistency between the storage change and flooded area is significant despite limitations of the satellite derived fluxes in addition to the time series comparison the net annual storage change and flooded areas were calculated to compare the data without the influence of intra annual trends conceptually years with larger net annual storage changes should also contain larger flooded areas the annual sums were calculated from april to march to align with the dry season minimums and the minimum flooded area was subtracted from the area time series to emphasize differences between years the comparison is presented in fig 8 and shows that some years have very high correspondence but the years 2002 to 2003 and 2004 to 2008 show large differences in magnitude based on this observation the satellite derived flooded area maps were closely analyzed to identify patterns and differences across the time series that might explain this behavior this analysis resulted in an adjustment procedure to the flooded area time series that is described in section s3 of the supplemental material the resulting revised net annual flooded area and storage change for the 2003 to 2008 period are shown in fig 8 illustrating a slight reduction in the differences the exploratory analysis described in the supplemental material largely focused on evaluating the connectivity of the satellite derived flooded areas patterns in time series animations of the areal flood and precipitation maps were studied to develop a more comprehensive data adjustment procedure however the patterns were inconsistent and sometimes illogical suggesting that that the sudd flooded area and precipitation maps likely contain significant errors this conclusion greatly influenced the hydrologic model development where the achievement of high model performance metrics was balanced against the potential for overfitting a model to uncertain data the comparisons depicted in figs 7 and 8 were implemented for each combination of the precipitation and et estimates described in section 3 1 to identify which products produced a net storage change that was most consistent with the satellite derived flooded area estimates the chirps precipitation and the hargreaves et estimates resulted in the highest linear correlation coefficient 0 83 and the smallest p value 0 4 for the full time series comparison the trmm and hargreaves combination also had a high correlation coefficient 0 81 and low p value 0 7 the net annual flux correlation coefficient was highest for the trmm and hargreaves combination 0 58 followed closely by the chirps and hargreaves combination 0 56 considering only a general comparison can be implemented to infer which data products are most accurate in the absence of more in situ data the analysis presented here suggests that both chirps and trmm precipitation and hargreaves et will support the development of a hydrologic model that is most consistent with available information both precipitation datasets were therefore used to develop and calibrate the hydrologic model 3 3 hydrologic model development conceptualizing a hydrologic model of the sudd should be begin with historical data and field observations reported in the literature previous studies howell et al 1988 petersen fohrer 2010 sutcliffe parks 1999 highlight the following key features of the wetland i the area is very flat and lacks prominent ridgelines resulting in an unbounded flood region ii the vertisol soils limit the magnitude and depth of groundwater flows but deep surface cracks develop on the ground surface during the dry season that must be filled before surface flooding occurs iii the rainy season within the sudd typically begins in march and ends in november iv the maximum areal extent of flooding in the sudd is believed to be primarily controlled by the sudd inflows which are augmented from august to december and v et rates are extremely important in the wetland water balance and are also highly uncertain although they are most significant during the dry season november to march and net et rates must exceed precipitation rates to explain the differences between the sudd inflows and outflows the sutcliffe and parks model 1987 1999 continues to be referenced in more recent studies mohamed et al 2006 petersen fohrer 2010 rebelo et al 2012 sutcliffe brown 2018 and appears to be the most widely accepted hydrologic representation of the sudd a conceptual schematic of the model is provided in fig 9 model inputs consisted of measured flow at the sudd entrance and precipitation that occurs over the flooded area model outputs consisted of the sudd exit flows estimated from in situ data at downstream gauges climatology et rates multiplied by the flooded area extents and vertical infiltration into the ground surface cracks over newly flooded areas the sudd flooded area was then calculated from the monthly storage volume assuming a linear relationship between area and volume and a constant depth of water in the wetland this simple area storage relationship is based on observations of the topography and the idea that the wetland area continues to expand outward instead of filling up a bounded area the sutcliffe and parks model parameters were calibrated by comparing flooded area estimates from the model to estimates that were derived from aerial imagery on four individual dates the calibrated parameters yielded a stable water mass balance and a reasonable fit according to the four data points however the continuous time series of the satellite derived flooded area can be leveraged to more thoroughly evaluate the sutcliffe and parks model and assess whether additional hydrologic processes or alternative representations of them should be implemented because the existing model was conceptualized from in situ data and field observations it serves as an excellent foundation to build upon the flooded area time series animation analysis and net hydrologic flux comparison summarized in section 3 2 provided valuable insights that guided the development of an alternative model the temporal lag between the net hydrologic flux and the flooded area extents indicates that additional storage compartments may be needed to capture the storage and attenuation characteristics of the wetland the temporal lag might also be resolved if additional hydrologic processes were integrated such as allowing water from previously flooded areas to re enter the main sudd water body through surface water or groundwater exchanges non linear relationships between the storage and area and the fluxes between storage compartments might also yield improved accuracy metrics each of these potential model adjustments were conceptualized formulated and implemented and improved accuracy metrics were balanced against model complexity in the context of the known limitations and uncertainties of the input data a broad overview of the mathematical models that were formulated and simulated in this study is provided next more detailed derivations of these models and explanations of how they were implemented computationally are provided in the supplemental materials section s4 the sutcliffe and parks 1987 1999 water balance of the sudd was formulated as follows d s q i n q o u t a p e d t r d a where s storage m3 q i n sudd inflows m3 month q o u t sudd outflows m3 month a flooded area of wetland m2 p precipitation over flooded area m month e evaporation over flooded area m month t time month r soil water recharge depth m the differential equation was discretized the area term a was replaced with the linear area storage relationship and terms were re arranged to derive an explicit expression for the storage at time k 1 s k 1 as follows 3 s k 1 s k 1 1 d r k 1 2 e k p k q i n k q o u t k 1 1 d r k 1 2 e k p k sutcliffe and parks simulated this model from 1905 to 1983 with measured inflows and outflows monthly rainfall records averaged over eight stations within the sudd area and the climatology monthly evaporation rates the soil moisture recharge depth represents the depth of water that infiltrates into the clay soil over newly flooded areas and was calculated as the difference between the maximum recharge depth and the cumulative depth of precipitation that has occurred over the current year this model has only two parameters k and the maximum soil recharge depth rmax by manually adjusting the parameters sutcliffe and parks found that values of k 1 meter and rmax 0 2 meters provided the best fit between the estimated and simulated flooded areas the original model requires direct estimates of the sudd outflows limiting its utility for alternative management and climate scenario assessments the statistical relationship between the sudd inflows and outflows equation 2 could be applied to simulate the outflows however this relationship is not physically based and may no longer be valid if the sudd hydrodynamics are significantly altered in future scenarios in our proposed alternative model the empirically estimated outflows are used to calibrate a process based model of the sudd that can simulate outflows as an exploratory modeling exercise the sutcliffe and parks model was simulated and calibrated using our empirically estimated outflows for the 2000 to 2014 period that aligns with the satellite derived flood maps the hydrologic fluxes resulting from this simulation presented in section 4 1 were then compared to identify alternative model structures and relationships between variables that would support a process based model that aligns with the satellite observations of flooded area multiple versions of hydrologic processes were mathematically formulated and tested but only those that yielded significant improvements in model performance were maintained the final model that is proposed in this study is summarized next in our proposed model the original water balance equation largely remains the same except instead of the outflows discharging directly to the sudd exit water is transferred into a routing compartment therefore there are two coupled storage compartments described as follows d s 1 q i n q 12 a p e d t r d a d s 2 q 12 q o u t d t the differential terms were discretized into monthly increments to obtain equations 4 and 5 the storage simulation equations the modified area storage relationship is presented in equation 6 the flux between the two storage compartments is estimated according to equation 7 and is a function of the storage in s1 equation 8 estimates the sudd outflows and is a function of the storage in the routing compartment s2 4 s 1 k 1

parameter a schematic of our proposed model is provided alongside the existing model in fig 9 and a summary comparison with regards to data inputs and model structure is provided in table 2 a key difference in our proposed model is that both the flooded areas and the outflows are simulated jointly requiring the introduction of outflow storage relationships assumed linear the modified area storage relationship is still linear but has an intercept term and depends on the storage in the previous month our proposed model has six parameters that can be calibrated s1min d rmax αe αq12 and αqout s2min is not included as a parameter because it was calculated directly from the routing compartment storage requiring additional computations to ensure convergence to facilitate the calibration of the proposed model the area storage and storage flow relationships were substituted into the water balance equations which were then reformulated to obtain an interpretable linear system that could be efficiently computed an objective function was defined that quantifies the error between the simulated and estimated flooded areas and outflows additional terms quantify the differences in timing of intra annual fluctuations in the simulated and satellite observed flooded areas a final term was added to ensure that the storage in s1 and s2 is balanced over the simulation period the parameters that minimize the objective function were determined using an iterative global search approach starting with coarse discretizations of the parameters and moving to finer discretizations that were identified through a sensitivity analysis the computational model formulation objective function and calibration discretizations are presented in the supplemental material section s4 4 results 4 1 sutcliffe and parks model simulation a comparison between the simulated and satellite estimated flooded area estimates using the original sutcliffe and parks hydrologic model is presented in fig 10 the depth d and maximum soil water recharge depth rmax parameters were kept the same as the original values k 1 meter rmax 0 2 meters to be consistent with the existing model the same climatology et rates and the trmm precipitation estimates were applied to estimate the net flux over the flooded area extents and time variable depth of water that can infiltrate into the soil based on the satellite estimates of flooded area the existing model over estimates the extent of flooding especially from 2006 to 2009 and 2012 to 2014 additionally the maximum flood extent typically occurs one month too early according to the recent sutcliffe and brown study 2018 the earlier peak in areal extent might be more consistent with the historical sudd hydrodynamics before flooding expanded in the lower region and potentially caused backwater effects that impact the wetland storage and attenuation features however the simulated areas appear to adequately capture the 2009 to 2010 drought and the minimum flood extent for most years the estimated sudd outflows are also shown in fig 10 to illustrate that the relationship between the outflow and area is very weak because the area and storage are assumed linearly related the existing model cannot accurately simulate both the sudd flooded area and outflows from the single storage compartment 4 2 alternative model calibrations the proposed model summarized in equations 4 8 was calibrated according to the computational procedures outlined in the supplemental material section s4 both the trmm and chirps precipitation estimates were tested and the model was calibrated using alternative versions of the objective function to be minimized individual terms of the objective function were turned on and off using weights the general model behavior was similar for both precipitation datasets but chirps consistently resulted in lower objective function values matching the timing of the maximum and minimum flooded area was challenging in all simulations and these objective function terms appeared to dominate the calibration alternative calibrations that neglected the timing penalties were therefore implemented and the resulting flooded area time series more accurately captured the satellite observed intra annual fluctuations to evaluate the trade offs between simulating the flooded areas and outflows the model was also calibrated to each time series individually the optimal parameters and objective function values associated with these alternative simulations is provided in the supplemental material section s5 a visual summary and comparison of the most successful simulations is presented in fig 11 time series comparisons are shown for both the joint and individual flooded area and outflow calibrations although differences from alternative calibrations are relatively minor compared to the original sutcliffe and parks model the magnitude of errors associated with the simulated flooded area time series are much smaller and the timing of the peaks are more closely aligned despite neglecting these terms in the objective function however the new model often underestimates the magnitude of the intra annual fluctuation of the flooded area time series differences between the simulated and observed areas are very minor for some years especially 2006 to 2009 but the storage in s1 cannot recover for multiple years following the 2009 10 drought the reduced storage following the drought supports the outflow simulation again suggesting that some of the satellite based flooded area estimates are not truly connected to the main sudd water body that regulates the outflows scatter plots between the simulated and estimated areas and outflows and the fitted area storage and outflow storage relationships are presented in fig 12 and illustrate that the outflows can be simulated more accurately compared to the flooded areas non linear area storage and outflow storage relationships might yield some improvement in model performance but the scatter plots do not provide strong justification for this added complexity an additional measure of the accuracy of the outflow simulation is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient which compares the magnitude of the model residuals to the total variance of the observed flows nash sutcliffe 1970 values of 0 77 and 0 83 were achieved for the full model calibration and outflow only calibration respectively considered acceptable based on values that have been reported for many standard rainfall runoff models moriasi et al 2007 the outflow simulation would be improved if the flows were increased from 2003 to 2006 and 2012 to 2014 but this would come at the expense of over predicting outflows from 2000 to 2002 and 2009 to 2011 additional improvements are therefore believed to be limited by the hydrologic data that controls the inter annual trends the mild seasonal fluctuation in the simulated flooded area time series is largely controlled by the depth parameter found to be 1 2 meters from the joint calibration this is slightly larger than the 1 0 meter depth assumed by sutcliffe and parks fig 13 illustrates that the flooded area fluctuations increase for a depth parameter of 0 7 meters however the improved alignment in some years comes at the cost of overestimating the flooded area in other years including 2003 2007 and 2014 additionally the minimum flooded area is too high in many years and the storage still cannot recover in the years immediately following the drought the increased seasonal fluctuations in the surface water storage compartment s1 will carry over into the storage compartment that regulates the outflow s2 and reduce the alignment between estimated and simulated outflows 4 3 impact of data uncertainty on model simulations the impact of data uncertainty was assessed by simulating alternative flux estimates and evaluating the resulting variation in the simulated flooded area and outflow this analysis could not be implemented for the satellite derived flooded areas because the uncertainty cannot be quantified given currently available information additional research is needed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the connectivity algorithm that delineates the outer extents of flooding a priority area for future research the impact of the inflow uncertainty was evaluated using the monthly error distributions derived in section 3 1 4 an ensemble of inflow time series was produced by adding randomly sampled error from the distributions to the deterministic values the ensemble estimates were then applied to the calibrated hydrologic model to simulate the sudd flooded areas and outflows twelve of these simulations are displayed in fig 14 and are compared to the flooded areas and outflows used for the optimal model calibration the spread of the flooded area and outflow ensemble simulations demonstrates the significant impact of the inflow uncertainty on the modeled areas and outflows the variability of the simulated outflow ensemble is especially concerning when compared to the temporal variation of the outflows used to calibrate the model suggesting that the current parameterized model has limited predictive power the monthly distributions of the estimated outflows can be compared to the simulated outflows to qualitatively compare uncertainties associated with the outflow estimates with those ingrained in the model structure fig 15 includes the alternative calibration approaches and shows that the simulation often surpasses the 95 confidence interval of the distributions this result suggests that reducing the uncertainty of the outflow estimates would yield relatively minor improvements in model performance compared to improving the model structure each of the precipitation and et estimates presented in figs 3 and 4 were applied to evaluate the model sensitivity to these data inputs the resulting variations were relatively minor compared to the overall model discrepancies however these simulations likely misrepresent the true impact of the data uncertainty the precipitation data sources are dependent on the same in situ gauges for calibration and bias correction introducing correlations and reducing the range of these estimates in the absence of a significant amount of independent gauge data the true uncertainty of the precipitation data products cannot be quantified to simulate the alternate et estimates the model parameter αet was adjusted for each dataset to produce realistic water storage volumes and simulations that are consistent with the modeling approach this required re calibration limited the magnitude of variation in the simulated flooded areas and outflows the perceived uncertainty of the precipitation and pet data is also mitigated by the model structure considering these fluxes are weighted and therefore largely controlled by the simulated flooded area extents these analyses suggest that the most influential source of uncertainty in the proposed alternative model is the estimated sudd inflows and potentially the satellite derived flooded areas the results depicted in figure 16 illustrate that a stochastic model of the sudd would be more appropriate than the deterministic model with singular parameter values presented here the model parameter uncertainty was partially assessed through a seven fold model cross validation exercise described and presented in the supplement material section s5 however a more holistic analysis of parameter uncertainty could be achieved using a stochastic model that includes ensemble simulations of inflow precipitation and et and incorporates uncertainties of the estimated flooded areas and outflows using bayesian statistics the development of this stochastic model is another priority area for future research 4 4 attempted iterative model improvements potential improvements to the proposed alternative model were conceptualized formulated and tested but were ultimately not adopted based on their modest impact on the model performance measured with the objective function these experimental adjustments are described next to provide important insights on the current data and model limitations and to guide future research efforts 1 alternative forms of the storage area relationship were formulated and calibrated including a non linear relationship a multi variate linear model that depends on the area from multiple temporal lags and a non constant depth parameter the power term in the non linear model was optimal at a value close to one and the multivariate model more accurately captured the timing of the peak flooded area but severely attenuated the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations the merit of a non constant depth parameter was evaluated by simulating the model and calculating the time variable depth that would exactly match the observations however a significant pattern in the depth time series could not be identified 2 a two way groundwater flux was tested by introducing a term that is similar to the original groundwater recharge term but allows water to flow into the wetland as it is receding however the optimal parameter applied to this term was consistently zero 3 a third storage compartment for the area surrounding the sudd was formulated and tested to assess whether infiltration and surface runoff across the extents of the sudd basin play a significant role in the water balance previous studies on the sudd suggest that the soil type prevents significant lateral groundwater fluxes and that ponded water along the sudd s perimeter evaporates before it can travel into the main wetland water body petersen fohrer 2010 sutcliffe parks 1999 however the current model performance suggests that this physical process may be missing the third storage compartment tracked precipitation and et outside of the sudd flooded area using an approach similar to that of the main storage compartment excess rainfall could then enter the sudd according to a linear flux storage relationship that has one parameter this flux was only significant if a two or three month lag was applied which seems unrealistic considering the high et rates that would reduce the runoff volume additionally the magnitude of rainfall over the surrounding area was similar to that of the main sudd area so this additional flux cannot amplify the flooded area simulations for years that are underestimated without causing larger differences during years that are overestimated 4 a more complex representation of a third storage compartment for the area surrounding the sudd was then tested that allowed for a continuous two way flux between the main and outer compartments the magnitude and direction of the flux was based on a relative comparison between the simulated storages and the maximum storage in the outer compartment treated as a model parameter the calibrated model significantly improved the alignment between the observed and simulated flooded areas however the optimal parameters made the storage in the outer compartment unstable and the water volume was forced into a negative range the barriers associated with each of the model prototypes highlight limitations of the hydrologic data the three compartment model might prove to be physically sound if the satellite based flooded area maps separated areas that flood seasonally but do not contribute to the sudd outflow supporting the delineation of an inner storage compartment that regulates the outflow and an outer compartment that controls the peak seasonal flood extent gridded precipitation data that more accurately captures the spatial variability of rainfall in the sudd would support a model that simulates regional flooding and runoff processes within and around the wetland 5 discussion and conclusion recall that the overarching goal of this study was to explore the potential for using satellite data to develop a hydrologic model of the sudd wetland that can inform water resources planning the approach to achieving this goal emphasized i careful consideration of the uncertainty in satellite derived estimates of hydrologic variables ii evaluating data and results in the context of existing field level knowledge and fundamental water balance analyses iii an iterative model development process where adjustments are introduced and assessed incrementally and iv balancing model complexity with data uncertainty a significant focus of this study was the estimation of the sudd fluxes and flows during the 2000 to 2018 period that aligns with the satellite derived flooded area time series the hydrologic variables could not be assessed for accuracy individually using currently available in situ data however their consistency was evaluated by comparing the net wetland water storage to the satellite flood maps this analysis highlighted significant differences in magnitude between the storage and flooded area that cannot be resolved with a process based model regardless of its complexity these differences may be partially attributed to flooded areas that appear to be connected to the main wetland area from satellite imagery but are not be hydrologically connected to the water body that regulates the outflows considering that the precipitation and et fluxes are weighted by the areal flood extents errors in the flood maps have a significant impact on the monthly fluxes the flooded area estimates therefore have a significant impact on model simulations and improving them is a priority for future research toward this goal additional satellite data sources could be integrated into the modis based inundation classification algorithm di vittorio georgakakos 2018 synthetic aperture radar sar has been used classify flooded vegetation hess et al 2003 whitcomb et al 2009 although the sensitivity of reflectance to inundation depends on the sensor wavelength geometric and textural characteristics of the vegetation and the depth of underlying water bourgeau chavez et al 2005 pulvirenti et al 2011 l band rebelo et al 2012 and c band wilusz et al 2017 sar have been applied to the sudd to map inundated areas during the 2007 to 2011 period this data is not available for the full 2000 to 2019 period of interest in this study but combining concurrent optical and radar imagery could support more accurate flood maps for the sudd more recent flood detection algorithms are combining sentinel 1 c band launched in 2014 with landsat 8 optical imagery launched in 2013 devries et al 2020 in addition the connectivity of the flood maps could be studied using imagery with a higher spatial resolution than modis 500 meter such as landsat 30 meter the existing algorithm could be applied to cloud free landsat imagery that is concurrent with modis to identify spatial patterns and assess whether they are discernable in modis if these patterns are identifiable and consistent over time a new algorithm could be developed to more accurately capture the monthly inundated areas that are hydrologically connected to the sudd another significant limitation in this study was the lack of in situ flow records at the sudd entrance and exit during the 2000 to 2018 period recall that the sudd inflows were primarily derived from upstream flow records at laropi that were gap filled using satellite altimetry and regression models flows that enter the nile between laropi and the sudd entrance were produced using a lumped rainfall runoff model for the torrents basin introducing more uncertainty into the final inflow estimates inflow ensembles were produced to conceptualize the impact of flow uncertainty on the hydrologic model the resulting flooded areas and outflow simulations showed a wide range of variability demonstrating the need for accurate in situ flow records at the sudd entrance flow records near the sudd exit were also not available so the outflows were estimated directly from the inflows using a statistical autoregressive model that was calibrated to historical flows considering the dependence between inflows and outflows the sudd outflow estimates are also highly uncertain independent observations of the sudd exit flows would provide a valuable calibration dataset and support the development of a more reliable hydrologic model this study leveraged multiple satellite and gauge based precipitation and et datasets and compared them through the exploratory water balance assessments and alternative model calibration scenarios these analyses suggested that chirps precipitation and the hargreaves et estimates were most consistent with the other hydrologic fluxes but none of the products nor their combinations resolved larger inconsistencies between the flooded area and net flux estimates in addition neither chirps nor trmm seemed to capture the spatial variability needed to develop a more complex hydrologic model that simulates runoff in regions surrounding the wetland this idea is supported by the inconsistencies observed between the gridded precipitation estimates and the satellite inundation maps see supplemental material section s3 while improved precipitation and et estimates could improve the final hydrologic model differences in model behavior would be relatively minor considering the uncertainty in the estimated inflows and outflows that drive the sudd hydrology recall that the precipitation and et uncertainty are mitigated in the proposed alternative hydrologic model with the actual et calibration parameter that enables a stable multi year hydrologic simulation prior to developing an alternative hydrologic model the existing sutcliffe and parks model was simulated with the estimated precipitation et flooded areas and flows this simulation served as a benchmark and a tool the storage flooded area and flow time series were analyzed and compared to identify alternative flux relationships observations from the existing model simulation led us to implement the following structural changes in the final alternative model i introduce a routing storage compartment that controls the outflows allowing the first compartment to regulate the flooded area only ii modify the area storage relationship to include an intercept term and a one month lag that captures the time required for flood waters to reach the outer extents of the wetland and iii construct storage flow relationships that allow the model to simulate the sudd outflows as opposed to requiring them as a model input more complex model structures that include additional storage compartments non linear relationships and additional parameters were conceptualized mathematically and computationally formulated and tested however these modifications could not be justified with a significant improvement in model accuracy considering known data uncertainties this exploratory analysis provides guidance on the development of a more complex model and suggests performance metrics might increase with the addition of a third storage compartment that allows for the exchange of surface water and shallow groundwater flows along the sudd boundary the ability to develop and calibrate this model depends on the availability of flood maps that more accurately delineate areas that are hydrologically connected to the main sudd storage compartment that regulates the outflows precipitation estimates that include more spatial variability would also support the development of a three compartment model in the absence of better data and a more complex model the uncertainty of each hydrologic variable could be quantified to enable the development of a stochastic model that uses distributions of the model parameters to capture the full potential range of flooded area and outflow simulations this approach would better communicate unresolved data model structure and parameter uncertainties compared to the deterministic model presented in this study in conclusion the satellite based estimates of flooded area precipitation and et allowed alternative models with increasing levels of complexity to be formulated and compared however the complexity of the final proposed model was limited by low confidence in the hydrologic data this research demonstrated the importance of

8172,the effects of riparian restoration and soil and water conservation practices on catchment hydrology are still unclear here we assess whether a positive change in soil and water conservation practices and riparian reforestation will affect the water availability and boost resilience in a brazilian cerrado basin under climate change scenarios this study was developed in the três marias basin 50 600 km² located in southeastern brazil first we calibrated 1992 2005 and evaluated 2006 2012 the soil and water assessment tool swat model then we created a land cover and land use change lcluc scenario that considers improving soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones following the recommendations of the brazilian payment for ecosystem services pes we also used the trend ssp2 4 5 and the fossil based economy ssp5 8 5 shared socioeconomic pathways climate scenarios data from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 project for the period of 2015 2100 along with a decrease of 5 15 in precipitation in the projected period an increase of 7 15 in forest areas due to the lcluc scenarios generated an increase in evapotranspiration values up to 38 resulting in a decrease of surface runoff and baseflow riparian reforestation and soil and water conservation practices did not necessarily enhance water availability on the simulations performed as expected by many pes keywords climate change land cover change food energy water nexus reforestation water security 1 introduction humans are at the core of the complex cycle between water food and energy while populations grow globally the water food and energy sectors have been experiencing unforeseeable challenges as the increasing demands of these sectors become the main driving force behind environmental problems oliveira et al 2019 as a consequence an increasing number of regions have reached their limits for sustainable water provisioning leading to wide spread water scarcity mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 as water is acknowledged to be the bloodstream of the biosphere pahl wostl et al 2013 water stress issues directly interfere on food and energy productions as it is an input for both processes hanes et al 2018 the competition among agriculture hydroelectric energy production and human supply sectors for water may aggravate vulnerability to water shortage as management practices of these sectors are not commonly integrated climate and land cover and land use changes lcluc are expected to exacerbate this intricate interaction between water security and societal development for instance droughts in the drought prone northeastern region of brazil are expected to intensify due to climate change driven reductions in precipitation almagro et al 2020 likewise other regions of brazil such as the midwest and southeast are likely to experience additional rainfall decreases as a result of reductions in evapotranspiration caused by deforestation of the amazon costa and pires 2010 zemp et al 2017 these factors coupled with poor management of water resources further enhance water stress scenarios generating conflicts within the water food energy ecosystems wfee nexus oliveira et al 2019 to investigate such complex interactions the phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison cmip6 provides climate projections produced by an integrated assessment of models which are driven by new greenhouse gases emission and land use scenarios coupled with future pathways of societal development the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp o neill et al 2016 riahi et al 2017 integrating the representative concentration pathways rcp from cmip5 with the ssps i e climate energy land use with socioeconomic scenarios will facilitate scientific assessment and help address adaptation and mitigation in different future scenarios o neill et al 2016 in some brazilian regions such as the são paulo metropolitan region escobar 2015 gesualdo et al 2019 and the northeast region sun et al 2016 reductions in water availability have led to the competition between multiple uses of water generating conflicts among users the são francisco river basin sfrb has been experiencing decreasing streamflows and increasing demands from multiple sectors mainly for food production and urban supply lucas et al 2021 moreover water uses in the sfrb s main channel are supported by the operation of hydroelectric plants which aggravate the complexity of water resources management in the region cbhsf 2013 ecosystems services play an important role in meeting the food energy water demands oliveira et al 2019 due to their importance to humanity watershed service programs around the world invested 24 billion to restore and protect the environment to ensure clean water supply to the population in 2016 bennett and ruef 2016 brauman 2015 bremer et al 2016 as blue water is crucial for agricultural production and drinking water provisioning several ecosystem services programs in the united states the nature conservancy 2014 africa apse et al 2015 vogl et al 2017 and china ouyang et al 2016 have incorporated the enhancement of water yields as one of their main goals bennett and carroll 2014 bennett and ruef 2016 in brazil the national water agency ana developed the water producer program in 2001 which was the first payment for ecosystem services pes initiative in brazil ana 2008 since conservation efforts are associated with water provision services postel and thompson 2005 government managers and stakeholders have a general perception that forest cover expansion will help to mitigate water stress situations calder 2007 however the effects of reforestation on blue water availability are still unclear many studies have reported that an increase in forest cover resulted in reduction of annual water yield brown et al 2005 filoso et al 2017 jackson et al 2005 liang et al 2015 whitehead and robinson 1993 nevertheless the debate over whether or not forest expansion can improve water availability and boost watershed resilience is far from it end ponette gonzález et al 2015 this uncertainty exists due to the multiple interacting factors that influence hydrological response such as catchment size reforestation extent forest type climate ecological conditions and watershed management practices aranda et al 2012 bonell et al 2010 trabucco et al 2008 furthermore the effects of reforestation on water fluxes within the context of climate change are still poorly understood ellison et al 2012 the objective of this study is to investigate whether the implementation of riparian zones all along the são francisco river and its tributaries associated with contour and terrace farming practices on agriculture will affect the water availability and boost the resilience in a brazilian cerrado basin under climate change scenarios this study was developed in the três marias basin 50 600 km² and its affluent the tributaries of the upper são francisco sf pará and paraopeba river basins with drainage areas of 13 240 km² 7 409 km² and 7 950 km² respectively first we calibrated 1992 2005 and evaluated 2006 2012 the soil and water assessment tool swat model using daily observed data to evaluate the effects of lcluc on water availability we created a lcluc scenario that considered the implementation of contour and terrace farming practices on agriculture and the reforestation of riparian areas following the recommendations of the brazilian pes we used data from the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios from the cmip6 project for the period of 2015 2100 which were first averaged to an ensemble mean of future projections generated by seven gcms global climate models and bias corrected them using the linear scaling method finally we analyzed the water security in the wfee context to help and guide stakeholders in the decision making process 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the três marias basin has a drainage area of 50 600 km² and covers about 106 municipalities fig 1 the são francisco sf river headwaters are located in the state of minas gerais at 1 460 m altitude after 570 km it is barred forming the três marias reservoir and hydroelectric power plant in this study we assess the three main tributary basins to the três marias reservoir a the tributaries of the upper sf b the pará river and c the paraopeba river basins fig 1 table 1 shows the main characteristics of the three basins separately most of the upper são francisco basin is composed by the oldest rocks of the pre cambrian indiviso and to a lesser extent by the bambuí limestone rocks the dominant aquifer system of the três marias basin is the fractured aquifer and according to the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa the soil classes existing in the basin are yellow latosols yl red latosol rl cambisols cs red argisols ra red yellow argisols rya and litholic neosols ln brasil 2006 furthermore the predominant vegetation is the brazilian savanna cerrado according to köppen s classification 13 of the três marias basin has an aw climate which is hot and humid tropical with summer rains and a dry season in winter 55 is classified as cwa which is a subtropical climate with dry winter with temperatures below 18 c and hot summer with temperatures above 22 c with dry winter and mild summer and 32 has a cwb climate which is a subtropical altitude climate the temperature ranges from 11 c in july to 35 c in january and the mean annual precipitation is 1 372 mm the rainy season is from november to january whereas the driest season is from july to september cbhsf 2016a the três marias basin is notable for being the headwaters of the são francisco river basin which is over 2 696 km long and plays an important role for hydropower energy generation in brazil brasil 2006 the rivers and reservoir are also needed for multiple water uses such as irrigation industry urban supply and the transposition of the são francisco river which supplies water to part of the semi arid northeast region despite meeting all the demand in the region the são francisco river basin has been experiencing rainfall below the historical average since 2012 this has resulted in a significant reduction in flows to the hydroelectric dams bringing them to the lowest storage levels ever recorded and endangering continued compliance with multiple water uses ana 2018 according to the last demographic census performed in 2010 about 14 3 million people live in the são francisco river basin half of them in the upper são francisco region the most urbanized region of the basin because of the metropolitan area of belo horizonte the state capital of minas gerais almost 95 of the upper são francisco population lives in urban areas and the basin is considered to be a low population density territory despite its localized high urbanization cbhsf 2016a 2 2 study delineation our analysis was carried out in four steps as shown in fig 2 first we calibrated a swat model for the period from 1992 to 2005 and evaluated its performance using historical streamflow data from 2006 to 2012 in the second step we used ssp2 4 5 trend climate scenario and ssp5 8 5 fossil based economy scenario data from the cmip6 project o neill et al 2016 for the period of 2015 2100 where we first performed an ensemble mean of future projections generated by seven gcms and bias corrected them using the linear scaling method rathjens et al 2016 in the third step we created a lcluc scenario that considers improvements in soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones following the recommendations of the brazilian payment for ecosystem services pes finally we estimated the environmental flows for each month and contrasted them with the average monthly streamflow for each climate and lcluc scenarios 2 3 hydrological modeling the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed process based hydro sedimentologic model developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture ars usda arnold et al 1998 arnold and fohrer 2005 swat simulates a number of different physical processes in a watershed such as climate hydrology soil moisture plant growth nutrients pesticides bacteria and pathogens and soil management arnold et al 2012 it operates on a daily time step to calculate water balance and generate hydrological response units hru which aggregate land use topographical management and soil characteristics of a watershed arnold et al 2012 swat has been widely used for assessing land use climate and management impacts on the hydrological system around the world and in brazil bressiani et al 2015 gassman et al 2007 in the model the land phase of the hydrological cycle is based on the water balance equation eq 1 arnold et al 1998 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t p q s e t w s q g w where s w t represents the final soil water content mm s w 0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm t is the time days p is the precipitation depth for the day mm q s is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm e t is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm w s is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm and q g w is the amount of return flow on day i mm neitsch et al 2011 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 model build up swat requires topographic land use and soil type maps and information as well as weather data to run the model table 2 shows the input data used for model setup precipitation data were collected from 44 rain gauges and the temperature data were obtained from 6 meteorological stations fig 1 to fill the gaps found in the time series we used the swat s weather generator daily streamflow data from 1992 to 2012 were obtained for the three studied basins the land cover map of the baseline period from 1992 to 2012 for the hydrological model and the soils map are shown in fig s3 and they were integrated into the swat s agriculture and vegetation database table s1 we ran the model on a monthly time step with a warm up period of four years and proceeded to the calibration and evaluation processes 2 5 climate change scenarios the cmip6 is the latest phase of the coupled model intercomparison project and its main activity is the scenario model intercomparison project scenariomip in the scenariomip the representative pathways of concentration rcps which are based on greenhouse gas emissions van vuuren et al 2011 are integrated with the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp which represent future pathways of societal developments the ssps are defined as alternative society evolutions due to climate policies and climate change absence o neill et al 2016 these scenarios encompass a range of possible future challenges regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation riahi et al 2017 ssps 1 and 5 predict tendencies for societal development with ssp1 assuming a sustainable path and ssp5 presenting a highly fossil based economy whereas ssps 3 and 4 envision more pessimistic scenarios of human development and climate change vulnerability with ssp3 considering the prioritization of regional security and ssp4 reflecting inequalities among regions and countries finally ssp2 assumes a trend scenario with no substantial diversion from historical patterns o neill et al 2016 in the present study we used the scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 from the cmip6 to represent a trend and pessimistic scenarios respectively seven gcms were selected based on the availability of temperature and precipitation data from 2015 to 2100 table 3 for the data processing we used the climate data operator cdo which is a compilation of linux command line operators to manipulate and assess climate data as the climate data were available in netcdf file format in different grid sizes we resampled the grid resolution from all the seven gcms to 1 5 and performed an ensemble mean by using the average of the climate models projections for precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures previous studies show that an ensemble of several gcms regularly present more suitable results than the use of an individual model dhakal et al 2018 teutschbein and seibert 2012 2 6 bias correction for the analysis of climate change impacts it is essential to apply a bias correction method to the data being used luo et al 2018 thus we employed the bias correction methods available in the climate model data for hydrologic modeling cmhyd tool rathjens et al 2016 table 4 to perform bias correction of the climate data and evaluate both historical observed and simulated data 1992 2012 and the simulated future climate data 2015 2100 the performance of each method was checked by analyzing different statistical indicators nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae and percentage bias pbias finally the bias corrected ensemble mean with the best performance for the past was used to force swat generating streamflow estimates for three future periods near future 2015 2040 mid future 2041 2070 and far future 2071 2100 2 7 model calibration and evaluation we performed global sensitivity analysis for the three main watersheds in the três marias basin using the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup abbaspour 2015 from the methods provided by swat cup the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 was selected to run the sensitivity analysis due to its wide spread usage kamali et al 2017 tang et al 2011 yang et al 2008 and the nash sutcliffe nse coefficient was used as goal function in sufi 2 the uncertainties of the input parameters are reflected by the minimum and maximum ranges stablished for each parameter whereas the uncertainty of the output parameters are expressed as the 95 probability distributions 95ppu abbaspour 2015 refer to abbaspour et al 2004 for more details of the sufi 2 method the sensitivity analysis calculates the t statistic and p value for each parameter providing the sensitivity and significance of a parameter relative to other parameters abbaspour et al 2004 the hydrological parameters considered in the uncertainty analysis affect streamflow surface runoff et soil water storage and groundwater table s2 the most sensitive parameters were then calibrated for each subbasin the calibration procedure was performed semi automatically in swat cup using sufi 2 as well the model was first calibrated for discharge using the 14 year time period from 1992 to 2005 with a set of 500 iterations and evaluated for the period from 2006 to 2012 an acceptable model is found when the performance statistics fall within admissible ranges as satisfactory in this study we consider as satisfactory values of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 50 and standard deviation error rsr 0 70 and percent bias pbias 25 for streamflow moriasi et al 2007 to check calibration and evaluation performances we analyzed the nse pbias r2 rsr and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 2 8 lcluc scenario the brazilian payment for ecosystem services pes program is aimed at reducing erosion in rural areas the program provides technical and financial support for the execution of water and soil conservation actions such as the construction of contour and terraces the readjustment of side roads the recovery and protection of springs the reforestation of areas of permanent protection and legal reserves and environmental sanitation podocionio and turetta 2012 thus we focused on the water provision services and structured a land cover and land use change lcluc map considering these services we generated a scenario that considers both the implementation of riparian zones all along the são francisco river and its tributaries as well as the implementation of soil and water conservation practices in agriculture following the brazilian pes according to the brazilian forest code riparian zones must be permanently preserved along rivers or any watercourse from its highest level in a marginal band whose minimum width is i 30 m for watercourses less than 10 m wide ii 50 m for watercourses that have 10 50 meters wide iii 100 m for watercourses that have 50 200 meters wide iv 200 m for watercourses that have 200 600 meters wide and v 500 m for watercourses that are wider than 600 m in this study we placed a 30 m width buffer zone on small watercourses 200 m width buffer zone on medium watercourses and a 500 m one around the reservoir in order to reproduce these changes in swat we considered the riparian zones as forests and modeled them as forest evergreen frse in accordance with the swat database we also changed the curve number cn values of the swat land uses types from poor or fair to good to account for contour and terrace farming practices on agriculture as per natural resources conservation service usda nrcs 1986 and we obtained relative difference values of cn reaching 29 see table s3 furthermore we modified some vegetation indices of forest land uses frse and frst to reproduce them as fully grown see table s4 2 9 assessment of climate and lcluc changes on water availability the impacts of climate and lcluc were evaluated in terms of average monthly and annual streamflow for the near 2015 2040 mid 2041 2070 and far 2071 2100 projection periods under both ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios for the three basins we first analyzed climate change impacts on streamflow and then the climate change scenarios were associated with lcluc scenario referred to as ssp2 4 5 landuse and ssp5 8 5 landuse in the graphs to evaluate the effects of the reforestation of riparian zones and soil and water conservation practices on water yield for baseflow analysis we used the baseflow and surface runoff output data from swat and calculated the baseflow index bfi which is a measure of baseflow contribution to total streamflow kroll et al 2004 vogel and kroll 1992 higher bfi values imply higher contribution of groundwater to total discharge 2 10 water security analysis assessing vulnerability to climate and lclu changes is vital to the elaboration of adaptive strategies on water resources management to preserve and sustain human and natural systems here we used the smakhtin methodology developed by smakhtin et al 2004 and modified by rodrigues et al 2014 to estimate the environmental flow requirements efr the smakhtin efr method estimates baseflow and surface runoff proportions which can be allocated for ecosystem maintenance and is composed by the low and high flow requirements lfr and hfr smakhtin et al 2004 the lfr contemplates the minimum flow requirement for aquatic species whereas the hfr is necessary for river channel maintenance riparian vegetation and wetland flooding smakhtin et al 2004 the adaptation proposed by rodrigues et al 2014 modified from annual to monthly efr values 6 e f r m o d e r a t e o r f a i r x t l f r x t h f r x t the lfr component is obtained by selecting a specific percentile value from the flow duration curve fdc using daily streamflow records the percentile point was chosen in compliance with the desire future state of the basin being q75 for moderate conservation slightly modified basin and q90 for fair conservation considerably modified basin smakhtin et al 2004 smakhtin and eriyagama 2008 the hfr value was defined as per hughes and hannart 2003 and smakhtin et al 2004 in which the long term monthly average streamflow qmean is contrasted with monthly lfr values for lfr values lower than 10 of the qmean hfr is set to 20 of qmean for lfr ranging from 10 to 20 and from 20 to 30 of the qmean hfr values are defined as 15 and 7 of the qmean respectively for lfr values higher than 30 of the qmean hfr is set to zero we first summed the streamflow from the outlets of the three basins as they are inlets of the três marias reservoir for the historical period we generated the fdc from monthly streamflow data as the swat hydrological model was run at a monthly time step we used the fair conservation q90 condition to estimate lfr value in the basin as lfr values were higher than 30 of the qmean we obtained hfr equal to zero and efr equal to q90 then we contrasted the monthly efr values from the baseline period with the average monthly streamflow values from the projected scenarios and periods in order to assess water security in the basin 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological model performance the most sensitive parameters were gw revap esco cn2 sol awc alpha bf sol bd gw delay gwqmn and sol alb all of them are related to the surface groundwater and soil phases of the hydrologic cycle and they were subsequently used to calibrate the model fig s4 table s5 summarizes the fitted values for each parameter and table 5 shows the performance of the calibration and validation periods for the three basins similarly a graph comparing both observed and simulated monthly discharges during the calibration and validation periods as well as the precipitation for the same periods are illustrated in fig 3 overall there is a significant correlation between observed and simulated discharges in the three basins performance in all basins can be considered very satisfactory during both calibration and evaluation periods with values of ns and kge exceeding 0 70 except in the tributaries of the upper sf basin where we found values of 0 51 and 0 61 for ns and kge respectively 3 2 evaluation of bias corrected projections of the seven gcms ensemble table s6 summarizes the goodness of fit statistics of the ensemble bias corrected by the cmhyd software among all bias correction methods applied for precipitation and temperature data analyzed in this study the linear scaling method obtained the best results and was selected to be used in the hydrological simulation process the bias corrected ensemble generated from the mean of the seven gcms was evaluated with reference to the baseline precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures 1992 2012 in three future time slices near future 2015 2040 mid future 2041 2070 and far future 2071 2100 fig 4 shows the percentage change in future average annual data of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature for all used gcms raw ensemble and bias corrected ensemble in relation to the baseline the bcc csm2 mr and canesm5 models show an overall increase in average annual precipitation reaching a relative change of almost 20 in the canesm5 model under ssp2 4 5 scenario for the near future period on the other hand projections by cnrm cm6 1 cnrm esm2 1 and gfdl cm4 present a decrease that ranges from 6 3 to 20 1 while the ipsl cm6a lr and mri esm2 0 models do not present major changes under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios with respect to the baseline both the raw ensemble and bias corrected ensemble resulted in values close to the observed ones under ssp2 4 5 scenario the raw ensemble and bias corrected ensemble presented a steeper pattern of decrease in the ssp5 8 5 scenario reaching a decrease of 9 1 and 8 5 in the raw and bias corrected ensemble in the far period respectively which points out the tendency towards a worse restriction in water availability in the basin all gcms as well as the ensembles have rising trends in average minimum temperature under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in contrast the average maximum temperature did not show a regular increment rate for all projection models in the near future period under both scenarios the average maximum temperature is inferior compared to the observed data in all the gcms except for the can model and the bias corrected ensemble the projection of these models denotes higher values in the far future period when compared to the baseline mainly in the ssp5 8 5 scenario the maximum temperature for the bias corrected ensemble reaches an increase of 3 1 c and 5 7 c in the end of the far future period under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively these outcomes are consistent with the predefined temperature raise in consequence of the driving forces described by o neill et al 2016 as shown in the precipitation data under ssp2 4 5 scenario some gcms projected an increase in precipitation while others showed the exact opposite situation one is subject to intrinsic uncertainties from a single model by choosing a specific model projection whereas an aggregate of several models may provide more representative data benestad et al 2017 likewise bias correction also played a significant role especially in maximum temperature data under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios presenting a change of 2 6 c between the raw ensemble and bias corrected ensemble for the far future period 3 3 hydrological response to climate change we analyzed the hydrological response due to climate change and lcluc in terms of average monthly discharges and average annual baseflow contribution fig s5 shows the average monthly streamflow resulted from the swat at the three basins for the three periods along with projected monthly values of precipitation precipitation from both ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios presented lower values in the months from january to may compared to the historical period for all the three basins the opposite situation occurs in the months from october to december where the observed precipitation is higher than in the projected scenarios except for the tributaries of upper sf basin we also noted that the lowest value of historical streamflow in the tributaries of the upper sf basin occurred in september whereas the lowest value in the three projected periods shifted to october for the same basin these shifts in the distribution of precipitation and streamflow along the year support the proposition that climate change also alters periodicity apart from frequency and intensity in general projected periods presented reductions in streamflow across both ssp scenarios with future wet seasons depicting higher changes than dry seasons especially in the tributaries of the upper sf where we found a negative change of 49 in december under ssp5 8 5 scenario in comparison to the baseline in contrast the exception occurred in the near and mid futures for the tributaries of the upper sf and in the near future for the pará river which showed increases in streamflow from april to august in both climate change scenarios with the highest relative difference of 41 in june under the ssp2 4 5 scenario in the tributaries of the upper sf see table s7 in the far future period streamflow in these basins reached values lower than the historical period indicating a change to a drier condition by the end of the century and consequent hydrological drought risk for the region in the paraopeba river we found low values of streamflow in all time spans and seasonal periods which reveals an eminent water security concern since this basin supplies water to an extremely populous region nóbrega et al 2011 assessed the uncertainty of climate change in the rio grande basin which is spatially located below the três marias basin and also found a reduction in streamflow in the region using certain gcms in relation to the climate change scenarios solely the more pessimistic scenario ssp5 8 5 resulted in lower values than the trend scenario ssp2 4 5 this can be attributed to a more robust precipitation decreases and temperature increases under the ssp5 8 5 scenario over the três marias basin 3 4 hydrological response to lcluc we generated a lcluc scenario contemplating conservation practices in agriculture and reforestation of riparian zones which resulted in an increase of 11 7 and 15 of forest cover in the tributaries of the upper sf pará river and paraopeba river basins respectively when incorporating the lcluc scenario in the model combined with the climate change scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 we found an overall reduction in streamflow in all months with the wet season october to march presenting higher changes than the dry season april to september fig 5 shows the relative change of precipitation potential and actual evapotranspiration between the projection periods and the control run 1992 2012 we noted an increment of actual evapotranspiration that ranged from 3 to 5 when confronting climate change scenarios solely ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 and climate change associated with lcluc scenario ssp2 4 5 land use and ssp5 8 5 land use in fig 5 as a result of forest cover expansion there was also an increment of potential evapotranspiration along the near mid and far future periods due to the increase in temperature evapotranspiration is a major component of the hydrological cycle in the ecosystems and has significant impact on water availability it is well known that forests have high evapotranspiration compared to other land use types calder 1998 the alteration of water balance between precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow is the mechanism that leads to a decline in water yield after forest cover expansion brown et al 2005 calder 2007 ellison et al 2012 a higher evapotranspiration reduces water availability in soils and groundwater oliveira et al 2017 mattos et al 2019 and modifies energy fluxes runyan et al 2016 which implies that the decrease in streamflow in all three basins was in fact an outcome of converting distinct land uses into forest our results suggest that reforestation of riparian zones and soil and water conservation practices will not necessarily increase water yield as expected by many watershed services programs although forests also provides other ecosystem services such as precipitation recycling keys et al 2016 habitat mendenhall et al 2016 and pollination ricketts and lonsdorf 2013 the increase in reforestation and soil and water conservation practices in the studied basins provided a decrease in the blue water available the result of declined water yield followed by an increase in forest cover corroborates the conclusions from previous studies birkel et al 2012 evaristo and mcdonnell 2019 li et al 2012 dennedy frank and gorelick 2019 analyzed the impacts of forest restoration in 29 watersheds worldwide and found that 75 of those watersheds had their water yield declined by 4 after reforestation lastly filoso et al 2017 performed a systematic review of scientific literature on water yield reduction as a result of forest cover expansion and reported that 80 of the researches had a decrease in annual water yields due to reforestation and 67 of them also presented similar behavior in baseflow therefore investing in forest restoration with enhancing water quantity being the program primary goal may be risky and uncertain and governments and stakeholders should carry out realistic assessment when employing such measures additionally we also investigated the contribution of baseflow and surface runoff to total streamflow by determining bfi values for the control run 1992 2012 and for the whole projected period 2015 2100 for the baseline we found bfi values of 0 83 0 77 and 0 79 for the tributaries of the upper sf pará river and paraopeba river basins respectively for the projected period we estimated a bfi value of 0 98 in both climate change and lcluc scenarios for all three basins which suggests that the river discharge will essentially consist of baseflow in the future fig 6 shows the annual average baseflow and fig 7 illustrates the annual average surface runoff and precipitation for the three basins in relation to the beginning of the projected period we identified a reduction in baseflow that ranged from 17 to 18 in the end of the century under ssp2 4 5 scenario as well as a negative change ranging from 43 to 55 under ssp5 8 5 scenario for the three basins in contrast despite the greater contribution from baseflow surface runoff did not show any changes in mean value and only presented higher peaks as a consequence of climate change see fig 7 under lcluc scenario we also found a small decrease of both baseflow and surface runoff as discussed previously on water yield in addition to a higher evapotranspiration and lower precipitation along the periods under climate change scenarios forest cover expansion leads to an increase in water interception from tree canopies as a result less water would become available for surface runoff and infiltration if less water infiltrates groundwater recharge also decreases oliveira et al 2015 furthermore the larger and deeper root system from trees results in additional water uptake and demand which in turn leads to an increase in transpiration and less water available for groundwater recharge finally the seasonal and interannual variability of precipitation is also critical since moisture deficit soils would require more water and consequently no substantial amount of water would contribute to streamflow and recharge montenegro and ragab 2012 vegetation in riparian zones has preferential access to water and consumes an amount of water disproportionate to the area of a basin it occupies scott 1999 similarly trees located away from streams have less access to soil water and hence transpire at a lower rate dye and poulter 1995 this supports our results of water availability decrease as a consequence of forest cover expansion at the riparian areas of the basins in this context salemi et al 2012 synthesized studies on the hydrological response to riparian zones and found streamflow reductions as a result of riparian reforestation moreover the reforested area of riparian zones is more distributed within the basin as it follows stream channels when comparing to forests which are punctual large areas of dense vegetation these factors may also contribute to the decrease of water yield caused by the insertion of forests in the model regarding the reforestation scale the paraopeba river basin which had the highest increase in forest cover 15 presented the greatest decrease in total streamflow reaching up to 42 of negative difference between the climate change scenarios and the climate change scenarios associated with lcluc in the mid future however even though the tributaries of the upper sf basin had a larger forest expansion 11 in comparison to the pará river basin 7 the latter presented higher decreases that reached up to 36 under ssp5 8 5 scenario when comparing the observed period to the historical simulated period this indicates that a plurality of interacting factors in addition to forest cover may play a role in the hydrological response to reforestation these include ecological conditions land use history vegetation species forest management position of the reforestation on the area and the method applied to increase forest cover aranda et al 2012 bonell et al 2010 trabucco et al 2008 in contrast to studies carried out in small catchments 1 km² to about 10 km² some researches argue that large forest expanses enhance water yield at regional and global scales mainly through water cycle intensification ellison et al 2012 large forest expansion draws in moisture from the oceans and propels evapotranspiration and precipitation which renews and intensifies the regional water cycle makarieva and gorshkov 2009 sheil and murdiyarso 2009 millán et al 2005 came to similar conclusions in the coastal zones of the mediterranean with regards to regional water cycle furthermore there are evidences that the deforestation in the amazon may cause regional impacts in climate and water cycle davidson et al 2012 increasing forest cover may have beneficial impacts on water fluxes at large scales even though testing this proposition becomes difficult since reforestation programs are generally implemented at small scales filoso et al 2017 filoso et al 2017 also found an inverse correlation between catchment size and water yield reduction which corroborates our results of minor decrease in streamflow when incorporating the lcluc scenario in the model such findings must be taken into account when implementing pes programs in a watershed in order to prevent declines in water availability our findings are the opposite to the reported by sone et al 2019 who found an increase of 0 018 m3s 1 during the period from 2012 to 2016 after the beginning of reforestation and implementation of soil and water conservation practices in a basin of 362 km² located in the midwestern brazil therefore it is important to clarify that the time response to change in a basin is dependent on the spatial scale of the study area in other words water balance results obtained for small areas can be quite different than those over larger areas reinforcing the need to investigate the responses at different scales oliveira et al 2014 our results indicate that riparian cover expansion is unlikely to enhance water availability in the três marias basin as well as boost the resilience concerning the quantity of water for the rest of the são francisco river basin this directly affects human well being given that the basin is highly characterized by the multiple uses of water and water shortage condition may bring about the misfunction of others sectors thar particularly rely on water mechanisms such as the payment for environmental services must be followed by a continuous evaluation process in order to monitor their effects on the system rodrigues et al 2013 in the light of this realistic assessment must be carried out by the government and stakeholders in order to achieve the desirable outcomes from watershed service programs 3 5 water security under climate and lcluc changes as the tributaries of the upper sp pará river and paraopeba river basins are the main contributors to the três marias reservoir henceforth we consider them as if they were one major basin in which the water that goes through its outlet flows into the reservoir thus the impacts of climate change and lcluc in the três marias basin are assessed by using the environmental flow requirements efr proposed by smakhtin et al 2004 and modified by rodrigues et al 2014 fig 8 shows the q90 values for the baseline period and the average monthly streamflow values for all scenarios and periods overall a pattern in which efr demands are attended for most of the year is indicated for the near future period it is important to note that this demand is barely met for months of october for all ssp s and lcluc scenarios periods in which demands are not met start becoming apparent in the mid and far future periods especially during the months of february and october the low value of q90 in february is due to a lower value of precipitation in this month when compared to the months of january and march in the tributaries of the upper sf basin see figs 5s and 8 this basin accounts for 46 of the summed areas of the three basins resulting in a large contribution to the low value of q90 in february scarcity conditions are accentuated in the mid future with average monthly streamflow in october reaching negative differences of 51 and 49 of the q90 under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively which indicate that half of the environmental flow required for aquatic animal living will be compromised finally when considering the far future period this value maintains constant in the trend scenario and reaches 71 under the pessimist scenario these results indicate a growing hydrological drought risk and a situation of extreme scarcity for both human and ecosystems towards the end of the century overall ssp5 8 5 presented lower values of average monthly streamflow than the ssp2 4 5 due to the forest cover expansion discussed above scenarios of climate change associated with lcluc ssp2 4 5 landuse and ssp5 8 5 landuse where we found a reduction in water yield in comparison with climate change scenarios solely intensified even more the water stress condition in the basin with an average monthly streamflow decline of 77 of q90 in the far future under the ssp5 8 5 scenario again this reinforces that a robust investigation must be performed beforehand by stakeholders in relation to reforestation programs these results of growing levels of water insecurity and vulnerability in the dry season period pose an enormous threat to the multiple uses of water the main conflicts result from the difficulty in making the satisfaction of water demand for consumptive uses compatible with the requirements of electricity generation cbhsf 2013 during the drought event observed in the três marias power plant in 2013 2014 the minimum level restriction of the turbines caused disruption or even the interruption of navigation water supply of cities and irrigation perimeters downstream the três marias dam as a result of reduced streamflow across the são francisco river between the três marias and the sobradinho plants therefore the concern with securing water for the multiple uses is extremely necessary in order to avoid conflicts among water users in the energy sector 61 of brazil s power generation in 2020 comes from hydroelectric power plants aneel 2020 due to this heavily reliance of hydroelectric energy contribution to the national integrated power grid the brazilian energy matrix is strongly dependent on the hydrological cycle of basins soito and freitas 2011 as noted in this study the imbalance of water availability should result in high water insecurity and vulnerability in the future which will consequently affect the generation of electric power in the três marias basin some studies have investigated the impacts of climate change on hydroelectricity generation in the são francisco river basin and predicted a loss in hydroelectricity production andrade et al 2012 de jong et al 2018 de lucena et al 2009 to offset this condition the energy sector in the três marias basin must be dependent on the integration with alternatives sources of renewable energy such as solar and wind power similarly in the water supply sector since 43 of water withdrawal of the three basins is supplied to cities and industrial uses cbhsf 2016b measures such as wastewater reuse and rainwater harvesting as well as policies aiming at reducing human consumption are essential to compensate the increase in water demand in fact some industries are already promoting the recirculation optimization or reuse of waters in the industry process reducing fresh water intake cbhsf 2016b moreover according to the national sanitation information system snis 2017 water loss in the water distribution system reaches up to 36 in the state of minas gerais this is mainly due to leakage on transmission and distribution mains and unauthorized consumption from the system therefore investment in water loss control is imperative to increase resilience in the basin as a whole in relation to the food sector irrigated agriculture is the activity with the highest water demand accounting for 57 of the total consumption of the three basins and the trend is that this activity will further increase its water needs cbhsf 2016c measures to manage water use in this sector include the use of modern irrigation practices that reduce water consumption such as irrigation scheduling and real time control koech and langat 2018 and subsurface drip irrigation ayars et al 1999 policies to control agricultural expansion and monoculture severe inspection on the abstractions and encourage a certification program for the rational use of water for irrigation resilience in the water food energy ecosystems wfee nexus involves the ability to integrate the food energy and water systems for the purpose of coping with pressures and conflicts and sustain the food energy and water security d odorico et al 2018 planning in response to anticipated climate change and lcluc impacts to the nexus sectors is crucial to boost resilience in the basin in the long run an integrated approach to the assessment of the wfee nexus with the public and stakeholder s participation can attenuate conflicts and foster the development of different management and adaptation strategies aiming at mutually reducing trade offs and providing benefits for all sectors 4 conclusions in this paper we investigate whether a positive change in soil and water conservation practices and reforestation may affect the water availability and boost the resilience in a brazilian cerrado basin under climate change scenarios this study was developed in the três marias basin 50 600 km² and its affluent the tributaries of the upper são francisco sf pará and paraopeba river basins with drainage areas of 13 240 km² 7 409 km² and 7 950 km² respectively first we calibrated 1992 2005 and evaluated 2006 2012 the swat model using daily observed data obtaining kling gupta efficiency values greater than 0 60 for both periods to evaluate the effects of lcluc on water availability we created a lcluc scenario that considers the best soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones following the recommendations of the brazilian payment for ecosystem services pes we also used the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios data from the cmip6 project for the period of 2015 2100 where we first perform an ensemble of future projections generated by seven gcms and bias corrected them using the linear method additionally we estimated the environmental flow for each month and contrasted it with the average monthly streamflow for each climate change and lcluc scenarios our results indicate that streamflow can be expected to decrease in the three basins due to a reduction in precipitation and an increase in temperature values under both climate change scenarios this reduction in water availability is accentuated when using climate change data associated with the lcluc scenario as a result even though baseflow decreased along the projected periods the combination of both climate change and lcluc scenarios led to an increase in its contribution to total flow in addition to climate change impacts forests implicate in high evapotranspiration and in great amount of water being intercepted by tree canopies moreover deeper root system from trees results in additional water uptake and demand which in turn leads to an increase in transpiration and less water available for groundwater recharge therefore although forests provide several benefits such as pollination habitat and recycling riparian forest cover expansion and soil and water conservation practices do not necessarily result in positive changes in water availability these findings must be carefully analyzed by watershed service programs mainly because pes programs in brazil aim at increasing water yield as a primary goal in the water security assessment for the três marias basin situations of hydrological drought risk and extreme scarcity can be expected to occur in the mid and far future under all scenarios mainly in the dry period from august to october this high insecurity and vulnerability conditions threaten the availability of water for ecosystems which in turn compromise the fulfillment of the needs from the food energy and water sectors for human living sustenance towards the end of the century it is indubitably essential that authorities and policy makers implement efficient adaptation and preventive strategies in order to secure water and mitigate losses in the food energy and water sectors the results and suggestions made in this study can assist regional government in formulating and stablishing effective policies to foster water security in the três marias basin as well as in the são francisco river basin at large future research may further assess the interactions and trade offs in the water food energy ecossytems wfee nexus and quantitatively quantify the economic impacts of each sector under critical water stress conditions in the region author

8172,the effects of riparian restoration and soil and water conservation practices on catchment hydrology are still unclear here we assess whether a positive change in soil and water conservation practices and riparian reforestation will affect the water availability and boost resilience in a brazilian cerrado basin under climate change scenarios this study was developed in the três marias basin 50 600 km² located in southeastern brazil first we calibrated 1992 2005 and evaluated 2006 2012 the soil and water assessment tool swat model then we created a land cover and land use change lcluc scenario that considers improving soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones following the recommendations of the brazilian payment for ecosystem services pes we also used the trend ssp2 4 5 and the fossil based economy ssp5 8 5 shared socioeconomic pathways climate scenarios data from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 project for the period of 2015 2100 along with a decrease of 5 15 in precipitation in the projected period an increase of 7 15 in forest areas due to the lcluc scenarios generated an increase in evapotranspiration values up to 38 resulting in a decrease of surface runoff and baseflow riparian reforestation and soil and water conservation practices did not necessarily enhance water availability on the simulations performed as expected by many pes keywords climate change land cover change food energy water nexus reforestation water security 1 introduction humans are at the core of the complex cycle between water food and energy while populations grow globally the water food and energy sectors have been experiencing unforeseeable challenges as the increasing demands of these sectors become the main driving force behind environmental problems oliveira et al 2019 as a consequence an increasing number of regions have reached their limits for sustainable water provisioning leading to wide spread water scarcity mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 as water is acknowledged to be the bloodstream of the biosphere pahl wostl et al 2013 water stress issues directly interfere on food and energy productions as it is an input for both processes hanes et al 2018 the competition among agriculture hydroelectric energy production and human supply sectors for water may aggravate vulnerability to water shortage as management practices of these sectors are not commonly integrated climate and land cover and land use changes lcluc are expected to exacerbate this intricate interaction between water security and societal development for instance droughts in the drought prone northeastern region of brazil are expected to intensify due to climate change driven reductions in precipitation almagro et al 2020 likewise other regions of brazil such as the midwest and southeast are likely to experience additional rainfall decreases as a result of reductions in evapotranspiration caused by deforestation of the amazon costa and pires 2010 zemp et al 2017 these factors coupled with poor management of water resources further enhance water stress scenarios generating conflicts within the water food energy ecosystems wfee nexus oliveira et al 2019 to investigate such complex interactions the phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison cmip6 provides climate projections produced by an integrated assessment of models which are driven by new greenhouse gases emission and land use scenarios coupled with future pathways of societal development the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp o neill et al 2016 riahi et al 2017 integrating the representative concentration pathways rcp from cmip5 with the ssps i e climate energy land use with socioeconomic scenarios will facilitate scientific assessment and help address adaptation and mitigation in different future scenarios o neill et al 2016 in some brazilian regions such as the são paulo metropolitan region escobar 2015 gesualdo et al 2019 and the northeast region sun et al 2016 reductions in water availability have led to the competition between multiple uses of water generating conflicts among users the são francisco river basin sfrb has been experiencing decreasing streamflows and increasing demands from multiple sectors mainly for food production and urban supply lucas et al 2021 moreover water uses in the sfrb s main channel are supported by the operation of hydroelectric plants which aggravate the complexity of water resources management in the region cbhsf 2013 ecosystems services play an important role in meeting the food energy water demands oliveira et al 2019 due to their importance to humanity watershed service programs around the world invested 24 billion to restore and protect the environment to ensure clean water supply to the population in 2016 bennett and ruef 2016 brauman 2015 bremer et al 2016 as blue water is crucial for agricultural production and drinking water provisioning several ecosystem services programs in the united states the nature conservancy 2014 africa apse et al 2015 vogl et al 2017 and china ouyang et al 2016 have incorporated the enhancement of water yields as one of their main goals bennett and carroll 2014 bennett and ruef 2016 in brazil the national water agency ana developed the water producer program in 2001 which was the first payment for ecosystem services pes initiative in brazil ana 2008 since conservation efforts are associated with water provision services postel and thompson 2005 government managers and stakeholders have a general perception that forest cover expansion will help to mitigate water stress situations calder 2007 however the effects of reforestation on blue water availability are still unclear many studies have reported that an increase in forest cover resulted in reduction of annual water yield brown et al 2005 filoso et al 2017 jackson et al 2005 liang et al 2015 whitehead and robinson 1993 nevertheless the debate over whether or not forest expansion can improve water availability and boost watershed resilience is far from it end ponette gonzález et al 2015 this uncertainty exists due to the multiple interacting factors that influence hydrological response such as catchment size reforestation extent forest type climate ecological conditions and watershed management practices aranda et al 2012 bonell et al 2010 trabucco et al 2008 furthermore the effects of reforestation on water fluxes within the context of climate change are still poorly understood ellison et al 2012 the objective of this study is to investigate whether the implementation of riparian zones all along the são francisco river and its tributaries associated with contour and terrace farming practices on agriculture will affect the water availability and boost the resilience in a brazilian cerrado basin under climate change scenarios this study was developed in the três marias basin 50 600 km² and its affluent the tributaries of the upper são francisco sf pará and paraopeba river basins with drainage areas of 13 240 km² 7 409 km² and 7 950 km² respectively first we calibrated 1992 2005 and evaluated 2006 2012 the soil and water assessment tool swat model using daily observed data to evaluate the effects of lcluc on water availability we created a lcluc scenario that considered the implementation of contour and terrace farming practices on agriculture and the reforestation of riparian areas following the recommendations of the brazilian pes we used data from the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios from the cmip6 project for the period of 2015 2100 which were first averaged to an ensemble mean of future projections generated by seven gcms global climate models and bias corrected them using the linear scaling method finally we analyzed the water security in the wfee context to help and guide stakeholders in the decision making process 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the três marias basin has a drainage area of 50 600 km² and covers about 106 municipalities fig 1 the são francisco sf river headwaters are located in the state of minas gerais at 1 460 m altitude after 570 km it is barred forming the três marias reservoir and hydroelectric power plant in this study we assess the three main tributary basins to the três marias reservoir a the tributaries of the upper sf b the pará river and c the paraopeba river basins fig 1 table 1 shows the main characteristics of the three basins separately most of the upper são francisco basin is composed by the oldest rocks of the pre cambrian indiviso and to a lesser extent by the bambuí limestone rocks the dominant aquifer system of the três marias basin is the fractured aquifer and according to the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa the soil classes existing in the basin are yellow latosols yl red latosol rl cambisols cs red argisols ra red yellow argisols rya and litholic neosols ln brasil 2006 furthermore the predominant vegetation is the brazilian savanna cerrado according to köppen s classification 13 of the três marias basin has an aw climate which is hot and humid tropical with summer rains and a dry season in winter 55 is classified as cwa which is a subtropical climate with dry winter with temperatures below 18 c and hot summer with temperatures above 22 c with dry winter and mild summer and 32 has a cwb climate which is a subtropical altitude climate the temperature ranges from 11 c in july to 35 c in january and the mean annual precipitation is 1 372 mm the rainy season is from november to january whereas the driest season is from july to september cbhsf 2016a the três marias basin is notable for being the headwaters of the são francisco river basin which is over 2 696 km long and plays an important role for hydropower energy generation in brazil brasil 2006 the rivers and reservoir are also needed for multiple water uses such as irrigation industry urban supply and the transposition of the são francisco river which supplies water to part of the semi arid northeast region despite meeting all the demand in the region the são francisco river basin has been experiencing rainfall below the historical average since 2012 this has resulted in a significant reduction in flows to the hydroelectric dams bringing them to the lowest storage levels ever recorded and endangering continued compliance with multiple water uses ana 2018 according to the last demographic census performed in 2010 about 14 3 million people live in the são francisco river basin half of them in the upper são francisco region the most urbanized region of the basin because of the metropolitan area of belo horizonte the state capital of minas gerais almost 95 of the upper são francisco population lives in urban areas and the basin is considered to be a low population density territory despite its localized high urbanization cbhsf 2016a 2 2 study delineation our analysis was carried out in four steps as shown in fig 2 first we calibrated a swat model for the period from 1992 to 2005 and evaluated its performance using historical streamflow data from 2006 to 2012 in the second step we used ssp2 4 5 trend climate scenario and ssp5 8 5 fossil based economy scenario data from the cmip6 project o neill et al 2016 for the period of 2015 2100 where we first performed an ensemble mean of future projections generated by seven gcms and bias corrected them using the linear scaling method rathjens et al 2016 in the third step we created a lcluc scenario that considers improvements in soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones following the recommendations of the brazilian payment for ecosystem services pes finally we estimated the environmental flows for each month and contrasted them with the average monthly streamflow for each climate and lcluc scenarios 2 3 hydrological modeling the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed process based hydro sedimentologic model developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture ars usda arnold et al 1998 arnold and fohrer 2005 swat simulates a number of different physical processes in a watershed such as climate hydrology soil moisture plant growth nutrients pesticides bacteria and pathogens and soil management arnold et al 2012 it operates on a daily time step to calculate water balance and generate hydrological response units hru which aggregate land use topographical management and soil characteristics of a watershed arnold et al 2012 swat has been widely used for assessing land use climate and management impacts on the hydrological system around the world and in brazil bressiani et al 2015 gassman et al 2007 in the model the land phase of the hydrological cycle is based on the water balance equation eq 1 arnold et al 1998 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t p q s e t w s q g w where s w t represents the final soil water content mm s w 0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm t is the time days p is the precipitation depth for the day mm q s is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm e t is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm w s is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm and q g w is the amount of return flow on day i mm neitsch et al 2011 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 model build up swat requires topographic land use and soil type maps and information as well as weather data to run the model table 2 shows the input data used for model setup precipitation data were collected from 44 rain gauges and the temperature data were obtained from 6 meteorological stations fig 1 to fill the gaps found in the time series we used the swat s weather generator daily streamflow data from 1992 to 2012 were obtained for the three studied basins the land cover map of the baseline period from 1992 to 2012 for the hydrological model and the soils map are shown in fig s3 and they were integrated into the swat s agriculture and vegetation database table s1 we ran the model on a monthly time step with a warm up period of four years and proceeded to the calibration and evaluation processes 2 5 climate change scenarios the cmip6 is the latest phase of the coupled model intercomparison project and its main activity is the scenario model intercomparison project scenariomip in the scenariomip the representative pathways of concentration rcps which are based on greenhouse gas emissions van vuuren et al 2011 are integrated with the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp which represent future pathways of societal developments the ssps are defined as alternative society evolutions due to climate policies and climate change absence o neill et al 2016 these scenarios encompass a range of possible future challenges regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation riahi et al 2017 ssps 1 and 5 predict tendencies for societal development with ssp1 assuming a sustainable path and ssp5 presenting a highly fossil based economy whereas ssps 3 and 4 envision more pessimistic scenarios of human development and climate change vulnerability with ssp3 considering the prioritization of regional security and ssp4 reflecting inequalities among regions and countries finally ssp2 assumes a trend scenario with no substantial diversion from historical patterns o neill et al 2016 in the present study we used the scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 from the cmip6 to represent a trend and pessimistic scenarios respectively seven gcms were selected based on the availability of temperature and precipitation data from 2015 to 2100 table 3 for the data processing we used the climate data operator cdo which is a compilation of linux command line operators to manipulate and assess climate data as the climate data were available in netcdf file format in different grid sizes we resampled the grid resolution from all the seven gcms to 1 5 and performed an ensemble mean by using the average of the climate models projections for precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures previous studies show that an ensemble of several gcms regularly present more suitable results than the use of an individual model dhakal et al 2018 teutschbein and seibert 2012 2 6 bias correction for the analysis of climate change impacts it is essential to apply a bias correction method to the data being used luo et al 2018 thus we employed the bias correction methods available in the climate model data for hydrologic modeling cmhyd tool rathjens et al 2016 table 4 to perform bias correction of the climate data and evaluate both historical observed and simulated data 1992 2012 and the simulated future climate data 2015 2100 the performance of each method was checked by analyzing different statistical indicators nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae and percentage bias pbias finally the bias corrected ensemble mean with the best performance for the past was used to force swat generating streamflow estimates for three future periods near future 2015 2040 mid future 2041 2070 and far future 2071 2100 2 7 model calibration and evaluation we performed global sensitivity analysis for the three main watersheds in the três marias basin using the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup abbaspour 2015 from the methods provided by swat cup the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 was selected to run the sensitivity analysis due to its wide spread usage kamali et al 2017 tang et al 2011 yang et al 2008 and the nash sutcliffe nse coefficient was used as goal function in sufi 2 the uncertainties of the input parameters are reflected by the minimum and maximum ranges stablished for each parameter whereas the uncertainty of the output parameters are expressed as the 95 probability distributions 95ppu abbaspour 2015 refer to abbaspour et al 2004 for more details of the sufi 2 method the sensitivity analysis calculates the t statistic and p value for each parameter providing the sensitivity and significance of a parameter relative to other parameters abbaspour et al 2004 the hydrological parameters considered in the uncertainty analysis affect streamflow surface runoff et soil water storage and groundwater table s2 the most sensitive parameters were then calibrated for each subbasin the calibration procedure was performed semi automatically in swat cup using sufi 2 as well the model was first calibrated for discharge using the 14 year time period from 1992 to 2005 with a set of 500 iterations and evaluated for the period from 2006 to 2012 an acceptable model is found when the performance statistics fall within admissible ranges as satisfactory in this study we consider as satisfactory values of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 50 and standard deviation error rsr 0 70 and percent bias pbias 25 for streamflow moriasi et al 2007 to check calibration and evaluation performances we analyzed the nse pbias r2 rsr and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 2 8 lcluc scenario the brazilian payment for ecosystem services pes program is aimed at reducing erosion in rural areas the program provides technical and financial support for the execution of water and soil conservation actions such as the construction of contour and terraces the readjustment of side roads the recovery and protection of springs the reforestation of areas of permanent protection and legal reserves and environmental sanitation podocionio and turetta 2012 thus we focused on the water provision services and structured a land cover and land use change lcluc map considering these services we generated a scenario that considers both the implementation of riparian zones all along the são francisco river and its tributaries as well as the implementation of soil and water conservation practices in agriculture following the brazilian pes according to the brazilian forest code riparian zones must be permanently preserved along rivers or any watercourse from its highest level in a marginal band whose minimum width is i 30 m for watercourses less than 10 m wide ii 50 m for watercourses that have 10 50 meters wide iii 100 m for watercourses that have 50 200 meters wide iv 200 m for watercourses that have 200 600 meters wide and v 500 m for watercourses that are wider than 600 m in this study we placed a 30 m width buffer zone on small watercourses 200 m width buffer zone on medium watercourses and a 500 m one around the reservoir in order to reproduce these changes in swat we considered the riparian zones as forests and modeled them as forest evergreen frse in accordance with the swat database we also changed the curve number cn values of the swat land uses types from poor or fair to good to account for contour and terrace farming practices on agriculture as per natural resources conservation service usda nrcs 1986 and we obtained relative difference values of cn reaching 29 see table s3 furthermore we modified some vegetation indices of forest land uses frse and frst to reproduce them as fully grown see table s4 2 9 assessment of climate and lcluc changes on water availability the impacts of climate and lcluc were evaluated in terms of average monthly and annual streamflow for the near 2015 2040 mid 2041 2070 and far 2071 2100 projection periods under both ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios for the three basins we first analyzed climate change impacts on streamflow and then the climate change scenarios were associated with lcluc scenario referred to as ssp2 4 5 landuse and ssp5 8 5 landuse in the graphs to evaluate the effects of the reforestation of riparian zones and soil and water conservation practices on water yield for baseflow analysis we used the baseflow and surface runoff output data from swat and calculated the baseflow index bfi which is a measure of baseflow contribution to total streamflow kroll et al 2004 vogel and kroll 1992 higher bfi values imply higher contribution of groundwater to total discharge 2 10 water security analysis assessing vulnerability to climate and lclu changes is vital to the elaboration of adaptive strategies on water resources management to preserve and sustain human and natural systems here we used the smakhtin methodology developed by smakhtin et al 2004 and modified by rodrigues et al 2014 to estimate the environmental flow requirements efr the smakhtin efr method estimates baseflow and surface runoff proportions which can be allocated for ecosystem maintenance and is composed by the low and high flow requirements lfr and hfr smakhtin et al 2004 the lfr contemplates the minimum flow requirement for aquatic species whereas the hfr is necessary for river channel maintenance riparian vegetation and wetland flooding smakhtin et al 2004 the adaptation proposed by rodrigues et al 2014 modified from annual to monthly efr values 6 e f r m o d e r a t e o r f a i r x t l f r x t h f r x t the lfr component is obtained by selecting a specific percentile value from the flow duration curve fdc using daily streamflow records the percentile point was chosen in compliance with the desire future state of the basin being q75 for moderate conservation slightly modified basin and q90 for fair conservation considerably modified basin smakhtin et al 2004 smakhtin and eriyagama 2008 the hfr value was defined as per hughes and hannart 2003 and smakhtin et al 2004 in which the long term monthly average streamflow qmean is contrasted with monthly lfr values for lfr values lower than 10 of the qmean hfr is set to 20 of qmean for lfr ranging from 10 to 20 and from 20 to 30 of the qmean hfr values are defined as 15 and 7 of the qmean respectively for lfr values higher than 30 of the qmean hfr is set to zero we first summed the streamflow from the outlets of the three basins as they are inlets of the três marias reservoir for the historical period we generated the fdc from monthly streamflow data as the swat hydrological model was run at a monthly time step we used the fair conservation q90 condition to estimate lfr value in the basin as lfr values were higher than 30 of the qmean we obtained hfr equal to zero and efr equal to q90 then we contrasted the monthly efr values from the baseline period with the average monthly streamflow values from the projected scenarios and periods in order to assess water security in the basin 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological model performance the most sensitive parameters were gw revap esco cn2 sol awc alpha bf sol bd gw delay gwqmn and sol alb all of them are related to the surface groundwater and soil phases of the hydrologic cycle and they were subsequently used to calibrate the model fig s4 table s5 summarizes the fitted values for each parameter and table 5 shows the performance of the calibration and validation periods for the three basins similarly a graph comparing both observed and simulated monthly discharges during the calibration and validation periods as well as the precipitation for the same periods are illustrated in fig 3 overall there is a significant correlation between observed and simulated discharges in the three basins performance in all basins can be considered very satisfactory during both calibration and evaluation periods with values of ns and kge exceeding 0 70 except in the tributaries of the upper sf basin where we found values of 0 51 and 0 61 for ns and kge respectively 3 2 evaluation of bias corrected projections of the seven gcms ensemble table s6 summarizes the goodness of fit statistics of the ensemble bias corrected by the cmhyd software among all bias correction methods applied for precipitation and temperature data analyzed in this study the linear scaling method obtained the best results and was selected to be used in the hydrological simulation process the bias corrected ensemble generated from the mean of the seven gcms was evaluated with reference to the baseline precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures 1992 2012 in three future time slices near future 2015 2040 mid future 2041 2070 and far future 2071 2100 fig 4 shows the percentage change in future average annual data of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature for all used gcms raw ensemble and bias corrected ensemble in relation to the baseline the bcc csm2 mr and canesm5 models show an overall increase in average annual precipitation reaching a relative change of almost 20 in the canesm5 model under ssp2 4 5 scenario for the near future period on the other hand projections by cnrm cm6 1 cnrm esm2 1 and gfdl cm4 present a decrease that ranges from 6 3 to 20 1 while the ipsl cm6a lr and mri esm2 0 models do not present major changes under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios with respect to the baseline both the raw ensemble and bias corrected ensemble resulted in values close to the observed ones under ssp2 4 5 scenario the raw ensemble and bias corrected ensemble presented a steeper pattern of decrease in the ssp5 8 5 scenario reaching a decrease of 9 1 and 8 5 in the raw and bias corrected ensemble in the far period respectively which points out the tendency towards a worse restriction in water availability in the basin all gcms as well as the ensembles have rising trends in average minimum temperature under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in contrast the average maximum temperature did not show a regular increment rate for all projection models in the near future period under both scenarios the average maximum temperature is inferior compared to the observed data in all the gcms except for the can model and the bias corrected ensemble the projection of these models denotes higher values in the far future period when compared to the baseline mainly in the ssp5 8 5 scenario the maximum temperature for the bias corrected ensemble reaches an increase of 3 1 c and 5 7 c in the end of the far future period under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively these outcomes are consistent with the predefined temperature raise in consequence of the driving forces described by o neill et al 2016 as shown in the precipitation data under ssp2 4 5 scenario some gcms projected an increase in precipitation while others showed the exact opposite situation one is subject to intrinsic uncertainties from a single model by choosing a specific model projection whereas an aggregate of several models may provide more representative data benestad et al 2017 likewise bias correction also played a significant role especially in maximum temperature data under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios presenting a change of 2 6 c between the raw ensemble and bias corrected ensemble for the far future period 3 3 hydrological response to climate change we analyzed the hydrological response due to climate change and lcluc in terms of average monthly discharges and average annual baseflow contribution fig s5 shows the average monthly streamflow resulted from the swat at the three basins for the three periods along with projected monthly values of precipitation precipitation from both ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios presented lower values in the months from january to may compared to the historical period for all the three basins the opposite situation occurs in the months from october to december where the observed precipitation is higher than in the projected scenarios except for the tributaries of upper sf basin we also noted that the lowest value of historical streamflow in the tributaries of the upper sf basin occurred in september whereas the lowest value in the three projected periods shifted to october for the same basin these shifts in the distribution of precipitation and streamflow along the year support the proposition that climate change also alters periodicity apart from frequency and intensity in general projected periods presented reductions in streamflow across both ssp scenarios with future wet seasons depicting higher changes than dry seasons especially in the tributaries of the upper sf where we found a negative change of 49 in december under ssp5 8 5 scenario in comparison to the baseline in contrast the exception occurred in the near and mid futures for the tributaries of the upper sf and in the near future for the pará river which showed increases in streamflow from april to august in both climate change scenarios with the highest relative difference of 41 in june under the ssp2 4 5 scenario in the tributaries of the upper sf see table s7 in the far future period streamflow in these basins reached values lower than the historical period indicating a change to a drier condition by the end of the century and consequent hydrological drought risk for the region in the paraopeba river we found low values of streamflow in all time spans and seasonal periods which reveals an eminent water security concern since this basin supplies water to an extremely populous region nóbrega et al 2011 assessed the uncertainty of climate change in the rio grande basin which is spatially located below the três marias basin and also found a reduction in streamflow in the region using certain gcms in relation to the climate change scenarios solely the more pessimistic scenario ssp5 8 5 resulted in lower values than the trend scenario ssp2 4 5 this can be attributed to a more robust precipitation decreases and temperature increases under the ssp5 8 5 scenario over the três marias basin 3 4 hydrological response to lcluc we generated a lcluc scenario contemplating conservation practices in agriculture and reforestation of riparian zones which resulted in an increase of 11 7 and 15 of forest cover in the tributaries of the upper sf pará river and paraopeba river basins respectively when incorporating the lcluc scenario in the model combined with the climate change scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 we found an overall reduction in streamflow in all months with the wet season october to march presenting higher changes than the dry season april to september fig 5 shows the relative change of precipitation potential and actual evapotranspiration between the projection periods and the control run 1992 2012 we noted an increment of actual evapotranspiration that ranged from 3 to 5 when confronting climate change scenarios solely ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 and climate change associated with lcluc scenario ssp2 4 5 land use and ssp5 8 5 land use in fig 5 as a result of forest cover expansion there was also an increment of potential evapotranspiration along the near mid and far future periods due to the increase in temperature evapotranspiration is a major component of the hydrological cycle in the ecosystems and has significant impact on water availability it is well known that forests have high evapotranspiration compared to other land use types calder 1998 the alteration of water balance between precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow is the mechanism that leads to a decline in water yield after forest cover expansion brown et al 2005 calder 2007 ellison et al 2012 a higher evapotranspiration reduces water availability in soils and groundwater oliveira et al 2017 mattos et al 2019 and modifies energy fluxes runyan et al 2016 which implies that the decrease in streamflow in all three basins was in fact an outcome of converting distinct land uses into forest our results suggest that reforestation of riparian zones and soil and water conservation practices will not necessarily increase water yield as expected by many watershed services programs although forests also provides other ecosystem services such as precipitation recycling keys et al 2016 habitat mendenhall et al 2016 and pollination ricketts and lonsdorf 2013 the increase in reforestation and soil and water conservation practices in the studied basins provided a decrease in the blue water available the result of declined water yield followed by an increase in forest cover corroborates the conclusions from previous studies birkel et al 2012 evaristo and mcdonnell 2019 li et al 2012 dennedy frank and gorelick 2019 analyzed the impacts of forest restoration in 29 watersheds worldwide and found that 75 of those watersheds had their water yield declined by 4 after reforestation lastly filoso et al 2017 performed a systematic review of scientific literature on water yield reduction as a result of forest cover expansion and reported that 80 of the researches had a decrease in annual water yields due to reforestation and 67 of them also presented similar behavior in baseflow therefore investing in forest restoration with enhancing water quantity being the program primary goal may be risky and uncertain and governments and stakeholders should carry out realistic assessment when employing such measures additionally we also investigated the contribution of baseflow and surface runoff to total streamflow by determining bfi values for the control run 1992 2012 and for the whole projected period 2015 2100 for the baseline we found bfi values of 0 83 0 77 and 0 79 for the tributaries of the upper sf pará river and paraopeba river basins respectively for the projected period we estimated a bfi value of 0 98 in both climate change and lcluc scenarios for all three basins which suggests that the river discharge will essentially consist of baseflow in the future fig 6 shows the annual average baseflow and fig 7 illustrates the annual average surface runoff and precipitation for the three basins in relation to the beginning of the projected period we identified a reduction in baseflow that ranged from 17 to 18 in the end of the century under ssp2 4 5 scenario as well as a negative change ranging from 43 to 55 under ssp5 8 5 scenario for the three basins in contrast despite the greater contribution from baseflow surface runoff did not show any changes in mean value and only presented higher peaks as a consequence of climate change see fig 7 under lcluc scenario we also found a small decrease of both baseflow and surface runoff as discussed previously on water yield in addition to a higher evapotranspiration and lower precipitation along the periods under climate change scenarios forest cover expansion leads to an increase in water interception from tree canopies as a result less water would become available for surface runoff and infiltration if less water infiltrates groundwater recharge also decreases oliveira et al 2015 furthermore the larger and deeper root system from trees results in additional water uptake and demand which in turn leads to an increase in transpiration and less water available for groundwater recharge finally the seasonal and interannual variability of precipitation is also critical since moisture deficit soils would require more water and consequently no substantial amount of water would contribute to streamflow and recharge montenegro and ragab 2012 vegetation in riparian zones has preferential access to water and consumes an amount of water disproportionate to the area of a basin it occupies scott 1999 similarly trees located away from streams have less access to soil water and hence transpire at a lower rate dye and poulter 1995 this supports our results of water availability decrease as a consequence of forest cover expansion at the riparian areas of the basins in this context salemi et al 2012 synthesized studies on the hydrological response to riparian zones and found streamflow reductions as a result of riparian reforestation moreover the reforested area of riparian zones is more distributed within the basin as it follows stream channels when comparing to forests which are punctual large areas of dense vegetation these factors may also contribute to the decrease of water yield caused by the insertion of forests in the model regarding the reforestation scale the paraopeba river basin which had the highest increase in forest cover 15 presented the greatest decrease in total streamflow reaching up to 42 of negative difference between the climate change scenarios and the climate change scenarios associated with lcluc in the mid future however even though the tributaries of the upper sf basin had a larger forest expansion 11 in comparison to the pará river basin 7 the latter presented higher decreases that reached up to 36 under ssp5 8 5 scenario when comparing the observed period to the historical simulated period this indicates that a plurality of interacting factors in addition to forest cover may play a role in the hydrological response to reforestation these include ecological conditions land use history vegetation species forest management position of the reforestation on the area and the method applied to increase forest cover aranda et al 2012 bonell et al 2010 trabucco et al 2008 in contrast to studies carried out in small catchments 1 km² to about 10 km² some researches argue that large forest expanses enhance water yield at regional and global scales mainly through water cycle intensification ellison et al 2012 large forest expansion draws in moisture from the oceans and propels evapotranspiration and precipitation which renews and intensifies the regional water cycle makarieva and gorshkov 2009 sheil and murdiyarso 2009 millán et al 2005 came to similar conclusions in the coastal zones of the mediterranean with regards to regional water cycle furthermore there are evidences that the deforestation in the amazon may cause regional impacts in climate and water cycle davidson et al 2012 increasing forest cover may have beneficial impacts on water fluxes at large scales even though testing this proposition becomes difficult since reforestation programs are generally implemented at small scales filoso et al 2017 filoso et al 2017 also found an inverse correlation between catchment size and water yield reduction which corroborates our results of minor decrease in streamflow when incorporating the lcluc scenario in the model such findings must be taken into account when implementing pes programs in a watershed in order to prevent declines in water availability our findings are the opposite to the reported by sone et al 2019 who found an increase of 0 018 m3s 1 during the period from 2012 to 2016 after the beginning of reforestation and implementation of soil and water conservation practices in a basin of 362 km² located in the midwestern brazil therefore it is important to clarify that the time response to change in a basin is dependent on the spatial scale of the study area in other words water balance results obtained for small areas can be quite different than those over larger areas reinforcing the need to investigate the responses at different scales oliveira et al 2014 our results indicate that riparian cover expansion is unlikely to enhance water availability in the três marias basin as well as boost the resilience concerning the quantity of water for the rest of the são francisco river basin this directly affects human well being given that the basin is highly characterized by the multiple uses of water and water shortage condition may bring about the misfunction of others sectors thar particularly rely on water mechanisms such as the payment for environmental services must be followed by a continuous evaluation process in order to monitor their effects on the system rodrigues et al 2013 in the light of this realistic assessment must be carried out by the government and stakeholders in order to achieve the desirable outcomes from watershed service programs 3 5 water security under climate and lcluc changes as the tributaries of the upper sp pará river and paraopeba river basins are the main contributors to the três marias reservoir henceforth we consider them as if they were one major basin in which the water that goes through its outlet flows into the reservoir thus the impacts of climate change and lcluc in the três marias basin are assessed by using the environmental flow requirements efr proposed by smakhtin et al 2004 and modified by rodrigues et al 2014 fig 8 shows the q90 values for the baseline period and the average monthly streamflow values for all scenarios and periods overall a pattern in which efr demands are attended for most of the year is indicated for the near future period it is important to note that this demand is barely met for months of october for all ssp s and lcluc scenarios periods in which demands are not met start becoming apparent in the mid and far future periods especially during the months of february and october the low value of q90 in february is due to a lower value of precipitation in this month when compared to the months of january and march in the tributaries of the upper sf basin see figs 5s and 8 this basin accounts for 46 of the summed areas of the three basins resulting in a large contribution to the low value of q90 in february scarcity conditions are accentuated in the mid future with average monthly streamflow in october reaching negative differences of 51 and 49 of the q90 under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively which indicate that half of the environmental flow required for aquatic animal living will be compromised finally when considering the far future period this value maintains constant in the trend scenario and reaches 71 under the pessimist scenario these results indicate a growing hydrological drought risk and a situation of extreme scarcity for both human and ecosystems towards the end of the century overall ssp5 8 5 presented lower values of average monthly streamflow than the ssp2 4 5 due to the forest cover expansion discussed above scenarios of climate change associated with lcluc ssp2 4 5 landuse and ssp5 8 5 landuse where we found a reduction in water yield in comparison with climate change scenarios solely intensified even more the water stress condition in the basin with an average monthly streamflow decline of 77 of q90 in the far future under the ssp5 8 5 scenario again this reinforces that a robust investigation must be performed beforehand by stakeholders in relation to reforestation programs these results of growing levels of water insecurity and vulnerability in the dry season period pose an enormous threat to the multiple uses of water the main conflicts result from the difficulty in making the satisfaction of water demand for consumptive uses compatible with the requirements of electricity generation cbhsf 2013 during the drought event observed in the três marias power plant in 2013 2014 the minimum level restriction of the turbines caused disruption or even the interruption of navigation water supply of cities and irrigation perimeters downstream the três marias dam as a result of reduced streamflow across the são francisco river between the três marias and the sobradinho plants therefore the concern with securing water for the multiple uses is extremely necessary in order to avoid conflicts among water users in the energy sector 61 of brazil s power generation in 2020 comes from hydroelectric power plants aneel 2020 due to this heavily reliance of hydroelectric energy contribution to the national integrated power grid the brazilian energy matrix is strongly dependent on the hydrological cycle of basins soito and freitas 2011 as noted in this study the imbalance of water availability should result in high water insecurity and vulnerability in the future which will consequently affect the generation of electric power in the três marias basin some studies have investigated the impacts of climate change on hydroelectricity generation in the são francisco river basin and predicted a loss in hydroelectricity production andrade et al 2012 de jong et al 2018 de lucena et al 2009 to offset this condition the energy sector in the três marias basin must be dependent on the integration with alternatives sources of renewable energy such as solar and wind power similarly in the water supply sector since 43 of water withdrawal of the three basins is supplied to cities and industrial uses cbhsf 2016b measures such as wastewater reuse and rainwater harvesting as well as policies aiming at reducing human consumption are essential to compensate the increase in water demand in fact some industries are already promoting the recirculation optimization or reuse of waters in the industry process reducing fresh water intake cbhsf 2016b moreover according to the national sanitation information system snis 2017 water loss in the water distribution system reaches up to 36 in the state of minas gerais this is mainly due to leakage on transmission and distribution mains and unauthorized consumption from the system therefore investment in water loss control is imperative to increase resilience in the basin as a whole in relation to the food sector irrigated agriculture is the activity with the highest water demand accounting for 57 of the total consumption of the three basins and the trend is that this activity will further increase its water needs cbhsf 2016c measures to manage water use in this sector include the use of modern irrigation practices that reduce water consumption such as irrigation scheduling and real time control koech and langat 2018 and subsurface drip irrigation ayars et al 1999 policies to control agricultural expansion and monoculture severe inspection on the abstractions and encourage a certification program for the rational use of water for irrigation resilience in the water food energy ecosystems wfee nexus involves the ability to integrate the food energy and water systems for the purpose of coping with pressures and conflicts and sustain the food energy and water security d odorico et al 2018 planning in response to anticipated climate change and lcluc impacts to the nexus sectors is crucial to boost resilience in the basin in the long run an integrated approach to the assessment of the wfee nexus with the public and stakeholder s participation can attenuate conflicts and foster the development of different management and adaptation strategies aiming at mutually reducing trade offs and providing benefits for all sectors 4 conclusions in this paper we investigate whether a positive change in soil and water conservation practices and reforestation may affect the water availability and boost the resilience in a brazilian cerrado basin under climate change scenarios this study was developed in the três marias basin 50 600 km² and its affluent the tributaries of the upper são francisco sf pará and paraopeba river basins with drainage areas of 13 240 km² 7 409 km² and 7 950 km² respectively first we calibrated 1992 2005 and evaluated 2006 2012 the swat model using daily observed data obtaining kling gupta efficiency values greater than 0 60 for both periods to evaluate the effects of lcluc on water availability we created a lcluc scenario that considers the best soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones following the recommendations of the brazilian payment for ecosystem services pes we also used the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios data from the cmip6 project for the period of 2015 2100 where we first perform an ensemble of future projections generated by seven gcms and bias corrected them using the linear method additionally we estimated the environmental flow for each month and contrasted it with the average monthly streamflow for each climate change and lcluc scenarios our results indicate that streamflow can be expected to decrease in the three basins due to a reduction in precipitation and an increase in temperature values under both climate change scenarios this reduction in water availability is accentuated when using climate change data associated with the lcluc scenario as a result even though baseflow decreased along the projected periods the combination of both climate change and lcluc scenarios led to an increase in its contribution to total flow in addition to climate change impacts forests implicate in high evapotranspiration and in great amount of water being intercepted by tree canopies moreover deeper root system from trees results in additional water uptake and demand which in turn leads to an increase in transpiration and less water available for groundwater recharge therefore although forests provide several benefits such as pollination habitat and recycling riparian forest cover expansion and soil and water conservation practices do not necessarily result in positive changes in water availability these findings must be carefully analyzed by watershed service programs mainly because pes programs in brazil aim at increasing water yield as a primary goal in the water security assessment for the três marias basin situations of hydrological drought risk and extreme scarcity can be expected to occur in the mid and far future under all scenarios mainly in the dry period from august to october this high insecurity and vulnerability conditions threaten the availability of water for ecosystems which in turn compromise the fulfillment of the needs from the food energy and water sectors for human living sustenance towards the end of the century it is indubitably essential that authorities and policy makers implement efficient adaptation and preventive strategies in order to secure water and mitigate losses in the food energy and water sectors the results and suggestions made in this study can assist regional government in formulating and stablishing effective policies to foster water security in the três marias basin as well as in the são francisco river basin at large future research may further assess the interactions and trade offs in the water food energy ecossytems wfee nexus and quantitatively quantify the economic impacts of each sector under critical water stress conditions in the region author

8173,study region kathmandu valley nepal study focus water scarcity affects more than 40 of the global population households in low and middle income countries typically use alternative water sources to piped water such as groundwater tanker water and jar water and various coping strategies to deal with water scarcity this study quantitatively examines the association between using multiple water sources and individual water consumption in addition we investigated the relationship between individual water consumption and physical i e water source supply time and non physical wealth status education for household head house ownership participation in local community water treatment factors before and after the 2015 gorkha earthquake a survey about socio demographics domestic water use behavior and community involvement was conducted three times and the data collected from 992 households were used for analysis new hydrological insights for the region it was confirmed that use of additional water sources is associated with greater individual water consumption this was especially the case in households using both groundwater and tanker water in addition wealth status education for household head and house ownership were associated with increased individual water consumption but this association was not apparent after the earthquake participation in the local community was also associated with increased individual water consumption except for the period impacted by the earthquake households using treated water consumed less water across all periods surveyed keywords

lpcd well 1998 total recommended basic water requirement is 50 lpcd gleick 1996 and optimal access for domestic hygiene is 100 lpcd howard and bartram 2003 however there are regions where domestic water consumption does not reach 100 lpcd gleick 1996 shaban and sharma 2007 to deal with water scarcity the use of multiple water sources is commonly practiced at households in asia africa and the pacific cook et al 2016 elliott et al 2017 grace et al 2013 howard et al 2002 luetkemeier and liehr 2018 özdemir et al 2011 shrestha et al 2017 however to our knowledge no study has quantitatively investigated the association between using multiple water sources and water consumption at household level recently water insecurity has been defined at the household level as the inability to access and benefit from affordable adequate reliable and safe water for wellbeing and a healthy life jepson et al 2017 achore et al 2020 identified that nine key coping strategies are typically employed by households including construction of alternative source water sharing and borrowing from social networks and treatment to improve water quality to deal with water insecurity according to previous reports households with higher income had higher probability of digging a tube well grace et al 2013 zerah 2000 the probability to treat water and larger water storage capacity zerah 2000 in addition it was indicated that more educated households have higher cost to behaviors collecting pumping treating storing and purchasing to deal with water scarcity pattanayak et al 2005 as above socioeconomic status such as household income and education level are associated with coping strategies venkataramanan et al 2020 classified individual and households level coping strategies related to access into three types physical economic and social here we assumed physical factors which depend on the external environment e g water source and water supply system and also non physical factors e g wealth status are associated with access i e water consumption though several reports confirm factors associated with household water consumption babel et al 2007 nauges and van den berg 2009 house peters and chang 2011 coulibaly et al 2014 many of them focused on factors that are not determined at the household level e g economics and climate and no reports considered the combined use of different sources of water it remains unknown how physical and non physical factors are associated with water consumption at household the kathmandu valley nepal is a region with chronic water scarcity due to population growth and rapid urbanization that has occurred since 1990 thapa and murayama 2010 like places with similar characteristics elsewhere in the world households in kathmandu habitually use multiple water sources to deal with water scarcity water demand is 370 million liters per day mld while kathmandu upatyaka khanepani limited kukl which is the only piped water supply company for the region provides 144 mld of piped water in the wet season and 86 mld in the dry season tamrakar and manandhar 2016 these production volumes have remained almost constant from 2008 to 2014 despite population growth the nepal government is implementing melamchi water supply project which aims to distribute 510 mld of water supply from the melamchi river in two phases 170 mld by september 2016 delayed by two years because of the 2015 earthquake shortage of fuel and other project management issues and an additional 340 mld by 2023 however only 60 mld is being distributed around the valley as of march 2021 the himalayan times 2021 and the progress of this project is behind the initial plan udmale et al 2016 estimated supply deficit would be 124 mld in 2021 after the first phase based on estimated population and the assumption that residents need 135 lpcd also thapa et al 2018 showed there is some inequity in water distribution in the water service area and the area with new reservoirs is expected to reach 317 lpcd while the area with existing reservoirs is expected to deteriorate to 52 lpcd in 2024 after the second phase in addition the average time of piped water supply was 4 h per week during the dry season in 2015 due to insufficient water supply households must use not only piped water but also alternative water sources shrestha et al 2017 however the main

and storage in this area however there was no information about the effect of borrowing and sharing water from social networks in nepal the 7 6 magnitude gorkha earthquake was occurred on april 25 2015 the earthquake caused major partial damage to 1 570 3 663 out of 11 288 water supply systems in the affected areas npc 2015 which resulted in a 40 reduction in piped water supply post earthquake thapa et al 2016 those environmental factors i e seasonality and earthquake supposedly affect other physical factors such as well collapse and obstruction of vendor water distribution or non physical factors the objective of this study was to quantify the association between using multiple water sources and individual water consumption in addition we investigated the relationship between water consumption and physical and non physical factors before and after the gorkha earthquake 2 methods 2 1 study area kathmandu is the capital city of nepal a low income country at the north of india in south asia kathmandu valley located in the midland of the himalayas between 27 32 13 and 27 49 10 n and 85 11 31 and 85 31 38 e has an area of 665 km2 and consists of the entire bhaktapur district 85

et al 2021 the population of kathmandu valley increased from 2 51 million in 2011 3 2 million in 2015 and the population growth rate was 4 3 per year from 2006 to 2015 tamrakar and manandhar 2016 as of 2017 kukl was distributing water to households through 10 branch offices in the kathmandu valley and provides services to 90 of the population 2 2 questionnaire survey this study used a questionnaire survey conducted in the densely populated areas of all kukl water supply areas i e the white areas shown in fig 1 but excluding bhaktapur the sampling unit was a household and there are more than 40 000 households in our target area a two stage cluster survey design was used for households sampling in the first stage total 50 clusters were extracted applying the probability proportional to size pps sampling technique on the basis of household number and geographical locations of each cluster were randomly selected using geographic information system here household numbers in wards of the municipalities were considered for selecting cluster in the second step the trained interviewers from local community randomly selected 30 households closest to each selected geographical location they conducted face to face interviews with any one of the household members aged between 15 and 60 years who were capable of understanding and answering the questions the questionnaire was created in english and translated into nepali answers were given in nepali and translated back into english the questionnaire included questions on socio demographics characteristics economic domestic water use behavior water storage treatment collecting buying etc and community involvement the details of this questionnaire have been explained by shrestha et al 2017 the questionnaire was conducted in three phases as shown in fig 2 phase 1 baseline period was conducted during the dry season from january to april 2015 but only in 39 clusters 1139 households due to the gorkha earthquake phase 2 was conducted in 50 clusters 1500 households during the dry season from december 2015 to february 2016 8 months after the earthquake and phase 3 was conducted in 50 clusters 1500 households during the wet season from august to september 2016 1 year and 4 months after the earthquake after excluding households that were answered by family members of invalid age or that had missing answers in one or more of the study phases the data from 992 households were included in this study 2 3 factors for analysis table 1 shows dependent and independent variables selected in this study for linear regression analysis piped water groundwater tanker water and jar water are the main water sources in kathmandu valley and are considered in this study few households answered they use another type of waters such as stone spout spring water rainwater and community water source piped water is defined as water supplied by the water utility kukl groundwater is defined as water extracted from underground through private dug wells and tube wells tanker water is market water sold by private vendors and is delivered from a truck or tanker jar water is also a market water available in 20 l bottle households answered water consumption in l per day for each source separately and the water consumption amount divided by the family size is the water consumption liter per capita per day lpcd used in this study the sum water consumption from different sources was considered as total water consumption a dependent variable seven independent variables i e source supply time wealth status education for household head head education ownership community and treatment were decided with respect to both physical and non physical characteristics while referring to previous reports shrestha et al 2013 2018 source consisted of 4 categories households using only piped water groundwater and piped water tanker water and piped water groundwater and tanker water and piped water supply time was the hours per week that piped water is supplied source and supply time were identified as physical factors wealth status was determined by constructing a wealth index based on 16 household asset possessions e g television bicycle car and refrigerator cordova 2009 the wealth index represented a household s long run economic status the principal component analysis was used for identifying the weighting of each asset prior to constructing a wealth index based on the wealth index households were categorized in to five quintiles lowest lower medium higher highest shrestha et al 2017 head education consists of 3 categories based on attainment of education by household head no education primary or secondary school and college or university since there is usually more than one household per house in this area ownership house owner tenant was also considered achore et al 2020 has identified water sharing and borrowing from social networks as one of the coping strategies to deal with water insecurity being a member of a local community strengthen social network of a household and water is borrowed or shared to cope with water scarcity hence whether or not a household is a member of local community was decided as an independent variable community though this study focused on water consumption quality also should not be overlooked and treatment was included as an independent variable treatment consists of 2 categories with without water treatment regardless of the method of treatment wealth status head education ownership community and treatment were identified as non physical factors that vary at the household level the above seven factors were adjusted as covariates in multiple linear regression analysis first a regression analysis was conducted using all data collected from phase 1 3 and including earthquake before after and season dry wet as independent variables in addition to the above seven independent variables another regression analysis was then conducted in each of the three phases to enable comparison of the association between seven independent variables and water consumption under the different situations before and after the april 2015 gorkha earthquake and across the wet and dry seasons 2 4 statistical analysis a post hoc comparison using the games howel test was used to examine the difference in water consumption of each source across the three phases and the difference in water consumption for each water source and also for combinations of water sources the correlation between continuous variables and continuous and nominal variables was assessed using pearson correlation coefficient and the correlation between nominal variables was assessed using cramer s v the correlation was considered strong when pearson correlation coefficient exceeded 0 7 dancey and reidy 2007 and cramer s v exceeded 0 5 multiple linear regression analysis was used to indicate the impact of the selected factors on individual water consumption and correlation coefficient and significance levels were calculated the significance level was set at 0 05 for all statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted by using the ibm spss statistics version 26 0 ibm corporation armonk ny usa 2 5 ethical considerations the ethical review board of the university of yamanashi and the nepal health research council reviewed and approved the study protocol shrestha et al 2017 the participants were informed about the objectives and procedures of the study and requested to participate voluntarily the anonymity and confidentiality of the participants were assured those who agreed to the terms and conditions signed the informed consent form omitting questions and withdrawing from the study were permitted at any time during the interview 3 results 3 1 water consumption for each source in phase 1 2 and 3 appropriate responses relating to water consumption were received from 832 884 and 913 out of 992 households respectively fig 3 shows the mean household consumption for each water source and their total in each of the three phases piped water consumption significantly decreased in phase 2 and partially recovered in phase 3 there were significant differences in piped water consumption between all phases p 0 01 jar water consumption was relatively low for all three phases groundwater consumption was significantly higher p 0 01 in the wet season phase 3 whereas tanker water consumption was significantly lower p 0 01 in wet season than in dry season phase 1 and phase 2 the total water consumption significantly decreased after the earthquake p 0 01 and recovered in the wet season p 0 01 3 2 combination of using water sources in phase 1 2 and 3 appropriate responses relating to water sources were received from 768 875 and 901 out of 992 households respectively there were 15 combinations of using water sources and water consumption associated with each combination is shown in fig 4 we assumed that piped water is the most basic water source because of the quality and groundwater and tanker water are used for the shortage of piped water and divided households into four groups only pipe only ground ground and pipe only tanker tanker and pipe and ground and tanker ground tanker and pipe here households using only jar water were excluded since its consumption was very low the number of households in each group was shown in table 2 the mean water consumption increased with the number of water sources throughout all phases except for households using tanker water in phase 3 in phase 1 2 3 respectively households using one alternative source consumed 1 6 1 8 3 2 4 6 and 1 2 1 9 times the amount of water consumed by households using only piped water in phase 1 2 3 respectively households using two alternative sources consumed 3 8 4 and 2 5 times the amount of water consumed by households using only piped water between households using groundwater and those using tanker water though there was no difference in phase 1 those using tanker water consumed more water in phase 2 p 0 01 while those using groundwater consumed more water in phase 3 p 0 01 water consumption in households using both alternative sources were significantly high throughout all phases and exceeded 100 lpcd which complied with optimal water access quantity as proposed by howard and bartram 2003 3 3 number of households for each factor the number of households for all factors and their ratios are shown in table 2 more details of descriptive statistics are shown in appendix table a1 in the kathmandu valley 20 13 of households used only piped water in dry wet season more than 28 of households were members of one or more communities and more than 67 of households treated water the data collected from 735 853 and 878 households in phase 1 2 and 3 respectively that answered all factor related questions were included for multiple linear regression analysis water storage is a coping strategy however we did not include the factor since it had a strong correlation with source there were no strong correlations between independent variables that avoided the problem of multicollinearity in multiple regression analysis appendix table a2 3 4 relationship between factors and water consumption the results of the multiple linear regression analyses are shown in table 3 the results using data from all phases indicated that water consumption decreased after the earthquake and increased during wet season and these impacts appeared greater by being adjusted with other variables after confirming the significant impacts from the two background variables details of indirect or riffle associations with water consumption were examined in each phase by excluding the two variables adjusted regression coefficient indicated that consumptions were high in households using multiple water sources except for households using tanker water in phase 3 wet season compared to households using only piped water in particular the consumption of households using both alternative sources were more than double the consumption of households using one alternative source throughout the three phases after being adjusted by the other factors supply time was a statistically insignificant factor in the dry season phase 1 p 0 19 phase 2 p 0 56 phase 3 p 0 01 however unadjusted it tended to be associated with reduced consumption throughout the three phases households with higher wealth status and with higher education for household head consumed more water however these associations were not statistically significant after the earthquake in phase 2 though households with primary or secondary education for head significantly consumed less water than those with no education education had negligible association with water consumption since households with highest education college or university was not significant in addition households owning a house and participating in the local community consumed more water except in phase 2 the direction of the relationship between the consumption and water treatment was negative in all phases the models explained 19 35 of the variability in individual water consumption 4 discussion this study quantifies the association between using multiple water sources and individual water consumption in a region with limited access to water furthermore the physical and non physical factors that affect water consumption were assessed considering the effect of the earthquake the key findings were 1 use of additional water sources was associated with greater water consumption especially in households using both groundwater and tanker water 2 wealth status education for household head head education house ownership were associated with increased water consumption in the baseline period but this association was not apparent after the earthquake and 3 households using treated water consumed less water across all periods while participation in the local community increased water consumption except after the earthquake the regression models could explain 19 35 of the variability in individual water consumption which is above the sufficient criterion 10 the result of multiple regression analysis using data of all phases showed that water consumption decreased after the earthquake in addition water consumption was positively correlated to season when adjusting other variables while such increase was not detected by a descriptive analysis fig 3 piped water supply in wet season is usually high but the preliminary result indicated that piped water consumption in wet season phase 3 was lower than that in dry season phase 1 this indicated that the damage on piped water system from the earthquake persisted until phase 3 which was not in ordinary wet season although the effect of season on water consumption was implied as mention above there was another concern that the impacts of the earthquake on not only piped water but also several other variables continued until phase 3 and for this reason the impact of seasonality was not further examined in this study multiple regression analysis indicated households with shorter supply times tended to consume more water table 3 according to pasakhala et al 2013 households with shorter supply time tended to use a larger number of water sources groundwater and tanker water which are common alternatives to piped water are available in larger amounts at one time than piped water and thus total water consumption increased in households with shorter supply times phase 2 and 3 results showed that households were able to achieve consumption of more than 80 lpcd by using tanker water and groundwater despite the decrease in water supply due to the earthquake fig 4 while this value was above the recommended value for basic requirements gleick 1996 it is below the recommended value for optimal access howard and bartram 2003 so is not sufficient from the perspective of domestic health and hygiene as shown in fig 4 individual water consumption increased with the increase in the number of water sources even after the earthquake except for households using tanker water in phase 3 particularly water consumption synergistically increased in households using two alternative sources shrestha et al 2020 concluded that the use of a greater number of water sources was one of the characteristics necessary for disaster resilience and water security in addition water deficit between supply and demand may continue even after 24 h availability of electricity from december 2016 global press journal 2017 and melamchi water supply project thus the diversity of water sources would be essential in the future our study indicated wealth status education for household head and ownership contributed to increased water consumption in the baseline period phase 1 pasakhala et al 2013 reported household income was the most influential factor in selection of coping strategies including purchase and use of alternative sources and found the households with low income tend to consume less water similar to the result of this study in addition according to previous reports households with highly educated head member have higher coping costs pattanayak et al 2005 and owners pay more to get water from alternative sources though tenants compromise their water consumption guragai et al 2017 wealth status education for household head and ownership may have helped improve coping strategies and then increase water consumption water treatment had a significant negative impact on the consumption throughout the three phases although households usually treat water only for drinking purpose the practice of treating water might have affected total water consumption households using treated water may be able to implement strategies for coping with water scarcity i e the gap between demand and supply as well as pollution in other words they may have high awareness of conserving water and as a result total water consumption decreased we also noticed the importance of membership in the local community that increased water consumption in the baseline period according to a previous report bisung and elliott 2014 interactions among community members affected their ability to collectively craft and enforce rules for management of water and sanitation facilities in the valley households supposedly enabled to actively cooperate on treatment distribution and protection of water through participation in community shrestha et al 2019 though we indicated wealth status education for household head ownership and participation in the local community had a positive impact on individual water consumption the relationships were insignificant after the earthquake and the mean consumption decreased to 64 lpcd given that the mean consumption in baseline period was 88 lpcd the gap of these values may include a potential amount that can be increased by these factors in this study individual water consumption lpcd was calculated by dividing household water consumption by the size of families this was based on assumption that all household members use water equally according to achore et al 2020 and venkataramanan et al 2020 water sharing with social networks was identified as a coping strategy our model could be improved and water saving effect can be better assessed by considering water sharing rates within households in addition a comparative study is needed to verify the impact of controlling variables on water consumption in regions using multiple water sources regarding physical factors we suggest to strengthen the diversity of water sources in both baseline and emergency periods as pandey et al 2013 stated regulation of groundwater development and augmentation of recharge are important in addition road maintenance and improvement can help make the distribution of tanker water more efficient even in emergency periods regarding non physical factors we suggest that encouragement of participation in the local community is an immediate and effective strategy for residents to cope with scarcity in surface water and groundwater resources in particular introducing compact water treatment systems shrestha et al 2019 that are decentralized and managed by residents may enhance relationship among residents and water security as a result it will be easier for residents to participate in the local community support for construction of new wells or systematic improvement for increasing supply time of piped water especially focused on households with lower socioeconomic status could also help reduce water scarcity our study contributes to understanding the local situation in kathmandu valley nepal but the same approach could be applied in similar regions around the world to assess the effectiveness of different strategies used to cope with water scarcity 5 conclusions this study showed that individual water consumption increased with the increase in the number of water sources particularly it synergistically increased in households using groundwater and tanker water in addition wealth status education for household head and house ownership were associated with significantly higher water consumption however these relationships disappeared after the earthquake participation in the local community a factor of coping strategy also increased individual water consumption on the other hand households using treated water consumed less water regardless of the survey periods probably because people in these households have higher awareness of conserving water author contributions yuri ito conceptualization investigation data

8173,study region kathmandu valley nepal study focus water scarcity affects more than 40 of the global population households in low and middle income countries typically use alternative water sources to piped water such as groundwater tanker water and jar water and various coping strategies to deal with water scarcity this study quantitatively examines the association between using multiple water sources and individual water consumption in addition we investigated the relationship between individual water consumption and physical i e water source supply time and non physical wealth status education for household head house ownership participation in local community water treatment factors before and after the 2015 gorkha earthquake a survey about socio demographics domestic water use behavior and community involvement was conducted three times and the data collected from 992 households were used for analysis new hydrological insights for the region it was confirmed that use of additional water sources is associated with greater individual water consumption this was especially the case in households using both groundwater and tanker water in addition wealth status education for household head and house ownership were associated with increased individual water consumption but this association was not apparent after the earthquake participation in the local community was also associated with increased individual water consumption except for the period impacted by the earthquake households using treated water consumed less water across all periods surveyed keywords

investigated the association between using multiple water sources and water consumption at household level recently water insecurity has been defined at the household level as the inability to access and benefit from affordable adequate reliable and safe water for wellbeing and a healthy life jepson et al 2017 achore et al 2020 identified that nine key coping strategies are typically employed by households including construction of alternative source water sharing and borrowing from social networks and treatment to improve water quality to deal with water insecurity according to previous reports households with higher income had higher probability of digging a tube well grace et al 2013 zerah 2000 the probability to treat water and larger water storage capacity zerah 2000 in addition it was indicated that more educated households have higher cost to behaviors collecting pumping treating storing and purchasing to deal with water scarcity pattanayak et al 2005 as above socioeconomic status such as household income and education level are associated with coping strategies venkataramanan et al 2020 classified individual and households level coping strategies related to access into three types physical economic and social here we assumed physical factors which depend on the external environment e g water source and water supply system and also non physical factors e g wealth status are associated with access i e water consumption though several reports confirm factors associated with household water consumption babel et al 2007 nauges and van den berg 2009 house peters and chang 2011 coulibaly et al 2014 many of them focused on factors that are not determined at the household level e g economics and climate and no reports considered the combined use of different sources of water it remains unknown how physical and non physical factors are associated with water consumption at household the kathmandu valley nepal is a region with chronic water scarcity due to population growth and rapid urbanization that has occurred since 1990 thapa and murayama 2010 like places with similar characteristics elsewhere in the world households in kathmandu habitually use multiple water sources to deal with water scarcity water demand is 370 million liters per day mld while kathmandu upatyaka khanepani limited kukl which is the only piped water supply company for the region provides 144 mld of piped water in the wet season and 86 mld in the dry season tamrakar and manandhar 2016 these production volumes have remained almost constant from 2008 to 2014 despite

identifying the weighting of each asset prior to constructing a wealth index based on the wealth index households were categorized in to five quintiles lowest lower medium higher highest shrestha et al 2017 head education consists of 3 categories based on attainment of education by household head no education primary or secondary school and college or university since there is usually more than one household per house in this area ownership house owner tenant was also considered achore et al 2020 has identified water sharing and borrowing from social networks as one of the coping strategies to deal with water insecurity being a member of a local community strengthen social network of a household and water is borrowed or shared to cope with water scarcity hence whether or not a household is a member of local community was decided as an independent variable community though this study focused on water consumption quality also should not be overlooked and treatment was included as an independent variable treatment consists of 2 categories with without water treatment regardless of the method of treatment wealth status head education ownership community and treatment were identified as non physical factors that vary at the household level the above seven factors were adjusted as covariates in multiple linear regression analysis first a regression analysis was conducted using all data collected from phase 1 3 and including earthquake before after and season dry wet as independent variables in addition to the above seven independent variables another regression analysis was then conducted in each of the three phases to enable comparison of the association between seven independent variables and water consumption under the different situations before and after the april 2015 gorkha earthquake and across the wet and dry seasons 2 4 statistical analysis a post hoc comparison using the games howel test was used to examine the difference in water consumption of each source across the three phases and the difference in water consumption for each water source and also for combinations of water sources the correlation between continuous variables and continuous and nominal variables was assessed using pearson correlation coefficient and the correlation between nominal variables was assessed using cramer s v the correlation was considered strong when pearson correlation coefficient exceeded 0 7 dancey and reidy 2007 and cramer s v exceeded 0 5 multiple linear regression analysis was used to indicate the impact of the selected factors on individual water consumption and correlation coefficient and significance levels were calculated the significance level was set at 0 05 for all statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted by using the ibm spss statistics version 26 0 ibm corporation armonk ny usa 2 5 ethical considerations the ethical review board of the university of yamanashi and the nepal health research council reviewed and approved the study protocol shrestha et al 2017 the participants were informed about the objectives and procedures of the study and requested to participate voluntarily the anonymity and confidentiality of the participants were assured those who agreed to the terms and conditions signed the informed consent form omitting questions and withdrawing from the study were permitted at any time during the interview 3 results 3 1 water consumption for each source in phase 1 2 and 3 appropriate responses relating to water consumption were received from 832 884 and 913 out of 992 households respectively fig 3 shows the mean household consumption for each water source and their total in each of the three phases piped water consumption significantly decreased in phase 2 and partially recovered in phase 3 there were significant differences in piped water consumption between all phases p 0 01 jar water consumption was relatively low for all three phases groundwater consumption was significantly higher p 0 01 in the wet season phase 3 whereas tanker water consumption was significantly lower p 0 01 in wet season than in dry season phase 1 and phase 2 the total water consumption significantly decreased after the earthquake p 0 01 and recovered in the wet season p 0 01 3 2 combination of using water sources in phase 1 2 and 3 appropriate responses relating to water sources were received from 768 875 and 901 out of 992 households respectively there were 15 combinations of using water sources and water consumption associated with each combination is shown in fig 4 we assumed that piped water is the most basic water source because of the quality and groundwater and tanker water are used for the shortage of piped water and divided households into four groups only pipe only ground ground and pipe only tanker tanker and pipe and ground and tanker ground tanker and pipe here households using only jar water were excluded since its consumption was very low the number of households in each group was shown in table 2 the mean water consumption increased with the number of water sources throughout all phases except for households using tanker water in phase 3 in phase 1 2 3 respectively households using one alternative source consumed 1 6 1 8 3 2 4 6 and 1 2 1 9 times the amount of water consumed by households using only piped water in phase 1 2 3 respectively households using two alternative sources consumed 3 8 4 and 2 5 times the amount of water consumed by households using only piped water between households using groundwater and those using tanker water though there was no difference in phase 1 those using tanker water consumed more water in phase 2 p 0 01 while those using groundwater consumed more water in phase 3 p 0 01 water consumption in households using both alternative sources were significantly high throughout all phases and exceeded 100 lpcd which complied with optimal water access quantity as proposed by howard and bartram 2003 3 3 number of households for each factor the number of households for all factors and their ratios are shown in table 2 more details of descriptive statistics are shown in appendix table a1 in the kathmandu valley 20 13 of households used only piped water in dry wet season more than 28 of households were members of one or more communities and more than 67 of households treated water the data collected from 735 853 and 878 households in phase 1 2 and 3 respectively that answered all factor related questions were included for multiple linear regression analysis water storage is a coping strategy however we did not include the factor since it had a strong correlation with source there were no strong correlations between independent variables that avoided the problem of multicollinearity in multiple regression analysis appendix table a2 3 4 relationship between factors and water consumption the results of the multiple linear regression analyses are shown in table 3 the results using data from all phases indicated that water consumption decreased after the earthquake and increased during wet season and these impacts appeared greater by being adjusted with other variables after confirming the significant impacts from the two background variables details of indirect or riffle associations with water consumption were examined in each phase by excluding the two variables adjusted regression coefficient indicated that consumptions were high in households using multiple water sources except for households using tanker water in phase 3 wet season compared to households using only piped water in particular the consumption of households using both alternative sources were more than double the consumption of households using one alternative source throughout the three phases after being adjusted by the other factors supply time was a statistically insignificant factor in the dry season phase 1 p 0 19 phase 2 p 0 56 phase 3 p 0 01 however unadjusted it tended to be associated with reduced consumption throughout the three phases households with higher wealth status and with higher education for household head consumed more water however these associations were not statistically significant after the earthquake in phase 2 though households with primary or secondary education for head significantly consumed less water than those with no education education had negligible association with water consumption since households with highest education college or university was not significant in addition households owning a house and participating in the local community consumed more water except in phase 2 the direction of the relationship between the consumption and water treatment was negative in all phases the models explained 19 35 of the variability in individual water consumption 4 discussion this study quantifies the association between using multiple water sources and individual water consumption in a region with limited access to water furthermore the physical and non physical factors that affect water consumption were assessed considering the effect of the earthquake the key findings were 1 use of additional water sources was associated with greater water consumption especially in households using both groundwater and tanker water 2 wealth status education for household head head education house ownership were associated with increased water consumption in the baseline period but this association was not apparent after the earthquake and 3 households using treated water consumed less water across all periods while participation in the local community increased water consumption except after the earthquake the regression models could explain 19 35 of the variability in individual water consumption which is above the sufficient criterion 10 the result of multiple regression analysis using data of all phases showed that water consumption decreased after the earthquake in addition water consumption was positively correlated to season when adjusting other variables while such increase was not detected by a descriptive analysis fig 3 piped water supply in wet season is usually high but the preliminary result indicated that piped water consumption in wet season phase 3 was lower than that in dry season phase 1 this indicated that the damage on piped water system from the earthquake persisted until phase 3 which was not in ordinary wet season although the effect of season on water consumption was implied as mention above there was another concern that the impacts of the earthquake on not only piped water but also several other variables continued until phase 3 and for this reason the impact of seasonality was not further examined in this study multiple regression analysis indicated households with shorter supply times tended to consume more water table 3 according to pasakhala et al 2013 households with shorter supply time tended to use a larger number of water sources groundwater and tanker water which are common alternatives to piped water are available in larger amounts at one time than piped water and thus total water consumption increased in households with shorter supply times phase 2 and 3 results showed that households were able to achieve consumption of more than 80 lpcd by using tanker water and groundwater despite the decrease in water supply due to the earthquake fig 4 while this value was above the recommended value for basic requirements gleick 1996 it is below the recommended value for optimal access howard and bartram 2003 so is not sufficient from the perspective of domestic health and hygiene as shown in fig 4 individual water consumption increased with the increase in the number of water sources even after the earthquake except for households using tanker water in phase 3 particularly water consumption synergistically increased in households using two alternative sources shrestha et al 2020 concluded that the use of a greater number of water sources was one of the characteristics necessary for disaster resilience and water security in addition water deficit between supply and demand may continue even after 24 h availability of electricity from december 2016 global press journal 2017 and melamchi water supply project thus the diversity of water sources would be essential in the future our study indicated wealth status education for household head and ownership contributed to increased water consumption in the baseline period phase 1 pasakhala et al 2013 reported household income was the most influential factor in selection of coping strategies including purchase and use of alternative sources and found the households with low income tend to consume less water similar to the result of this study in addition according to previous reports households with highly educated head member have higher coping costs pattanayak et al 2005 and owners pay more to get water from alternative sources though tenants compromise their water consumption guragai et al 2017 wealth status education for household head and ownership may have helped improve coping strategies and then increase water consumption water treatment had a significant negative impact on the consumption throughout the three phases although households usually treat water only for drinking purpose the practice of treating water might have affected total water consumption households using treated water may be able to implement strategies for coping with water scarcity i e the gap between demand and supply as well as pollution in other words they may have high awareness of conserving water and as a result total water consumption decreased we also noticed the importance of membership in the local community that increased water consumption in the baseline period according to a previous report bisung and elliott 2014 interactions among community members affected their ability to collectively craft and enforce rules for management of water and sanitation facilities in the valley households supposedly enabled to actively cooperate on treatment distribution and protection of water through participation in community shrestha et al 2019 though we indicated wealth status education for household head ownership and participation in the local community had a positive impact on individual water consumption the relationships were insignificant after the earthquake and the mean consumption decreased to 64 lpcd given that the mean consumption in baseline period was 88 lpcd the gap of these values may include a potential amount that can be increased by these factors in this study individual water consumption lpcd was calculated by dividing household water consumption by the size of families this was based on assumption that all household members use water equally according to achore et al 2020 and venkataramanan et al 2020 water sharing with social networks was identified as a coping strategy our model could be improved and water saving effect can be better assessed by considering water sharing rates within households in addition a comparative study is needed to verify the impact of controlling variables on water consumption in regions using multiple water sources regarding physical factors we suggest to strengthen the diversity of water sources in both baseline and emergency periods as pandey et al 2013 stated regulation of groundwater development and augmentation of recharge are important in addition road maintenance and improvement can help make the distribution of tanker water more efficient even in emergency periods regarding non physical factors we suggest that encouragement of participation in the local community is an immediate and effective strategy for residents to cope with scarcity in surface water and groundwater resources in particular introducing compact water treatment systems shrestha et al 2019 that are decentralized and managed by residents may enhance relationship among residents and water security as a result it will be easier for residents to participate in the local community support for construction of new wells or systematic improvement for increasing supply time of piped water especially focused on households with lower socioeconomic status could also help reduce water scarcity our study contributes to understanding the local situation in kathmandu valley nepal but the same approach could be applied in similar regions around the world to assess the effectiveness of different strategies used to cope with water scarcity 5 conclusions this study showed that individual water consumption increased with the increase in the number of water sources particularly it synergistically increased in households using groundwater and tanker water in addition wealth status education for household head and house ownership were associated with significantly higher water consumption however these relationships disappeared after the earthquake participation in the local community a factor of coping strategy also increased individual water consumption on the other hand households using treated water consumed less water regardless of the survey periods probably because people in these households have higher awareness of conserving water author contributions yuri ito conceptualization investigation data

8174,study region glaciated headwaters of the vilcanota urubamba river basin southern peru study focus a pivotal question is if robust hydrological simulation of streamflow in data scarce and glaciated catchments can be achieved using parsimonious or more complex models therefore a multi model assessment of three glacio hydrological models of different complexity was conducted thoroughly analyzing model performance flow signatures and runoff components new hydrological insights for the region in data scarce catchments such as in the tropical andes parsimonious glacio hydrological

increasing data scarcity more complex models involve higher uncertainties furthermore complex models require substantial understanding of the underpinning hydrological processes and a comprehensive calibration strategy to avoid apparently high model performance driven by inadequate assumptions based on these insights we present a framework for robust glacio hydrological simulation under data scarcity this stepwise approach includes among others a multi model focus with a comprehensive assessment of flow signatures and runoff components future modeling needs to be further supported by alternative data collection strategies to substantially improve knowledge and process understanding therefore the extension of sensor and station networks combined with the integration of co produced knowledge represents a meaningful measure to robust decision making for climate change adaptation and water management under high uncertainty graphical abstract ga1 keywords glacio hydrological simulation tropical andes shaman model scarce data model complexity multi model comparison 1 introduction hydrological models are a common tool used to understand the water cycle and to assess the possible impacts of water management policies hrachowitz and clark 2017 in the last decades there has been a trend to develop models of higher complexity perrin et al 2001 as our understanding of hydrological processes globally available gridded datasets and computing power have increased furthermore wide availability of free software and modeling packages in combination with powerful automatic calibration tools have facilitated the use of complex models even to non expert users however multi model comparisons have revealed that more complex models do not necessarily provide more consistent results than parsimonious models caldwell et al 2015 jiang et al 2007 perrin et al 2001 tegegne et al 2017 an inadequate model complexity could lead to model over parametrization perrin et al 2001 and in particular a higher complexity could involve a more difficult parameter estimation higher uncertainty and higher data requirement li et al 2015 most of multi model comparisons were carried out by using common measures of model performance such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency or the coefficient of determination nevertheless these indicators might be affected by the limitations of a proper assessment of the model performance krause et al 2005 models that perform similarly during the calibration process might provide distinct simulations under different conditions jiang et al 2007 e g driven by climate change often related to the model structure and calibration strategy caldwell et al 2015 a good model curve fitting may not capture the underpinning dominant hydrological processes cf hrachowitz and clark 2017 and could thus neglect high uncertainties a more appropriate calibration strategy should therefore consider different aspects of the fit between measured and simulated runoff vansteenkiste et al 2014 by using multiple variables model states and hydrological signatures to comprehensively understand the respective hydrographs hrachowitz and clark 2017 in the

models e g carenzo et al 2016 hock 2003 have limitations when estimating glacier melt sicart et al 2011 while more appropriate sophisticated energy balance models e g fyffe et al 2014 ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 with high data requirement juen et al 2007 are of limited usefulness when hampered by data scarcity and hence have only been applied so far in a few highly instrumented catchments

scarce regions are not common e g bai et al 2017 ragettli et al 2014 tegegne et al 2017 such a context of limited data availability regional experience and process understanding challenges the

2015 and ecuador e g pouget et al 2017 lumped models are the most commonly used ranging from simple linear equations e g mark and seltzer 2003 to more complex estimations that consider detailed hydroclimatic variables like glacier mass balance or sublimation e g soruco et al 2015 no lumped model seems to be preferred for simulations semi distributed models are also widely applied in the region mostly using the weap condom et al 2012 yates et al 2005 and rs minerve garcía hernández et al 2016 software weap allows simulation under different model structures while rs minerve simulates runoff by using several conceptual models of different complexity such as hbv bergström 1976 and gr4j perrin et al 2003 lumped models are particularly suitable in the data scarce tropical andes as they require a limited data input while semi distributed models additionally provide information about the water cycle such as detailed runoff components despite these efforts there is only a limited number and scope of hydrological modeling research available for glacierized tropical andean catchments due to limited access complex hydroclimatic processes social tensions and low institutional capacities drenkhan et al 2015 schoolmeester et al 2018 vuille et al 2018 to our knowledge there is no peer reviewed study available for the tropical andes implementing fully distributed models furthermore glacio hydrological multi model assessments with strong emphasis on comprehensive model result evaluation are missing limited knowledge of model performance in the region is a critical shortcome with serious implications for research inappropriate model selection could lead to the production of unusable model outputs or misleading interpretation of results and might thus be jeopardizing meaningful decision making support in this study we focus on the headwater area of the vilcanota urubamba basin vub in southern peru which remains highly understudied despite holding the second largest tropical glacier extent worldwide 142 km2 including one of the highest peaks in peru ausangate 6374 m a s l and the largest tropical ice cap quelccaya at 5300 m a s l drenkhan et al 2018 yarleque et al 2018 together with the zongo glacier in the nearby cordillera real bolivia quelccaya is among the most studied glaciers in the outer tropics with important insights for tropical glacier melt processes e g guido et al 2016 hastenrath 1978 réveillet et al 2015 sicart et al 2011 yarleque et al 2018 the upper vub is known for its high cultural importance for surrounding communities c f vuille et al 2018 providing water for 674 km2 of irrigated agricultural land about 830 000 people and more than 290 mw of installed hydropower capacity drenkhan et al 2019 this essential water supply for local livelihoods and regional economy is jeopardized by climate change recent research suggests that almost half of glacier areas might vanish in the vub under an rcp2 6 scenario or most parts disappear under an rcp8 5 scenario by the end of the 21st century drenkhan et al 2018 schauwecker et al 2017 accordingly this paper aims to identify if parsimonious or more complex glacio hydrological models can perform robust simulations in areas with a tropical climate and important glacier contribution and scarce data therefore we compare three glacio hydrological models of different complexity and assess them comprehensively by evaluating the commonly used measures of model performance associated flow signatures and runoff components 2 study site and regional setting the study is carried out in the sibinacocha and phinaya catchments both located in the headwater of the vub in the cusco region peru fig 1 the sibinacocha phinaya catchment ranges from 4900 to 5975 4709 to 6004 m a s l with a current glacier extent of 10 9 km2 19 6 km2 starting at about 5020 4948 m a s l inaigem 2018 a loss of about 36 30 in glacier area has been observed for the sibinacocha phinaya catchment between 1986 from our baseline see section 3 1 models and data source and 2016 from the glacier inventory from inaigem 2018 consistent with regional glacier studies e g schoolmeester et al 2018 vuille et al 2018 yarleque et al 2018 below about 5000 m a s l bare soils overburden materials and moraines act as an important temporary water store particularly during the dry season baraer et al 2015 glas et al 2018 these paraglacial landscapes are sparsely populated by dry puna grasslands whose hydrological role has barely been investigated ochoa tocachi et al 2016 an important feature in the proglacial valleys represent glacier fed high andean wetlands locally called bofedales which can provide a major contribution to base flow buytaert and beven 2011 the main sources of moisture in the region are the tropical atlantic and the amazon basin garreaud et al 2003 neukom et al 2015 total annual precipitation is about 540 mm of which about 60 occurs during austral summer december february as in other tropical regions surface temperature shows low annual variability ranging from 0 to 3 c at monthly scale at the sibinacocha reservoir outlet the vub is part of the outer tropics where glacier ablation occurs during the entire year and accumulation is limited to the wet season kaser 2001 such a typical behavior of tropical glaciers is related to the absence of thermal seasonality combined with the pronounced wet and dry seasons therefore temperature indices are poor indicators for glacier melt while in turn precipitation and humidity play a major role in melting processes kronenberg et al 2019 sicart et al 2008 these features of the peruvian outer tropics have been widely explored in previous studies mainly for the quelccaya ice cap at 5300 m a s l see buytaert et al 2017 hastenrath 1978 yarleque et al 2018 and at the ausangate peak at 6374 m a s l one of the highest peaks in southern peru see hanshaw and bookhagen 2014 phinaya 4910 m a s l is the only settlement in the study area and has about 340 inhabitants inei 2017 due to the harsh climatic conditions agriculture is not possible and the only economic activity is livestock breeding such as alpacas and sheep and tourism to some extent local springs are the only source of potable water for both households and livestock in 1996 the hydropower company egemsa dammed the existing natural lake of sibinacocha to regulate up to 110 million m3 of the natural water body extent with the purpose to provide water for energy production at the machu picchu hydropower plant about 230 km downstream of sibinacocha 3 data and methods 3 1 models and data source three conceptual models were implemented and compared see fig 2 in order of increasing complexity 1 the lumped simple hydrological model for the andes shaman model presented in this study in appendix a 2 the semi distributed hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv light model seibert and vis 2012 and 3 the semi distributed routing system minerve rs minerve garcía hernández et al 2016 a conceptual scheme of each model is shown in appendix a both rs minerve and hbv light have been selected because they are open access widely documented and increasingly be used for assessments in the peruvian andes e g by the peruvian water authority ana and the national meteorology and hydrology service of peru senamhi and beyond both models allow for including glacier and non glacier routines require few input data and have been implemented to study a large variety of topics including climate change impacts and water management e g astorayme et al 2015 lópez lópez et al 2018 lujano laura et al 2016 nauditt et al 2017 ochoa sánchez et al 2019 sucozhañay and célleri 2018 in addition the shaman model has been developed to model a full water balance accounting for among others a parsimonious glacier routine with focus on the modeling of tropical glacier melt a subsurface reservoir and sectorial water demand including back flows the model structure setup and calibration method were designed to fit with the main features of the tropical andean catchments like the strong precipitation seasonality year round but still seasonal glacier melt and data scarcity by using limited input data the simulations of all three models were implemented on a monthly time step from 1981 to 2010 for both semi distributed models hbv light and rs minerve the catchments were divided into 200 m elevation bands starting at 4800 m a s l the shaman model includes nine parameters with one module for glacier surfaces and one for non glacier surfaces glacier contribution to river streamflow four parameters is estimated as a function of the total glacier surface the accumulation area ratio aar and melting factors which in turn are estimated through a sinusoidal function to provide a seasonal variability non glacier contribution 5 parameters is based on témez 1977 equations and is composed of two buckets one for fast and one for slow runoff components as a result one single runoff series is estimated at the outlet of the catchment additional details in appendix a hbv light named hereafter as hbv includes 23 parameters and is based on the widely applied original hbv model bergström 1976 that is capable of representing diverse catchment conditions seibert and vis 2012 glacier contribution is constrained by nine parameters of which six are specific to the glacier routine other parameters in the glacier routine such as the temperature threshold tt that defines thresholds for melt and the separation of liquid solid precipitation are shared with the routine that simulates non glacier contributions in particular the sp factor allows a seasonal variability of the degree day factor cfmax as a result runoff is estimated at the outlet of the catchment rs minerve allows simulating total runoff based on an ensemble of different conceptual semi distributed models several models are available such as gr4j perrin et al 2003 sacramento burnash et al 1973 and hbv in this study we used the hbv model to represent the non glacier contribution composed of fast intermediate and slow runoff components 14 parameters while the glacier snow model gsm garcía hernández et al 2016 was used to simulate glacier contribution to river streamflow 16 parameters gsm computed melting from snow and ice using two different degree day factors and a sinusoidal function that allows accounting for seasonal variations cf garcía hernández et al 2016 this combined approach of sinusoidal interpolation function with a seasonal minimum austral winter and maximum value austral summer is particularly suitable for modeling melt from tropical glaciers as a result runoff is estimated for each elevation band and the outlet of the catchment this ensemble of the hbv and gsm models using the rs minerve software will be named hereafter as minerve the topography for both catchments sibinacocha and phinaya was computed using the global digital elevation model aster gdem v3 at 30 m grid size available at the earthdata nasa website https search earthdata nasa gov the catchment boundaries were then constructed applying the arc hydro tools removing artifacts manually monthly precipitation data were retrieved from the peruvian interpolated data of senamhi s climatological and hydrological observations pisco pisco v2 1 is a gridded dataset at 10 km spatial resolution that combines weather station reanalysis and satellite data from 1981 to 2016 aybar camacho et al 2017 monthly temperature data was taken from two local weather stations operated by senamhi sibinacocha 2016 2019 and quisoquipina 2013 2019 fig 1 missing data partially between 1981 and 2013 and 2016 was imputed with nearest neighbor linear interpolation from the pisco v1 1 temperature dataset a quantile based bias correction was applied to the pisco v1 1 since we observed higher temperature values than the local weather stations around 6 c potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated with the turc 1961 method which uses mean monthly temperature retrieved from pisco and a global radiation dataset the latter was taken from the surface meteorological and solar energy sse web portal stackhouse 2016 for lake evaporation a linear relationship between monthly air temperature and evaporation measurements or 1996 was calculated at sibinacocha station r2 0 73 this relationship was then used to estimate lake evaporation for the entire study period at both sibinacocha and ccasccana lakes fig 1 monthly streamflow measurements were obtained from the hydropower company egemsa for sibinacocha outflow 1981 1996 and from ana for the phinaya bridge gauge 1981 1996 although the data sources were the same each model required a particular input data arrangement the shaman model requires one single input data series that represents the whole catchment the precipitation series was estimated as a weighted area average while pet was computed by using the temperature at the average elevation from non glacier areas only hbv also required one single input data series the precipitation and pet series were the same as those used in the shaman model for temperature we used the data from the quisoquipina weather station additionally the model used gradients to estimate the input data for each elevation band in minerve the full pisco v2 1 precipitation dataset and both weather stations for temperature were included the pet values were obtained from the minerve dataset that also uses the turc 1961 method three glacier outlines were delineated from 1986 1994 and 2004 which represented as far as possible the mid year of the calibration validation and simulation periods see section 3 2 calibration strategy free multi spectral optical satellite images were used from landsat 5 1986 1994 and landsat 7 2004 missions downloaded from the usgs earth explorer since 2003 landsat 7 has scan line corrector failures however due to the small extension of the study area the small affected areas were easily delineated by applying multi temporal assessment images with cloud cover up to 10 were selected within the dry season june and july to avoid temporal snow cover leading to confusion of glacier discrimination glacier outlines were obtained through a semi automatic approach based on the normalized difference snow index ndsi hall and riggs 2011 ndsi thresholds were iteratively assessed ranging between 0 55 and 0 65 glacier fragments were filtered using a minimum surface threshold of 5000 m2 similar to the peruvian glacier inventory from ana 2014 and then manually edited to correct residual and confusion pixels such as water bodies or cast shadows finally the calibrated set of parameters of the sibinacocha catchment were transferred to simulate total runoff for the phinaya catchment this is a common practice in data scarce and ungauged catchments with shared conditions e g bárdossy 2007 moussa and chahinian 2009 3 2 calibration strategy three time periods were assessed calibration 1981 1990 validation 1988 1996 and simulation 1998 2009 model results from both calibration and validation were compared with measured streamflow while for the simulation period comparison was only among model results in each period the first two years were considered as model initialization warm up period and therefore not included in the assessment since most of the studies in the peruvian andes focus on water availability the calibration focused on a better representation of low flows than on high flows parameter calibration was implemented at the sibinacocha catchment where the longest runoff measurement is available we took into consideration the expected behavior of the different runoff components during the hydrological year september to august in the peruvian andes in the case of glacier contribution to total runoff the highest absolute values should occur around november january austral summer wet season when maximum solar radiation matches with low cloudiness and thus highest glacier mass turnover kronenberg et al 2016 concerning non glacier surfaces it was expected that the fast runoff component plays an important role during the wet season in the study region high andean wetlands are a common feature and work as important water storage and the intermediate flow could serve as an approximation since groundwater is characterized by slow flow rates it was expected that the slow runoff component remains constant during the hydrological year with higher absolute values during the wet season and an increasing relative share of overall contribution in the dry season baraer et al 2015 glas et al 2018 polk et al 2017 parameter calibration was implemented using an objective function of composed of three measures of model performance that capture average high and low flows each model has its own set of measures of model performance available for calibration in the shaman model the available measures of model performance for the of were the coefficient of determination r2 for average flow the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash for peak flows and the logarithmic nash sutcliffe efficiency nash ln for low flows in hbv the of consisted of the model efficiency reff for average flow the peak flow efficiency reffpeak for peak flows and the logarithmic efficiency logreff for low flows finally in minerve the of consisted of the kling gupta efficiency kg for average flow the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash for peak flows and the logarithmic nash sutcliffe efficiency nash ln for low flows to facilitate the comparison between models a common set of measures of model performance were calculated after the individual calibration process the spearman rank coefficient spearman nash nash ln kg r2 and the weighted r2 wr 2 with the b gradient of the linear correlation between observed and simulated runoff proposed by krause et al 2005 also eight commonly used flow signatures were calculated to characterize the different parts of the hydrograph see table 1 degree day values and melting factor rates from literature see condom et al 2011 hock 2003 kronenberg et al 2019 were used to help to constrain glacier parameters glacier mass balance from hbv and minerve was used to calculate glacier mass balance rates which were compared with existing estimations from 2000 to 2009 for the same region dussaillant et al 2019 we used automatic calibration by using the available tools from each model for that reason no single tool was possible to use to calibrate all models in the shaman model we used the generalized reduced gradient grg nonlinear method lasdon et al 1974 in hbv the genetic algorithm and powell optimization seibert 2000 and in minerve the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona method sce ua duan et al 1994 as seen for calibration instead of using a common set of measures of model performance and calibration tool we used the predefined options within each model this allowed reproducing the normal conditions of model implementation that is usually model simulations are executed with the predefined options within the models 4 results to facilitate model comparison the results were assessed in two stages first we focused on the sibinacocha catchment for which measured streamflow exist there we looked at the total runoff simulation and the measures of model performance section 4 1 total runoff comparison glacier runoff section 4 2 glacier runoff simulation and total runoff components section 4 3 components of total runoff in a second step we looked at the results from the parameter transfer from sibinacocha to the phinaya catchment section 4 4 parameter transfer to the ungauged catchment the calibrated set of parameters for each model is indicated in appendix a 4 1 total runoff comparison streamflow measurements at the sibinacocha catchment allowed us to compare both measures of model performance and flow signatures table 2 all models provided acceptable values for measures of model performance the spearman coefficient suggests a better fit between measured and simulated total runoff from more complex models in both calibration and validation the kling gupta coefficient kg ranks high for minerve in both calibration and validation although in calibration the highest value is for the parsimonious shaman model the weighted coefficient of determination wr 2 showed the highest value in calibration validation for results from hbv shaman overall nash ln values logarithmic nash sutcliffe efficiency were higher than nash values nash sutcliffe efficiency as a result of the calibration strategy where higher importance was given to low flows model performance was on average lower in validation than in calibration but shaman shows the strongest model performance reduction followed by hbv and minerve the more complex the model was the higher the model performances that were achieved while measures of model performance tended to favor high model complexity the flow signatures suggested the opposite in table 2 the bold numbers indicate which model provides the closest flow signature values compared to those calculated from measured runoff for the respective calibration and validation periods in that way both shaman and hbv models performed better than the more complex model minerve however minerve was the one whose performance does not largely differ between calibration and validation in terms of flow signature similarities followed by shaman and hbv models despite that the calculated flow signatures are similar across the different models at calibration and validation periods the shaman model showed higher sensitivity to changes in precipitation than the other models the highest streamflow elasticity se among the models indeed both shaman and hbv had similar flow signatures minerve showed on the other hand less sensibility to changes in precipitation and influence from fast flows indicated by both lower runoff ratio rr and slope compared to other models both the flow duration curve fdc and hydrographs from fig 3 show similarities between the models during calibration and validation nevertheless the small differences were amplified in the simulation period as expected the low flows were better estimated than the extreme peak flows due to the calibration strategy the box plots in the right column of fig 3 show the difference between the simulated qsim and measured total runoff qobs as a fraction of the total runoff that can be considered as error estimations ee minerve showed higher ee than hbv and shaman represented by the largest box plot the magnitude of the ee from minerve and shaman looks the same in both calibration and validation while ee from hbv reduces in validation the box plots show also a tendency to overestimate the total runoff except for the shaman model where over and underestimations look similar 4 2 glacier runoff simulation in the absence of measured glacier runoff data we used several assumptions to constrain the parameters of the glacier runoff simulation see section 3 2 calibration strategy such a strategy resulted in similar glacier runoff from every model in m3 s but a different proportion of glacier contribution to total runoff table 3 all models estimated glacier runoff at about 0 37 m3 s on average between 1983 and 2010 about 14 km2 of glacier surface on average for this period estimated annual glacier runoff represents on average about 26 of total runoff which is in line with regional studies e g buytaert et al 2017 both shaman and minerve indicated that the maximum glacier contribution m3 s occurs at the beginning of the summer season december while hbv estimated the maximum to occur at the end of the summer season february during the calibration period all models simulated the maximum relative glacier contribution in august the hydrograph from glacier runoff from the shaman model is smoother than the ones from hbv and minerve table 3 right panel that is because the simulations from shaman are not based on climate variables but on the glacier surface accumulation area ratio aar and melting factors both minerve and shaman showed a decrease of the glacier runoff from the calibration to the simulation period according to changes in the glacier surface hbv in its turn showed a decrease in glacier runoff from calibration to validation and then a slight increase in the simulation period table 3 right panel which might be related to the high streamflow elasticity se of the model table 2 we also calculated the glacier mass balance rate from hbv and minerve for each period table 3 low rates were calculated in the calibration period which then increased during the validation period and decreased again in the simulation period despite those changes results from the simulation period 2000 2010 are in line with the regional estimations of geodetic mass balance computed by dussaillant et al 2019 that ranges from 0 35 to 0 38 m w eq year for the headwater of the vub these results are also in line with mass balance estimations from the cordillera blanca 2006 2007 calculated as 0 32 0 4 m w eq year gurgiser et al 2013 4 3 components of total runoff each model estimated different runoff components depending on their structure in addition to glacier and lake runoff the shaman model simulated slow and fast runoff the hbv model simulated slow intermediate and fast runoff from non glacierized areas and overland flow from glacierized areas and minerve simulated slow intermediate and fast runoff fig 4 in automatic calibration every model had a predefined range of parameters to balance the contribution of every single runoff component however we observed that in most of the cases the automatic calibration tends to overestimate the slow or glacier flows to compensate for the strong precipitation seasonality even more such a result provided high model performance in the very first run of automatic calibration for non expert users this might indicate a good model performance despite the wrong representation of relevant hydrological processes in the study area fig 4 shows both results from the first automatic calibration top and after a careful and exhaustive readjustment of parameter ranges and several runs of automatic calibration bottom all models were able to represent the assumptions described in section 3 2 calibration strategy like higher fast flow contribution in the wet season and higher slow flow contribution in the dry season bottom row fig 4 the slow flow from shaman is equivalent in order of magnitude to the sum of intermediate and slow flows from hbv and minerve hbv indicated a higher contribution from intermediate flow in comparison with the slow flow in turn minerve provided an equivalent contribution between intermediate and slow flows in the absence of additional measurements it is difficult to indicate which one provides a more realistic simulation regarding the slow flow that approximates groundwater hbv simulated a more stable slow flow without peaks an expected characteristic of groundwater 4 4 parameter transfer to the ungauged catchment the set of parameters calibrated from the sibinacocha catchment were used to simulate the runoff at the phinaya catchment in the latter monthly streamflow measurements from december 1992 to december 1993 exist which were compared with simulated runoff fig 5 by looking at the hydrograph results from both hbv and shaman provided a better fit to the measured data while minerve overestimated the total runoff most of the time however the seasonality was well represented all models provided a high coefficient of determination r2 the highest was hbv 0 93 followed by minerve 0 83 and then shaman 0 82 the flow duration curve in fig 5 right panel was calculated from the full simulation at phinaya catchment from september 1983 to august 2010 both shaman and hbv provided closer simulations among them mainly for high and medium flows 45 of exceedance while minerve tended to estimate higher flows for the same percent of exceedance regarding low flows 65 of exceedance all models tended to provide similar results to each other 5 discussion results outlined above show that there is no significant difference of simulation outputs from parsimonious and more complex models this corroborates previous studies e g breuer et al 2009 perrin et al 2001 vansteenkiste et al 2014 which indicate that more complex models do not necessarily improve the performance of hydrological simulations contrariwise parsimonious glacio hydrological models can provide more robust results than more complex models in a context of data scarcity and limited process understanding such as in the glacierized tropical andean catchments if sufficient quantity and quality data is available more complex models might provide several advantages like estimations inside of the catchments or deeper processes understanding however several limitations need to be considered when evaluating the presented results in this study firstly the selected hydrological models depict a certain range rather than a full spectrum of model complexity secondly no fully distributed model was assessed due to the inherent limitations of data input and process complexity this might also be the main reason why no fully distributed models have been implemented yet in the region thirdly the use of different of and calibration tools influence the simulations and model results although some calibration tools might be more powerful than others all model results were compared with the same measures of model performance lastly another important insight is linked to the assessment of final model outputs at the catchment outlet only in the following sections we elaborate and discuss in more detail the aforementioned critical points and present a modeling framework to improve the robustness of glacio hydrological simulation in glacierized data scarce tropical andean catchments 5 1 parsimonious vs complex glacio hydrological models results suggest that three models of different complex perform similar runoff simulations the median error estimations from all models are also comparable among them 15 see fig 3 although they represent only the behavior of total runoff small differences between model results might be related to the model structure the inherent conceptual differences and how the input data is used see section 3 1 models and data sources as a result the parsimonious shaman model can perform as well as the more complex hbv or minerve models while providing a clear advantage of reduced computer power and data requirement this becomes more relevant with automatic calibration without an expert supervision and quality checking because the runoff components can be wrongly compensated to achieve good model performance see top row in fig 4 this is known as the achieving good model performance for the wrong reasons error and has been observed in several model applications e g finger et al 2015 kirchner 2006 konz and seibert 2010 automatic calibration results are highly sensitive on the selection of the measures of model performance the specified search scheme and numerical measures of the goodness of fit madsen 2000 therefore even when automatic calibration tools are powerful and easy to use they need to be carefully supervised to make full benefit of the advantages such as exploring an exhaustive set of parameter options in a short time series fig 4 shows that unsupervised automatic calibration from shaman and hbv provided a distribution of runoff components than the automatic calibration from minerve nonetheless the shuffled complex evolution method sce ua which is available for minerve is well known as an efficient and robust tool for automatic calibration of hydrological models muttil and jayawardena 2008 seong et al 2015 wang et al 2010 under the specific conditions of this study the exhaustive calibration strategy of minerve that requires further adjustment of the runoff components represents a disadvantage compared to the more parsimonious shaman and hbv models our assessment under complex and data scarce basin conditions highlights the fact that measures based on model performance only do not provide sufficient information about the drivers behind the predominant hydrological processes a comprehensive assessment is needed to identify or reject model results that do not meet minimum requirements vaché and mcdonnell 2006 such a comprehensive assessment is directly linked to the calibration strategy in this study the calibration strategy used different assumptions based on the fast and slow flows to constrain the runoff components but also to reject unrealistic model results see section 3 2 calibration strategy vansteenkiste et al 2014 applied a similar approach for the calibration procedure where runoff responses derived from rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were used to constrain the runoff components nevertheless this approach implies some degree of subjectivity and is therefore highly dependent on the modeler s expertise more complex models provide several advantages such as a larger sets of calibration options perrin et al 2001 spatial scenarios specific simulation and analysis options within the catchment pokhrel and gupta 2011 and provide new insights about the hydrological processes see table 4 nevertheless in the absence of sufficient measurements and process understanding all model results remain as unverified hypotheses hrachowitz and clark 2017 to produce robust simulations and benefit of its advantages more complex models require sufficient data availability of both quality and quantity and a deep understanding of the underlying model structure and the predominant hydrological processes in the catchment table 4 summarizes the potential benefits and trade offs of the implementation of parsimonious and more complex models under data scarcity on the one side parsimonious models require limited input data and knowledge about the hydrological processes with robust model outputs but of limited insight and mostly with single research goals on the other side more complex models require additional data and expertise to use their full potential and advantages such as providing new insights of hydrological processes these trade offs highlight the importance of a careful model selection depending on the research goal and how well the dominant hydrological processes are understood therefore a more appropriate approach in data scarce environments is to collect additional data improve the calibration strategy and implement a comprehensive model assessment of parsimonious models rather than increasing model complexity c f finger et al 2015 tarasova et al 2016 5 2 glacier runoff simulation in this study glacier runoff was constrained by three factors the change of glacier area over time the glacier mass balance rate and relative glacier contribution to total runoff accounting for changes in glacier area over time due to glacier melt is not a regular practice instead the glacier area remains the same in hydrological simulations over large periods with the risk to overestimate glacier runoff tiel et al 2020 here the glacier surface was delineated from satellite images using a common semi automatic approach deploying the ndsi and manual editing with an estimated error at around 5 under normal conditions paul and kääb 2005 other studies applied different approaches that take into account vertical changes in the glacier mass but require additional data such as glacier volume or snow water equivalent e g bahr et al 2015 huss et al 2010 our computed relative annual and seasonal glacier contribution to streamflow are in line with existing studies e g buytaert et al 2017 nevertheless without field measurements that help to constrain glacier model routines see konz and seibert 2010 results are highly dependent on user expertise and parameter selection therefore we additionally used a glacier mass balance rate corresponding to available measurements which have proven to be suitable when assessing appropriate melting rates see section 3 2 calibration strategy in tropical high mountain conditions our results suggest that a differentiated routine and parameters for glacier and non glacier areas like in shaman and minerve models are more helpful than an integrated approach like hbv when simulating glacier runoff the differentiated coefficients provide flexibility when trying to simulate the expected absolute and relative glacier contribution to total runoff in any case common degree day models are not appropriate for simulating the melting of tropical glaciers at sub annual time steps air temperature is a poor index of melt due to relative constant temperature throughout the year and low air heat content in high altitudes sicart et al 2008 therefore adapted approaches such as a sinusoidal interpolation function used in shaman and minerve models with a seasonal minimum austral winter and maximum melt factor austral summer seem to be more promising garcía hernández et al 2016 kronenberg et al 2019 sicart et al 2008 5 3 a framework for robust glacio hydrological simulation in data scarce areas based on the insights of our inter model comparison for the peruvian andes a framework has been developed that includes three main levels and four pillars to support robust glacio hydrological simulation under data scarcity fig 6 in the first level the research goal of simulations is defined and the dominant hydrological processes are identified in this study the focus was rather on low flows than on peak flows while the seasonality of glacier runoff and the high contribution of slow flows were identified as key hydrological processes the second level covers the data collection process including e g gridded datasets of precipitation and evapotranspiration often not available as in situ data while temperature can normally be obtained from weather stations such a data needs to be comprehensively assessed in both quality and quantity depending on the time step and study period the third level comprises the entire modeling process divided into four pillars the first pillar 3 a focuses on the database construction by extending temporally and spatially when possible the climate data series the collection of glacier mass balance data or rates and the delimitation of multit emporal glacier outlines in this study for instance we extended the in situ temperature series in time with gridded data compared our glacier mass balance data with regional estimates and delineated glacier outlines for calibration validation and simulation periods the second pillar 3 b focuses on the calibration strategy by establishing assumptions about the expected runoff components and the glacier runoff contribution to total runoff see section 3 2 calibration strategy then the third pillar 3 c focuses on the model implementation through the multi model association e g differentiated routines and parameters for glacier and non glacier regions and the multi model ensemble e g running different models of different complexities the latter which has been successfully implemented in climate models finally the last pillar 3 d focuses on the model evaluation by using both common model performance indicators and additionally evaluating e g flow signatures and different runoff components short and limited data series do not allow the models to capture all relevant flow signatures and models can only partially reproduce them therefore the use of different models and complexities in a multi model ensemble can provide more robust results than a single model if available additional data can be included in the calibration strategy 3 b or in the model evaluation 3 d as part of a multi response or multi data calibration e g he et al 2018 konz and seibert 2010 pellicciotti et al 2012 tarasova et al 2016 uhlenbrook and leibundgut 2002 the individual steps within the framework can be considered as universally applicable to improve the quality of hydrological simulations and considered best practices in applications beyond this particular study region and purpose therefore the framework is also valid in data rich and non tropical glacier regions nonetheless a systematic integration and implementation of each step within the framework considerably improves the quality and meaningfulness of simulations in data scarce regions 5 4 implications for technical institutions and decision makers the development of efficient strategies for data collection and hydrological modeling approaches that increases process understanding is of paramount importance to bridge limited in situ data and the lack of regional studies modelers can benefit from a knowledge production process by implementing parsimonious models at a first stage and then increase model complexity as new data and knowledge is gathered therefore the presented framework fig 6 can facilitate the exploration of new models within a multi model strategy that could fit better research goals and context nevertheless data scarcity limited research capacities and process understanding remain a major bottleneck that both academia and local governments need to tackle future research should focus on overcoming these limitations that require among others additional funding time allocation for research capacity building and the development and use of meaningful applications in the last years citizen science based initiatives have increasingly been adopted in the tropical andes and beyond as they contribute to the flexible collection of extensive datasets often combined with low cost sensor technology buytaert et al 2014 njue et al 2019 as participatory approaches they can potentially empower e g local communities by engaging them with data monitoring management and further decision making ideally this collaborative process integrates different types of co produced knowledge within a shared baseline since the early research planning muccione et al 2019 which could then be used for hydrological modeling and further water management planning njue et al 2019 additionally decision making under deep uncertainty marchau et al 2019 and exploratory scenario modeling kwakkel 2017 approaches have an enormous potential to support policy making for climate change and water management such approaches deal with high uncertainties from different sources including both natural and human factors in the near future glacio hydrological modeling in the tropical andes will most likely continue to deal with high uncertainty and limited process understanding due to the striking gap in data monitoring and modeling approaches model results should thus be taken as first order indicators with limited significance and precision that need to be constantly revised and updated when new data are available future studies should also continue with systematic data collection in the region exploring improvements in understanding hydrological processes as well as the adaptation or design of particular model structures that represent the relevant catchment behavior in the glacierized tropical andes the use of remote sensing data seems promising to fill data gaps but modelers should be aware of the limitations and combine the advantages of comprehensive remote sensing assessments with ground truth validation sidle 2021 taylor et al 2021 6 conclusion this paper aims to identify if parsimonious or more complex glacio hydrological models can perform robust simulations in tropical glaciated mountain environments with scarce data accordingly three models of different complexity were compared and comprehensively assessed for the 2000 2010 period total runoff was estimated as 2 5 3 3 m3 s with an annual maximum glacier contribution of 18 29 29 49 absolute relative maximum glacier contribution to runoff was calculated for december august as 0 41 0 49 m3 s 30 58 all model complexities allow for acceptable modeling performance r2 0 65 0 70 nash sutcliffe 0 65 0 73 nash sutcliffe ln 0 73 0 78 with small differences related to the model structure this confirms findings from previous studies more complex models do not necessarily improve hydrological simulation more complex models require a more comprehensive calibration strategy and assessment to avoid simulations with apparently high model performance driven by inadequate assumptions besides complex models require a better understanding of the hydrological processes that are often hampered by data scarcity limited knowledge and field accessibility such as in the glacierized tropical andes therefore our study suggests that parsimonious glacio hydrological models can provide more robust results than complex models in data scarce catchments our results imply several limitations that need to be carefully considered 1 the selected models do not cover the full spectrum of model complexity 2 different of and calibration tools have been used that influence the simulation and quality of the model results and 3 the assessment of model outputs was performed at the catchment outlet only which does not allow for further modeling insights within the catchment results suggest that the use of parsimonious models combined with a careful calibration strategy and additional data collection can provide more robust simulations rather than opt for increasing model complexity additional data includes among others extended climate data series glacier mass balance data multitemporal glacier outlines and single runoff measurements based on these insights a framework has been developed that aims for robust glacio hydrological simulation under data scarcity this approach includes a multi model focus with a comprehensive assessment of flow signatures and runoff components and is relevant for the tropical andes region and other regions with similar characteristics while such a combined model framework will most likely contribute to more robust hydrological simulations the remaining challenges of high uncertainty limited knowledge and capacities hamper a further improvement of model results academia and local governments should therefore continue to extend data collection improve understanding of hydrological processes and the adaptation or design of model structures for specific applications in glacierized tropical andean catchments funding this work is part of a phd project

8174,study region glaciated headwaters of the vilcanota urubamba river basin southern peru study focus a pivotal question is if robust hydrological simulation of streamflow in data scarce and glaciated catchments can be achieved using parsimonious or more complex models therefore a multi model assessment of three glacio hydrological models of different complexity was conducted thoroughly analyzing model performance flow signatures and runoff components new hydrological insights for the region in data scarce catchments such as in the tropical andes parsimonious glacio hydrological

scarcity this stepwise approach includes among others a multi model focus with a comprehensive assessment of flow signatures and runoff components future modeling needs to be further supported by

simulation tropical andes shaman model scarce data model complexity multi model comparison 1 introduction hydrological models are a common tool used to understand the water cycle and to assess the possible impacts of water management policies hrachowitz and clark 2017 in the last decades there has been a trend to develop models of higher complexity perrin et al 2001 as our understanding of hydrological processes globally available gridded datasets and computing power have increased furthermore wide availability of free software and modeling packages in combination with powerful automatic calibration tools have facilitated the use of complex models even to non expert users however multi model comparisons have revealed that more complex models do not necessarily provide more consistent results than parsimonious models caldwell et al 2015 jiang et al 2007 perrin et al 2001 tegegne et al 2017 an inadequate model complexity could lead to model over parametrization perrin et al 2001 and in particular a higher complexity could involve a more difficult parameter estimation higher uncertainty and higher data requirement li et al 2015 most of multi model comparisons were carried out by using common measures of model performance such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency or the coefficient of determination nevertheless these indicators might be affected by the limitations of a proper assessment of the model performance krause et al 2005 models that perform similarly during the calibration process might provide distinct simulations under different conditions jiang et al 2007 e g driven by climate change often related to the model structure and calibration strategy caldwell et al 2015 a good model curve fitting may not capture the underpinning dominant hydrological processes cf hrachowitz and clark 2017 and could thus neglect high uncertainties a more appropriate calibration strategy should therefore consider different aspects of the fit between measured and simulated runoff vansteenkiste et al 2014 by using multiple variables model states and hydrological signatures to comprehensively understand the respective hydrographs hrachowitz and clark 2017 in the

runoff by using several conceptual models of different complexity such as hbv bergström 1976 and gr4j perrin et al 2003 lumped models are particularly suitable in the data scarce tropical andes as they require a limited data input while semi distributed models additionally provide information about the water cycle such as detailed runoff components despite these efforts there is only a limited number and scope of hydrological modeling research available for glacierized tropical andean catchments due to limited access complex hydroclimatic processes social tensions and low institutional capacities drenkhan et al 2015 schoolmeester et al 2018 vuille et al 2018 to our knowledge there is no peer reviewed study available for the tropical andes implementing fully distributed models furthermore glacio hydrological multi model assessments with strong emphasis on comprehensive model result evaluation are missing limited knowledge of model performance in the region is a critical shortcome with serious implications for research inappropriate model selection could lead to the production of unusable model outputs or misleading interpretation of results and might thus be jeopardizing meaningful decision making support in this study we focus on the headwater area of the vilcanota urubamba basin vub in southern peru which remains highly understudied despite holding the second largest tropical glacier extent worldwide 142 km2 including one of the highest peaks in peru ausangate 6374 m a s l and the largest tropical ice cap quelccaya at 5300 m a s l drenkhan et al 2018 yarleque et al 2018 together with the zongo glacier in the nearby cordillera real bolivia quelccaya is among the most studied glaciers in the outer tropics with important insights for tropical glacier melt processes e g guido et al 2016 hastenrath 1978 réveillet et al 2015 sicart et al 2011 yarleque et al 2018 the upper vub is known for its high cultural importance for surrounding communities c f vuille et al 2018 providing water for 674 km2 of irrigated agricultural land about 830 000 people and more than 290 mw of installed hydropower capacity drenkhan et al 2019 this essential water supply for local livelihoods and regional economy is jeopardized by climate change recent research suggests that almost half of glacier areas might vanish in the vub under an rcp2 6 scenario or most parts disappear under an rcp8 5 scenario by the end of the 21st century drenkhan et al 2018 schauwecker et al 2017 accordingly this paper aims to identify if parsimonious or more complex glacio hydrological models can perform robust simulations in areas with a tropical climate and important glacier contribution and scarce data therefore we compare three glacio hydrological models of different complexity and assess them comprehensively by evaluating the commonly used measures of model performance associated flow signatures and runoff components 2 study site and regional setting the study is carried out in the sibinacocha and phinaya catchments both located in the headwater of the vub in the cusco region peru fig 1 the sibinacocha phinaya catchment ranges from 4900 to 5975 4709 to 6004 m a s l with a current glacier extent of 10 9 km2 19 6 km2 starting at about 5020 4948 m a s l inaigem 2018 a loss of about 36 30 in glacier area has been observed for the sibinacocha phinaya catchment between 1986 from our baseline see section 3 1 models and data source and 2016 from the glacier inventory from inaigem 2018 consistent with regional glacier studies e g schoolmeester et al 2018 vuille et al 2018 yarleque et al 2018 below about 5000 m a s l bare soils overburden materials and moraines act as an important temporary water store particularly during the dry season baraer et al 2015 glas et al 2018 these paraglacial landscapes are sparsely populated by dry puna grasslands whose hydrological role has barely been investigated ochoa tocachi et al 2016 an important feature in the proglacial valleys represent glacier fed high andean wetlands locally called bofedales which can provide a major contribution to base flow buytaert and beven 2011 the main sources of moisture in the region are the tropical atlantic and the amazon basin garreaud et al 2003 neukom et al 2015 total annual precipitation is about 540 mm of which about 60 occurs during austral summer december february as in other tropical regions surface temperature shows low annual variability ranging from 0 to 3 c at monthly scale at the sibinacocha reservoir outlet the vub is part of the outer tropics where glacier ablation occurs during the entire year and accumulation is limited to the wet season kaser 2001 such a typical behavior of tropical glaciers is related to the absence of thermal seasonality combined with the pronounced wet and dry seasons therefore temperature indices are poor indicators for glacier melt while in turn precipitation and humidity play a major role in melting processes kronenberg et al 2019 sicart et al 2008 these features of the peruvian outer tropics have been widely explored in previous studies mainly for the quelccaya ice cap at 5300 m a s l see buytaert et al 2017 hastenrath 1978 yarleque et al 2018 and at the ausangate peak at 6374 m a s l one of the highest peaks in southern peru see hanshaw and bookhagen 2014 phinaya 4910 m a s l is the only settlement in the study area and has about 340 inhabitants inei 2017 due to the harsh climatic conditions agriculture is not possible and the only economic activity is livestock breeding such as alpacas and sheep and tourism to some extent local springs are the only source of potable water for both households and livestock in 1996 the hydropower company egemsa dammed the existing natural lake of sibinacocha to regulate up to 110 million m3 of the natural water body extent with the purpose to provide water for energy production at the machu picchu hydropower plant about 230 km downstream of sibinacocha 3 data and methods 3 1 models and data source three conceptual models were implemented and compared see fig 2 in order of increasing complexity 1 the lumped simple hydrological model for the andes shaman model presented in this study in appendix a 2 the semi distributed hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv light model seibert and vis 2012 and 3 the semi distributed routing system minerve rs minerve garcía hernández et al 2016 a conceptual scheme of each model is shown in appendix a both rs minerve and hbv light have been selected because they are open access widely documented and increasingly be used for assessments in the peruvian andes e g by the peruvian water authority ana and the national meteorology and hydrology service of peru senamhi and beyond both models allow for including glacier and non glacier routines require few input data and have been implemented to study a large variety of topics including climate change impacts and water management e g astorayme et al 2015 lópez lópez et al 2018 lujano laura et al 2016 nauditt et al 2017 ochoa sánchez et al 2019 sucozhañay and célleri 2018 in addition the shaman model has been developed to model a full water balance accounting for among others a parsimonious glacier routine with focus on the modeling of tropical glacier melt a subsurface reservoir and sectorial water demand including back flows the model structure setup and calibration method were designed to fit with the main features of the tropical andean catchments like the strong precipitation seasonality year round but still seasonal glacier melt and data scarcity by using limited input data the simulations of all three models were implemented on a monthly time step from 1981 to 2010 for both semi distributed models hbv light and rs minerve the catchments were divided into 200 m elevation bands starting at 4800 m a s l the shaman model includes nine parameters with one module for glacier surfaces and one for non glacier surfaces glacier contribution to river streamflow four parameters is estimated as a function of the total glacier surface the accumulation area ratio aar and melting factors which in turn are estimated through a sinusoidal function to provide a seasonal variability non glacier contribution 5 parameters is based on témez 1977 equations and is composed of two buckets one for fast and one for slow runoff components as a result one single runoff series is estimated at the outlet of the catchment additional details in appendix a hbv light named hereafter as hbv includes 23 parameters and is based on the widely applied original hbv model bergström 1976 that is capable of representing diverse catchment conditions seibert and vis 2012 glacier contribution is constrained by nine parameters of which six are specific to the glacier routine other parameters in the glacier routine such as the temperature threshold tt that defines thresholds for melt and the separation of liquid solid precipitation are shared with the routine that simulates non glacier contributions in particular the sp factor allows a seasonal variability of the degree day factor cfmax as a result runoff is estimated at the outlet of the catchment rs minerve allows simulating total runoff based on an ensemble of different conceptual semi distributed models several models are available such as gr4j perrin et al 2003 sacramento burnash et al 1973 and hbv in this study we used the hbv model to represent the non glacier contribution composed of fast intermediate and slow runoff components 14 parameters while the glacier snow model gsm garcía hernández et al 2016 was used to simulate glacier contribution to river streamflow 16 parameters gsm computed melting from snow and ice using two different degree day factors and a sinusoidal function that allows accounting for seasonal variations cf garcía hernández et al 2016 this combined approach of sinusoidal interpolation function with a seasonal minimum austral winter and maximum value austral summer is particularly suitable for modeling melt from tropical glaciers as a result runoff is estimated for each elevation band and the outlet of the catchment this ensemble of the hbv and gsm models using the rs minerve software will be named hereafter as minerve the topography for both catchments sibinacocha and phinaya was computed using the global digital elevation model aster gdem v3 at 30 m grid size available at the earthdata nasa website https search earthdata nasa gov the catchment boundaries were then constructed applying the arc hydro tools removing artifacts manually monthly precipitation data were retrieved from the peruvian interpolated data of senamhi s climatological and hydrological observations pisco pisco v2 1 is a gridded dataset at 10 km spatial resolution that combines weather station reanalysis and satellite data from 1981 to 2016 aybar camacho et al 2017 monthly temperature data was taken from two local weather stations operated by senamhi sibinacocha 2016 2019 and quisoquipina 2013 2019 fig 1 missing data partially between 1981 and 2013 and 2016 was imputed with nearest neighbor linear interpolation from the pisco v1 1 temperature dataset a quantile based bias correction was applied to the pisco v1 1 since we observed higher temperature values than the local weather stations around 6 c potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated with the turc 1961 method which uses mean monthly temperature retrieved from pisco and a global radiation dataset the latter was taken from the surface meteorological and solar energy sse web portal stackhouse 2016 for lake evaporation a linear relationship between monthly air temperature and evaporation measurements or 1996 was calculated at sibinacocha station r2 0 73 this relationship was then used to estimate lake evaporation for the entire study period at both sibinacocha and ccasccana lakes fig 1 monthly streamflow measurements were obtained from the hydropower company egemsa for sibinacocha outflow 1981 1996 and from ana for the phinaya bridge gauge 1981 1996 although the data sources were the same each model required a particular input data arrangement the shaman model requires one single input data series that represents the whole catchment the precipitation series was estimated as a weighted area average while pet was computed by using the temperature at the average elevation from non glacier areas only hbv also required one single input data series the precipitation and pet series were the same as those used in the shaman model for temperature we used the data from the quisoquipina weather station additionally the model used gradients to estimate the input data for each elevation band in minerve the full pisco v2 1 precipitation dataset and both weather stations for temperature were included the pet values were obtained from the minerve dataset that also uses the turc 1961 method three glacier outlines were delineated from 1986 1994 and 2004 which represented as far as possible the mid year of the calibration validation and simulation periods see section 3 2 calibration strategy free multi spectral optical satellite images were used from landsat 5 1986 1994 and landsat 7 2004 missions downloaded from the usgs earth explorer since 2003 landsat 7 has scan line corrector failures however due to the small extension of the study area the small affected areas were easily delineated by applying multi temporal assessment images with cloud cover up to 10 were selected within the dry season june and july to avoid temporal snow cover leading to confusion of glacier discrimination glacier outlines were obtained through a semi automatic approach based on the normalized difference snow index ndsi hall and riggs 2011 ndsi thresholds were iteratively assessed ranging between 0 55 and 0 65 glacier fragments were filtered using a minimum surface threshold of 5000 m2 similar to the peruvian glacier inventory from ana 2014 and then manually edited to correct residual and confusion pixels such as water bodies or cast shadows finally the calibrated set of parameters of the sibinacocha catchment were transferred to simulate total runoff for the phinaya catchment this is a common practice in data scarce and ungauged catchments with shared conditions e g bárdossy 2007 moussa and chahinian 2009 3 2 calibration strategy three time periods were assessed calibration 1981 1990 validation 1988 1996 and simulation 1998 2009 model results from both calibration and validation were compared with measured streamflow while for the simulation period comparison was only among model results in each period the first two years were considered as model initialization warm up period and therefore not included in the assessment since most of the studies in the peruvian andes focus on water availability the calibration focused on a better representation of low flows than on high flows parameter calibration was implemented at the sibinacocha catchment where the longest runoff measurement is available we took into consideration the expected behavior of the different runoff components during the hydrological year september to august in the peruvian andes in the case of glacier contribution to total runoff the highest absolute values should occur around november january austral summer wet season when maximum solar radiation matches with low cloudiness and thus highest glacier mass turnover kronenberg et al 2016 concerning non glacier surfaces it was expected that the fast runoff component plays an important role during the wet season in the study region high andean wetlands are a common feature and work as important water storage and the intermediate flow could serve as an approximation since groundwater is characterized by slow flow rates it was expected that the slow runoff component remains constant during the hydrological year with higher absolute values during the wet season and an increasing relative share of overall contribution in the dry season baraer et al 2015 glas et al 2018 polk et al 2017 parameter calibration was implemented using an objective function of composed of three measures of model performance that capture average high and low flows each model has its own set of measures of model performance available for calibration in the shaman model the available measures of model performance for the of were the coefficient of determination r2 for average flow the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash for peak flows and the logarithmic nash sutcliffe efficiency nash ln for low flows in hbv the of consisted of the model efficiency reff for average flow the peak flow efficiency reffpeak for peak flows and the logarithmic efficiency logreff for low flows finally in minerve the of consisted of the kling gupta efficiency kg for average flow the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash for peak flows and the logarithmic nash sutcliffe efficiency nash ln for low flows to facilitate the comparison between models a common set of measures of model performance were calculated after the individual calibration process the spearman rank coefficient spearman nash nash ln kg r2 and the weighted r2 wr 2 with the b gradient of the linear correlation between observed and simulated runoff proposed by krause et al 2005 also eight commonly used flow signatures were calculated to characterize the different parts of the hydrograph see table 1 degree day values and melting factor rates from literature see condom et al 2011 hock 2003 kronenberg et al 2019 were used to help to constrain glacier parameters glacier mass balance from hbv and minerve was used to calculate glacier mass balance rates which were compared with existing estimations from 2000 to 2009 for the same region dussaillant et al 2019 we used automatic calibration by using the available tools from each model for that reason no single tool was possible to use to calibrate all models in the shaman model we used the generalized reduced gradient grg nonlinear method lasdon et al 1974 in hbv the genetic algorithm and powell optimization seibert 2000 and in minerve the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona method sce ua duan et al 1994 as seen for calibration instead of using a common set of measures of model performance and calibration tool we used the predefined options within each model this allowed reproducing the normal conditions of model implementation that is usually model simulations are executed with the predefined options within the models 4 results to facilitate model comparison the results were assessed in two stages first we focused on the sibinacocha catchment for which measured streamflow exist there we looked at the total runoff simulation and the measures of model performance section 4 1 total runoff comparison glacier runoff section 4 2 glacier runoff simulation and total runoff components section 4 3 components of total runoff in a second step we looked at the results from the parameter transfer from sibinacocha to the phinaya catchment section 4 4 parameter transfer to the ungauged catchment the calibrated set of parameters for each model is indicated in appendix a 4 1 total runoff comparison streamflow measurements at the sibinacocha catchment allowed us to compare both measures of model performance and flow signatures table 2 all models provided acceptable values for measures of model performance the spearman coefficient suggests a better fit between measured and simulated total runoff from more complex models in both calibration and validation the kling gupta coefficient kg ranks high for minerve in both calibration and validation although in calibration the highest value is for the parsimonious shaman model the weighted coefficient of determination wr 2 showed the highest value in calibration validation for results from hbv shaman overall nash ln values logarithmic nash sutcliffe efficiency were higher than nash values nash sutcliffe efficiency as a result of the calibration strategy where higher importance was given to low flows model performance was on average lower in validation than in calibration but shaman shows the strongest model performance reduction followed by hbv and minerve the more complex the model was the higher the model performances that were achieved while measures of model performance tended to favor high model complexity the flow signatures suggested the opposite in table 2 the bold numbers indicate which model provides the closest flow signature values compared to those calculated from measured runoff for the respective calibration and validation periods in that way both shaman and hbv models performed better than the more complex model minerve however minerve was the one whose performance does not largely differ between calibration and validation in terms of flow signature similarities followed by shaman and hbv models despite that the calculated flow signatures are similar across the different models at calibration and validation periods the shaman model showed higher sensitivity to changes in precipitation than the other models the highest streamflow elasticity se among the models indeed both shaman and hbv had similar flow signatures minerve showed on the other hand less sensibility to changes in precipitation and influence from fast flows indicated by both lower runoff ratio rr and slope compared to other models both the flow duration curve fdc and hydrographs from fig 3 show similarities between the models during calibration and validation nevertheless the small differences were amplified in the simulation period as expected the low flows were better estimated than the extreme peak flows due to the calibration strategy the box plots in the right column of fig 3 show the difference between the simulated qsim and measured total runoff qobs as a fraction of the total runoff that can be considered as error estimations ee minerve showed higher ee than hbv and shaman represented by the largest box plot the magnitude of the ee from minerve and shaman looks the same in both calibration and validation while ee from hbv reduces in validation the box plots show also a tendency to overestimate the total runoff except for the shaman model where over and underestimations look similar 4 2 glacier runoff simulation in the absence of measured glacier runoff data we used several assumptions to constrain the parameters of the glacier runoff simulation see section 3 2 calibration strategy such a strategy resulted in similar glacier runoff from every model in m3 s but a different proportion of glacier contribution to total runoff table 3 all models estimated glacier runoff at about 0 37 m3 s on average between 1983 and 2010 about 14 km2 of glacier surface on average for this period estimated annual glacier runoff represents on average about 26 of total runoff which is in line with regional studies e g buytaert et al 2017 both shaman and minerve indicated that the maximum glacier contribution m3 s occurs at the beginning of the summer season december while hbv estimated the maximum to occur at the end of the summer season february during the calibration period all models simulated the maximum relative glacier contribution in august the hydrograph from glacier runoff from the shaman model is smoother than the ones from hbv and minerve table 3 right panel that is because the simulations from shaman are not based on climate variables but on the glacier surface accumulation area ratio aar and melting factors both minerve and shaman showed a decrease of the glacier runoff from the calibration to the simulation period according to changes in the glacier surface hbv in its turn showed a decrease in glacier runoff from calibration to validation and then a slight increase in the simulation period table 3 right panel which might be related to the high streamflow elasticity se of the model table 2 we also calculated the glacier mass balance rate from hbv and minerve for each period table 3 low rates were calculated in the calibration period which then increased during the validation period and decreased again in the simulation period despite those changes results from the simulation period 2000 2010 are in line with the regional estimations of geodetic mass balance computed by dussaillant et al 2019 that ranges from 0 35 to 0 38 m w eq year for the headwater of the vub these results are also in line with mass balance estimations from the cordillera blanca 2006 2007 calculated as 0 32 0 4 m w eq year gurgiser et al 2013 4 3 components of total runoff each model estimated different runoff components depending on their structure in addition to glacier and lake runoff the shaman model simulated slow and fast runoff the hbv model simulated slow intermediate and fast runoff from non glacierized areas and overland flow from glacierized areas and minerve simulated slow intermediate and fast runoff fig 4 in automatic calibration every model had a predefined range of parameters to balance the contribution of every single runoff component however we observed that in most of the cases the automatic calibration tends to overestimate the slow or glacier flows to compensate for the strong precipitation seasonality even more such a result provided high model performance in the very first run of automatic calibration for non expert users this might indicate a good model performance despite the wrong representation of relevant hydrological processes in the study area fig 4 shows both results from the first automatic calibration top and after a careful and exhaustive readjustment of parameter ranges and several runs of automatic calibration bottom all models were able to represent the assumptions described in section 3 2 calibration strategy like higher fast flow contribution in the wet season and higher slow flow contribution in the dry season bottom row fig 4 the slow flow from shaman is equivalent in order of magnitude to the sum of intermediate and slow flows from hbv and minerve hbv indicated a higher contribution from intermediate flow in comparison with the slow flow in turn minerve provided an equivalent contribution between intermediate and slow flows in the absence of additional measurements it is difficult to indicate which one provides a more realistic simulation regarding the slow flow that approximates groundwater hbv simulated a more stable slow flow without peaks an expected characteristic of groundwater 4 4 parameter transfer to the ungauged catchment the set of parameters calibrated from the sibinacocha catchment were used to simulate the runoff at the phinaya catchment in the latter monthly streamflow measurements from december 1992 to december 1993 exist which were compared with simulated runoff fig 5 by looking at the hydrograph results from both hbv and shaman provided a better fit to the measured data while minerve overestimated the total runoff most of the time however the seasonality was well represented all models provided a high coefficient of determination r2 the highest was hbv 0 93 followed by minerve 0 83 and then shaman 0 82 the flow duration curve in fig 5 right panel was calculated from the full simulation at phinaya catchment from september 1983 to august 2010 both shaman and hbv provided closer simulations among them mainly for high and medium flows 45 of exceedance while minerve tended to estimate higher flows for the same percent of exceedance regarding low flows 65 of exceedance all models tended to provide similar results to each other 5 discussion results outlined above show that there is no significant difference of simulation outputs from parsimonious and more complex models this corroborates previous studies e g breuer et al 2009 perrin et al 2001 vansteenkiste et al 2014 which indicate that more complex models do not necessarily improve the performance of hydrological simulations contrariwise parsimonious glacio hydrological models can provide more robust results than more complex models in a context of data scarcity and limited process understanding such as in the glacierized tropical andean catchments if sufficient quantity and quality data is available more complex models might provide several advantages like estimations inside of the catchments or deeper processes understanding however several limitations need to be considered when evaluating the presented results in this study firstly the selected hydrological models depict a certain range rather than a full spectrum of model complexity secondly no fully distributed model was assessed due to the inherent limitations of data input and process complexity this might also be the main reason why no fully distributed models have been implemented yet in the region thirdly the use of different of and calibration tools influence the simulations and model results although some calibration tools might be more powerful than others all model results were compared with the same measures of model performance lastly another important insight is linked to the assessment of final model outputs at the catchment outlet only in the following sections we elaborate and discuss in more detail the aforementioned critical points and present a modeling framework to improve the robustness of glacio hydrological simulation in glacierized data scarce tropical andean catchments 5 1 parsimonious vs complex glacio hydrological models results suggest that three models of different complex perform similar runoff simulations the median error estimations from all models are also comparable among them 15 see fig 3 although they represent only the behavior of total runoff small differences between model results might be related to the model structure the inherent conceptual differences and how the input data is used see section 3 1 models and data sources as a result the parsimonious shaman model can perform as well as the more complex hbv or minerve models while providing a clear advantage of reduced computer power and data requirement this becomes more relevant with automatic calibration without an expert supervision and quality checking because the runoff components can be wrongly compensated to achieve good model performance see top row in fig 4 this is known as the achieving good model performance for the wrong reasons error and has been observed in several model applications e g finger et al 2015 kirchner 2006 konz and seibert 2010 automatic calibration results are highly sensitive on the selection of the measures of model performance the specified search scheme and numerical measures of the goodness of fit madsen 2000 therefore even when automatic calibration tools are powerful and easy to use they need to be carefully supervised to make full benefit of the advantages such as exploring an exhaustive set of parameter options in a short time series fig 4 shows that unsupervised automatic calibration from shaman and hbv provided a distribution of runoff components than the automatic calibration from minerve nonetheless the shuffled complex evolution method sce ua which is available for minerve is well known as an efficient and robust tool for automatic calibration of hydrological models muttil and jayawardena 2008 seong et al 2015 wang et al 2010 under the specific conditions of this study the exhaustive calibration strategy of minerve that requires further adjustment of the runoff components represents a disadvantage compared to the more parsimonious shaman and hbv models our assessment under complex and data scarce basin conditions highlights the fact that measures based on model performance only do not provide sufficient information about the drivers behind the predominant hydrological processes a comprehensive assessment is needed to identify or reject model results that do not meet minimum requirements vaché and mcdonnell 2006 such a comprehensive assessment is directly linked to the calibration strategy in this study the calibration strategy used different assumptions based on the fast and slow flows to constrain the runoff components but also to reject unrealistic model results see section 3 2 calibration strategy vansteenkiste et al 2014 applied a similar approach for the calibration procedure where runoff responses derived from rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were used to constrain the runoff components nevertheless this approach implies some degree of subjectivity and is therefore highly dependent on the modeler s expertise more complex models provide several advantages such as a larger sets of calibration options perrin et al 2001 spatial scenarios specific simulation and analysis options within the catchment pokhrel and gupta 2011 and provide new insights about the hydrological processes see table 4 nevertheless in the absence of sufficient measurements and process understanding all model results remain as unverified hypotheses hrachowitz and clark 2017 to produce robust simulations and benefit of its advantages more complex models require sufficient data availability of both quality and quantity and a deep understanding of the underlying model structure and the predominant hydrological processes in the catchment table 4 summarizes the potential benefits and trade offs of the implementation of parsimonious and more complex models under data scarcity on the one side parsimonious models require limited input data and knowledge about the hydrological processes with robust model outputs but of limited insight and mostly with single research goals on the other side more complex models require additional data and expertise to use their full potential and advantages such as providing new insights of hydrological processes these trade offs highlight the importance of a careful model selection depending on the research goal and how well the dominant hydrological processes are understood therefore a more appropriate approach in data scarce environments is to collect additional data improve the calibration strategy and implement a comprehensive model assessment of parsimonious models rather than increasing model complexity c f finger et al 2015 tarasova et al 2016 5 2 glacier runoff simulation in this study glacier runoff was constrained by three factors the change of glacier area over time the glacier mass balance rate and relative glacier contribution to total runoff accounting for changes in glacier area over time due to glacier melt is not a regular practice instead the glacier area remains the same in hydrological simulations over large periods with the risk to overestimate glacier runoff tiel et al 2020 here the glacier surface was delineated from satellite images using a common semi automatic approach deploying the ndsi and manual editing with an estimated error at around 5 under normal conditions paul and kääb 2005 other studies applied different approaches that take into account vertical changes in the glacier mass but require additional data such as glacier volume or snow water equivalent e g bahr et al 2015 huss et al 2010 our computed relative annual and seasonal glacier contribution to streamflow are in line with existing studies e g buytaert et al 2017 nevertheless without field measurements that help to constrain glacier model routines see konz and seibert 2010 results are highly dependent on user expertise and parameter selection therefore we additionally used a glacier mass balance rate corresponding to available measurements which have proven to be suitable when assessing appropriate melting rates see section 3 2 calibration strategy in tropical high mountain conditions our results suggest that a differentiated routine and parameters for glacier and non glacier areas like in shaman and minerve models are more helpful than an integrated approach like hbv when simulating glacier runoff the differentiated coefficients provide flexibility when trying to simulate the expected absolute and relative glacier contribution to total runoff in any case common degree day models are not appropriate for simulating the melting of tropical glaciers at sub annual time steps air temperature is a poor index of melt due to relative constant temperature throughout the year and low air heat content in high altitudes sicart et al 2008 therefore adapted approaches such as a sinusoidal interpolation function used in shaman and minerve models with a seasonal minimum austral winter and maximum melt factor austral summer seem to be more promising garcía hernández et al 2016 kronenberg et al 2019 sicart et al 2008 5 3 a framework for robust glacio hydrological simulation in data scarce areas based on the insights of our inter model comparison for the peruvian andes a framework has been developed that includes three main levels and four pillars to support robust glacio hydrological simulation under data scarcity fig 6 in the first level the research goal of simulations is defined and the dominant hydrological processes are identified in this study the focus was rather on low flows than on peak flows while the seasonality of glacier runoff and the high contribution of slow flows were identified as key hydrological processes the second level covers the data collection process including e g gridded datasets of precipitation and evapotranspiration often not available as in situ data while temperature can normally be obtained from weather stations such a data needs to be comprehensively assessed in both quality and quantity depending on the time step and study period the third level comprises the entire modeling process divided into four pillars the first pillar 3 a focuses on the database construction by extending temporally and spatially when possible the climate data series the collection of glacier mass balance data or rates and the delimitation of multit emporal glacier outlines in this study for instance we extended the in situ temperature series in time with gridded data compared our glacier mass balance data with regional estimates and delineated glacier outlines for calibration validation and simulation periods the second pillar 3 b focuses on the calibration strategy by establishing assumptions about the expected runoff components and the glacier runoff contribution to total runoff see section 3 2 calibration strategy then the third pillar 3 c focuses on the model implementation through the multi model association e g differentiated routines and parameters for glacier and non glacier regions and the multi model ensemble e g running different models of different complexities the latter which has been successfully implemented in climate models finally the last pillar 3 d focuses on the model evaluation by using both common model performance indicators and additionally evaluating e g flow signatures and different runoff components short and limited data series do not allow the models to capture all relevant flow signatures and models can only partially reproduce them therefore the use of different models and complexities in a multi model ensemble can provide more robust results than a single model if available additional data can be included in the calibration strategy 3 b or in the model evaluation 3 d as part of a multi response or multi data calibration e g he et al 2018 konz and seibert 2010 pellicciotti et al 2012 tarasova et al 2016 uhlenbrook and leibundgut 2002 the individual steps within the framework can be considered as universally applicable to improve the quality of hydrological simulations and considered best practices in applications beyond this particular study region and purpose therefore the framework is also valid in data rich and non tropical glacier regions nonetheless a systematic integration and implementation of each step within the framework considerably improves the quality and meaningfulness of simulations in data scarce regions 5 4 implications for technical institutions and decision makers the development of efficient strategies for data collection and hydrological modeling approaches that increases process understanding is of paramount importance to bridge limited in situ data and the lack of regional studies modelers can benefit from a knowledge production process by implementing parsimonious models at a first stage and then increase model complexity as new data and knowledge is gathered therefore the presented framework fig 6 can facilitate the exploration of new models within a multi model strategy that could fit better research goals and context nevertheless data scarcity limited research capacities and process understanding remain a major bottleneck that both academia and local governments need to tackle future research should focus on overcoming these limitations that require among others additional funding time allocation for research capacity building and the development and use of meaningful applications in the last years citizen science based initiatives have increasingly been adopted in the tropical andes and beyond as they contribute to the flexible collection of extensive datasets often combined with low cost sensor technology buytaert et al 2014 njue et al 2019 as participatory approaches they can potentially empower e g local communities by engaging them with data monitoring management and further decision making ideally this collaborative process integrates different types of co produced knowledge within a shared baseline since the early research planning muccione et al 2019 which could then be used for hydrological modeling and further water management planning njue et al 2019 additionally decision making under deep uncertainty marchau et al 2019 and exploratory scenario modeling kwakkel 2017 approaches have an enormous potential to support policy making for climate change and water management such approaches deal with high uncertainties from different sources including both natural and human factors in the near future glacio hydrological modeling in the tropical andes will most likely continue to deal with high uncertainty and limited process understanding due to the striking gap in data monitoring and modeling approaches model results should thus be taken as first order indicators with limited significance and precision that need to be constantly revised and updated when new data are available future studies should also continue with systematic data collection in the region exploring improvements in understanding hydrological processes as well as the adaptation or design of particular model structures that represent the relevant catchment behavior in the glacierized tropical andes the use of remote sensing data seems promising to fill data gaps but modelers should be aware of the limitations and combine the advantages of comprehensive remote sensing assessments with ground truth validation sidle 2021 taylor et al 2021 6 conclusion this paper aims to identify if parsimonious or more complex glacio hydrological models can perform robust simulations in tropical glaciated mountain environments with scarce data accordingly three models of different complexity were compared and comprehensively assessed for the 2000 2010 period total runoff was estimated as 2 5 3 3 m3 s with an annual maximum glacier contribution of 18 29 29 49 absolute relative maximum glacier contribution to runoff was calculated for december august as 0 41 0 49 m3 s 30 58 all model complexities allow for acceptable modeling performance r2 0 65 0 70 nash sutcliffe 0 65 0 73 nash sutcliffe ln 0 73 0 78 with small differences related to the model structure this confirms findings from previous studies more complex models do not necessarily improve hydrological simulation more complex models require a more comprehensive calibration strategy and assessment to avoid simulations with apparently high model performance driven by inadequate assumptions besides complex models require a better understanding of the hydrological processes that are often hampered by data scarcity limited knowledge and field accessibility such as in the glacierized tropical andes therefore our study suggests that parsimonious glacio hydrological models can provide more robust results than complex models in data scarce catchments our results imply several limitations that need to be carefully considered 1 the selected models do not cover the full spectrum of model complexity 2 different of and calibration tools have been used that influence the simulation and quality of the model results and 3 the assessment of model outputs was performed at the catchment outlet only which does not allow for further modeling insights within the catchment results suggest that the use of parsimonious models combined with a careful calibration strategy and additional data collection can provide more robust simulations rather than opt for increasing model complexity additional data includes among others extended climate data series glacier mass balance data multitemporal glacier outlines and single runoff measurements based on these insights a framework has been developed that aims for robust glacio hydrological simulation under data scarcity this approach includes a multi model focus with a comprehensive assessment of flow signatures and runoff components and is relevant for the tropical andes region and other regions with similar characteristics while such a combined model framework will most likely contribute to more robust hydrological simulations the remaining challenges of high uncertainty limited knowledge and capacities hamper a further improvement of model results academia and local governments should therefore continue to extend data collection improve understanding of hydrological processes and the adaptation or design of model structures for specific applications in glacierized tropical andean catchments funding this work is part of a phd project
