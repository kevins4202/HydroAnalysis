22545,numerical wave tanks rely on specific models to generate realistic wave condition propagate accurately the waves in the domain and absorb the reflected waves at the boundaries in this paper three wave modeling methods for two phase cfd solvers are compared including the internal wave generator method the relaxation zone method and the spectral wave explicit navier stokes equations swense method the first two methods consist in generating and absorbing the waves in specific regions of the domain while the third achieves a potential viscous coupling in the entire domain these methods implemented either in openfoam or in isis cfd are compared by simulating a fixed catenary anchor leg mooring calm buoy in regular waves the simulation results are compared with available experimental data obtained by a model test in the ocean engineering tank of ecole centrale de nantes the comparison shows the efficiency and the accuracy of these waves modeling methods a problem related to the turbulence modeling in two phase flow is also remarked keywords wave modeling in cfd relaxation zone internal wave generator potential viscous flow coupling swense 1 introduction reproducing the open sea environment in a finite domain is a common challenge faced by both physical and numerical wave tanks nwt for ocean engineering applications the key technique is to generate incident waves and to prevent the reflection at the domain boundaries at the same time a physical experimental wave tank usually generates waves with wavemakers and uses an absorption beach to prevent wave reflection on the other end in nwts reproducing a wavemaker using moving mesh and a wave absorption beach is computationally expensive and thus is often replaced by numerical wave generation and absorption models the simplest method is to use the incident wave velocity and the free surface elevation as boundary conditions this kind of boundary allows incident waves to travel in and out but causes wave reflections when the real waves are different from the incident waves e g diffracted waves by structures without proper treatments large domains should be used to secure a time window long enough for data analysis before the reflected waves travel back same as in physical wave tanks but with a high computational cost efforts in two major directions to overcome this difficulty can be found in the literature the first direction focuses on developing generation absorption boundary conditions aiming to use the boundary to generate incident waves and absorb the diffracted waves at the same time for example the weakly reflecting boundary condition proposed by petit et al 1995 and the active absorption boundary condition proposed by higuera et al 2013 however these methods use linear superposition to combine the incident and the diffracted waves and are thus limited to small diffraction cases methods in the second direction treat the wave generation and the absorption problems separately the internal wave generator iwg method generates incident waves in a specific zone inside the computational domain and absorbs all the outgoing waves with sponge layers on boundaries the iwg method is originally proposed by larsen and dancy 1983 in a boussinesq equation model and has been extended to navier stokes models by adding source terms either in the mass conservation equation lin and liu 1999 or in the momentum equation choi and yoon 2009 to generate unidirectional regular or irregular waves chen and hsiao 2016 and ha et al 2013 have enabled multi directional wave generation by using two perpendicular iwg zones the iwg is transparent to the flow allowing any waves passing through the wavemakers without interference so this is particularly good for cases with significant wave reflection such as simulating wave shoaling and breaking on the beach lara et al 2006 and waves interacting with structures such as wave energy converters schmitt and elsaesser 2015 lópez et al 2014 floating offshore wind turbines calderer et al 2018 etc another widely used method is the relaxation zone rz method differently from the iwg method where waves are generated anywhere in a zone inside the computational domain the rz method blends the numerical solution obtained by the solver to a reference solution in a zone near the boundaries of the domain the velocity and the free surface position computed are relaxed to an incident wave solution this generates waves out of the rzs and also avoids outgoing waves being reflected this method was initially used by mayer et al 1998 to only absorb outgoing waves by setting the incident solution to zero after being extended for wave generation and implemented in openfoam by jacobsen et al 2012 the rz method is now widely used by the ocean and coastal engineering community it has been applied to simulate regular and irregular wave propagation choi et al 2018 wave breaking on a steep beach chella et al 2015 and waves interacting structures such as substructures of offshore wind turbines paulsen et al 2014a b wave energy converters kamath et al 2015 palm et al 2016 coastal bridges seiffert et al 2014 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 and ships seo et al 2017 moreover coupling viscous flow solver with potential wave theory is also used to model waves in nwts as in the spectral wave explicit navier stokes equations swense ferrant et al 2003 vukčević et al 2016a li et al 2018 2019 method the swense method solves the incident wave propagation problem with fully non linear potential wave models and uses the cfd solver only to solve the complementary field since the incident waves are no more treated by the cfd solver one needs only to prevent the complementary field the diffraction radiation etc from reflecting in the far field this can be easily achieved since the complementary waves decrease naturally as they travel away an absorption approach may also be used to damp out the complementary waves in the far field this method has been successfully applied to simulate wave structure interactions such as ships in waves luquet et al 2003 reliquet et al 2013 and vertical cylinder in waves vukčević et al 2016b li et al 2017 miquel et al 2018 compared the active wave absorption method from the first category and the rz method from the second category and concluded that the latter is more effective the present work aims to compare the wave modeling methods from the second category namely the iwg the rz and the swense methods for ocean engineering applications the three methods are implemented in a similar numerical framework using the finite volume method and simulating the two phase air water flow by the volume of fluid vof technique hirt and nichols 1981 the iwg method is implemented in isis cfd 1 1 https lheea ec nantes fr software and patents isis cfd 193387 kjsp a cfd code developed at ecole centrale de nantes and distributed commercially by numeca international as a part of the fine marine computing suite 2 2 https www numeca com product finemarine the rz and the swense methods are implemented in foamstar developed by ecole centrale nantes and bureau veritas based on openfoam 3 3 http www openfoam com a widely used open source cfd software package this comparison is achieved by studying a real ocean engineering application case concerning a fixed catenary anchor leg mooring calm buoy exposed to regular incident waves in open sea the experiment carried out in the ocean engineering tank at ecole centrale de nantes is also provided for the comparison the wave generation and absorption performance and the computational efficiency of the three methods are mainly concerned a problem related to the turbulence modeling in two phase flow is also remarked the paper is structured as follows after this introduction the theory part describes the governing equations of nwts and the principles of the three wave generation and absorption methods sect 3 provides information of the model test in the experimental wave tank sect 4 includes the numerical study of the same case the data analyses and the comparison the conclusion is given in the end 2 theory this section provides the theory about establishing a nwt using two phase cfd solvers in sect 2 1 the basic governing equations of two phase flow is given in sect 2 2 the theory of the iwg method the rz method and the swense method is described 2 1 governing equations in classical ocean engineering application the fluid is assumed as incompressible and the surface tension is ignored in this condition the two phase air water flow in a nwt is modeled with the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse as follows 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u p ρ g μ eff u u t where u is the velocity vector field ρ is the density of the fluid p is the pressure field g is the gravitational acceleration vector and μ eff is the effective dynamic viscosity defined as μ eff μ ρ ν t with μ the fluid dynamic viscosity and ν t the turbulent eddy viscosity k ω sst model is used to determine the turbulence eddy viscosity menter 1994 the fluid properties ρ and μ remain to be determined with interface capturing techniques such as the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 in the present implementations the vof method defines a scalar field α representing the volume fraction of water in a cell this field is equal to 1 when the cell is fully occupied by water and is equal to 0 when the cell is full of air cells on the interface have 0 α 1 the fluid properties are defined with an interpolation between water and air using α as weight 3 ρ α ρ water 1 α ρ air 4 μ α μ water 1 α μ air the vof field is advected by the velocity field u as follows 5 α t u α 0 these equations are the common and fundamental part of two phase vof solvers and are implemented in isis cfd in foamstar the momentum equation eqn 2 is expressed in a slightly different form as follows 6 ρ u t ρ u u p d g x ρ μ eff u u t where p d is the dynamic pressure defined as p d p ρ g x and x x y z is the vector field of the cell center coordinates eqns 2 and 6 are fully equivalent the vof transport equation in foamstar also contains a small modification as follows 7 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 compare to eqn 5 the extra term represents an artificial compression to keep the interface sharp rusche 2003 2 2 wave generation and absorption methods 2 2 1 iwg the iwg method produces waves in a specific region inside the computational domain by adding a momentum source function in the governing equations the implementation in isis cfd is inspired by the method of choi and yoon 2009 a momentum source term is added in eqn 2 the modified momentum equation reads 8 ρ u t ρ u u p ρ g μ eff u u t r ρ a i where r ρ a i is the extra momentum source term calculated using incident wave kinematics r is a scalar field that is equal to one inside the wave generation zone and to zero elsewhere as shown in fig 1 a at the outlet boundary a damping zone is applied to damp the waves to zero with numerical wave damping techniques 2 2 2 rz the rz approach jacobsen et al 2012 is used together with wave generating and absorbing boundary conditions nwts using only boundary conditions suffer from reflection problems when the simulated waves and the imposed incident waves are different at the boundary to avoid such differences rzs are added see fig 1 b to gradually blend the computed value to the target value and force them to match at the boundary the relaxed velocity and vof fields in these regions are defined as a linear combination of the cfd solution and the target incident wave value as follows 9 α relax ω α i 1 ω α 10 u relax ω u i 1 ω u where the variables without subscripts denote the solution of cfd solver and the subscript i denotes the incident wave values in foamstar the incident waves are defined by an external wave solver based on fully non linear potential theory rienecker and fenton 1981 ducrozet et al 2019 2012 2016 ω is a space dependent weight function chosen here as 11 ω 1 3 d 2 2 d 3 where d is the normalized distance in the rz defined as the distance to the boundary divided by the length of the rz monroy et al 2016 this blending procedure is applied at the end of each time step after a converged solution has been obtained the relaxed values are then used in the further simulation the pressure field is not relaxed since it is obtained directly from the poisson equation in the incompressible flow case this technique is used to generate incident waves at the inlet of the cfd domain and can also prevent wave reflections at the boundary by letting the incident part of the waves go out of the domain and absorbing the other parts with the rz a thorough study on the optimal parameter setup can be found in the work of choi et al 2018 2 2 3 swense the swense method ferrant et al 2003 is a specific method designed to solve the wave structure interaction problem using a potential viscous flow coupling approach it treats the wave structure interaction problem by decomposing the total fields into i the incident part and ii the complementary part the incident part describes the incident wave propagation in the computational domain without the structure the complementary part represents the diffracted radiated waves and viscous effects this decomposition is illustrated by fig 2 the decomposition is applied in the entire computational domain no specific wave generation or absorption zone is defined as in the iwg and the rz the two decomposed parts are treated separately the incident wave part is addressed by non linear potential flow theory under the inviscid and irrotational flow assumption and solved by spectral wave models regular incident waves are solved by the stream function wave theory rienecker and fenton 1981 ducrozet et al 2019 while irregular incident waves are solved with high order spectral hos method ducrozet et al 2012 2016 the complementary part is treated by a viscous cfd solver the governing equations of the complementary field are derived using the following idea a variable χ velocity pressure in navier stokes equations eqns 1 and 2 is decomposed into an incident variable χ i and a complementary variable χ c as follows 12 χ χ i χ c the incident variable χ i represents the inviscid flow and is described by euler equations the governing equations of χ c are mathematically derived by substituting eqn 12 into the navier stokes equations eqns 1 and 2 and simplifying them by euler equations the original swense method proposed by ferrant et al 2003 was made for single phase solvers it has been extended for two phase cfd solvers in two recent works using different decomposition strategies in the first work vukčević et al 2016a b the swense decomposition is applied only to the velocity field leaving the entire pressure field to be solved by the viscous solver in contrast in the second work li et al 2018 2019 the swense decomposition is applied to both the velocity and pressure fields this more complete incident and complementary decomposition leads to less solution effort of the viscous solver for this reason the method in the second work is used in the present comparison the governing equations of the complementary fields read 13 u c 0 14 u c t u c u c u c u i u i u c p c ρ p i ρ i ρ ρ μ eff u c u c t ρ where ρ i ρ water is the water density and p i is the incident wave pressure provided by nonlinear potential theory all the incident fields are extended to the viscous solver s computational domain after solving the complementary field the total field is reconstructed to obtain the final solution the merit of such decomposition is on the mesh requirement regarding the incident wave propagation this one can be loosened since the incident wave information is explicitly known a high mesh density is only necessary near the structure to solve the complementary field with a high level of accuracy the boundary condition of the complementary field at far field boundary is defined to be zero to ensure the complementary field vanish at far field and to prevent its reflection the outgoing complementary waves are either absorbed with coarse mesh or with rzs in the far field zone 3 experimental study the experimental study deals with a fixed calm buoy rousset and ferrant 2005 in regular incident waves the complexity of the geometry and of the flow represents a realistic ocean engineering application case thus this study is suitable for comparing the different nwt models 3 1 experimental setup the experiment has been conducted in the ocean engineering basin of ecn which is rectangular and is 50 m long 30 m wide and 5 m deep one side of the tank is equipped with a segmented wavemaker composed of 48 hinged flaps distributed over the width of the basin each flap is controlled separately the wave generator system is equipped with an active wave absorption control feature the opposite end of the basin is equipped with a passive wave breaking beach to prevent wave reflections the side walls are reflective the geometry of the calm buoy contains a truncated cylinder and a thin skirt near the bottom to provide additional heave damping force through vortex shedding as shown in fig 3 and table 1 in the experiment the buoy is captured by a tripod and fixed at its design draft position the center of the buoy locates on the basin s center line and is 17 19 m away from the wavemaker uni directional regular incident waves are used in this case the wave parameters are provided in table 2 3 2 data measurement and analysis 3 2 1 data measurement wave forces and moments on the buoy are measured by a 5d dynamometer mz is not measured the free surface elevations are measured at four positions with resistance wave gauges the data is acquired at 100 hz three probes are located near the structure see fig 4 probe no 4 is located at 8 m aside from the buoy and 17 19 m away from the wavemaker to indicate the far field wave information 3 2 2 sliding window fourier transform the amplitudes of the zeroth the mean value the first and the second harmonic components of the measurement are obtained by the sliding window fourier transform the sliding window is equal to one wave period t 1 8 s the time increment between two windows is δ t 0 01 t after such a transform the amplitudes are recorded in function of time their time averaged values and the standard deviations can be calculated in a chosen analysis zone 3 2 3 non dimensionalization the data is non dimensionalized to take into account the probable discrepancies between the target and the measured incident waves such discrepancies are related to the use of a linear transfer function for the control of the wavemaker fig 5 shows the free surface elevation measured by wave probe 4 η 4 together with its first harmonic amplitude η 4 1 extracted with the sliding window fourier transform ideally its amplitude should remain constant and be equal to that of the target incident wave if i the wave generation and absorption are perfect and ii this position is not affected by the diffracted waves however the measured wave amplitude contains several variations see fig 5 b which indicates that the above assumptions are not fully satisfied such variations are interpreted as a at t 45 s the arrival of the wave front where small amplitudes waves are followed by steeper waves before the amplitude becomes nearly constant b at t 55 s the arrival of diffracted waves at first the diffracted waves from the buoy reach the probe several periods later the waves get reflected at the side wall travels back and reach the probe again c at t 85 s the arrival of reflected waves from the absorbing beach as a result only the interval after the peak a and before the reflection b corresponds to the pure incident waves generated by the wavemaker at this probe the measured wave height crest to trough in this interval is h m σ h m 0 152 m 0 0015 m where h m is the mean value and σ h m is the standard deviation it is worth noting that the measured mean wave height h m is slightly smaller than 0 16 m the target value in wave tank experiments this difficulty in generating the exact target incident waves is overcome by converting the raw experimental data to non dimensional values with a correction taking the measured incident wave information into account the non dimensional wave forces are defined as 15 f nondim f a m k ρ g v where f is the measured force a m is the measured amplitude k is the wave number and v is the immersed volume the measured wave amplitude a m is defined as 16 a m 1 2 h m the non dimensional wave elevation is defined as 17 η nondim η a m with η the measured free surface elevation 3 2 4 wave forces and free surface elevations the first harmonic amplitudes of horizontal and vertical forces dimensionless values are shown in fig 6 similarly as for the incident wave measurement the three variations are also observed in the force amplitudes a at t 45 s the arrival of the wave front b at t 65 s the arrival of reflected diffracted waves from side wall c at t 85 s the arrival of reflected waves from the beach it is worth noting that the variation b happens about 10 s later for the force than that for the wave elevation at probe 4 since only the reflection caused by the side walls has an influence on the force and these waves need more time to propagate back to the center of the basin to obtain final results describing the true response to the incident waves only data in the effective time window after the peak a and before the variation b where the amplitudes are almost constant are used the experimental results are summarized in table 3 in the table the superscript i represents the ith harmonic component the results of first harmonics are given in the first place followed by the second harmonics the zeroth harmonic amplitude representing the drift force is also provided in the end for each component the mean value x corresponds to the time averaged value during the zone of analysis and the standard deviations σ x include already the error on the incident waves in the non dimensionalization the relative standard deviation σ x x represents the difficulty to obtain a precise result in this experiment all the first harmonic amplitudes have relative standard deviations about 1 showing a good data quality however the second harmonics are more difficult to obtain and contain larger relative standard deviations since the mean values are much smaller only the horizontal force f x 2 has a fairly small standard deviation of about 5 the zeroth harmonic amplitude of the horizontal force f x 0 has also a relative standard deviation of about 5 4 numerical study this section reproduces the wave tank experiment using the three nwts to compares the three wave modeling methods the following features are considered the accuracy the computational efficiency the wave generation and absorption ability the section begins by introducing the cfd solvers implementing the three wave modeling methods and continues with a description of the numerical setup the numerical results and the discussions are presented in the end 4 1 cfd solvers the wave generation and absorption methods presented in sect 2 2 are implemented in two phase cfd solvers the iwg method is implemented with isis cfd while the rz method and the swense method are implemented in foamstar both isis cfd and foamstar are based on the second order accurate finite volume method unstructured polyhedral mesh with co located variable arrangement is used the governing equations are solved with the simple algorithm ferziger and peric 2012 the free surface is treated with the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 f oamstar is based on interdymfoam the native openfoam solver for incompressible two phase flow the solver s main structure is maintained only slight modifications are made to implement the wave generation and absorption methods details can be found in monroy et al 2016 for the rz implementation and in li et al 2018 2019 for the swense method 4 2 numerical setup two types of mesh are used in this test case one is rectangular and the other is cylindrical as shown in figs 7 and 8 the rectangular configuration is normally used by most nwts because its uniform and regular mesh is usually more accurate for the incident wave propagation the cylindrical configuration has fine cells only near the structure and coarse mesh in the far field this mesh arrangement contains a lower number of cells while keeping the density near the structure the same as in the rectangular configuration it is consequently often more efficient however due to the coarse mesh in the far field this configuration is not suitable to simulate wave propagation using classical navier stokes models but this configuration is compatible with the swense method and shows its best performance since the swense method only need to solve the complementary fields which is located close to the structure in the zone with high mesh density in both configurations the origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the buoy and on the free surface at rest the x axis points to the wave propagation direction and z axis points upward the depth of the computational domain is the same as in the experimental wave tank z min 5 m only half of the domain is simulated by using a longitudinal symmetry plane the following part only details the spatial discretizations the temporal discretization is set to have 360 time steps per wave period which is considered to be fine enough according to a separate study choi et al 2018 4 2 1 rectangular configuration the rectangular configurations in fig 7 have cartesian far field mesh unstructured refined mesh is used locally near the structure to fit the geometry see fig 9 three meshes with different far field mesh densities 20x 40x and 80x are used to compare the three models on their spatial discretization requirement the number 20 40 and 80 signify the number of cells per wavelength λ along the x direction the far field meshes are the only difference the mesh density near the buoy is kept invariant and is assumed to be adequate to capture the flow details the mesh information is detailed in table 4 where λ 5 05 m and h 0 16 m are the target incident wave length and height please note that the vertical discretization is kept unchanged in the three configurations and is assumed to be enough the transverse y direction is not varying simultaneously with cells in the x direction such a configuration is commonly used to reduce the number of cells in unidirectional regular wave simulations it has a preference wave propagation direction along which the mesh is more refined than the other direction 4 2 2 cylindrical configuration as shown in fig 8 the mesh of the cylindrical configuration has fine cells near the center of the domain and coarse cells in the far field a local refinement is applied near the structure the mesh density in this refinement zone is comparable to that of the rectangular configuration using the cylindrical mesh with the swense method assumes that the complementary fields diffracted waves need to be solved accurately only in a region close to the structure this study analyzes the necessary size of this region three meshes with different refinement zone sizes are used as illustrated by fig 10 and referred to as c1 c2 and c3 their details can be found in table 5 in the table δ r near and δ r far represent the radial size of the smallest and the largest cells respectively r refine denotes the width of the local refinement zone near the buoy 4 2 3 wave generation and absorption the wave generation and absorption methods used in the rectangular configuration are detailed as follows the iwg method in isis cfd a wave generation zone of one wavelength long is set next to the inlet boundary x x min x min λ as shown in fig 7 a the wave damping zone is 1 5 wavelength long and is next to the outlet boundary x x max 1 5 λ x max the side wall is modeled as slip wall since using damping zones near the side wall is not feasible this configuration is very similar to the experimental condition reflection from the side wall is expected the rz method in foamstar uses incident wave boundary condition at the inlet the outlet and the side wall three rzs with 1 5 wavelength long are used next to these boundaries x x min x min 1 5 λ and x x max 1 5 λ x max and y y max 1 5 λ y max as shown in fig 7 b this setup avoids the reflections at any domain boundary to simulate an open sea condition the swense method in foamstar does not need wave generation zone but uses rzs to prevent the reflections of complementary waves these zones are set in the same way as in the rz method to simulate an open sea condition for the cylindrical configuration the swense method in foamstar uses a rz of 1 5 wavelength long around the far field boundary to simulate an open sea condition as shown in fig 8 the stream function wave theory rienecker and fenton 1981 ducrozet et al 2019 is used to calculate the target incident waves as shown in table 2 4 3 results same information is collected in the numerical study as in the experiment the raw data is non dimensionalized and processed with sliding windows fourier transform in the same way as in the experiment for simplicity only the analysis procedure for the horizontal wave force is detailed here the complete results are provided in table 6 and further compared in figs 15 and 16 it is worth noting that the non dimensionalization in the numerical study uses the target incident value and not the measured value so to see the errors in the wave propagation 4 3 1 iwg in isis cfd the simulation using the iwg method starts with calm water condition at t 0 the waves are generated in the wave making zone and propagates in the nwt fig 11 plots the horizontal wave force during the first 10 wave periods and its first harmonic amplitude the three different curves represent the results using different discretizations from fig 11 b it is observed that the force amplitudes are not constant but with two obvious variations similar to the experiment the horizontal wave force exhibits a peak after the arrival of the wave front point a it is also worth noting that the wave force amplitudes begin to decrease at t 12 s point b although this decrease is similar to the experiment it is not due to the side wall reflection since the reflected waves need more time to travel back this decrease is caused by the damping zone at the outlet the distance of which is only 1 5 wavelength away from the buoy the traveling time estimated with the wave group velocity is equal to 10 8 s for this reason only a short time window after the peak a and before the reflection b can be used for data analysis besides the wave forces show a converging trend with the mesh refinement the results using the 20x mesh is about 10 smaller than the two close results with the 40x and 80x meshes 4 3 2 rz in foamstar at the beginning of the simulation the incident waves are initialized everywhere in the entire computational domain such initial condition is necessary to ensure the compatibility of the flow in the pure cfd zone and in the rzs blending to incident wave the results of such initial condition is shown by the peak a in fig 12 b which corresponds to the impact caused by the sudden appearance of the buoy in the incident waves the following trough corresponds to the establishment of the diffracted waves note that the amplitude curve starts one period later compared to the time history since the sliding window fourier transform uses one wave period as the window length after point a t 1 8 s the force amplitudes remain almost constant for a short interval it may be interpreted as the response to the incident waves initialized at the beginning of the simulation then force amplitudes decrease between point a and point b t 7 s this decrease suggests that the waves generated at the inlet boundary become smaller while propagating in the cfd domain due to numerical errors in the wave modeling method this loss of wave amplitude is more severe with the coarse mesh 20x than with the fine mesh 80x but the duration of such a decrease is the same for the three meshes which is approximately equal to the time to propagate information from the inlet boundary to the structure at the wave group velocity after point b the results become almost constant and correspond to the converged results with each discretization compared to the iwg result the duration of the stable result is longer so it offers a longer zone to extract the final results the results in different meshes have larger discrepancy compared with the iwg s results in isis cfd 4 3 3 swense in foamstar figs 13 and 14 plot the horizontal force obtained with the rectangular and the cylindrical mesh configurations the initial condition in the swense simulation is the same as the rz method i e the incident waves exist everywhere thus the wave force at the beginning of the simulation is similar to that of the rz method near point a the point b in figs 13 b and 14 b are plotted at the same position as in fig 12 b i e at t 7 s since the information propagation time should be identical however the decrease of the force amplitudes between a and b is much smaller than that of the rz method showing that the loss of wave amplitude caused by the swense method is also smaller than the rz method after point b the simulation results become almost constant offering a long zone of analysis to extract the final result in fig 13 the cylindrical mesh simulations show very close results the force amplitudes increase slightly when enlarging the size of refinement zone near the structure it suggests that solving the complementary field accurately in different spatial extents has a slight influence the quantitative study of this problem will be given in sect 4 3 4 and the compromise between the accuracy and the computational cost using the swense method will be further addressed in sect 4 4 1 moreover in fig 14 the difference between mesh configurations are very small revealing that the far field spatial discretization has only minor influence on the accuracy of wave force calculation 4 3 4 summary of the results the simulation results are detailed in tables 6 and 7 including the first two harmonic amplitudes of the wave force horizontal and vertical and of the wave amplitudes at the three probes close to the buoy the zeroth harmonic amplitude of the horizontal wave force is also provided in the table the mesh names are followed by the number of cells to indicate the computational cost these data are obtained with the sliding window fourier transform in the same way as in the experiment only the numerical results inside the exploitable zone are used for the data processing to exclude the transitional regime at the beginning and the influence of the wave reflections in the iwg case for example in the interval wave generation case in fig 11 b the result after peak a and before b is used in the rz method and the swense method the results after point b are used see figs 12 14 for each result the mean value is provided and followed by its standard deviation to give an indication of the periodical uncertainty before going into details the tables show a general good agreement between the experimental data and the numerical results on the mean values especially when the finest mesh 80x is used this agreement indicates that all the three wave modeling methods are able to simulate correctly the waves and the interaction with the structure with respect to the standard deviation the results of the iwg method in isis cfd have the largest deviations which are comparable with that in experimental data the results of rz method and the swense method in foamstar have smaller deviations suggesting a more stable simulation results which is in agreement with the observation from figs 11 14 among these quantities the first harmonics are one or two orders of magnitudes larger than the second harmonics and thus describe the majority of the physical phenomenon besides they contain relatively small standard deviations showing better data quality the second harmonics especially that of the vertical force has much smaller mean values and much larger standard deviations for this reason the comparison shall concentrate on the first harmonics forces which are the main interest from the engineering point of view for this reason the comparison is at first conducted for the first harmonics of the horizontal and vertical forces in fig 15 the first harmonic amplitude of the free surface elevation at probe 1 is also shown in each figure the vertical axis denotes the non dimensional amplitude the horizontal axis describes the mesh information in ascending order of number of cells the mean experimental data is plotted with a black solid line which is encompassed by a red region covering one standard deviation above and below the mean values of the simulation results are described by the bars the error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the mean values in fig 15 a the first harmonic amplitudes of the horizontal wave forces f x 1 are plotted all the three methods achieve good results compared to the experimental data when the finest discretization 80x is used but their accuracy varies significantly on coarser meshes with 80x mesh the difference to the experimental data is smaller than 3 for the foamstar rz while the results of isis cfd iwg and the foamstar swense are very close to the experimental data when meshes become coarser the behavior of the three wave modeling methods become different isis cfd iwg and foamstar swense can still produce results with errors smaller than one standard deviation with 40x mesh while the foamstar rz are about 5 smaller when the mesh becomes even coarser only the results of foamstar swense show no obvious degradation for the foamstar rz and isis cfd iwg the wave force decreases when enlarging the far field cell size this decrease is most due to the numerical diffusion errors induced by the mesh in the incident wave propagation the iwg method and rz methods rely on the cfd solver to calculate the incident wave propagation and thus require fine cells everywhere in the domain in contrast the incident waves of the swense method are solved with external potential flow solvers and are not affected by the cfd mesh as a result the swense method is the least sensitive to the quality of far field mesh in fig 15 b and c the first harmonic amplitudes of the vertical force f z 1 and the free surface elevation at probe 1 η 1 reveal similar results with the horizontal force i e the three methods show close and the most accurate results with 80x mesh but the swense method is the least sensitive to the far field mesh quality however for the vertical force f z 1 an obvious larger discrepancy between the numerical results and the experimental data is observed even with the finest mesh this difference still remains and exists for all the three methods provided that the heave damping skirt mainly influences the vertical wave force it is possible that the local refinement near the skirt identical in all the meshes is not enough to capture accurately the complex vortex shedding phenomenon the zeroth harmonic and the second harmonic of the horizontal force is about 5 and 10 to the first harmonic force these values can give a more detailed comparison of the accuracy moreover the zeroth harmonic is of engineering interest since it corresponds to the drift force of the waves fig 16 provides such a comparison the swense method still shows a good accuracy on both quantities regardless the mesh used while the loss of amplitudes is also obvious in the results of the foamstar rz and isis cfd iwg with mesh 20x due to the numerical damping caused by large mesh size in the far field the foamstar rz achieves good results with fine meshes 40x and 80x while the isis cfd iwg underestimates the drift force and has larger periodical uncertainty in its result 4 4 discussion 4 4 1 efficiency of the models the results reveal that each wave modeling method achieves its best accuracy with the finest discretization 80x mesh however coarse mesh in the far field has different influence on their accuracy the swense method is able to use much coarser mesh by giving little concession on the accuracy and thus is the most efficient wave modeling method among the three and is very advantage in cases where the efficiency is more emphasized than the absolute accuracy to confirm that we compare the efficiency of the three models according to their mesh requirement to reach a same level of accuracy taking the first harmonic amplitude of the horizontal wave force as an example if set an accuracy tolerance of 3 1 35 f x 1 1 43 then isis cfd iwg requires the 40x mesh with 1 5 million cells to meet the criteria foamstar rz requires the 80x mesh with 2 4 million cells while foamstar swense is able to achieve the same level of accuracy with the coarsest c1 mesh with only 0 72 million of cells the efficiency enhancement in the swense method is credited to the use of the potential viscous coupling approach so that accurate incident waves are independent of the cfd mesh only the complementary field needs to be solved moreover this study confirms that the complementary fields need only to be solved accurately in a close vicinity of the structure so that a small local refinement zone near the structure with coarse mesh in the far field is able to produce good results the cylindrical mesh with a local refinement of 0 04 incident wave length around the structure c1 is enough to achieve a good estimation of horizontal wave force with 2 3 error compared to the experimental data although enlarging this local refinement zone to 0 27 wave length wide c3 can reduce the error to 1 7 using larger refinement zone is not always necessary if the efficiency is more emphasized than the accuracy to ensure the accuracy of the simulation especially to validate the result of swense on the coarse mesh the flow details of the simulation are compared the iwg method uses the medium mesh 40x the rz method uses the finest mesh 80x the swense method uses the coarsest mesh 20x with such discretizations all methods should have a same level of accuracy fig 17 plots the q criterion and the pressure fields obtained by the three methods showing a good agreement 4 4 2 wave reflection prevention ability the wave reflection is prevented using two strategies in the present study full absorption condition damping zones are used to absorb the entire wave trains at the outlet boundary as in the iwg method and in the experiment diffraction absorption condition this condition allows the incident waves to leave the computational domain and absorb the diffracted waves only as in the rz method and in the swense method it is observed that the diffraction absorption condition prevents better wave reflection comparing with the full absorption condition for example when the full absorption condition is used both the experiment and numerical methods show difficulty in damping out the full wave trains at the end of the domain reflected waves travel back to the structure and affect the results see point c in fig 6 and point b in fig 11 b as a result the exploitable window for the data analysis is reduced a secondary effect of the full absorption condition is that it can not be used to prevent side wall reflections in the present study the numerical simulation with the iwg method is not long enough to make this phenomenon appear but the experimental data confirms the necessity of avoiding side wall reflections the rz method and the swense method both use the diffraction absorption condition at all domain boundaries with both methods no apparent wave reflections are observed the simulations are more stable and provide longer exploitable time for the data analysis inspired by the rz method forcing zones are added to the iwg method in isis cfd to achieve the diffraction absorption condition the forcing zone is similar to the rz but it uses a momentum source in the rans equations to force the cfd solution equal to the incident wave solution and thus it provides the absorption of the diffracted waves in fig 18 the results of iwg using forcing zones at side walls and the outlet are plotted by red dash lines and compared to the original method shown by black lines the forcing zones avoid the wave reflections and show a much more stable result 4 4 3 remark on the turbulence model in two phase flow in the present numerical study the standard k ω sst turbulence model is selected to calculate the eddy viscosity in the rans equations however an excessive wave damping and a wave force diminishing are observed with the rz method implemented in openfoam fig 19 shows the 0th and 1st harmonic amplitudes of the horizontal wave force a loss in amplitude is observed from t 15 s this problem is purely numeric and limits the effective time window to analyze the physics this problem has been reported in the literature devolder et al 2017 on using rans model for two phase flow simulations and it is attributed to the limitation of the present turbulence models which are mostly derived and tuned for single phase flows these models are usually not adequate to consider the discontinuity of physics near the free surface and create excessive and nonphysical turbulent eddy viscosity which leads to the wave damping this problem is often severe in a wave structure interaction problem without forward speed since the turbulent viscosity always remains in the computational domain fig 20 shows the turbulent viscosity ν t at t 1 t and t 15 t in the simulation with the rz method after one wave periods the turbulent viscosity appears not only close to structure but also in the far field the far field turbulence is created near the free surface which is shown as a white line due to the interface discontinuity the maximum ν t has an order of 10 3 m 2 s at t 1 8 s at the end of the simulation the turbulent viscosity has a much larger value order of 10 1 m 2 s due to the accumulation and appears in a larger zone the result of the swense method is not affected by this problem despite using the same turbulence model the wave force amplitudes are maintained constant even after a long simulation time this has to be credited to the potential viscous coupling used in swense method so that the viscous effects is only applied to the complementary field and does not affect the incident waves 5 conclusion the present work compared three wave modeling methods in two phase cfd solvers the iwg method in isis cfd the rz method and the swense method in foamstar the accuracy and the performance of these methods are compared by simulating a fixed calm buoy in regular waves and compared with experiments on the accuracy side all the three methods are able to achieve accurate comparison with the experiment when the mesh is fine enough to propagate the incident waves accurately compared to the swense method in foamstar the iwg method in isis cfd and the rz method in foamstar show more dependency on fine meshes to obtain accurate results only the swense method in foamstar still obtain good results with coarse far field mesh on the performance side the swense method in foamstar is the most efficient it is able to achieve a significant gain in efficiency with a tiny concession on the accuracy by using coarse mesh in the far field for a same level of accuracy the swense method requires only about 25 cells compared to the rz method with both methods implemented in openfoam the diffraction absorption condition prevents better wave reflection than the full absorption condition the rz and the swense method in foamstar using the diffraction absorption condition are able to prevent reflections at all the domain boundaries and thus provide more stable result and longer time window for the data analysis the full absorption method damping used by the iwg method in isis cfd and the experiment creates larger reflection at the outlet and is inapplicable for side wall absorption using forcing zones is able to achieve the diffraction absorption condition in the iwg method a last remark shows the k ω sst turbulence model is not adapted for two phase flow simulation in standard ranse solvers since it causes excessive numerical damping of incident waves the use of the potential viscous coupling method as the swense method is able to alleviate this problem and maintain good simulation results for longer simulation time acknowledgments this work has been performed in the framework of the chaire hydrodynamique et structure marines centrale nantes bureau

22545,numerical wave tanks rely on specific models to generate realistic wave condition propagate accurately the waves in the domain and absorb the reflected waves at the boundaries in this paper three wave modeling methods for two phase cfd solvers are compared including the internal wave generator method the relaxation zone method and the spectral wave explicit navier stokes equations swense method the first two methods consist in generating and absorbing the waves in specific regions of the domain while the third achieves a potential viscous coupling in the entire domain these methods implemented either in openfoam or in isis cfd are compared by simulating a fixed catenary anchor leg mooring calm buoy in regular waves the simulation results are compared with available experimental data obtained by a model test in the ocean engineering tank of ecole centrale de nantes the comparison shows the efficiency and the accuracy of these waves modeling methods a problem related to the turbulence modeling in two phase flow is also remarked keywords wave modeling in cfd relaxation zone internal wave generator potential viscous flow coupling swense 1 introduction reproducing the open sea environment in a finite domain is a common challenge faced by both physical and numerical wave tanks nwt for ocean engineering applications the key technique is to generate incident waves and to prevent the reflection at the domain boundaries at the same time a physical experimental wave tank usually generates waves with wavemakers and uses an absorption beach to prevent wave reflection on the other end in nwts reproducing a wavemaker using moving mesh and a wave absorption beach is computationally expensive and thus is often replaced by numerical wave generation and absorption models the simplest method is to use the incident wave velocity and the free surface elevation as boundary conditions this kind of boundary allows incident waves to travel in and out but causes wave reflections when the real waves are different from the incident waves e g diffracted waves by structures without proper treatments large domains should be used to secure a time window long enough for data analysis before the reflected waves travel back same as in physical wave tanks but with a high computational cost efforts in two major directions to overcome this difficulty can be found in the literature the first direction focuses on developing generation absorption boundary conditions aiming to use the boundary to generate incident waves and absorb the diffracted waves at the same time for example the weakly reflecting boundary condition proposed by petit et al 1995 and the active absorption boundary condition proposed by higuera et al 2013 however these methods use linear superposition to combine the incident and the diffracted waves and are thus limited to small diffraction cases methods in the second direction treat the wave generation and the absorption problems separately the internal wave generator iwg method generates incident waves in a specific zone inside the computational domain and absorbs all the outgoing waves with sponge layers on boundaries the iwg method is originally proposed by larsen and dancy 1983 in a boussinesq equation model and has been extended to navier stokes models by adding source terms either in the mass conservation equation lin and liu 1999 or in the momentum equation choi and yoon 2009 to generate unidirectional regular or irregular waves chen and hsiao 2016 and ha et al 2013 have enabled multi directional wave generation by using two perpendicular iwg zones the iwg is transparent to the flow allowing any waves passing through the wavemakers without interference so this is particularly good for cases with significant wave reflection such as simulating wave shoaling and breaking on the beach lara et al 2006 and waves interacting with structures such as wave energy converters schmitt and elsaesser 2015 lópez et al 2014 floating offshore wind turbines calderer et al 2018 etc another widely used method is the relaxation zone rz method differently from the iwg method where waves are generated anywhere in a zone inside the computational domain the rz method blends the numerical solution obtained by the solver to a reference solution in a zone near the boundaries of the domain the velocity and the free surface position computed are relaxed to an incident wave solution this generates waves out of the rzs and also avoids outgoing waves being reflected this method was initially used by mayer et al 1998 to only absorb outgoing waves by setting the incident solution to zero after being extended for wave generation and implemented in openfoam by jacobsen et al 2012 the rz method is now widely used by the ocean and coastal engineering community it has been applied to simulate regular and irregular wave propagation choi et al 2018 wave breaking on a steep beach chella et al 2015 and waves interacting structures such as substructures of offshore wind turbines paulsen et al 2014a b wave energy converters kamath et al 2015 palm et al 2016 coastal bridges seiffert et al 2014 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 and ships seo et al 2017 moreover coupling viscous flow solver with potential wave theory is also used to model waves in nwts as in the spectral wave explicit navier stokes equations swense ferrant et al 2003 vukčević et al 2016a li et al 2018 2019 method the swense method solves the incident wave propagation problem with fully non linear potential wave models and uses the cfd solver only to solve the complementary field since the incident waves are no more treated by the cfd solver one needs only to prevent the complementary field the diffraction radiation etc from reflecting in the far field this can be easily achieved since the complementary waves decrease naturally as they travel away an absorption approach may also be used to damp out the complementary waves in the far field this method has been successfully applied to simulate wave structure interactions such as ships in waves luquet et al 2003 reliquet et al 2013 and vertical cylinder in waves vukčević et al 2016b li et al 2017 miquel et al 2018 compared the active wave absorption method from the first category and the rz method from the second category and concluded that the latter is more effective the present work aims to compare the wave modeling methods from the second category namely the iwg the rz and the swense methods for ocean engineering applications the three methods are implemented in a similar numerical framework using the finite volume method and simulating the two phase air water flow by the volume of fluid vof technique hirt and nichols 1981 the iwg method is implemented in isis cfd 1 1 https lheea ec nantes fr software and patents isis cfd 193387 kjsp a cfd code developed at ecole centrale de nantes and distributed commercially by numeca international as a part of the fine marine computing suite 2 2 https www numeca com product finemarine the rz and the swense methods are implemented in foamstar developed by ecole centrale nantes and bureau veritas based on openfoam 3 3 http www openfoam com a widely used open source cfd software package this comparison is achieved by studying a real ocean engineering application case concerning a fixed catenary anchor leg mooring calm buoy exposed to regular incident waves in open sea the experiment carried out in the ocean engineering tank at ecole centrale de nantes is also provided for the comparison the wave generation and absorption performance and the computational efficiency of the three methods are mainly concerned a problem related to the turbulence modeling in two phase flow is also remarked the paper is structured as follows after this introduction the theory part describes the governing equations of nwts and the principles of the three wave generation and absorption methods sect 3 provides information of the model test in the experimental wave tank sect 4 includes the numerical study of the same case the data analyses and the comparison the conclusion is given in the end 2 theory this section provides the theory about establishing a nwt using two phase cfd solvers in sect 2 1 the basic governing equations of two phase flow is given in sect 2 2 the theory of the iwg method the rz method and the swense method is described 2 1 governing equations in classical ocean engineering application the fluid is assumed as incompressible and the surface tension is ignored in this condition the two phase air water flow in a nwt is modeled with the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse as follows 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u p ρ g μ eff u u t where u is the velocity vector field ρ is the density of the fluid p is the pressure field g is the gravitational acceleration vector and μ eff is the effective dynamic viscosity defined as μ eff μ ρ ν t with μ the fluid dynamic viscosity and ν t the turbulent eddy viscosity k ω sst model is used to determine the turbulence eddy viscosity menter 1994 the fluid properties ρ and μ remain to be determined with interface capturing techniques such as the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 in the present implementations the vof method defines a scalar field α representing the volume fraction of water in a cell this field is equal to 1 when the cell is fully occupied by water and is equal to 0 when the cell is full of air cells on the interface have 0 α 1 the fluid properties are defined with an interpolation between water and air using α as weight 3 ρ α ρ water 1 α ρ air 4 μ α μ water 1 α μ air the vof field is advected by the velocity field u as follows 5 α t u α 0 these equations are the common and fundamental part of two phase vof solvers and are implemented in isis cfd in foamstar the momentum equation eqn 2 is expressed in a slightly different form as follows 6 ρ u t ρ u u p d g x ρ μ eff u u t where p d is the dynamic pressure defined as p d p ρ g x and x x y z is the vector field of the cell center coordinates eqns 2 and 6 are fully equivalent the vof transport equation in foamstar also contains a small modification as follows 7 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 compare to eqn 5 the extra term represents an artificial compression to keep the interface sharp rusche 2003 2 2 wave generation and absorption methods 2 2 1 iwg the iwg method produces waves in a specific region inside the computational domain by adding a momentum source function in the governing equations the implementation in isis cfd is inspired by the method of choi and yoon 2009 a momentum source term is added in eqn 2 the modified momentum equation reads 8 ρ u t ρ u u p ρ g μ eff u u t r ρ a i where r ρ a i is the extra momentum source term calculated using incident wave kinematics r is a scalar field that is equal to one inside the wave generation zone and to zero elsewhere as shown in fig 1 a at the outlet boundary a damping zone is applied to damp the waves to zero with numerical wave damping techniques 2 2 2 rz the rz approach jacobsen et al 2012 is used together with wave generating and absorbing boundary conditions nwts using only boundary conditions suffer from reflection problems when the simulated waves and the imposed incident waves are different at the boundary to avoid such differences rzs are added see fig 1 b to gradually blend the computed value to the target value and force them to match at the boundary the relaxed velocity and vof fields in these regions are defined as a linear combination of the cfd solution and the target incident wave value as follows 9 α relax ω α i 1 ω α 10 u relax ω u i 1 ω u where the variables without subscripts denote the solution of cfd solver and the subscript i denotes the incident wave values in foamstar the incident waves are defined by an external wave solver based on fully non linear potential theory rienecker and fenton 1981 ducrozet et al 2019 2012 2016 ω is a space dependent weight function chosen here as 11 ω 1 3 d 2 2 d 3 where d is the normalized distance in the rz defined as the distance to the boundary divided by the length of the rz monroy et al 2016 this blending procedure is applied at the end of each time step after a converged solution has been obtained the relaxed values are then used in the further simulation the pressure field is not relaxed since it is obtained directly from the poisson equation in the incompressible flow case this technique is used to generate incident waves at the inlet of the cfd domain and can also prevent wave reflections at the boundary by letting the incident part of the waves go out of the domain and absorbing the other parts with the rz a thorough study on the optimal parameter setup can be found in the work of choi et al 2018 2 2 3 swense the swense method ferrant et al 2003 is a specific method designed to solve the wave structure interaction problem using a potential viscous flow coupling approach it treats the wave structure interaction problem by decomposing the total fields into i the incident part and ii the complementary part the incident part describes the incident wave propagation in the computational domain without the structure the complementary part represents the diffracted radiated waves and viscous effects this decomposition is illustrated by fig 2 the decomposition is applied in the entire computational domain no specific wave generation or absorption zone is defined as in the iwg and the rz the two decomposed parts are treated separately the incident wave part is addressed by non linear potential flow theory under the inviscid and irrotational flow assumption and solved by spectral wave models regular incident waves are solved by the stream function wave theory rienecker and fenton 1981 ducrozet et al 2019 while irregular incident waves are solved with high order spectral hos method ducrozet et al 2012 2016 the complementary part is treated by a viscous cfd solver the governing equations of the complementary field are derived using the following idea a variable χ velocity pressure in navier stokes equations eqns 1 and 2 is decomposed into an incident variable χ i and a complementary variable χ c as follows 12 χ χ i χ c the incident variable χ i represents the inviscid flow and is described by euler equations the governing equations of χ c are mathematically derived by substituting eqn 12 into the navier stokes equations eqns 1 and 2 and simplifying them by euler equations the original swense method proposed by ferrant et al 2003 was made for single phase solvers it has been extended for two phase cfd solvers in two recent works using different decomposition strategies in the first work vukčević et al 2016a b the swense decomposition is applied only to the velocity field leaving the entire pressure field to be solved by the viscous solver in contrast in the second work li et al 2018 2019 the swense decomposition is applied to both the velocity and pressure fields this more complete incident and complementary decomposition leads to less solution effort of the viscous solver for this reason the method in the second work is used in the present comparison the governing equations of the complementary fields read 13 u c 0 14 u c t u c u c u c u i u i u c p c ρ p i ρ i ρ ρ μ eff u c u c t ρ where ρ i ρ water is the water density and p i is the incident wave pressure provided by nonlinear potential theory all the incident fields are extended to the viscous solver s computational domain after solving the complementary field the total field is reconstructed to obtain the final solution the merit of such decomposition is on the mesh requirement regarding the incident wave propagation this one can be loosened since the incident wave information is explicitly known a high mesh density is only necessary near the structure to solve the complementary field with a high level of accuracy the boundary condition of the complementary field at far field boundary is defined to be zero to ensure the complementary field vanish at far field and to prevent its reflection the outgoing complementary waves are either absorbed with coarse mesh or with rzs in the far field zone 3 experimental study the experimental study deals with a fixed calm buoy rousset and ferrant 2005 in regular incident waves the complexity of the geometry and of the flow represents a realistic ocean engineering application case thus this study is suitable for comparing the different nwt models 3 1 experimental setup the experiment has been conducted in the ocean engineering basin of ecn which is rectangular and is 50 m long 30 m wide and 5 m deep one side of the tank is equipped with a segmented wavemaker composed of 48 hinged flaps distributed over the width of the basin each flap is controlled separately the wave generator system is equipped with an active wave absorption control feature the opposite end of the basin is equipped with a passive wave breaking beach to prevent wave reflections the side walls are reflective the geometry of the calm buoy contains a truncated cylinder and a thin skirt near the bottom to provide additional heave damping force through vortex shedding as shown in fig 3 and table 1 in the experiment the buoy is captured by a tripod and fixed at its design draft position the center of the buoy locates on the basin s center line and is 17 19 m away from the wavemaker uni directional regular incident waves are used in this case the wave parameters are provided in table 2 3 2 data measurement and analysis 3 2 1 data measurement wave forces and moments on the buoy are measured by a 5d dynamometer mz is not measured the free surface elevations are measured at four positions with resistance wave gauges the data is acquired at 100 hz three probes are located near the structure see fig 4 probe no 4 is located at 8 m aside from the buoy and 17 19 m away from the wavemaker to indicate the far field wave information 3 2 2 sliding window fourier transform the amplitudes of the zeroth the mean value the first and the second harmonic components of the measurement are obtained by the sliding window fourier transform the sliding window is equal to one wave period t 1 8 s the time increment between two windows is δ t 0 01 t after such a transform the amplitudes are recorded in function of time their time averaged values and the standard deviations can be calculated in a chosen analysis zone 3 2 3 non dimensionalization the data is non dimensionalized to take into account the probable discrepancies between the target and the measured incident waves such discrepancies are related to the use of a linear transfer function for the control of the wavemaker fig 5 shows the free surface elevation measured by wave probe 4 η 4 together with its first harmonic amplitude η 4 1 extracted with the sliding window fourier transform ideally its amplitude should remain constant and be equal to that of the target incident wave if i the wave generation and absorption are perfect and ii this position is not affected by the diffracted waves however the measured wave amplitude contains several variations see fig 5 b which indicates that the above assumptions are not fully satisfied such variations are interpreted as a at t 45 s the arrival of the wave front where small amplitudes waves are followed by steeper waves before the amplitude becomes nearly constant b at t 55 s the arrival of diffracted waves at first the diffracted waves from the buoy reach the probe several periods later the waves get reflected at the side wall travels back and reach the probe again c at t 85 s the arrival of reflected waves from the absorbing beach as a result only the interval after the peak a and before the reflection b corresponds to the pure incident waves generated by the wavemaker at this probe the measured wave height crest to trough in this interval is h m σ h m 0 152 m 0 0015 m where h m is the mean value and σ h m is the standard deviation it is worth noting that the measured mean wave height h m is slightly smaller than 0 16 m the target value in wave tank experiments this difficulty in generating the exact target incident waves is overcome by converting the raw experimental data to non dimensional values with a correction taking the measured incident wave information into account the non dimensional wave forces are defined as 15 f nondim f a m k ρ g v where f is the measured force a m is the measured amplitude k is the wave number and v is the immersed volume the measured wave amplitude a m is defined as 16 a m 1 2 h m the non dimensional wave elevation is defined as 17 η nondim η a m with η the measured free surface elevation 3 2 4 wave forces and free surface elevations the first harmonic amplitudes of horizontal and vertical forces dimensionless values are shown in fig 6 similarly as for the incident wave measurement the three variations are also observed in the force amplitudes a at t 45 s the arrival of the wave front b at t 65 s the arrival of reflected diffracted waves from side wall c at t 85 s the arrival of reflected waves from the beach it is worth noting that the variation b happens about 10 s later for the force than that for the wave elevation at probe 4 since only the reflection caused by the side walls has an influence on the force and these waves need more time to propagate back to the center of the basin to obtain final results describing the true response to the incident waves only data in the effective time window after the peak a and before the variation b where the amplitudes are almost constant are used the experimental results are summarized in table 3 in the table the superscript i represents the ith harmonic component the results of first harmonics are given in the first place followed by the second harmonics the zeroth harmonic amplitude representing the drift force is also provided in the end for each component the mean value x corresponds to the time averaged value during the zone of analysis and the standard deviations σ x include already the error on the incident waves in the non dimensionalization the relative standard deviation σ x x represents the difficulty to obtain a precise result in this experiment all the first harmonic amplitudes have relative standard deviations about 1 showing a good data quality however the second harmonics are more difficult to obtain and contain larger relative standard deviations since the mean values are much smaller only the horizontal force f x 2 has a fairly small standard deviation of about 5 the zeroth harmonic amplitude of the horizontal force f x 0 has also a relative standard deviation of about 5 4 numerical study this section reproduces the wave tank experiment using the three nwts to compares the three wave modeling methods the following features are considered the accuracy the computational efficiency the wave generation and absorption ability the section begins by introducing the cfd solvers implementing the three wave modeling methods and continues with a description of the numerical setup the numerical results and the discussions are presented in the end 4 1 cfd solvers the wave generation and absorption methods presented in sect 2 2 are implemented in two phase cfd solvers the iwg method is implemented with isis cfd while the rz method and the swense method are implemented in foamstar both isis cfd and foamstar are based on the second order accurate finite volume method unstructured polyhedral mesh with co located variable arrangement is used the governing equations are solved with the simple algorithm ferziger and peric 2012 the free surface is treated with the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 f oamstar is based on interdymfoam the native openfoam solver for incompressible two phase flow the solver s main structure is maintained only slight modifications are made to implement the wave generation and absorption methods details can be found in monroy et al 2016 for the rz implementation and in li et al 2018 2019 for the swense method 4 2 numerical setup two types of mesh are used in this test case one is rectangular and the other is cylindrical as shown in figs 7 and 8 the rectangular configuration is normally used by most nwts because its uniform and regular mesh is usually more accurate for the incident wave propagation the cylindrical configuration has fine cells only near the structure and coarse mesh in the far field this mesh arrangement contains a lower number of cells while keeping the density near the structure the same as in the rectangular configuration it is consequently often more efficient however due to the coarse mesh in the far field this configuration is not suitable to simulate wave propagation using classical navier stokes models but this configuration is compatible with the swense method and shows its best performance since the swense method only need to solve the complementary fields which is located close to the structure in the zone with high mesh density in both configurations the origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the buoy and on the free surface at rest the x axis points to the wave propagation direction and z axis points upward the depth of the computational domain is the same as in the experimental wave tank z min 5 m only half of the domain is simulated by using a longitudinal symmetry plane the following part only details the spatial discretizations the temporal discretization is set to have 360 time steps per wave period which is considered to be fine enough according to a separate study choi et al 2018 4 2 1 rectangular configuration the rectangular configurations in fig 7 have cartesian far field mesh unstructured refined mesh is used locally near the structure to fit the geometry see fig 9 three meshes with different far field mesh densities 20x 40x and 80x are used to compare the three models on their spatial discretization requirement the number 20 40 and 80 signify the number of cells per wavelength λ along the x direction the far field meshes are the only difference the mesh density near the buoy is kept invariant and is assumed to be adequate to capture the flow details the mesh information is detailed in table 4 where λ 5 05 m and h 0 16 m are the target incident wave length and height please note that the vertical discretization is kept unchanged in the three configurations and is assumed to be enough the transverse y direction is not varying simultaneously with cells in the x direction such a configuration is commonly used to reduce the number of cells in unidirectional regular wave simulations it has a preference wave propagation direction along which the mesh is more refined than the other direction 4 2 2 cylindrical configuration as shown in fig 8 the mesh of the cylindrical configuration has fine cells near the center of the domain and coarse cells in the far field a local refinement is applied near the structure the mesh density in this refinement zone is comparable to that of the rectangular configuration using the cylindrical mesh with the swense method assumes that the complementary fields diffracted waves need to be solved accurately only in a region close to the structure this study analyzes the necessary size of this region three meshes with different refinement zone sizes are used as illustrated by fig 10 and referred to as c1 c2 and c3 their details can be found in table 5 in the table δ r near and δ r far represent the radial size of the smallest and the largest cells respectively r refine denotes the width of the local refinement zone near the buoy 4 2 3 wave generation and absorption the wave generation and absorption methods used in the rectangular configuration are detailed as follows the iwg method in isis cfd a wave generation zone of one wavelength long is set next to the inlet boundary x x min x min λ as shown in fig 7 a the wave damping zone is 1 5 wavelength long and is next to the outlet boundary x x max 1 5 λ x max the side wall is modeled as slip wall since using damping zones near the side wall is not feasible this configuration is very similar to the experimental condition reflection from the side wall is expected the rz method in foamstar uses incident wave boundary condition at the inlet the outlet and the side wall three rzs with 1 5 wavelength long are used next to these boundaries x x min x min 1 5 λ and x x max 1 5 λ x max and y y max 1 5 λ y max as shown in fig 7 b this setup avoids the reflections at any domain boundary to simulate an open sea condition the swense method in foamstar does not need wave generation zone but uses rzs to prevent the reflections of complementary waves these zones are set in the same way as in the rz method to simulate an open sea condition for the cylindrical configuration the swense method in foamstar uses a rz of 1 5 wavelength long around the far field boundary to simulate an open sea condition as shown in fig 8 the stream function wave theory rienecker and fenton 1981 ducrozet et al 2019 is used to calculate the target incident waves as shown in table 2 4 3 results same information is collected in the numerical study as in the experiment the raw data is non dimensionalized and processed with sliding windows fourier transform in the same way as in the experiment for simplicity only the analysis procedure for the horizontal wave force is detailed here the complete results are provided in table 6 and further compared in figs 15 and 16 it is worth noting that the non dimensionalization in the numerical study uses the target incident value and not the measured value so to see the errors in the wave propagation 4 3 1 iwg in isis cfd the simulation using the iwg method starts with calm water condition at t 0 the waves are generated in the wave making zone and propagates in the nwt fig 11 plots the horizontal wave force during the first 10 wave periods and its first harmonic amplitude the three different curves represent the results using different discretizations from fig 11 b it is observed that the force amplitudes are not constant but with two obvious variations similar to the experiment the horizontal wave force exhibits a peak after the arrival of the wave front point a it is also worth noting that the wave force amplitudes begin to decrease at t 12 s point b although this decrease is similar to the experiment it is not due to the side wall reflection since the reflected waves need more time to travel back this decrease is caused by the damping zone at the outlet the distance of which is only 1 5 wavelength away from the buoy the traveling time estimated with the wave group velocity is equal to 10 8 s for this reason only a short time window after the peak a and before the reflection b can be used for data analysis besides the wave forces show a converging trend with the mesh refinement the results using the 20x mesh is about 10 smaller than the two close results with the 40x and 80x meshes 4 3 2 rz in foamstar at the beginning of the simulation the incident waves are initialized everywhere in the entire computational domain such initial condition is necessary to ensure the compatibility of the flow in the pure cfd zone and in the rzs blending to incident wave the results of such initial condition is shown by the peak a in fig 12 b which corresponds to the impact caused by the sudden appearance of the buoy in the incident waves the following trough corresponds to the establishment of the diffracted waves note that the amplitude curve starts one period later compared to the time history since the sliding window fourier transform uses one wave period as the window length after point a t 1 8 s the force amplitudes remain almost constant for a short interval it may be interpreted as the response to the incident waves initialized at the beginning of the simulation then force amplitudes decrease between point a and point b t 7 s this decrease suggests that the waves generated at the inlet boundary become smaller while propagating in the cfd domain due to numerical errors in the wave modeling method this loss of wave amplitude is more severe with the coarse mesh 20x than with the fine mesh 80x but the duration of such a decrease is the same for the three meshes which is approximately equal to the time to propagate information from the inlet boundary to the structure at the wave group velocity after point b the results become almost constant and correspond to the converged results with each discretization compared to the iwg result the duration of the stable result is longer so it offers a longer zone to extract the final results the results in different meshes have larger discrepancy compared with the iwg s results in isis cfd 4 3 3 swense in foamstar figs 13 and 14 plot the horizontal force obtained with the rectangular and the cylindrical mesh configurations the initial condition in the swense simulation is the same as the rz method i e the incident waves exist everywhere thus the wave force at the beginning of the simulation is similar to that of the rz method near point a the point b in figs 13 b and 14 b are plotted at the same position as in fig 12 b i e at t 7 s since the information propagation time should be identical however the decrease of the force amplitudes between a and b is much smaller than that of the rz method showing that the loss of wave amplitude caused by the swense method is also smaller than the rz method after point b the simulation results become almost constant offering a long zone of analysis to extract the final result in fig 13 the cylindrical mesh simulations show very close results the force amplitudes increase slightly when enlarging the size of refinement zone near the structure it suggests that solving the complementary field accurately in different spatial extents has a slight influence the quantitative study of this problem will be given in sect 4 3 4 and the compromise between the accuracy and the computational cost using the swense method will be further addressed in sect 4 4 1 moreover in fig 14 the difference between mesh configurations are very small revealing that the far field spatial discretization has only minor influence on the accuracy of wave force calculation 4 3 4 summary of the results the simulation results are detailed in tables 6 and 7 including the first two harmonic amplitudes of the wave force horizontal and vertical and of the wave amplitudes at the three probes close to the buoy the zeroth harmonic amplitude of the horizontal wave force is also provided in the table the mesh names are followed by the number of cells to indicate the computational cost these data are obtained with the sliding window fourier transform in the same way as in the experiment only the numerical results inside the exploitable zone are used for the data processing to exclude the transitional regime at the beginning and the influence of the wave reflections in the iwg case for example in the interval wave generation case in fig 11 b the result after peak a and before b is used in the rz method and the swense method the results after point b are used see figs 12 14 for each result the mean value is provided and followed by its standard deviation to give an indication of the periodical uncertainty before going into details the tables show a general good agreement between the experimental data and the numerical results on the mean values especially when the finest mesh 80x is used this agreement indicates that all the three wave modeling methods are able to simulate correctly the waves and the interaction with the structure with respect to the standard deviation the results of the iwg method in isis cfd have the largest deviations which are comparable with that in experimental data the results of rz method and the swense method in foamstar have smaller deviations suggesting a more stable simulation results which is in agreement with the observation from figs 11 14 among these quantities the first harmonics are one or two orders of magnitudes larger than the second harmonics and thus describe the majority of the physical phenomenon besides they contain relatively small standard deviations showing better data quality the second harmonics especially that of the vertical force has much smaller mean values and much larger standard deviations for this reason the comparison shall concentrate on the first harmonics forces which are the main interest from the engineering point of view for this reason the comparison is at first conducted for the first harmonics of the horizontal and vertical forces in fig 15 the first harmonic amplitude of the free surface elevation at probe 1 is also shown in each figure the vertical axis denotes the non dimensional amplitude the horizontal axis describes the mesh information in ascending order of number of cells the mean experimental data is plotted with a black solid line which is encompassed by a red region covering one standard deviation above and below the mean values of the simulation results are described by the bars the error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the mean values in fig 15 a the first harmonic amplitudes of the horizontal wave forces f x 1 are plotted all the three methods achieve good results compared to the experimental data when the finest discretization 80x is used but their accuracy varies significantly on coarser meshes with 80x mesh the difference to the experimental data is smaller than 3 for the foamstar rz while the results of isis cfd iwg and the foamstar swense are very close to the experimental data when meshes become coarser the behavior of the three wave modeling methods become different isis cfd iwg and foamstar swense can still produce results with errors smaller than one standard deviation with 40x mesh while the foamstar rz are about 5 smaller when the mesh becomes even coarser only the results of foamstar swense show no obvious degradation for the foamstar rz and isis cfd iwg the wave force decreases when enlarging the far field cell size this decrease is most due to the numerical diffusion errors induced by the mesh in the incident wave propagation the iwg method and rz methods rely on the cfd solver to calculate the incident wave propagation and thus require fine cells everywhere in the domain in contrast the incident waves of the swense method are solved with external potential flow solvers and are not affected by the cfd mesh as a result the swense method is the least sensitive to the quality of far field mesh in fig 15 b and c the first harmonic amplitudes of the vertical force f z 1 and the free surface elevation at probe 1 η 1 reveal similar results with the horizontal force i e the three methods show close and the most accurate results with 80x mesh but the swense method is the least sensitive to the far field mesh quality however for the vertical force f z 1 an obvious larger discrepancy between the numerical results and the experimental data is observed even with the finest mesh this difference still remains and exists for all the three methods provided that the heave damping skirt mainly influences the vertical wave force it is possible that the local refinement near the skirt identical in all the meshes is not enough to capture accurately the complex vortex shedding phenomenon the zeroth harmonic and the second harmonic of the horizontal force is about 5 and 10 to the first harmonic force these values can give a more detailed comparison of the accuracy moreover the zeroth harmonic is of engineering interest since it corresponds to the drift force of the waves fig 16 provides such a comparison the swense method still shows a good accuracy on both quantities regardless the mesh used while the loss of amplitudes is also obvious in the results of the foamstar rz and isis cfd iwg with mesh 20x due to the numerical damping caused by large mesh size in the far field the foamstar rz achieves good results with fine meshes 40x and 80x while the isis cfd iwg underestimates the drift force and has larger periodical uncertainty in its result 4 4 discussion 4 4 1 efficiency of the models the results reveal that each wave modeling method achieves its best accuracy with the finest discretization 80x mesh however coarse mesh in the far field has different influence on their accuracy the swense method is able to use much coarser mesh by giving little concession on the accuracy and thus is the most efficient wave modeling method among the three and is very advantage in cases where the efficiency is more emphasized than the absolute accuracy to confirm that we compare the efficiency of the three models according to their mesh requirement to reach a same level of accuracy taking the first harmonic amplitude of the horizontal wave force as an example if set an accuracy tolerance of 3 1 35 f x 1 1 43 then isis cfd iwg requires the 40x mesh with 1 5 million cells to meet the criteria foamstar rz requires the 80x mesh with 2 4 million cells while foamstar swense is able to achieve the same level of accuracy with the coarsest c1 mesh with only 0 72 million of cells the efficiency enhancement in the swense method is credited to the use of the potential viscous coupling approach so that accurate incident waves are independent of the cfd mesh only the complementary field needs to be solved moreover this study confirms that the complementary fields need only to be solved accurately in a close vicinity of the structure so that a small local refinement zone near the structure with coarse mesh in the far field is able to produce good results the cylindrical mesh with a local refinement of 0 04 incident wave length around the structure c1 is enough to achieve a good estimation of horizontal wave force with 2 3 error compared to the experimental data although enlarging this local refinement zone to 0 27 wave length wide c3 can reduce the error to 1 7 using larger refinement zone is not always necessary if the efficiency is more emphasized than the accuracy to ensure the accuracy of the simulation especially to validate the result of swense on the coarse mesh the flow details of the simulation are compared the iwg method uses the medium mesh 40x the rz method uses the finest mesh 80x the swense method uses the coarsest mesh 20x with such discretizations all methods should have a same level of accuracy fig 17 plots the q criterion and the pressure fields obtained by the three methods showing a good agreement 4 4 2 wave reflection prevention ability the wave reflection is prevented using two strategies in the present study full absorption condition damping zones are used to absorb the entire wave trains at the outlet boundary as in the iwg method and in the experiment diffraction absorption condition this condition allows the incident waves to leave the computational domain and absorb the diffracted waves only as in the rz method and in the swense method it is observed that the diffraction absorption condition prevents better wave reflection comparing with the full absorption condition for example when the full absorption condition is used both the experiment and numerical methods show difficulty in damping out the full wave trains at the end of the domain reflected waves travel back to the structure and affect the results see point c in fig 6 and point b in fig 11 b as a result the exploitable window for the data analysis is reduced a secondary effect of the full absorption condition is that it can not be used to prevent side wall reflections in the present study the numerical simulation with the iwg method is not long enough to make this phenomenon appear but the experimental data confirms the necessity of avoiding side wall reflections the rz method and the swense method both use the diffraction absorption condition at all domain boundaries with both methods no apparent wave reflections are observed the simulations are more stable and provide longer exploitable time for the data analysis inspired by the rz method forcing zones are added to the iwg method in isis cfd to achieve the diffraction absorption condition the forcing zone is similar to the rz but it uses a momentum source in the rans equations to force the cfd solution equal to the incident wave solution and thus it provides the absorption of the diffracted waves in fig 18 the results of iwg using forcing zones at side walls and the outlet are plotted by red dash lines and compared to the original method shown by black lines the forcing zones avoid the wave reflections and show a much more stable result 4 4 3 remark on the turbulence model in two phase flow in the present numerical study the standard k ω sst turbulence model is selected to calculate the eddy viscosity in the rans equations however an excessive wave damping and a wave force diminishing are observed with the rz method implemented in openfoam fig 19 shows the 0th and 1st harmonic amplitudes of the horizontal wave force a loss in amplitude is observed from t 15 s this problem is purely numeric and limits the effective time window to analyze the physics this problem has been reported in the literature devolder et al 2017 on using rans model for two phase flow simulations and it is attributed to the limitation of the present turbulence models which are mostly derived and tuned for single phase flows these models are usually not adequate to consider the discontinuity of physics near the free surface and create excessive and nonphysical turbulent eddy viscosity which leads to the wave damping this problem is often severe in a wave structure interaction problem without forward speed since the turbulent viscosity always remains in the computational domain fig 20 shows the turbulent viscosity ν t at t 1 t and t 15 t in the simulation with the rz method after one wave periods the turbulent viscosity appears not only close to structure but also in the far field the far field turbulence is created near the free surface which is shown as a white line due to the interface discontinuity the maximum ν t has an order of 10 3 m 2 s at t 1 8 s at the end of the simulation the turbulent viscosity has a much larger value order of 10 1 m 2 s due to the accumulation and appears in a larger zone the result of the swense method is not affected by this problem despite using the same turbulence model the wave force amplitudes are maintained constant even after a long simulation time this has to be credited to the potential viscous coupling used in swense method so that the viscous effects is only applied to the complementary field and does not affect the incident waves 5 conclusion the present work compared three wave modeling methods in two phase cfd solvers the iwg method in isis cfd the rz method and the swense method in foamstar the accuracy and the performance of these methods are compared by simulating a fixed calm buoy in regular waves and compared with experiments on the accuracy side all the three methods are able to achieve accurate comparison with the experiment when the mesh is fine enough to propagate the incident waves accurately compared to the swense method in foamstar the iwg method in isis cfd and the rz method in foamstar show more dependency on fine meshes to obtain accurate results only the swense method in foamstar still obtain good results with coarse far field mesh on the performance side the swense method in foamstar is the most efficient it is able to achieve a significant gain in efficiency with a tiny concession on the accuracy by using coarse mesh in the far field for a same level of accuracy the swense method requires only about 25 cells compared to the rz method with both methods implemented in openfoam the diffraction absorption condition prevents better wave reflection than the full absorption condition the rz and the swense method in foamstar using the diffraction absorption condition are able to prevent reflections at all the domain boundaries and thus provide more stable result and longer time window for the data analysis the full absorption method damping used by the iwg method in isis cfd and the experiment creates larger reflection at the outlet and is inapplicable for side wall absorption using forcing zones is able to achieve the diffraction absorption condition in the iwg method a last remark shows the k ω sst turbulence model is not adapted for two phase flow simulation in standard ranse solvers since it causes excessive numerical damping of incident waves the use of the potential viscous coupling method as the swense method is able to alleviate this problem and maintain good simulation results for longer simulation time acknowledgments this work has been performed in the framework of the chaire hydrodynamique et structure marines centrale nantes bureau

22546,the progress in drive technology and the increasing needs for compact ship propulsion systems has brought a new class of hubless propellers into the field of operation so far no detailed analyses have been done concerning the unsteady flow structures which are important for the hydroacoustic emission the objective of this paper is to analyze the unsteady flow topology and the related hydroacoustic emission of a hubless propeller with numerical and experimental methods in order to capture the unsteady wake flow structures a stress blended eddy simulation sbes has been done experimental investigations in a circulating water channel provided the validation data in terms of integral quantities like thrust wall pressure fluctuation and the hydroacoustic noise emission the wake flow can be characterized by a multi helix vortex system which develops from the blade root and tip region as well as from the trailing edge the transition length of the helixes is larger compared to hub propellers in conjunction with an accelerated dissipation the application of the proper orthogonal decomposition pod onto the unsteady wall pressure fields obtained from the sbes simulation was capable to assign different flow structures to the measured hydroacoustic emissions keywords rim drive vortex structures underwater noise proper orthogonal decomposition hybrid large eddy simulation 1 introduction during the past decades hubless propellers have been established in the marine industry for dynamic positioning tasks as bow thrusters and as main propulsion systems for midsize ships as well as auv s or rov s according to hsieh and chen 2007 and holt and white 1994 besides conventional drives the hubless design is also used for shaft less pumps as examined by schmirler and netrebska 2017 it is expected that different vortex structures will arise in the wake flow compared to hub propellers due to the inwardly pointing blades previous investigations on hubless propellers have primarily dealt with the design process and analysis of the resulting open water characteristics yakovlev and sokolov 2011 presented the design procedure of a hubless propeller and the hydrodynamic differences between the hub and hubless design in terms of the open water characteristic and wall shear stresses the differences in the open water characteristics between both propeller variants lie within the range of the measurement uncertainty though the pressure head losses were reduced in the case of the hubless propeller due to the equalization of the flow field in front of the propeller disk it was further assumed that the emission of hydroacoustic noise should be reduced as well the investigations of wei song et al 2015 dealt with the comparison of the hubless and hub propeller design based on cfd simulations the results of the frozen rotor simulations were used to compare the open water characteristic and to analyze the velocity and pressure field distribution of the propeller flow in contrast to yakovlev and sokolov 2011 a slightly higher efficiency was detected for the hubless variant further investigations of hubless propellers can be found in amminikutty and subramanian 2006 dubas et al 2011 dubas et al 2015 freeman and marshall 2011 qing ming et al 2012 and shuai et al 2013 an overview of the development of hubless propellers can be found in the work of yan et al 2017 yet detailed analyses of the unsteady flow structures in the wake of a hubless propeller and their relationship to the hydroacoustic noise emission have not been done so far in contrast extensive numerical and experimental investigations on the unsteady wake flow characteristics of hub propellers have been done by felli et al 2011 and muscari and mascio 2013 the work of felli et al 2011 focuses on the description of the development and instability processes of the tip and hub vortex with experimental methods muscari and mascio 2013 uses the same propeller to investigate the capabilities of detached eddy simulation des and urans simulation methods to describe the different effects in the wake flow the used des approach was capable of predicting the development of the wake flow with all experimentally observed features over long distances the more dissipative urans method was capable of predicting integral quantities very precisely but failed to predict the unsteady vortex formations in the wake in general investigations of unsteady flow field phenomena are essential for a better understanding of dynamic processes like the emission of hydroacoustic noise or the excitation of vibrations of the ship structure in the current study a further development of the des the stress blended eddy simulation sbes according to menter and ansys germany gmbh 2016 has been used to simulate the unsteady wake flow of a hubless propeller wherein the open water characteristic of the propeller was computed with a urans model the in depth analysis of the wake flow structures was done with the proper orthogonal decomposition method pod which was applied to the transient pressure and velocity fields from the des the separation of different coherent flow structures which are superimposed in the turbulent flow field is an advantage of the pod the pod was capable of assigning different coherent flow structures to pronounced frequency peaks in the wall pressure and hydroacoustic spectra which were obtained from experiments in a circulating water channel measurements of the thrust at various advance coefficients were done to provide additional validation data for the numerical simulations 2 experimental setup experiments were carried out in a circulating water channel in order to validate the simulations thrust flow velocity wall pressure fluctuations and the hydroacoustic pressure emitted by the hubless propeller system were recorded during the experiment in the context of the upcoming sections the measurement setup and the procedure of the experiment will be explained in detail 2 1 measurement the experiments were carried out in a 19 7 6 2 m circulating water channel with a capacity of 200 m 3 which belongs to an industrial partner the open measurement section in the circulating water channel has a volume of 2 2 m 1 1 m 7 m the flow velocity in the tank can be accelerated up to 4 5 m s and is driven by a propeller installed in the lower tank compartment visual accessibility is given by windows from the side of the measurement section 2 2 hubless propeller design fig 1 shows the hubless propeller the four symmetrical rotor blades were designed on the basis of the naca 16 modified profile the blade leading edge part has been mirrored at 50 of the chord length fig 3 shows the distribution of the length ratio l d the thickness ratio s l and the pitch angle α of the propeller blades along the radial direction the individual blade profiles are twisted around the middle axis along r r subsequently the hubless propeller can be operated in clockwise and counter clockwise direction the hydrofoil of the duct cf fig 2 has been optimized using an iterative procedure based on a droplet profile until no separation in the area of the duct outlet occur the length ratio of the duct profile is l d 2 1 the hubless propeller is powered by a 48 v dc motor and controlled by a frequency inverter via labview additional sensors along the ring motor detect the rotational speed of the propeller maximum thrust is about 80 n at a maximum rotational speed of 1600 rpm specific details of the examined propeller can be found in table 1 2 3 measurement configuration fig 4 shows the measurement configuration additionally the support structure is covered by a drop profile to minimize the hydrodynamic load and to prevent a flow separation which would cause pressure fluctuations the thrust is captured along the upper end of the support structure by means of coupled load cells furthermore the flow velocity was measured using an annubar probe at a distance of x r 19 behind the propeller disk the acoustic measurements were done according to ittc 2014 the hydrophone brüel kjaer type 8103 was placed at an axial distance of x r 39 downstream of the propeller disk and at a radial position of z r 8 5 measured from the rotation axis such that the measurements are not disturbed by the wake flow of the propeller a cover to protect the hydrophone against the background flow was not necessary because the hydroacoustic measurements were carried out under static thrust conditions high loaded the reynolds number for static thrust j 0 at a rotational speed of n 16 9 s 1 is r e 5 31 1 0 5 with respect to the circumferential velocity u ω r and the rotor diameter furthermore the wall pressure fluctuations were measured at the interior duct wall with a dynamic pressure sensor pcb s112a22 placed at x r 0 7 at the propeller pressure side fig 5 brüel kjaer s lan xi system was used for signal conditioning and data acquisition sampling rate was chosen to be f s a m p l i n g 65 5 khz ensuring that all relevant hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic effects are captured with a proper time respectively frequency resolution the measurements were performed for various advance coefficients 1 j v a n d with the advance speed v a the diameter d and the propeller speed n the calculation of the efficiency for a ducted propeller 2 η i d 1 1 c t 4 v a u x was done according to kornev 2009 with the thrust coefficient c t and the ratio between the progress speed v a and the axial propeller velocity u x the thrust coefficient 3 c t 2 t t d ρ a 0 v a 2 was calculated with the thrust of the duct t d and the propeller t as well as the propeller disk area a 0 3 numerical approach verification and analysis methods 3 1 numerical model the used numerical methods were chosen according to the specific needs of the simulation type and the quantities which were extracted from the simulations a standard k ω sst urans model was used for the various simulations to compute general integral quantities like the open water characteristic thrust and efficiency of the hubless propeller in general urans models are to dissipative for studies concerning the evaluation of unsteady flow structures but the prediction of integral quantities can be still accurate therefore the urans results will be included in this studies to provide information of the hubless propeller performance over a broad advance coefficient range a grid independence study was done for this numerical setup to ensure that the solution had converged a cfd method with scale resolving capabilities is necessary in order to compute the transient hydrodynamic processes within the wake flow of the hubless propeller which are important for the emission of noise the direct numerical simulation dns les or even des are appropriate methods which fulfills these claims due to the high reynolds number of the current setup and the very high mesh requirements within the boundary layers for a les simulation the des sbes method was chosen for this study the sbes menter and ansys germany gmbh 2016 spalart 2009 is an improved formulation of the shielded detached eddy simulation sdes which uses the des shielding function f s to distinguish between regions in the flow field where the les or the urans model should be active respectively furthermore the sbes provides an asymptotic shielding behavior of the boundary layers to ensure that the model will stay in the urans mode to prevent grid induced flow separations a rapid transition behavior between urans and les model part is provided by the sbes outside of the wall boundary layers the shear stress tensor 4 τ i j s b e s f s τ i j r a n s 1 f s τ i j l e s is composed of the shares of the urans and les model wherein the shielding function f s determines the transition between both models the total turbulent kinetic energy tke can be computed according to 5 k t o t k s g s k s s t k r e s with the modeled tke of urans k s s t and les k s g s thus the resolved tke 6 k r e s 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 is also affected by the individual shares of both models the calculation of the modeled tke for the les is realized as 7 k s g s ν s g s c ν δ 2 with the subgrid scale viscosity ν s g s the lattice width δ and a constant c ν 0 165 the influence of the not resolved turbulent flow structures was treated using the standard smagorinsky subgrid scale model within the les region the solution of the k equation of the urans model is used for the calculation of k s s t advection and diffusion fluxes in the governing equations were discretized using a bounded central differencing scheme bcds which is second order an implicit second order differencing scheme was used for the discretization of the transient term the full hydrodynamic system of equations is solved simultaneously in an implicit manner an acceleration of the solution is achieved by solving the equations in an agglomeration based multigrid framework the convergence limit of the solution process was set to 10 4 for rms residuals which is a good compromise between computational speed and accuracy this limit was carefully chosen and ensures that the mean value of the field quantities recorded at certain grid points was converged as well a sketch of the entire cfd domain with the main dimensions is shown in fig 6 boundary conditions for the inlet and outlet as well as for the circumferential outer domain surface were set as opening for the simulation case with an advance coefficient of j 0 the relative total pressure respectively static pressure was set to zero for opening boundary condition surfaces the total pressure condition is used for a flow direction into the cfd domain and the static pressure condition for a flow direction out of the domain in general this boundary conditions is preferable when the velocity field is unknown at the domain boundaries and therefore part of the solution process the advance speed v a and a zero gradient condition for the static pressure was set for all urans simulation for j 0 the static pressure was set to zero for these cases at the domain outlet all walls were treated as smooth walls wherein the velocity components were set to zero and a vanishing wall normal gradient was used as pressure boundary condition the turbulence intensity was set to zero at the domain inlet for j 0 because the outer fluid is at rest in some distance to the propeller and will be sucked into it only in the vicinity thus the turbulent kinetic energy k is zero and all other turbulence quantities are part of the solution and a zero gradient boundary condition is applied at the domain inlet the turbulent kinetic energy k was explicitly defined at the inlet domain for cases j 0 zero gradient boundary conditions are applied for the turbulence quantities at the outlet and the circumferential outer surface of the domain the mesh resolution close to the wall was appropriate to achieve y 2 for the des sbes and y 5 for the urans which ensures a direct resolution of the viscous boundary sublayer thus no wall function approach was incorporated in the solution process this implies that k ε or ω are part of the solution process and internally treated with a zero gradient wall boundary condition the urans and des sbes calculations were done in ansys cfx 19 1 3 2 numerical mesh a block structured 3d hexahedral grid of the hubless propeller model was created for the cfd simulations in compliance with the criteria given in menter s best practice guide 2015 menter nov 2015 for scale resolving simulations based on the individual requirements of the urans and des sbes models grids were created with 5 20 m urans and 33 m des sbes cells the achieved wall resolution for the des sbes was checked in terms of the y values in various test runs and adapted until y dropped below 2 in the entire cfd domain the mesh aspect ratio is smaller than 20 for 90 of all cells and smaller than 60 for 95 the angle of the cells is at least about 27 and between 36 and 90 for more than 90 of all cells further the volume change is between 1 and 2 for 98 of the mesh cells and does not exceed 10 within the whole domain fig 7 shows the structure of the mesh for the sake of clarity a coarse mesh with 8 m nodes was chosen for the presentation of the fundamental mesh topology it can be seen that the domain is divided into three sections at the borders of these sections the mesh is split in the x direction so that hanging nodes are created red lines which offers the advantage of maintaining the quality criteria in the whole domain without exceeding an acceptable numbers of cells in order to select an appropriate mesh for the urans simulations a grid independence study is necessary the grid convergence index gci was calculated according to roache 1994 five different grids were created and calculated using the k ω sst model table 2 shows an overview of the created grids in fig 8 the resulting asymptotic behavior of the gci can be seen the ordinate axis was normalized to the extrapolated values so that differences between the individual grids can be specified in proportion the abscissa shows the average grid width of the individual simulations with the high resolution grid on the left side of the diagram based on the mesh study shown in fig 8 a fairly converged solution for the axial velocity is achieved for the 20 m cell mesh which was chosen for the calculation of the open water characteristic with the urans model the sbes des simulation was run for the static thrust case at j 0 for which the hydroacoustic measurements were carried out during the water channel experiments the results of a urans simulation at j 0 were used as initial conditions for the sbes des 3 3 power loss analysis the quality of the des sbes is attributed to the numerical and model related accuracies both accuracies depend on the resolution of the grid which is used to solve the governing equations celik et al march 2009 an inherent energy analysis was applied to verify the achieved model quality of the computed flow field the pla by torner et al 2018 compares the global losses to the losses within the flow field the global losses are calculated at the boundaries of the computational domain whereas the losses within the flow field are calculated from the dissipation both losses have to be equal from the theoretical standpoint thus the pla quantifies the inherent accuracy of the used cfd model based on the input p b l a d e s m ω and output power δ p f l u i d δ p t o t q within the hubless propeller duct the power loss p l o s s 1 can be defined according to eq 8 8 p l o s s 1 p b l a d e s δ p f l u i d m b l a d e s ω a δ p t o t q the flow loss in eq 8 has to be equal to the dissipation integrated over the computational domain of the duct three different dissipation terms the direct p d i r the resolved turbulent p t u r b r e s and the modeled turbulent dissipation p t u r b m o d can be calculated from the flow field quantities the direct dissipation relies on the gradients of the time averaged velocity field cf eq 9 the resolved turbulent dissipation eq 10 incorporates with the directly resolved fluctuations in the velocity field the modeled turbulent dissipation eq 11 is computed via the turbulent viscosity ν t and the unsteady velocity gradients in the flow field due to the hybrid approach the modeled turbulent dissipation of the des sbes consists of an les and a urans part 9 p d i r ρ v ν u i x j u i x j u j x i d v 10 p t u r b r e s ρ v ν u i x j u i x j u j x i d v 11 p t u r b m o d ρ v ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i d v the power loss p l o s s 2 can finally be written as the sum of the individual dissipation terms from eqs 9 11 12 p l o s s 2 p d i r p t u r b r e s p t u r b m o d s s t p t u r b m o d l e s the terms p l o s s 1 and p l o s s 2 should be approximately equal because they describe the same physical process the remaining dissipation of the numerical simulation is attributed to the numerical and the modeling accuracies the results of the pla for the des sbes can be seen in table 3 the deviation of the total power loss terms p l o s s 1 and p l o s s 2 for the des sbes with 33m cells is 5 5 which is in an acceptable range according to torner et al 2018 additionally the des sbes were performed with 8m and 20m cells to demonstrate the increase in model quality with respect to the loss the direct the turbulent resolved and the modeled dissipation of the les increase hence the turbulent flow within the observed domain is capable of representing the total losses 3 4 proper orthogonal decomposition the wake flow of the hubless propeller is superimposed with different coherent and incoherent turbulent flow structures in the most cases the coherent parts of the fluctuation patterns in the velocity or pressure field are characterized by specific distinguished frequencies in contrast the incoherent part characterizes the irregular and chaotic fluctuations in the turbulent flow field such that no discrete frequencies can be assigned to these motion patterns the proper orthogonal decomposition pod is capable of separating the coherent and incoherent fluctuations in the velocity or pressure field from each other frederich et al 2011 witte et al 2018 in the following section only a brief description of the pod method will be given detailed information can be obtained from lumley et al 1967 lumley 1981 sirovich 1987 1989 1990 holmes et al 1990 holmes et al 1990 and berkooz et al 1993 the pod decomposes the field quantity ϕ which can be a tensor of any order 13 ϕ x t i ϕ ϕ ϕ k 1 k m k x a k t i i k 1 2 k into a set of orthogonal modes m k and time coefficients a k the computation of the pod modes and time coefficients relies on the solution of the eigenvalue problem based on the temporal correlation matrix c k l 14 c k l λ k δ k l b k 0 15 c k l 1 k v ϕ x t k ϕ x t l d v 16 m k 1 k λ k i 1 k b k t i ϕ x t i i 1 2 k 17 a k t i b k t i k λ k the computation of the pod time coefficients can be done according to eqs 16 and 17 once the eigenvalues λ k and eigenvectors b k are known the identification of coherent flow structures can be carried out using the eigenvalues time coefficients and mode shapes a convective coherent flow structure can be described by at least two pod modes frederich et al 2011 with nearly identical eigenvalues furthermore the pod time coefficients should ideally be characterized by a single pronounced frequency and the pod mode field distribution should show a clear spatial periodicity this description of a coherent structure is in accordance to the definition given by hussain 1983 as a large scale turbulent fluid mass with a phase correlated vorticity over its spatial extent 4 results the results of the measurements are presented in the following section the propeller thrust the axial flow velocity the wall pressure fluctuations and the acoustic pressure were recorded during the measurements table 4 summarizes the results of the measured open water characteristics for the advance coefficients j 0 43 0 53 0 71 with the respective absolute error limits urans simulations were performed for different advance coefficients and the results for efficiency and thrust were compared with the measurement results fig 9 shows the efficiency and the thrust coefficients of the measurements and simulations according to the equations in section 2 3 the des sbes was done for static thrust conditions j 0 so that the hydrophone is not disturbed by the background flow the measured thrust for this condition is t 30 7 0 4 n and the prediction of the sbes is t 31 6 n which is a deviation of 2 8 in contrast to the sbes the urans simulation predicts a thrust of 31 9n which corresponds to a deviation of about 3 9 the following section will focus on the evaluation of the des sbes for j 0 for which the hydroacoustic measurements were performed 4 1 measurement of wall pressure fluctuation and acoustic emission parallel to the open water characteristics the wall pressure fluctuations and hydroacoustic emissions where measured under static thrust conditions j 0 this allows for an acoustic measurement without disturbances from the background flow in the water channel fig 10 shows the spectra obtained from the dynamic wall pressure and hydrophone measurements the frequency axis is normalized with the rotational speed n the reference acoustic pressure for water is p r e f 1 0 6 pa and the wall pressure data were normalized with p d r e f ω r 2 ρ 2 besides the different orders of the blade passing frequency bpf further components in the spectrum which are related to specific parts of the electrical drive such as the number of magnets 12 and coils 8 are clearly visible an increase of the 6th bpf and its higher harmonics at f n 48 72 is the result of these interactions additionally the cross power spectrum 18 s p p d y n p f p f was calculated in order to bring out the similarities between the wall pressure fluctuations p and the emitted acoustic noise cf p fig 11 the detailed comparison of the cross power spectra in fig 11 shows a good correlation between the wall pressure fluctuations and the hydroacoustic noise emission it is obvious that the amplitudes at the dominant frequencies in the shown spectra are superimposed by hydrodynamic effects as well as effects due to the specific characteristics of the electrical drive itself further the relationship between the hydrodynamic effects in the flow field and the acoustic noise spectrum which were obtained from the measurements can additionally be captured by the des sbes 4 2 simulation results this section presents the results of the simulation with the focus placed on the analysis of the unsteady flow and pressure fields for this purpose the spectrum of the wall pressure measurement will be compared with the spectrum of the simulation the origin of the pressure excitation will be examined more closely with the analysis of the wall shear stresses the application of vortex identification criteria and the pod method to find the source for specific tonalities in the acoustic noise spectrum 4 3 analysis of wall pressure fluctuation fig 12 shows the normalized frequency spectrum of the wall pressure fluctuations from the des sbes and the measurement recorded at the same position the different orders of the bpf dominate the whole spectrum and can be inspected up to the 40th order additionally higher amplitudes can be observed at some frequencies besides the bpf orders which is the case for f n 6 5 10 5 and f n 30 obviously these frequency components cannot be assigned to the bpf orders but to other phenomena in the flow field and were also observed in the hydroacoustic measurement cf fig 10 again the numerical simulation can capture hydrodynamic effects only for example structural vibrations of the propeller system which are excited by magnetic force components related to the coil or magnet pole number e g the 6th and 12th bpf cannot be accounted for in the following section the wake flow will be examined in detail and the dominant flow structures will be assigned to the respective frequencies of the wall pressure fluctuations the flow structures of the hubless propeller will be phenomenologically compared with those of hub propellers 4 4 analysis of the wake flow field the turbulent wake flow of the propeller is dominated by periodic vortex structures which develop from the blade root the tip and trailing edge to provide an overview of the turbulent wake flow hunt s q criterion is shown in fig 13 q is defined as q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 ω and s are the skew symmetric and symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor q computes the difference between the rotation and strain rate and can be therefore interpreted as the excess of rotation compared with the strain thus it defines the strength of rotation of a vortical structure besides different chaotic vortex structures fig 13 top a horseshoe vortex solid and dashed line fig 13 bottom along the blade roots can be observed the horseshoe vortex dissipates at about x r 2 within the duct and is no longer visible in the wake the computed q iso surfaces at q n 2 19 were clipped along different r r fig 14 to enhance the visibility of the different vortex structures in the wake flow in fig 14 a the q iso surface was clipped for r r 0 9 to enable the observation of a complex multi helix vortex system which originates from the blade tip region especially the trailing edge flow is affected by the boundary layer separation on the profile suction side causes the development of a vortex street cf figs 15 and 14 a a leading edge separation and turbulent re attachment can be seen on the suction side before the flow finally separates close to the trailing edge the flow separation lines in fig 15 were extracted as a ridge or convergence line from the wall shear stress field furthermore the boundary layer separates on the pressure side very close to the trailing edge as well both effects causes the development of the mentioned trailing edge vortex street cf figs 14 and 16 the flow separation itself originates from the high angle of attack of the blade which is essential for thrust generation with a symmetrical profile in fig 16 a close up view of the blade tip region is shown three different vortical structures are recognizable one tip vortex i develops at the inner blade radius as expected but dissipates shortly after its formation the early dissipation of this tip vortex might be attributed to the relatively strong radial gradient of the axial velocity component in that region cf 21 a plausible explanation could be that the strong radial gradient of the axial velocity will initiate a vortex stretching or deformation mechanism which will increase the dissipation process the second tip vortex i i develops from a position closer to the blade tip in its initial development stage it is strongly affected by the vortex street behind the trailing edge the third structure in fig 16 is the trailing edge vortex street i i i the structure of the vortices close to the trailing edge is pretty similar to the classical von kàrmàn vortex street the axis of the shedding vortices are aligned with the trailing edge itself shortly after a re orientation process is initiated wherein the vortex axis are tilted into the mean flow direction thus the outer part of the helix structure is formed the second tip vortex develops into the inner and the trailing edge vortex street into the outer part of the multi helix system in fig 14 a the outer part of the helix system is shown on its own in fig 14 b and the inner core of it in fig 14 c the wavelength of the helix system reduces continuously and the spatial extension in radial direction increases because the convective flow velocity decreases due to the expansion of the propeller jet flow via entrainment processes the dissipation process is initiated by some first flow instabilities starting at x r 2 5 within the inner helix system which causes a bumpy appearance in the visualization with the q criterion at x r 3 5 the inner helix collapses and disappears instabilities of the outer helix system start at x r 3 and cause the disintegration at x r 4 5 cf fig 14 in fig 17 the q criterion are represented over different y z sectional planes in the propeller wake both the tip vortex i i and the trailing edge vortex street i i i which later develops into the outer part of the helix system are tracked along its axial path it can be seen how the multi helix system expands in radial direction during convection the flow structure widens further up to x r 4 and subsequently becomes unstable with the collapse being mostly completed at x r 4 5 the frontal view shows that the individual helix structures do not run synchronously because of the gradient of the circumferential speed in radial direction and the different spatial wavelengths in x direction the inner helix vortex overtakes its outer counterpart because of the lower spatial wavelength cf also fig 18 top in addition the vorticity ω z is shown in fig 18 bottom to provide information about the rotation direction of the different vortical structures the vortex shedding from the trailing edge i i i can be clearly inspected by the periodical change of the sign in the ω z distribution and is present up to x r 1 5 due to the difficult definition and different interpretation by researchers of what a coherent structure is the shown vortex patterns or multi helix system i i i and i i i can be interpreted at least as one single dominant coherent flow structure in the wake of the hubless propeller or even as three independent structures at the end the shown structures representing a state of equilibrium as a result of different interaction processes in the wake flow the described pod procedure is capable to extract these structures with respect to the overall fluctuation energy in terms of pod modes and time coefficients the most energetic modes will represent the helix system i i i and i i i wherein higher pod modes will represent superimposed small scale fluctuation patterns these higher pod modes can be periodic in time and space itself and therefore representing superimposed coherent substructures this is some kind of an cascade process going down from large to small scale fluctuation patterns respectively coherent structures the capabilities of the pod will be demonstrated in terms of the decomposition of the wall pressure fields in section 4 5 according to felli et al 2011 a four blade hub propeller tip vortex decays at about x r 0 6 under static thrust conditions and the blade hub vortex decays at x r 1 in comparison to the investigations by felli et al on hub propellers the transition length of the blade tip vortices of the hubless propeller is significantly larger the different instability mechanisms of interacting helix structures investigated by widnall 1972 saffman 1970 lugt 1996 and felli et al 2011 are superimposed in general which makes it difficult to clearly distinguish them from each other in the current case at least so called short wave instabilities are recognizable which cause a bumpy deformation of the inner and outer helix vortex shortly before their disintegration the wake destabilization process and the dissipation of the inner and outer part of the helix systems happens very rapidly compared with investigated cases for hub propellers of felli that might be attributed to the fact that the entire wake flow in the current case is significantly different compared to those of hub propellers first the two helix systems are close compared to the tip vortices of hub propellers thus a boosted mutual induction process might be present secondly the radial gradient of the axial velocity is more pronounced compared with hub propellers especially in the range between r r 0 3 r r 1 2 which will amplify vortex stretching mechanisms third the influence of the duct have to be considered which will also introduce additional disturbances in the flow field compared to hub propellers so far the flow respectively vortex structures have been described phenomenologically in terms of hunt s q criterion as a consequence of the different interacting processes a pronounced amount of turbulent kinetic energy is produced in the wake in fig 19 the modeled distribution of the instantaneous tke computed by the urans and les part of the des sbes model as well as the directly resolved tke are shown the typical patterns of the wake flow structures which were already visualized by the q criterion are clearly visible in both modeled tke fields the subgrid scale fluctuations of the les part of the sbes model causes mostly high tke values in the vicinity of the inner and outer helix vortex which can by observed as discrete dot areas high tke values from the les model part can be also observed close to the duct surface the high velocity gradients close to the wall in that area acting like a trigger to increase the velocity fluctuations and therefore ramping up the tke the modeled tke from the k ω sst part of the sbes has a much smoother appearance and could be interpreted like a screwed region of high tke values probably this pattern in the tke distribution is originated from the trailing edge vortex street cf fig 19 the highest share of tke is provided by the direct resolved fluctuations in the velocity field which is another indicator the mesh resolution was chosen properly the distribution of the tke over the radius coordinate for different x r are shown in fig 20 the highest tke values can be found in the region of the inner duct wall for x r 1 and x r 2 the slight decrease in the tke for x r 2 compared with x r 1 might be caused by the increase of the duct diameter which will reduce the mean axial velocity as well as the velocity fluctuation the mean axial velocity distribution for different x r is shown for comparisons in fig 21 increasing tke values can be observed again starting at the duct exit wherein the interaction between the fluid at rest in the outer domain region and the wake flow causing strong velocity gradients the general distribution of the axial velocity in fig 21 inside the duct shows significant smaller amplitudes close to the rotation axis the maximum axial velocity for x r 1 is about u u r e f 0 52 at a radial position r r 0 85 the ratio between the minimum and maximum axial velocity for x r 2 is 0 46 which is significant higher compared with hub propellers according to hamill and kee 2016 the relatively high axial velocity close to the blade root at r r 1 in combination with the maximum circumferential speed and the horseshoe vortex is a critical region for static pressure reduction and cavitation initiation for hubless propellers the cavitation number σ p p v 1 2 ρ u 2 computed from the time averaged flow field quantities of the sbes is shown in fig 22 and reveals that in the current case cavitation has not to be considered in general the risk for tip cavitation is always reduced for hubless propellers compared with the hub counterpart due to the very small circumferential and axial velocities cf fig 21 anyway it always depends on the actual design of the hubless propeller whether or not cavitation can occur in general a high thrust coefficient c t makes any propeller prone for cavitation issues in the case of the hubless propellers chances are high that cavitation will be initiated at the blade root region 4 5 pod analysis of the wall pressure field and the relationship to the hydroacoustic emission the specific characteristics of the hubless propeller wake flow as well as the results from the measurement campaign were discussed independently from each other in the previous section the relationship between the coherent structures of the flow field and the noise emission will be discussed now in terms of a pod analysis of the wall pressure fluctuations the unsteady wall pressure fields from the des sbes were recorded for 3 complete revolutions of the hubless propeller which corresponds to 2160 time steps in total for this the wall pressure data on stationary mesh parts of the kort duct as well as on the rotating mesh parts were used once the eigenvalue decomposition of the pod correlation matrix was performed the spectra of the time coefficients were computed and analyzed respectively used to identify pod modes with pronounced discrete frequency components cf fig 23 the sum of the pod eigenvalues is equal to the trace of the correlation matrix therefore the eigenvalue represents the fluctuation energy per mode of the decomposed field quantity the distribution of the pod eigenvalues is shown in fig 24 the eigenvalues of the first two pod wall pressure mode have a share of 75 of the overall fluctuation energy the share drops to 4 2 for the third and fourth pod mode and is below 1 for the seventh mode and the following ones in general these higher order pressure fluctuations are of minor importance for pure hydrodynamic problems but for application where the acoustic is in the focus they are essential astonishingly a close inspection of the pod wall pressure eigenvalue spectrum reveals that the decay of the wall pressure fluctuation energy is 0 9 in the doubled logarithmic chart this result is in accordance with the decay of the power spectrum obtained by felli et al for the radial velocity component an explanation might be that the radial velocity component will be mostly affect the wall pressure field thus the same behavior can be observed despite the fact that a completely different analysis techniques were used the shown pod pressure modes and time coefficients in this section have a corresponding counterpart with a phase shift of 90 both the spatial pattern of the pod pressure mode field and the spectrum of the assigned pod time coefficient are equal apart from the phase shift thus these pod modes correspond to convective coherent structures in the flow field in fig 25 the pod pressure mode field distributions are shown the time coefficients are assigned to the first second third and sixth order of the bpf respectively the sixth order of the bpf was additionally chosen for the representation in this row because the highest hydroacoustic noise emission was measured at this frequency in the experimental investigations a periodic pattern in the pod pressure mode field distribution can be seen in all four cases in accordance with the successively higher dominant frequency component in the corresponding pod time coefficients the spatial wavelength is consequently reduced between the individual cases in general the observed pattern in the pod pressure mode field distribution reflects the interaction of the propeller blades with the walls of the kort duct causing fluctuations in the wall pressure field at the bpf orders the distribution of the pod pressure modes in the kort duct inlet region is very smooth and free of any disturbances the sloped pattern in the pod pressure mode field behind the propeller disk can furthermore be attributed to the horseshoe vortices in the root region of the individual blades in contrast to the inlet region the pattern is not that smooth and already affected by the turbulence of the wake flow additionally some short wave disturbances can be observed in the inlet of the kort duct for pod pressure mode 7 which corresponds to f n 12 this tendency increases continuously for even higher pod modes which are related to the bpf orders remarkably only minor pressure fluctuations on the propeller blade itself can be observed for the shown pod mode distributions in fig 25 pod pressure modes with a clear periodicity can be identified up to the 6th order of the bpf which was proven by a spectral analysis of the corresponding time coefficients according to fig 11 these discrete frequencies were identified by the experimental wall pressure and hydrophone measurements too the identified pod mode pairs can be interpreted as coherent flow structures with respect to the definition of hussain 1983 though only the wall pressure field was decomposed other specific effects in the flow field which are not correlated with the orders of the bpf were identified by the pod as well the time coefficient of pod mode 5 is assigned to f n 10 5 which is not related to the blade numbers and therefor related to another specific effect in the flow field the corresponding pod wall pressure field is shown in fig 26 it is obvious that the highest fluctuations in the wall pressure field are in effect at the inlet region of the kort duct cf fig 27 a close inspection of the flow field at the inlet edge of the kort duct reveals that a small separation separation bubble of the boundary layer takes places shortly after the boundary layer reattaches but nevertheless the fluctuations in the pressure field progress up to the propeller disk region and affecting the wake flow as well furthermore the spectrum of the pod time coefficient shows an additional small amplitude peak at f n 12 fig 29 which might indicate that a feedback loop exists wherein the interaction of the rotor blades with the flow field amplifies the pressure fluctuations due to the inlet edge separation in the kort duct both the spectrum of the measured wall pressure as well as the spectrum of the emitted hydroacoustic noise show this specific frequency component which is an indication that the des sbes is capable of detecting those sensitive effects in the flow field cf figs 29 and 11 the spectra in fig 11 shows several additional frequency peaks which cannot be assigned to the orders of the bpf a leading edge separation on the blade suction side was discussed in the previous result section in terms of the assigned flow topology but not in terms of its temporal dynamics this phenomenon was captured by the pod pressure mode 33 with a dominant frequency of f n 30 in the spectrum of the corresponding time coefficient as well cf figs 30 and 28 d this phenomenon was furthermore identified and investigated with the pod decomposition of the pressure field recorded on a cylindrical cut plane at r r 0 5 during the des sbes simulation cf fig 31 the pressure mode field inside the computational domain is shown in fig 32 the fluctuations in the pressure field are initiated directly at the leading edge of the blade profile where the boundary layer separation is in effect the pressure fluctuations decrease further downstream before they increase again shortly before the trailing edge this behavior is in accordance with the results from the pod decomposition of the wall pressure field cf figs 32 and 28 d the influence of the other propeller blades can be seen in fig 32 too higher order disturbances in the flow field which are caused by the leading edge flow separation can be inspected in fig 33 for a dominant frequency of f n 60 both frequencies f n 30 and f n 60 are dominant components in the hydroacoustic noise and wall pressure spectrum obtained from the measurements according to the pod results tonal components in the measured hydroacoustic noise spectrum around f n 124 f n 143 and f n 155 can be attributed to high frequency oscillations of the pressure field directly at the leading edge of the blade the cause for these fluctuations can be attributed to a small recirculation bubble at the leading edge fig 34 shows the order spectrum of the acoustic measurement from f n 120 to f n 160 several peaks can be found in the hydroacoustic spectrum from the experiment and were identified by the pod as well indeed other effects related to higher orders of the bpf and internal components of the drive are present as well so far the relationship between specific effects in the flow field and the emission of hydroacoustic noise has only been discussed indirectly because no direct simulation of the sound field for example with the eif expansion about incompressible flow method shen and sorensen 1999 has been performed nevertheless the pod analysis of the wall pressure field was capable of separating different effects and even coherent flow structures in the flow field the characteristic frequencies of these structures were found in the spectral analysis of the various data obtained from the water channel experiments as well according to hardin and pope 1994 the identified wall pressure fluctuations dipole sources are one of the most important sources for the emission of noise in the upcoming investigations the eif procedure will be applied onto the fully transient 3d flow field data from the des sbes 5 conclusions and final remarks the investigation of the hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic properties of a hubless propeller was the scope of this present study therefor the open water characteristic was calculated with a k ω sst urans model and experimentally determined in a circulating water channel the results from a urans simulation for j 0 were furthermore used as initial conditions for a scale resolving des sbes to capture the unsteady wake flow in detail additional measurements of the wall pressure fluctuations and the emitted hydroacoustic noise were also used for the validation of the des sbes in addition a grid independence study gci for the urans simulation and a power loss analysis for the des sbes were done to certify that the chosen mesh was appropriate the analysis process of the experimental and simulation data relied on the evaluation of integral quantities order analysis of the wall pressure fluctuation and the hydroacoustic noise the wake flow topology was examined in terms of vortical structures visualized with iso surfaces of hunt s q criterion a proper orthogonal decomposition pod of the transient pressure field was done to identify different coherent structures in the wake flow and their temporal dynamics the pod results were also used to highlight the connection between the identified flow structures in the propeller wake and the corresponding components in the hydroacoustic noise spectrum the analysis of the wake flow revealed that a pronounced multi helix vortex system is present under static thrust conditions the inner helix vortex propagates from the blade tip region as a result of the pressure difference between the suction and pressure side of the blade the outer helix develops from the trailing edge vortex street the vortex axis is aligned with the trailing edge in its initial state further downstream close to the duct exit a re organization of the vortex street was observed ending up in the outer helix structure additionally a horseshoe vortex which develops from the blade root region was identified besides the multi helix structure observations of the temporal development of the wake flow from the des sbes revealed that the breakdown of the helix structures is initiated by short wave instabilities whereas the transition length is nearly doubled compared to hub propellers investigated by felli et al the assigned wall pressure fluctuations and the pressure fluctuations in the flow field which results from the superposition of all observed flow structures were investigated with the pod in detail the analysis of the pod time coefficients showed that dominant frequency components exist at different orders of the blade passing frequency bpf furthermore the time coefficients of some pod modes were characterized by frequency components which are not related to the bpf order numbers pod modes characterizing the trailing edge vortex street were assigned to a frequency of f n 30 the vortex shedding at the trailing edge is furthermore correlated with pressure fluctuations on the suction side of the blade close to the leading edge higher frequency components in the pod time coefficients at f n 155 143 and 124 were found for pod pressure modes whose highest amplitudes are located at the blade leading edge this is caused by a small recirculation bubble at the leading edge the flow separation in the duct inlet region was detected by the pod at f n 10 5 the pod pressure mode was characterized by a dominant pattern in the duct inlet and showed strong similarities with the pod mode distribution which was assigned to the 3rd bpf order this might indicate that a feedback loop exists wherein pressure fluctuation energy is transferred from the rotor to the duct inlet and vice versa even the flow separation itself might be triggered by the pressure pulsation of the rotor at 3rd bpf order the investigations of the hydroacoustic noise emission in a water channel revealed that dominant frequency components in the pressure field identified by the pod analysis and assigned to different specific effects in the flow field were included in the experimental data as well the usage of the pod methods for post processing purposes or as a smart filter is therefore quite worthwhile the application of the pod method onto the velocity and pressure field of the full cfd domain is planned for future activities to extract the global coherent structures in the wake flow a further aspect that is to be considered is the incorporation of the pod modes and time coefficients into numerical acoustic methods like the eif method to compute the acoustic emission and wave pattern of specific coherent flow structures

22546,the progress in drive technology and the increasing needs for compact ship propulsion systems has brought a new class of hubless propellers into the field of operation so far no detailed analyses have been done concerning the unsteady flow structures which are important for the hydroacoustic emission the objective of this paper is to analyze the unsteady flow topology and the related hydroacoustic emission of a hubless propeller with numerical and experimental methods in order to capture the unsteady wake flow structures a stress blended eddy simulation sbes has been done experimental investigations in a circulating water channel provided the validation data in terms of integral quantities like thrust wall pressure fluctuation and the hydroacoustic noise emission the wake flow can be characterized by a multi helix vortex system which develops from the blade root and tip region as well as from the trailing edge the transition length of the helixes is larger compared to hub propellers in conjunction with an accelerated dissipation the application of the proper orthogonal decomposition pod onto the unsteady wall pressure fields obtained from the sbes simulation was capable to assign different flow structures to the measured hydroacoustic emissions keywords rim drive vortex structures underwater noise proper orthogonal decomposition hybrid large eddy simulation 1 introduction during the past decades hubless propellers have been established in the marine industry for dynamic positioning tasks as bow thrusters and as main propulsion systems for midsize ships as well as auv s or rov s according to hsieh and chen 2007 and holt and white 1994 besides conventional drives the hubless design is also used for shaft less pumps as examined by schmirler and netrebska 2017 it is expected that different vortex structures will arise in the wake flow compared to hub propellers due to the inwardly pointing blades previous investigations on hubless propellers have primarily dealt with the design process and analysis of the resulting open water characteristics yakovlev and sokolov 2011 presented the design procedure of a hubless propeller and the hydrodynamic differences between the hub and hubless design in terms of the open water characteristic and wall shear stresses the differences in the open water characteristics between both propeller variants lie within the range of the measurement uncertainty though the pressure head losses were reduced in the case of the hubless propeller due to the equalization of the flow field in front of the propeller disk it was further assumed that the emission of hydroacoustic noise should be reduced as well the investigations of wei song et al 2015 dealt with the comparison of the hubless and hub propeller design based on cfd simulations the results of the frozen rotor simulations were used to compare the open water characteristic and to analyze the velocity and pressure field distribution of the propeller flow in contrast to yakovlev and sokolov 2011 a slightly higher efficiency was detected for the hubless variant further investigations of hubless propellers can be found in amminikutty and subramanian 2006 dubas et al 2011 dubas et al 2015 freeman and marshall 2011 qing ming et al 2012 and shuai et al 2013 an overview of the development of hubless propellers can be found in the work of yan et al 2017 yet detailed analyses of the unsteady flow structures in the wake of a hubless propeller and their relationship to the hydroacoustic noise emission have not been done so far in contrast extensive numerical and experimental investigations on the unsteady wake flow characteristics of hub propellers have been done by felli et al 2011 and muscari and mascio 2013 the work of felli et al 2011 focuses on the description of the development and instability processes of the tip and hub vortex with experimental methods muscari and mascio 2013 uses the same propeller to investigate the capabilities of detached eddy simulation des and urans simulation methods to describe the different effects in the wake flow the used des approach was capable of predicting the development of the wake flow with all experimentally observed features over long distances the more dissipative urans method was capable of predicting integral quantities very precisely but failed to predict the unsteady vortex formations in the wake in general investigations of unsteady flow field phenomena are essential for a better understanding of dynamic processes like the emission of hydroacoustic noise or the excitation of vibrations of the ship structure in the current study a further development of the des the stress blended eddy simulation sbes according to menter and ansys germany gmbh 2016 has been used to simulate the unsteady wake flow of a hubless propeller wherein the open water characteristic of the propeller was computed with a urans model the in depth analysis of the wake flow structures was done with the proper orthogonal decomposition method pod which was applied to the transient pressure and velocity fields from the des the separation of different coherent flow structures which are superimposed in the turbulent flow field is an advantage of the pod the pod was capable of assigning different coherent flow structures to pronounced frequency peaks in the wall pressure and hydroacoustic spectra which were obtained from experiments in a circulating water channel measurements of the thrust at various advance coefficients were done to provide additional validation data for the numerical simulations 2 experimental setup experiments were carried out in a circulating water channel in order to validate the simulations thrust flow velocity wall pressure fluctuations and the hydroacoustic pressure emitted by the hubless propeller system were recorded during the experiment in the context of the upcoming sections the measurement setup and the procedure of the experiment will be explained in detail 2 1 measurement the experiments were carried out in a 19 7 6 2 m circulating water channel with a capacity of 200 m 3 which belongs to an industrial partner the open measurement section in the circulating water channel has a volume of 2 2 m 1 1 m 7 m the flow velocity in the tank can be accelerated up to 4 5 m s and is driven by a propeller installed in the lower tank compartment visual accessibility is given by windows from the side of the measurement section 2 2 hubless propeller design fig 1 shows the hubless propeller the four symmetrical rotor blades were designed on the basis of the naca 16 modified profile the blade leading edge part has been mirrored at 50 of the chord length fig 3 shows the distribution of the length ratio l d the thickness ratio s l and the pitch angle α of the propeller blades along the radial direction the individual blade profiles are twisted around the middle axis along r r subsequently the hubless propeller can be operated in clockwise and counter clockwise direction the hydrofoil of the duct cf fig 2 has been optimized using an iterative procedure based on a droplet profile until no separation in the area of the duct outlet occur the length ratio of the duct profile is l d 2 1 the hubless propeller is powered by a 48 v dc motor and controlled by a frequency inverter via labview additional sensors along the ring motor detect the rotational speed of the propeller maximum thrust is about 80 n at a maximum rotational speed of 1600 rpm specific details of the examined propeller can be found in table 1 2 3 measurement configuration fig 4 shows the measurement configuration additionally the support structure is covered by a drop profile to minimize the hydrodynamic load and to prevent a flow separation which would cause pressure fluctuations the thrust is captured along the upper end of the support structure by means of coupled load cells furthermore the flow velocity was measured using an annubar probe at a distance of x r 19 behind the propeller disk the acoustic measurements were done according to ittc 2014 the hydrophone brüel kjaer type 8103 was placed at an axial distance of x r 39 downstream of the propeller disk and at a radial position of z r 8 5 measured from the rotation axis such that the measurements are not disturbed by the wake flow of the propeller a cover to protect the hydrophone against the background flow was not necessary because the hydroacoustic measurements were carried out under static thrust conditions high loaded the reynolds number for static thrust j 0 at a rotational speed of n 16 9 s 1 is r e 5 31 1 0 5 with respect to the circumferential velocity u ω r and the rotor diameter furthermore the wall pressure fluctuations were measured at the interior duct wall with a dynamic pressure sensor pcb s112a22 placed at x r 0 7 at the propeller pressure side fig 5 brüel kjaer s lan xi system was used for signal conditioning and data acquisition sampling rate was chosen to be f s a m p l i n g 65 5 khz ensuring that all relevant hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic effects are captured with a proper time respectively frequency resolution the measurements were performed for various advance coefficients 1 j v a n d with the advance speed v a the diameter d and the propeller speed n the calculation of the efficiency for a ducted propeller 2 η i d 1 1 c t 4 v a u x was done according to kornev 2009 with the thrust coefficient c t and the ratio between the progress speed v a and the axial propeller velocity u x the thrust coefficient 3 c t 2 t t d ρ a 0 v a 2 was calculated with the thrust of the duct t d and the propeller t as well as the propeller disk area a 0 3 numerical approach verification and analysis methods 3 1 numerical model the used numerical methods were chosen according to the specific needs of the simulation type and the quantities which were extracted from the simulations a standard k ω sst urans model was used for the various simulations to compute general integral quantities like the open water characteristic thrust and efficiency of the hubless propeller in general urans models are to dissipative for studies concerning the evaluation of unsteady flow structures but the prediction of integral quantities can be still accurate therefore the urans results will be included in this studies to provide information of the hubless propeller performance over a broad advance coefficient range a grid independence study was done for this numerical setup to ensure that the solution had converged a cfd method with scale resolving capabilities is necessary in order to compute the transient hydrodynamic processes within the wake flow of the hubless propeller which are important for the emission of noise the direct numerical simulation dns les or even des are appropriate methods which fulfills these claims due to the high reynolds number of the current setup and the very high mesh requirements within the boundary layers for a les simulation the des sbes method was chosen for this study the sbes menter and ansys germany gmbh 2016 spalart 2009 is an improved formulation of the shielded detached eddy simulation sdes which uses the des shielding function f s to distinguish between regions in the flow field where the les or the urans model should be active respectively furthermore the sbes provides an asymptotic shielding behavior of the boundary layers to ensure that the model will stay in the urans mode to prevent grid induced flow separations a rapid transition behavior between urans and les model part is provided by the sbes outside of the wall boundary layers the shear stress tensor 4 τ i j s b e s f s τ i j r a n s 1 f s τ i j l e s is composed of the shares of the urans and les model wherein the shielding function f s determines the transition between both models the total turbulent kinetic energy tke can be computed according to 5 k t o t k s g s k s s t k r e s with the modeled tke of urans k s s t and les k s g s thus the resolved tke 6 k r e s 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 is also affected by the individual shares of both models the calculation of the modeled tke for the les is realized as 7 k s g s ν s g s c ν δ 2 with the subgrid scale viscosity ν s g s the lattice width δ and a constant c ν 0 165 the influence of the not resolved turbulent flow structures was treated using the standard smagorinsky subgrid scale model within the les region the solution of the k equation of the urans model is used for the calculation of k s s t advection and diffusion fluxes in the governing equations were discretized using a bounded central differencing scheme bcds which is second order an implicit second order differencing scheme was used for the discretization of the transient term the full hydrodynamic system of equations is solved simultaneously in an implicit manner an acceleration of the solution is achieved by solving the equations in an agglomeration based multigrid framework the convergence limit of the solution process was set to 10 4 for rms residuals which is a good compromise between computational speed and accuracy this limit was carefully chosen and ensures that the mean value of the field quantities recorded at certain grid points was converged as well a sketch of the entire cfd domain with the main dimensions is shown in fig 6 boundary conditions for the inlet and outlet as well as for the circumferential outer domain surface were set as opening for the simulation case with an advance coefficient of j 0 the relative total pressure respectively static pressure was set to zero for opening boundary condition surfaces the total pressure condition is used for a flow direction into the cfd domain and the static pressure condition for a flow direction out of the domain in general this boundary conditions is preferable when the velocity field is unknown at the domain boundaries and therefore part of the solution process the advance speed v a and a zero gradient condition for the static pressure was set for all urans simulation for j 0 the static pressure was set to zero for these cases at the domain outlet all walls were treated as smooth walls wherein the velocity components were set to zero and a vanishing wall normal gradient was used as pressure boundary condition the turbulence intensity was set to zero at the domain inlet for j 0 because the outer fluid is at rest in some distance to the propeller and will be sucked into it only in the vicinity thus the turbulent kinetic energy k is zero and all other turbulence quantities are part of the solution and a zero gradient boundary condition is applied at the domain inlet the turbulent kinetic energy k was explicitly defined at the inlet domain for cases j 0 zero gradient boundary conditions are applied for the turbulence quantities at the outlet and the circumferential outer surface of the domain the mesh resolution close to the wall was appropriate to achieve y 2 for the des sbes and y 5 for the urans which ensures a direct resolution of the viscous boundary sublayer thus no wall function approach was incorporated in the solution process this implies that k ε or ω are part of the solution process and internally treated with a zero gradient wall boundary condition the urans and des sbes calculations were done in ansys cfx 19 1 3 2 numerical mesh a block structured 3d hexahedral grid of the hubless propeller model was created for the cfd simulations in compliance with the criteria given in menter s best practice guide 2015 menter nov 2015 for scale resolving simulations based on the individual requirements of the urans and des sbes models grids were created with 5 20 m urans and 33 m des sbes cells the achieved wall resolution for the des sbes was checked in terms of the y values in various test runs and adapted until y dropped below 2 in the entire cfd domain the mesh aspect ratio is smaller than 20 for 90 of all cells and smaller than 60 for 95 the angle of the cells is at least about 27 and between 36 and 90 for more than 90 of all cells further the volume change is between 1 and 2 for 98 of the mesh cells and does not exceed 10 within the whole domain fig 7 shows the structure of the mesh for the sake of clarity a coarse mesh with 8 m nodes was chosen for the presentation of the fundamental mesh topology it can be seen that the domain is divided into three sections at the borders of these sections the mesh is split in the x direction so that hanging nodes are created red lines which offers the advantage of maintaining the quality criteria in the whole domain without exceeding an acceptable numbers of cells in order to select an appropriate mesh for the urans simulations a grid independence study is necessary the grid convergence index gci was calculated according to roache 1994 five different grids were created and calculated using the k ω sst model table 2 shows an overview of the created grids in fig 8 the resulting asymptotic behavior of the gci can be seen the ordinate axis was normalized to the extrapolated values so that differences between the individual grids can be specified in proportion the abscissa shows the average grid width of the individual simulations with the high resolution grid on the left side of the diagram based on the mesh study shown in fig 8 a fairly converged solution for the axial velocity is achieved for the 20 m cell mesh which was chosen for the calculation of the open water characteristic with the urans model the sbes des simulation was run for the static thrust case at j 0 for which the hydroacoustic measurements were carried out during the water channel experiments the results of a urans simulation at j 0 were used as initial conditions for the sbes des 3 3 power loss analysis the quality of the des sbes is attributed to the numerical and model related accuracies both accuracies depend on the resolution of the grid which is used to solve the governing equations celik et al march 2009 an inherent energy analysis was applied to verify the achieved model quality of the computed flow field the pla by torner et al 2018 compares the global losses to the losses within the flow field the global losses are calculated at the boundaries of the computational domain whereas the losses within the flow field are calculated from the dissipation both losses have to be equal from the theoretical standpoint thus the pla quantifies the inherent accuracy of the used cfd model based on the input p b l a d e s m ω and output power δ p f l u i d δ p t o t q within the hubless propeller duct the power loss p l o s s 1 can be defined according to eq 8 8 p l o s s 1 p b l a d e s δ p f l u i d m b l a d e s ω a δ p t o t q the flow loss in eq 8 has to be equal to the dissipation integrated over the computational domain of the duct three different dissipation terms the direct p d i r the resolved turbulent p t u r b r e s and the modeled turbulent dissipation p t u r b m o d can be calculated from the flow field quantities the direct dissipation relies on the gradients of the time averaged velocity field cf eq 9 the resolved turbulent dissipation eq 10 incorporates with the directly resolved fluctuations in the velocity field the modeled turbulent dissipation eq 11 is computed via the turbulent viscosity ν t and the unsteady velocity gradients in the flow field due to the hybrid approach the modeled turbulent dissipation of the des sbes consists of an les and a urans part 9 p d i r ρ v ν u i x j u i x j u j x i d v 10 p t u r b r e s ρ v ν u i x j u i x j u j x i d v 11 p t u r b m o d ρ v ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i d v the power loss p l o s s 2 can finally be written as the sum of the individual dissipation terms from eqs 9 11 12 p l o s s 2 p d i r p t u r b r e s p t u r b m o d s s t p t u r b m o d l e s the terms p l o s s 1 and p l o s s 2 should be approximately equal because they describe the same physical process the remaining dissipation of the numerical simulation is attributed to the numerical and the modeling accuracies the results of the pla for the des sbes can be seen in table 3 the deviation of the total power loss terms p l o s s 1 and p l o s s 2 for the des sbes with 33m cells is 5 5 which is in an acceptable range according to torner et al 2018 additionally the des sbes were performed with 8m and 20m cells to demonstrate the increase in model quality with respect to the loss the direct the turbulent resolved and the modeled dissipation of the les increase hence the turbulent flow within the observed domain is capable of representing the total losses 3 4 proper orthogonal decomposition the wake flow of the hubless propeller is superimposed with different coherent and incoherent turbulent flow structures in the most cases the coherent parts of the fluctuation patterns in the velocity or pressure field are characterized by specific distinguished frequencies in contrast the incoherent part characterizes the irregular and chaotic fluctuations in the turbulent flow field such that no discrete frequencies can be assigned to these motion patterns the proper orthogonal decomposition pod is capable of separating the coherent and incoherent fluctuations in the velocity or pressure field from each other frederich et al 2011 witte et al 2018 in the following section only a brief description of the pod method will be given detailed information can be obtained from lumley et al 1967 lumley 1981 sirovich 1987 1989 1990 holmes et al 1990 holmes et al 1990 and berkooz et al 1993 the pod decomposes the field quantity ϕ which can be a tensor of any order 13 ϕ x t i ϕ ϕ ϕ k 1 k m k x a k t i i k 1 2 k into a set of orthogonal modes m k and time coefficients a k the computation of the pod modes and time coefficients relies on the solution of the eigenvalue problem based on the temporal correlation matrix c k l 14 c k l λ k δ k l b k 0 15 c k l 1 k v ϕ x t k ϕ x t l d v 16 m k 1 k λ k i 1 k b k t i ϕ x t i i 1 2 k 17 a k t i b k t i k λ k the computation of the pod time coefficients can be done according to eqs 16 and 17 once the eigenvalues λ k and eigenvectors b k are known the identification of coherent flow structures can be carried out using the eigenvalues time coefficients and mode shapes a convective coherent flow structure can be described by at least two pod modes frederich et al 2011 with nearly identical eigenvalues furthermore the pod time coefficients should ideally be characterized by a single pronounced frequency and the pod mode field distribution should show a clear spatial periodicity this description of a coherent structure is in accordance to the definition given by hussain 1983 as a large scale turbulent fluid mass with a phase correlated vorticity over its spatial extent 4 results the results of the measurements are presented in the following section the propeller thrust the axial flow velocity the wall pressure fluctuations and the acoustic pressure were recorded during the measurements table 4 summarizes the results of the measured open water characteristics for the advance coefficients j 0 43 0 53 0 71 with the respective absolute error limits urans simulations were performed for different advance coefficients and the results for efficiency and thrust were compared with the measurement results fig 9 shows the efficiency and the thrust coefficients of the measurements and simulations according to the equations in section 2 3 the des sbes was done for static thrust conditions j 0 so that the hydrophone is not disturbed by the background flow the measured thrust for this condition is t 30 7 0 4 n and the prediction of the sbes is t 31 6 n which is a deviation of 2 8 in contrast to the sbes the urans simulation predicts a thrust of 31 9n which corresponds to a deviation of about 3 9 the following section will focus on the evaluation of the des sbes for j 0 for which the hydroacoustic measurements were performed 4 1 measurement of wall pressure fluctuation and acoustic emission parallel to the open water characteristics the wall pressure fluctuations and hydroacoustic emissions where measured under static thrust conditions j 0 this allows for an acoustic measurement without disturbances from the background flow in the water channel fig 10 shows the spectra obtained from the dynamic wall pressure and hydrophone measurements the frequency axis is normalized with the rotational speed n the reference acoustic pressure for water is p r e f 1 0 6 pa and the wall pressure data were normalized with p d r e f ω r 2 ρ 2 besides the different orders of the blade passing frequency bpf further components in the spectrum which are related to specific parts of the electrical drive such as the number of magnets 12 and coils 8 are clearly visible an increase of the 6th bpf and its higher harmonics at f n 48 72 is the result of these interactions additionally the cross power spectrum 18 s p p d y n p f p f was calculated in order to bring out the similarities between the wall pressure fluctuations p and the emitted acoustic noise cf p fig 11 the detailed comparison of the cross power spectra in fig 11 shows a good correlation between the wall pressure fluctuations and the hydroacoustic noise emission it is obvious that the amplitudes at the dominant frequencies in the shown spectra are superimposed by hydrodynamic effects as well as effects due to the specific characteristics of the electrical drive itself further the relationship between the hydrodynamic effects in the flow field and the acoustic noise spectrum which were obtained from the measurements can additionally be captured by the des sbes 4 2 simulation results this section presents the results of the simulation with the focus placed on the analysis of the unsteady flow and pressure fields for this purpose the spectrum of the wall pressure measurement will be compared with the spectrum of the simulation the origin of the pressure excitation will be examined more closely with the analysis of the wall shear stresses the application of vortex identification criteria and the pod method to find the source for specific tonalities in the acoustic noise spectrum 4 3 analysis of wall pressure fluctuation fig 12 shows the normalized frequency spectrum of the wall pressure fluctuations from the des sbes and the measurement recorded at the same position the different orders of the bpf dominate the whole spectrum and can be inspected up to the 40th order additionally higher amplitudes can be observed at some frequencies besides the bpf orders which is the case for f n 6 5 10 5 and f n 30 obviously these frequency components cannot be assigned to the bpf orders but to other phenomena in the flow field and were also observed in the hydroacoustic measurement cf fig 10 again the numerical simulation can capture hydrodynamic effects only for example structural vibrations of the propeller system which are excited by magnetic force components related to the coil or magnet pole number e g the 6th and 12th bpf cannot be accounted for in the following section the wake flow will be examined in detail and the dominant flow structures will be assigned to the respective frequencies of the wall pressure fluctuations the flow structures of the hubless propeller will be phenomenologically compared with those of hub propellers 4 4 analysis of the wake flow field the turbulent wake flow of the propeller is dominated by periodic vortex structures which develop from the blade root the tip and trailing edge to provide an overview of the turbulent wake flow hunt s q criterion is shown in fig 13 q is defined as q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 ω and s are the skew symmetric and symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor q computes the difference between the rotation and strain rate and can be therefore interpreted as the excess of rotation compared with the strain thus it defines the strength of rotation of a vortical structure besides different chaotic vortex structures fig 13 top a horseshoe vortex solid and dashed line fig 13 bottom along the blade roots can be observed the horseshoe vortex dissipates at about x r 2 within the duct and is no longer visible in the wake the computed q iso surfaces at q n 2 19 were clipped along different r r fig 14 to enhance the visibility of the different vortex structures in the wake flow in fig 14 a the q iso surface was clipped for r r 0 9 to enable the observation of a complex multi helix vortex system which originates from the blade tip region especially the trailing edge flow is affected by the boundary layer separation on the profile suction side causes the development of a vortex street cf figs 15 and 14 a a leading edge separation and turbulent re attachment can be seen on the suction side before the flow finally separates close to the trailing edge the flow separation lines in fig 15 were extracted as a ridge or convergence line from the wall shear stress field furthermore the boundary layer separates on the pressure side very close to the trailing edge as well both effects causes the development of the mentioned trailing edge vortex street cf figs 14 and 16 the flow separation itself originates from the high angle of attack of the blade which is essential for thrust generation with a symmetrical profile in fig 16 a close up view of the blade tip region is shown three different vortical structures are recognizable one tip vortex i develops at the inner blade radius as expected but dissipates shortly after its formation the early dissipation of this tip vortex might be attributed to the relatively strong radial gradient of the axial velocity component in that region cf 21 a plausible explanation could be that the strong radial gradient of the axial velocity will initiate a vortex stretching or deformation mechanism which will increase the dissipation process the second tip vortex i i develops from a position closer to the blade tip in its initial development stage it is strongly affected by the vortex street behind the trailing edge the third structure in fig 16 is the trailing edge vortex street i i i the structure of the vortices close to the trailing edge is pretty similar to the classical von kàrmàn vortex street the axis of the shedding vortices are aligned with the trailing edge itself shortly after a re orientation process is initiated wherein the vortex axis are tilted into the mean flow direction thus the outer part of the helix structure is formed the second tip vortex develops into the inner and the trailing edge vortex street into the outer part of the multi helix system in fig 14 a the outer part of the helix system is shown on its own in fig 14 b and the inner core of it in fig 14 c the wavelength of the helix system reduces continuously and the spatial extension in radial direction increases because the convective flow velocity decreases due to the expansion of the propeller jet flow via entrainment processes the dissipation process is initiated by some first flow instabilities starting at x r 2 5 within the inner helix system which causes a bumpy appearance in the visualization with the q criterion at x r 3 5 the inner helix collapses and disappears instabilities of the outer helix system start at x r 3 and cause the disintegration at x r 4 5 cf fig 14 in fig 17 the q criterion are represented over different y z sectional planes in the propeller wake both the tip vortex i i and the trailing edge vortex street i i i which later develops into the outer part of the helix system are tracked along its axial path it can be seen how the multi helix system expands in radial direction during convection the flow structure widens further up to x r 4 and subsequently becomes unstable with the collapse being mostly completed at x r 4 5 the frontal view shows that the individual helix structures do not run synchronously because of the gradient of the circumferential speed in radial direction and the different spatial wavelengths in x direction the inner helix vortex overtakes its outer counterpart because of the lower spatial wavelength cf also fig 18 top in addition the vorticity ω z is shown in fig 18 bottom to provide information about the rotation direction of the different vortical structures the vortex shedding from the trailing edge i i i can be clearly inspected by the periodical change of the sign in the ω z distribution and is present up to x r 1 5 due to the difficult definition and different interpretation by researchers of what a coherent structure is the shown vortex patterns or multi helix system i i i and i i i can be interpreted at least as one single dominant coherent flow structure in the wake of the hubless propeller or even as three independent structures at the end the shown structures representing a state of equilibrium as a result of different interaction processes in the wake flow the described pod procedure is capable to extract these structures with respect to the overall fluctuation energy in terms of pod modes and time coefficients the most energetic modes will represent the helix system i i i and i i i wherein higher pod modes will represent superimposed small scale fluctuation patterns these higher pod modes can be periodic in time and space itself and therefore representing superimposed coherent substructures this is some kind of an cascade process going down from large to small scale fluctuation patterns respectively coherent structures the capabilities of the pod will be demonstrated in terms of the decomposition of the wall pressure fields in section 4 5 according to felli et al 2011 a four blade hub propeller tip vortex decays at about x r 0 6 under static thrust conditions and the blade hub vortex decays at x r 1 in comparison to the investigations by felli et al on hub propellers the transition length of the blade tip vortices of the hubless propeller is significantly larger the different instability mechanisms of interacting helix structures investigated by widnall 1972 saffman 1970 lugt 1996 and felli et al 2011 are superimposed in general which makes it difficult to clearly distinguish them from each other in the current case at least so called short wave instabilities are recognizable which cause a bumpy deformation of the inner and outer helix vortex shortly before their disintegration the wake destabilization process and the dissipation of the inner and outer part of the helix systems happens very rapidly compared with investigated cases for hub propellers of felli that might be attributed to the fact that the entire wake flow in the current case is significantly different compared to those of hub propellers first the two helix systems are close compared to the tip vortices of hub propellers thus a boosted mutual induction process might be present secondly the radial gradient of the axial velocity is more pronounced compared with hub propellers especially in the range between r r 0 3 r r 1 2 which will amplify vortex stretching mechanisms third the influence of the duct have to be considered which will also introduce additional disturbances in the flow field compared to hub propellers so far the flow respectively vortex structures have been described phenomenologically in terms of hunt s q criterion as a consequence of the different interacting processes a pronounced amount of turbulent kinetic energy is produced in the wake in fig 19 the modeled distribution of the instantaneous tke computed by the urans and les part of the des sbes model as well as the directly resolved tke are shown the typical patterns of the wake flow structures which were already visualized by the q criterion are clearly visible in both modeled tke fields the subgrid scale fluctuations of the les part of the sbes model causes mostly high tke values in the vicinity of the inner and outer helix vortex which can by observed as discrete dot areas high tke values from the les model part can be also observed close to the duct surface the high velocity gradients close to the wall in that area acting like a trigger to increase the velocity fluctuations and therefore ramping up the tke the modeled tke from the k ω sst part of the sbes has a much smoother appearance and could be interpreted like a screwed region of high tke values probably this pattern in the tke distribution is originated from the trailing edge vortex street cf fig 19 the highest share of tke is provided by the direct resolved fluctuations in the velocity field which is another indicator the mesh resolution was chosen properly the distribution of the tke over the radius coordinate for different x r are shown in fig 20 the highest tke values can be found in the region of the inner duct wall for x r 1 and x r 2 the slight decrease in the tke for x r 2 compared with x r 1 might be caused by the increase of the duct diameter which will reduce the mean axial velocity as well as the velocity fluctuation the mean axial velocity distribution for different x r is shown for comparisons in fig 21 increasing tke values can be observed again starting at the duct exit wherein the interaction between the fluid at rest in the outer domain region and the wake flow causing strong velocity gradients the general distribution of the axial velocity in fig 21 inside the duct shows significant smaller amplitudes close to the rotation axis the maximum axial velocity for x r 1 is about u u r e f 0 52 at a radial position r r 0 85 the ratio between the minimum and maximum axial velocity for x r 2 is 0 46 which is significant higher compared with hub propellers according to hamill and kee 2016 the relatively high axial velocity close to the blade root at r r 1 in combination with the maximum circumferential speed and the horseshoe vortex is a critical region for static pressure reduction and cavitation initiation for hubless propellers the cavitation number σ p p v 1 2 ρ u 2 computed from the time averaged flow field quantities of the sbes is shown in fig 22 and reveals that in the current case cavitation has not to be considered in general the risk for tip cavitation is always reduced for hubless propellers compared with the hub counterpart due to the very small circumferential and axial velocities cf fig 21 anyway it always depends on the actual design of the hubless propeller whether or not cavitation can occur in general a high thrust coefficient c t makes any propeller prone for cavitation issues in the case of the hubless propellers chances are high that cavitation will be initiated at the blade root region 4 5 pod analysis of the wall pressure field and the relationship to the hydroacoustic emission the specific characteristics of the hubless propeller wake flow as well as the results from the measurement campaign were discussed independently from each other in the previous section the relationship between the coherent structures of the flow field and the noise emission will be discussed now in terms of a pod analysis of the wall pressure fluctuations the unsteady wall pressure fields from the des sbes were recorded for 3 complete revolutions of the hubless propeller which corresponds to 2160 time steps in total for this the wall pressure data on stationary mesh parts of the kort duct as well as on the rotating mesh parts were used once the eigenvalue decomposition of the pod correlation matrix was performed the spectra of the time coefficients were computed and analyzed respectively used to identify pod modes with pronounced discrete frequency components cf fig 23 the sum of the pod eigenvalues is equal to the trace of the correlation matrix therefore the eigenvalue represents the fluctuation energy per mode of the decomposed field quantity the distribution of the pod eigenvalues is shown in fig 24 the eigenvalues of the first two pod wall pressure mode have a share of 75 of the overall fluctuation energy the share drops to 4 2 for the third and fourth pod mode and is below 1 for the seventh mode and the following ones in general these higher order pressure fluctuations are of minor importance for pure hydrodynamic problems but for application where the acoustic is in the focus they are essential astonishingly a close inspection of the pod wall pressure eigenvalue spectrum reveals that the decay of the wall pressure fluctuation energy is 0 9 in the doubled logarithmic chart this result is in accordance with the decay of the power spectrum obtained by felli et al for the radial velocity component an explanation might be that the radial velocity component will be mostly affect the wall pressure field thus the same behavior can be observed despite the fact that a completely different analysis techniques were used the shown pod pressure modes and time coefficients in this section have a corresponding counterpart with a phase shift of 90 both the spatial pattern of the pod pressure mode field and the spectrum of the assigned pod time coefficient are equal apart from the phase shift thus these pod modes correspond to convective coherent structures in the flow field in fig 25 the pod pressure mode field distributions are shown the time coefficients are assigned to the first second third and sixth order of the bpf respectively the sixth order of the bpf was additionally chosen for the representation in this row because the highest hydroacoustic noise emission was measured at this frequency in the experimental investigations a periodic pattern in the pod pressure mode field distribution can be seen in all four cases in accordance with the successively higher dominant frequency component in the corresponding pod time coefficients the spatial wavelength is consequently reduced between the individual cases in general the observed pattern in the pod pressure mode field distribution reflects the interaction of the propeller blades with the walls of the kort duct causing fluctuations in the wall pressure field at the bpf orders the distribution of the pod pressure modes in the kort duct inlet region is very smooth and free of any disturbances the sloped pattern in the pod pressure mode field behind the propeller disk can furthermore be attributed to the horseshoe vortices in the root region of the individual blades in contrast to the inlet region the pattern is not that smooth and already affected by the turbulence of the wake flow additionally some short wave disturbances can be observed in the inlet of the kort duct for pod pressure mode 7 which corresponds to f n 12 this tendency increases continuously for even higher pod modes which are related to the bpf orders remarkably only minor pressure fluctuations on the propeller blade itself can be observed for the shown pod mode distributions in fig 25 pod pressure modes with a clear periodicity can be identified up to the 6th order of the bpf which was proven by a spectral analysis of the corresponding time coefficients according to fig 11 these discrete frequencies were identified by the experimental wall pressure and hydrophone measurements too the identified pod mode pairs can be interpreted as coherent flow structures with respect to the definition of hussain 1983 though only the wall pressure field was decomposed other specific effects in the flow field which are not correlated with the orders of the bpf were identified by the pod as well the time coefficient of pod mode 5 is assigned to f n 10 5 which is not related to the blade numbers and therefor related to another specific effect in the flow field the corresponding pod wall pressure field is shown in fig 26 it is obvious that the highest fluctuations in the wall pressure field are in effect at the inlet region of the kort duct cf fig 27 a close inspection of the flow field at the inlet edge of the kort duct reveals that a small separation separation bubble of the boundary layer takes places shortly after the boundary layer reattaches but nevertheless the fluctuations in the pressure field progress up to the propeller disk region and affecting the wake flow as well furthermore the spectrum of the pod time coefficient shows an additional small amplitude peak at f n 12 fig 29 which might indicate that a feedback loop exists wherein the interaction of the rotor blades with the flow field amplifies the pressure fluctuations due to the inlet edge separation in the kort duct both the spectrum of the measured wall pressure as well as the spectrum of the emitted hydroacoustic noise show this specific frequency component which is an indication that the des sbes is capable of detecting those sensitive effects in the flow field cf figs 29 and 11 the spectra in fig 11 shows several additional frequency peaks which cannot be assigned to the orders of the bpf a leading edge separation on the blade suction side was discussed in the previous result section in terms of the assigned flow topology but not in terms of its temporal dynamics this phenomenon was captured by the pod pressure mode 33 with a dominant frequency of f n 30 in the spectrum of the corresponding time coefficient as well cf figs 30 and 28 d this phenomenon was furthermore identified and investigated with the pod decomposition of the pressure field recorded on a cylindrical cut plane at r r 0 5 during the des sbes simulation cf fig 31 the pressure mode field inside the computational domain is shown in fig 32 the fluctuations in the pressure field are initiated directly at the leading edge of the blade profile where the boundary layer separation is in effect the pressure fluctuations decrease further downstream before they increase again shortly before the trailing edge this behavior is in accordance with the results from the pod decomposition of the wall pressure field cf figs 32 and 28 d the influence of the other propeller blades can be seen in fig 32 too higher order disturbances in the flow field which are caused by the leading edge flow separation can be inspected in fig 33 for a dominant frequency of f n 60 both frequencies f n 30 and f n 60 are dominant components in the hydroacoustic noise and wall pressure spectrum obtained from the measurements according to the pod results tonal components in the measured hydroacoustic noise spectrum around f n 124 f n 143 and f n 155 can be attributed to high frequency oscillations of the pressure field directly at the leading edge of the blade the cause for these fluctuations can be attributed to a small recirculation bubble at the leading edge fig 34 shows the order spectrum of the acoustic measurement from f n 120 to f n 160 several peaks can be found in the hydroacoustic spectrum from the experiment and were identified by the pod as well indeed other effects related to higher orders of the bpf and internal components of the drive are present as well so far the relationship between specific effects in the flow field and the emission of hydroacoustic noise has only been discussed indirectly because no direct simulation of the sound field for example with the eif expansion about incompressible flow method shen and sorensen 1999 has been performed nevertheless the pod analysis of the wall pressure field was capable of separating different effects and even coherent flow structures in the flow field the characteristic frequencies of these structures were found in the spectral analysis of the various data obtained from the water channel experiments as well according to hardin and pope 1994 the identified wall pressure fluctuations dipole sources are one of the most important sources for the emission of noise in the upcoming investigations the eif procedure will be applied onto the fully transient 3d flow field data from the des sbes 5 conclusions and final remarks the investigation of the hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic properties of a hubless propeller was the scope of this present study therefor the open water characteristic was calculated with a k ω sst urans model and experimentally determined in a circulating water channel the results from a urans simulation for j 0 were furthermore used as initial conditions for a scale resolving des sbes to capture the unsteady wake flow in detail additional measurements of the wall pressure fluctuations and the emitted hydroacoustic noise were also used for the validation of the des sbes in addition a grid independence study gci for the urans simulation and a power loss analysis for the des sbes were done to certify that the chosen mesh was appropriate the analysis process of the experimental and simulation data relied on the evaluation of integral quantities order analysis of the wall pressure fluctuation and the hydroacoustic noise the wake flow topology was examined in terms of vortical structures visualized with iso surfaces of hunt s q criterion a proper orthogonal decomposition pod of the transient pressure field was done to identify different coherent structures in the wake flow and their temporal dynamics the pod results were also used to highlight the connection between the identified flow structures in the propeller wake and the corresponding components in the hydroacoustic noise spectrum the analysis of the wake flow revealed that a pronounced multi helix vortex system is present under static thrust conditions the inner helix vortex propagates from the blade tip region as a result of the pressure difference between the suction and pressure side of the blade the outer helix develops from the trailing edge vortex street the vortex axis is aligned with the trailing edge in its initial state further downstream close to the duct exit a re organization of the vortex street was observed ending up in the outer helix structure additionally a horseshoe vortex which develops from the blade root region was identified besides the multi helix structure observations of the temporal development of the wake flow from the des sbes revealed that the breakdown of the helix structures is initiated by short wave instabilities whereas the transition length is nearly doubled compared to hub propellers investigated by felli et al the assigned wall pressure fluctuations and the pressure fluctuations in the flow field which results from the superposition of all observed flow structures were investigated with the pod in detail the analysis of the pod time coefficients showed that dominant frequency components exist at different orders of the blade passing frequency bpf furthermore the time coefficients of some pod modes were characterized by frequency components which are not related to the bpf order numbers pod modes characterizing the trailing edge vortex street were assigned to a frequency of f n 30 the vortex shedding at the trailing edge is furthermore correlated with pressure fluctuations on the suction side of the blade close to the leading edge higher frequency components in the pod time coefficients at f n 155 143 and 124 were found for pod pressure modes whose highest amplitudes are located at the blade leading edge this is caused by a small recirculation bubble at the leading edge the flow separation in the duct inlet region was detected by the pod at f n 10 5 the pod pressure mode was characterized by a dominant pattern in the duct inlet and showed strong similarities with the pod mode distribution which was assigned to the 3rd bpf order this might indicate that a feedback loop exists wherein pressure fluctuation energy is transferred from the rotor to the duct inlet and vice versa even the flow separation itself might be triggered by the pressure pulsation of the rotor at 3rd bpf order the investigations of the hydroacoustic noise emission in a water channel revealed that dominant frequency components in the pressure field identified by the pod analysis and assigned to different specific effects in the flow field were included in the experimental data as well the usage of the pod methods for post processing purposes or as a smart filter is therefore quite worthwhile the application of the pod method onto the velocity and pressure field of the full cfd domain is planned for future activities to extract the global coherent structures in the wake flow a further aspect that is to be considered is the incorporation of the pod modes and time coefficients into numerical acoustic methods like the eif method to compute the acoustic emission and wave pattern of specific coherent flow structures

22547,captive model experiments are completely replaced by viscous cfd simulations in the present study aiming to obtain all the necessary parameters for mathematical model to predict yaw checking ability of kvlcc2 by zig zag manoeuvring simulations present cfd simulations successfully determine all the necessary manoeuvring parameters it is also figured out that accurate estimation in sway related linear hydrodynamic coefficient y v hull rudder interaction coefficient a h and flow straitening coefficient γ r are the key for the present manoeuvring predictions the present study is of its first kind 1 to identify all the necessary parameters for modular type mathematical model by viscous cfd with overset grid interface and 2 all the computational results e g forces and moment coefficients of hull and rudder available local flows and the ship s kinematic parameters trajectories and ship rudder motions in zig zag motions are rigorously validated with the available experimental data keywords viscous cfd captive model tests manoeuvring modular type mathematical model 1 introduction simulation is one of the most popular and practical approaches for manoeuvring prediction of a ship there are two representative mathematical models utilized to simulate manoeuvring motion of ships e g abkowitz type model and modular type model stern et al 2011 the former was originally developed by abkowitz 1964 abkowitz 1964 in which external hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the hull were expressed as a polynomial function of acceleration velocity and rudder angle based on taylor series expansion the latter was originally developed by inter domestic project in japan in late 1970 s kose and saeki 1979 kose and saeki 1979 and it was termed mmg model the uniqueness of the mmg model compared to abkowitz type model was to decompose external hydrodynamic forces and moments into hull rudder and propeller modules to couple these modules several interaction coefficients were introduced the formulation of the mmg model was recently unified and standardized by yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 manoeuvring simulations rely on these mathematical models for which their input parameters are usually identified by captive and or dynamic model tests or by empirical based formulae based on database stern et al 2011 although scale effect is one of the issues to be overcome model test is still major option and is feasible in the conventional towing and or manoeuvring tanks yet they are sometimes expensive in cost and time in the meantime they are not flexible in design change of hull and rudder which are frequently happened during initial design stage empirical based formulae are practical yet their database must be sufficient enough to cover latest design of recent ships which is difficult to achieve to overcome these issues captive and dynamic model tests are replaced by viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations on 2008 workshop on verification and validation of ship manoeuvring simulation methods simman 2008 stern et al 2011 was held aiming to benchmark the prediction capabilities of different ship manoeuvring simulation methods including viscous cfd in simman 2008 cura hochbaum et al 2008 hochbaum et al 2008 mimicked captive and dynamic planar motion mechanism pmm tests with kvlcc1 and kvlcc2 by viscous cfd to identify all the necessary manoeuvring parameters for abkowitz type model they carried out 10 10 zig zag simulation by the mathematical model with cfd identified manoeuvring parameters and the computational results of 1st and 2nd overshoot angles agreed well with the experiments similar works have been done by shenoi et al 2016 shenoi et al 2016 and guo and zou 2017 guo and zou 2017 who carried out extensive number of cfd simulations of captive and dynamic pmm tests for s175 container ship and onr tumblehome respectively both of them selected abkowitz type mathematical model to simulate ships trajectory yet few studies can be found to identify all the necessary manoeuvring parameters for the mmg model by viscous cfd it is also feasible to reproduce free running configurations via viscous cfd simulations these approaches are flexible in design change of hull and or rudder in the meantime simulating free running configuration is rather free from assumptions relative to those of adopted in mathematical models at simman 2008 carrica and stern 2008 carrica and stern 2008 and carrica and stern 2008 carrica et al 2013 demonstrated free running simulations of kvlcc1 and model 5415 by viscous cfd the simulations were carried out with moving rudder and discretized body force propeller using structured overset grid their results were encouraging in that the simulations were able to predict not only trajectory of ships but also detailed flow structure around ships under free running configurations after simman 2008 extensive studies for free running simulation by viscous cfd have been carried out for different type of ships and submarines by chase et al 2013 chase et al 2013 mofidi and carrica 2014 mofidi and carrica 2014 martin et al 2015 martin et al 2015 shen et al 2015 shen et al 2015 carrica et al 2016 carrica et al 2016 mofidi et al 2018 mofidi et al 2018 and ohashi et al 2018 ohashi et al 2018 although free running cfd simulations has become feasible its computational costs are relatively expensive in time compared to captive model computations because such simulations must be unsteady to predict ship motions and flows around ships at the same time therefore they are sometimes challenging for practical application in consequence one of the most efficient and practical methods to estimate ships manoeuvrability is the complementary use of viscous cfd and mathematical models that is captive model tests are replaced by cfd simulations to identify complete sets of manoeuvring parameters for mathematical models and then the mathematical models simulate ships trajectory to achieve such procedure it is necessary to improve viscous cfd methods to reproduce captive model tests in the meantime to develop methodologies to identify all the necessary input parameters for mathematical models from cfd outputs based on these backgrounds present study aims to identify complete sets of manoeuvring parameters for the mmg model by unstructured grid based reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solver surf hino 1997 with overset grid assembler upgrid kobayashi and kodama 2016 both are in house codes developed by national maritime research institute nmri in japan identified manoeuvring parameters are utilized to predict yaw checking ability of kvlcc2 tanker section 2 will describe the overview of the cfd solver utilized in the present study as well as the modular type mathematical model section 3 will summarize simulation design that is geometry grid and boundary conditions for cfd simulations methods to identify complete sets of manoeuvring parameters are also described herein section 4 will present validation results in terms of forces and moment coefficients for hull and rudder selected local flows hull rudder interaction coefficients and the rest of manoeuvring parameters trajectories of kvlcc2 in 10 10 and 20 20 zig zag manoeuvres are then estimated in model scale and are validated utilizing free running model experiments section 5 will summarize the conclusions of the present study overall results are encouraging in that complete sets of manoeuvring parameters for modular type mathematical model are successfully obtained throughout the present cfd simulations 2 computational method 2 1 viscous cfd solver surf the governing equations are continuity and rans equations they

and pressure are coupled by artificial compressibility approach matrix system is solved using symmetric multi color gauss seidel method which is efficiently parallelized by openmp on shared memory machine sato et al 2013 the rans equation is discretized by finite volume approach with collocated variables the 2nd order monotone upwind scheme for conservation laws muscl scheme is utilized for special discretization in convection term and diffusion term is discretized by 2nd order central differencing scheme the 1st order euler backward scheme is utilized for temporal discretization and steady state simulations are carried out with local time stepping 2 2 modular type mathematical model the mmg model adopted in the present study is the standardized version by yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 and stands for the following assumptions 1 the model is valid for single screw and single rudder configuration 2 only surge sway and yaw motions are modeled in the present study this is reasonable assumption since the target ship is relatively blunt and navigating in low speed which yields relatively large value in the meta centric height and thus the heel effect to the ship is small fig 1 describes the coordinate system of the present mmg model o 0 x 0 y 0 and o xy describe earth fixed and ship fixed frames respectively where the longitudinal position of the latter coordinate is identical to the midship of the target ship the u v m r represents dimensional surge velocity sway velocity and yaw angular velocity in the ship fixed frame respectively the subscript m for v means that the sway velocity is defined at midship ψ is the yaw angle in the earth fixed frame and is positive in clockwise observing from top the drift angle β t a n 1 v m u is in the ship fixed frame and is positive in clockwise observing from top the rudder angle δ is in the ship fixed frame and positive in anticlockwise observing from top the composite velocity u m s is defined by eq 1 as 1 u u 2 v m 2 3 simulation design 3 1 target geometry a tanker geometry kvlcc2 is of the interest in the present study this is one of the well known benchmark hull forms utilized in the international workshops in resistance and propulsion as well as manoeuvring stern et al 2011 larsson et al 2003 2013 fig 2 shows its overview with rudder under the design water line table 1 summarizes major dimensions of hull rudder and propeller where the breadth is b m the design draught is d m the block coefficient is c b the rudder height is hr the mean chord length of the rudder is b r m the aspect ratio of the rudder is λ the movable area of the rudder is a r m2 the diameter of the propeller is d p m the pitch ratio is h d p the expanded area ratio is a e and the number of propeller blades is z previous study has pointed out that the presence of rudder horn has some effects to the estimations in hull rudder interaction coefficients although it is feasible to generate rudder grid with horn total number of computational cells will be doubled this is problematic in terms of computational expense for the present therefore horn is treated as a part of rudder in the present study in other words a r utilized for the present cfd simulations is slightly larger than that of the experiment 3 2 computational grid and boundary conditions fig 3 and fig 4 show computational grid and boundary conditions utilized in the present study table 2 summarizes the number of cells for each block and their topology computational grids are separated into three blocks e g hull rudder and local refinement around the rudder for captive model simulations see fig 3 and rudder local refinement around the rudder and external block for open rudder simulations see fig 4 open rudder simulation solves flow around the rudder with certain rudder angles in uniform flow without ship hull for which the necessity of this simulation will be explained in 3 4 6 the i j and k for a hull block represent longitudinal girthwise and outward normal directions from wall respectively for a rudder block they correspond to chord normal chordwise and outward normal directions from wall respectively for a refinement block with cartesian topology the i j and k correspond to streamwise lateral and vertical directions respectively computational grid consists of hexahedra cells without hanging nodes and is generated by commercial grid generation package gridgen ver 15 18 once the grid is independently generated around hull rudder and refinement region interpolation information e g donor and receptor locations weights for donor stencils and in wall cell flagging between these blocks are computed as a preprocess utilizing upgrid for which the order of interpolation accuracy is 1st order in space total number of cell for captive model simulations is approximately 3 5 m in both sides while it is approximately 1 9 m in both sides for open rudder simulations smallest nondimensional grid spacing near the wall is set to 1 0e 06 so that nondimensional viscous length y becomes nearly 1 a requirement for the present k omega sst turbulence model for captive model simulations the forward perpendicular fp and afterward perpendicular ap of the hull lies between 0 5 x l pp 0 5 distance between fp and inflow boundary is 1 5l pp and the same distance is utilized between midship and bottom boundary distance between ap and outflow boundary is 2 0l pp as boundary conditions inflow outflow no slip and z symmetry conditions are applied for open rudder simulations hull block is replaced by rectangular external block as shown in fig 4 the size of the external block in x y and z direction is set in such a way that the length of each perimeter is at least 25c max where c max is the maximum chord length of the rudder to avoid domain size dependency in cfd solutions the rudder is completely submerged under the water 3 3 configurations of captive model tests to be simulated by the viscous cfd table 3 summarizes configurations of captive model tests to be simulated by the viscous cfd in order to obtain all the necessary manoeuvring parameters to the mmg model these configurations were carefully determined by the following criteria condition of resistance and self propulsion 1 4 in table 3 is simple e g β r and δ are all zero according to existing free running model tests yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 kvlcc2 is subjected to maximum β approximately 10 deg at 20 20 zig zag motion and thus the range of β is set as 12 deg β 12 deg for static drift configuration 5 in table 2 utilizing the same experimental data yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 it is found that the hull is subjected to maximum r at 20 20 zig zag motion approximately 0 1 however it is necessary to approximate hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the hull as a function of r therefore the range of r is set as 0 8 r 0 8 for steady turn configuration 9 in table 2 for static rudder configuration the rudder angle is set as 20 deg δ 20 deg 11 in table 3 since the maximum δ is 20 deg at 20 20 zig zag motion the maximum δ for open rudder configuration is set as 20 deg 12 in table 3 due to the same reason to estimate components of effective rudder inflow velocity u r v r flow straightening coefficient γ r and effective longitudinal coordinate of rudder position l r different δ must be set in static drift and steady turn configurations 7 and 10 in table 3 see section 3 4 for this reason to obtain cross coupling terms explained in 3 4 3 several β with non zero r must be set at static drift configuration without rudder angle 6 in table 3 3 4 identification of manoeuvring parameters for the mmg model 3 4 1 nondimensionalization forces and moments are nondimensionalized by eqs 2 and 3 as 2 f f o r c e 0 5 ρ u 2 l p p d 3 n m o m e n t 0 5 ρ u 2 l p p 2 d the same definition will be adopted to nondimensionalize hydrodynamic coefficients which will be explained in 3 4 3 and later mass is nondimensionalized by eq 4 as 4 m m a s s 0 5 ρ l p p 2 d surge and sway velocity components as well as yaw angular velocity are nondimensionalized utilizing characteristic velocity u and characteristic length l pp 3 4 2 3dof equations of motions in the mmg model the equations of motions in ship fixed coordinate system in the present mmg model are written in nondimensional form as 5 m m x u m m y v m r x g m r 2 x 6 m m y v m m m x u r x g m r y 7 i z g x g 2 m j z r x g m v m u r n m where m expresses nondimensional mass of the hull m x and m y are added mass coefficient in surge and sway direction respectively the nondimensional longitudinal centre of gravity in the ship fixed frame is x g shown in fig 1 where midship to fp is the positive x direction the nondimensional moment of inertia around z axis is i zg which assumes the radius of gyration of 0 25l pp the nondimensional added moment of inertia around z axis is j z the prime in in eqs 5 7 means that they are nondimensionalized one of the key formulations of the mmg model is to decompose the right hand side of eqs 5 7 as 8 x x h x r x p 9 y y h y r 10 n m n h n r where subscripts h r and p denote hull rudder and propeller respectively 3 4 3 hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on hull and rudder in the present study surge and sway force coefficients x h y h and yaw moment coefficient n h acting on the hull are defined by eqs 11 13 respectively following the definition of the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 as 11 x h x 0 x v v v m 2 x v r m m y v m r x r r x g m r 2 x v v v v v m 4 12 y h

coefficient of the hull excluding rudder at straight ahead configuration y 0 and n 0 are sway force and yaw moment coefficient respectively acting on the hull excluding rudder at straight ahead configuration attention must be paid when validation of x h y h and n h is carried out between experimental and computational results these variables obtained from the present cfd do not include inertial components to make direct comparison of present computational results to the experimental data centrifugal centripetal and coriolis components are analytically calculated and added to the cfd results rudder force coefficients x r y r rudder moment coefficient n r and surge interaction force coefficient x p due to propeller are expressed by eqs 14 17 respectively following the definition of the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 as 14 x r 1 t r f n sin δ 15 y r 1 a h f n cos δ 16 n r x r a h x h f n cos δ 17 x p 1 t t where f n is the rudder normal force coefficient t is the propeller thrust nondimensionalized by the same manner as eq 2 the parameters t r a h and x h are termed as hull rudder interaction coefficients the parameter x r is the nondimensinal longitudinal position of the rudder which is set to 0 5 for the present study and 1 t is the thrust deduction factor 3 4 4 estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients of the hull considering two configurations e g static drift at r 0 and steady turn at β 0 deg i e v m 0 rhs of eqs 11 13 are expressed as polynomial functions of v m and r therefore polynomial coefficients x vv x vvvv y v y vvv n v n vvv x rr y r y rrr n r n rrr are obtained by least square curve fitting lscf to obtain cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients e g x vr y vvr y vrr n vvr n vrr in eqs 11 13 static drift configuration with non zero r is considered in such case rhs of eqs 11 13 are expressed as functions of v m utilizing linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients e g x vv x vvvv y v y vvv n v n vvv x rr y r y rrr n r n rrr which are already calculated and thus known variables cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained by lscf 3 4 5 estimation of hull rudder interaction coefficients hull rudder interaction coefficients are obtained utilizing static rudder configuration according to the definition of the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 hull surge and sway force coefficients x y and yaw moment coefficient n m around the midship are defined by eqs 18 20 respectively introducing hull rudder interaction coefficients as 18 x x 0 1 t t 1 t r f n sin δ 19 y 1 a h f n cos δ 20 n m x r a h x h f n cos δ given x 0 and 1 t obtained from resistance and self propulsion conditions respectively x becomes a linear function of f n sinδ in the meantime y and n m also become linear functions of f n cosδ therefore the lscf of eqs 18 20 estimates 1 t r 1 a h and x r a h x h respectively 3 4 6 estimation of effective rudder inflow velocity and flow straightening coefficients according to the reference yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 following procedures are made to obtain nondimensional values of effective rudder inflow velocity u r v r γr and l r 1 first consider static drift r 0 and steady turn β 0 deg configurations and set zero and nonzero δ on these configurations estimate f n 2 second generate a x y plot for which x axis is δ and y axis is f n the cross point of f n 0 on x axis gives a certain value of δ for which it is termed δ fn0 in the meantime the gradient of f n with respect to δ can be obtained e g f n δ 3 third compute u r and v r by eq 24 and eq 25 respectively as 21 a f n

hekkenberg 2017 as 26 f α 6 13 λ λ 2 25 4 forth obtain γ r and l r in eq 25 v r is a function of β at static drift configuration while it is a function of r at steady turn configuration therefore γ r will be determined by eqs 27 and 28 respectively as 27 β r β l r r 28 v r γ r β r where β r is the geometrical inflow angle to the rudder setting β equals to 0 in eq 27 re arrangement of eqs 27 and 28 yields 29 v r γ r l r r the lscf of v r as a linear function of r with known γr gives l r 3 4 7 estimation of ratio of wake fraction at rudder position relative to propeller position and empirical constant for u r the u r of the present mmg model is expressed by eq 30 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 to take the effect of accelerated flow behind the propeller and propeller open water characteristic of k t t ρn p 2 d p 4 into consideration as 30 u r ε 1 w p η 1 κ 1 8 k t π j 2 1 2 1 η where ε is the ratio of wake fraction at rudder position relative to propeller position 1 w p is the effective wake fraction in manoeuvring η d p h r κ is the empirical constant for u r to take effect of accelerated flow into consideration n p rps is the propeller rotation speed j is the advance ratio as standard procedure yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 ε and κ are iteratively estimated in such a way that u r obtained by eq 30 converges to u r obtained by eq 24 in the present study ε and κ were estimated following this procedure however the result of ε does not converge to comprehensively accepted value approximately 1 1 according to the reference motora 1997 alternative procedure is adopted to estimate ε at the beginning viscous cfd simulations of open rudder configuration are carried out at δ 10 deg and 20 deg without propeller and obtain the coefficient of rudder normal force f n0 in the meantime obtain the coefficient of rudder normal force f nb from the computational results of static rudder simulations without propeller then define two different rudder inflow velocities u 0 and u r0 where u 0 is from open rudder configuration which is 1 in non dimensional form and u r0 is from static rudder configuration respectively according to identity method of rudder normal force fujino and ishiguro 1984 u r0 is estimated by eq 31 as 31 u r 0 u 0 f n b f n 0 the u r0 is considered to be the wake fraction at rudder position without propeller effect it is defined as 1 w r then ε is estimated by eq 32 as 32 ε 1 w r 1 w p 0 where 1 w p0 is the wake fraction of self propelled straight ahead configuration with δ 0 deg empirical formula eq 33 for κ is utilized for the present study according to the reference motora 1997 as 33 κ 0 6 ε 3 4 8 effective wake fraction in manoeuvring propeller inflow velocity in manoeuvring is quite different from straight ahead and thus 1 w p should be expressed as a function of β and r in the present procedure static drift and steady turn simulations at δ 0 deg are carried out first among these simulations n p is set in such a way that the ship is in self propulsion at model point in straight ahead δ 0 deg configuration then define the geometrical inflow angle β p to the propeller in manoeuvring as 34 β p β l p r according to the present mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 the w p will be modeled by eq 35 as a function of β p 35 w p w p 0 e x p c 0 β p 2 the coefficient c 0 in the rhs of eq 35 is determined by lscf 3 4 9 expression of thrust coefficient surf has a capability to compute propeller open water characteristics including k t by simplified propeller model based on infinite bladed theory hino et al 2008 estimated k t is expressed as a 2nd order polynomial in terms of advance ratio j as 36 k t k 2 j 2 k 1 j k 0 the lscf of eq 36 will determine k 0 k 1 and k 2 3 5 computational configurations for captive model simulations by cfd and zig zag simulations by the mmg model flow conditions for captive model simulations are summarized in table 3 two nondimensional parameters are introduced to represent flow conditions the reynolds number rn and the froude number fn based on l pp and u the running attitude of the ship is fixed at even keel with designed draught for all the cases all the simulations with the exception of 2 are carried out without free surface in order to save computational expense the rn for simulations 1 2 4 5 7 9 12 is identical to the experimental condition by ueno et al 2009 ueno et al 2009 the rn for simulation 3 is the same as measurement condition of nominal wake for kvlcc2 by lee et al 2003 lee et al 2003 for which it is also adopted as validation data at gothenburg 2010 cfd workshop larsson et al 2013 the rn for simulation 8 is identical to the experimental condition by kume et al 2006 kume et al 2006 notice that the hull form used for their experiment is kvlcc2m which has minor geometrical difference in the stern region compared to kvlcc2 utilized in the present study yet the effects of the difference in c tm and nominal wake distribution at straight ahead configuration are negligibly small as reported in hino 2005 hino 2005 simulation 2 is carried out with free surface in order to estimate c w which will be one of the necessary input parameters for the mmg model this fn is the same as the experimental data for gothenburg 2010 cfd workshop larsson et al 2013 for simulation 4 self propulsion point is set at model point which is consistent to the experiment ueno et al 2009 although simulation 4 is carried out under double model flow configuration the effect of free surface is included to the propeller loading by setting the model ship correlation allowance c a being the same as c w obtained by simulations 1 and 2 by three dimensional extrapolation method table 4 summarizes the computational configurations of for zig zag simulations by the present mmg model added mass m x m y as well as added moment of inertia around z axis j z are obtained from empirical based chart by motora 1997 4 results 4 1 grid convergence study prior to identify manoeuvring parameters grid convergence study is carried out in order to confirm discretization sensitivity in space for the present computational results setting the grid used for captive model simulations shown in table 2 as medium grid coarse and fine grids are systematically prepared using the refinement ratio r g 2 0 25 in i j k directions the total number of cells is 2 31 m and 6 30 m for coarse and fine grids respectively since it is not realistic to quantify grid uncertainty for all the cases presented in table 3 three representative cases are selected for grid convergence study which are 1 resistance and self propulsion simulations 1 and 4 in tables 3 and 2 static drift at β 12 deg with δ 0 deg one case from simulation 5 in tables 3 and 3 steady turn at r 0 2 with δ 0 deg one case from simulation 9 in table 3 the parameters subjected to the analysis are total resistance coefficient c tm from resistance simulation self propulsion coefficients 1 t 1 w p0 and n p from self propulsion simulation x y n m and f n from static drift and steady turn simulations grid convergence is evaluated by the factor of safety method proposed by xing and stern 2010 xing and stern 2010 in table 5 ε 21 and ε 32 are the solution change between fine grid s1 and medium grid s2 and medium grid to coarse grid s3 respectively the convergence ratio r is defined as 37 r ε 21 ε 32 when 0 0 r 1 0 monotonic convergence is achieved and the richardson extrapolation is used to estimate the order of accuracy p g and grid error δ g defined as 38 p g ln ε 32 ε 21 ln r g 39 δ g ε 21 r g p g 1 when 1 0 r 0 0 the type of convergence is classified as oscillatory convergence when r 1 0 the grid convergence is not achieved the distant metric p is defined as 40 p p g p t h where p th is the theoretical order of accuracy which is 2 for the present study when monotonic convergence is achieved the grid uncertainty u g is estimated according to p as 41 u g f s p δ g 2 45 0 85 p δ g 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 δ g p 1 when oscillatory convergence is achieved the u g is estimated by 42 u g 0 5 s u s l where s u and s l are the oscillation maximum and oscillation minimum of the solutions from the grids table 5 summarizes the results of grid convergence study for hydrodynamic forces and moment coefficients as well as propulsion parameters for resistance self propulsion and static drift simulations most of the parameters show grid convergence in the meantime ε 21 is below 1 s1 different to these simulations only f n shows grid convergence in steady turn case it is likely that the solutions from steady turn may be more sensitive to the grid density than those from resistance self propulsion and static drift cases this implies that hydrodynamic coefficients related to yaw rate could be affected by the grid density 4 2 resistance and self propulsion cases 1 in table 3 table 6 summarizes experimental and computational results of c tm form factor 1 k 1 w p0 1 t relative rotative efficiency η r and n p at model point respectively for resistance quantities they are well estimated within 3 of difference relative to the experimental results on the other hand 7 of difference can be seen in the self propulsion quantities fig 5 describes experimental lee et al 2003 and computational results of nominal wake distribution on the propeller plane the overall trend in axial momentum defect can be predicted by the present cfd yet local quantities e g hook shape of bilge vortex and wake peak at 12 o clock could be improved further according to the reference larsson et al 2013 their computational accuracies can be improved by introducing higher order turbulence model and local grid refinement 4 3 static rudder cases fig 6 shows experimental and computational results of x y n m and f n obtained from static rudder cases as a function of δ the computational results of y and n m show excellent agreement to the experimental data within 4 of difference with the exception at δ 20 deg the computational results of f n show 16 difference to the experimental data at δ 20 deg yet its linear profile as a function of δ is well predicted in terms of x it is the difference between hull resistance and propeller thrust and thus it is one order of magnitude smaller than those of y and n m although accurate estimation of x is challenging the present cfd simulation is able to capture its parabolic profile fig 7 presents experimental and computational results of propeller thrust as a function of δ the computational results 15 smaller t than that of the experiment which is most probably due to underestimation of n p by the present cfd discussed in section 4 1 fig 8 plots the same results as fig 6 in x y and n m yet the horizontal axis is either f n sinδ or f n cosδ in order to utilize eqs 14 16 to estimate hull rudder interaction coefficients for which the results are summarized in table 7 computational result of 1 t r is 52 larger than that of the experimental data which means that longitudinal interaction between rudder and hull is underestimated by the present simulation computational result of 1 a h is approximately 10 smaller than that of the experimental data it indicates that present cfd underestimates the ratio of increase in y due to rudder deflection being 10 smaller to the experiment computational result of x h is approximately 30 smaller than that of the experimental data this implies that the present computation predicts acting point of increased y due to rudder deflection being shifted 30 toward forward perpendicular of the ship in comparison to the experiment to investigate the effect of rudder horn to f n and hull rudder interaction coefficients the results by araki et al 2015 araki et al 2015 is referenced who carried out viscous cfd simulation of kvlcc2 static rudder at δ 10 deg without with rudder horn under the same flow condition as the present study table 8 summarizes hull rudder interaction coefficients without and with rudder horn total number of cells for these simulations is almost doubled compared to the present grid to mimic the geometry of rudder horn in the meantime to construct proper overset donor receptor information specifically at thin gap between rudder horn and movable rudder fig 9 depicts distribution of pressure coefficient in the stern vicinity without and with horn in the first row of fig 9 the movable rudder is eliminated from the drawing just for visualization purpose all the hull rudder interaction coefficients estimated with rudder horn are improved relative to those of without rudder horn the presence of the rudder horn changes the negative pressure distribution the source of f n at upper half of the rudder which yields increase in f n by 4 for with horn relative to without horn one of the reasons to cause such change of pressure distribution is the flow through the gap between the horn and the movable part of the rudder which is similar to the results from cura hochbaum et al 2008 hochbaum et al 2008 the presence of rudder horn also changes pressure distribution on the hull specifically at stern overhang region where asymmetric pressure distribution between port and starboard is more pronounced in with horn than without horn in consequence reproducing rudder horn yields 1 increase f n and 2 pronounced asymmetric pressure distribution on the stern overhang region they are likely to improve the computational accuracy in hull rudder interaction coefficients 4 4 static drift and steady turn cases δ 0 deg fig 10 shows experimental and computational results of x h y h n h and f n obtained from static drift cases at δ 0deg as a function of v m at 0 069 v m 0 208 12 deg β 4 deg computational results of y h and n h agree well with the experimental data within the difference of 5 at 0 208 v m 0 069 4 deg β 12 deg the averaged difference of y h and n h between the computational and experimental results becomes 16 which indicates the computational accuracy changes depending on the sign of v m or β computational results of y h and n h almost behave as odd function with respect to v m 0 on the other hand the experimental data especially for y h is not if there were no propeller effects on flow domain y h and n h should have behaved as pure odd function with respect to v m 0 provided that r 0 it is therefore likely that the propeller hull interaction becomes apparent in the experimental data of y h and the present cfd tends to underestimate such effect especially at v m 0 or β 0 computational results of x h are approximately 7 smaller than those of experimental results among all v m possible reason to cause this difference is discussed in terms of t from static drift configuration with δ 0 deg in fig 11 and kt in fig 12 computational results of t is approximately 13 smaller than that of experiment which is consistent to the fact that the computational results of n p at self propulsion point is smaller than that of experiment in the present study n p is constant for both experiment and computation which means that t is largely affected by the computational accuracy of propeller open water characteristic of k t as well as by propeller inflow velocity e g wake distribution on the propeller plane from the past free running model tests of present hull14 the propeller working point is 0 19 j 0 27 among this range the computational results of k t in open water agree well with the experiment as shown in fig 12 therefore one reason to cause the difference in t is likely to wake distribution on the propeller plane another possible reason is the propeller modeling the present body force model does not include the effect of inclined inflow to the propeller this can be achieved by for instance the method proposed by broglia et al 2012 broglia et al 2012 in body force modeling or utilizing fully discretized propeller the former broglia et al 2012 reports the improvement in propeller hull rudder interaction computational results of f n agree well with the experimental data within the acceptable range i e the average difference between computational and experimental results over v m is approximately 9 similar to y h and n h the computational results of f n at 0 208 v m 0 069 4 deg β 12 deg is slightly worse than that of at 0 069 v m 0 208 12 deg β 4 deg the local flow around the rudder with propeller effect estimated by the present cfd may include some discrepancy to that of the experiment which yields the difference in f n as t changes circulatory and accelerated flow due to propeller effect change once the computational accuracy of t is improved it will contribute to improve computational accuracy of local flow around the rudder with propeller effect and resultant f n fig 13 shows experimental kume et al 2006 and computational results of axial flow distribution at x l pp 0 48 in the static drift β 12 deg without propeller computational result reproduces the trend of separated flow from the hull due to inflow from upstream port well compared to the experimental data yet the present computation underestimates the axial momentum defect specifically at the centre of separated flow originated from starboard bow this is due to lack of spacial resolution at its path in the meantime estimated eddy viscosity by the present turbulence model is likely to add excessive viscous diffusion to the flow xing et al 2012 xing et al 2012 reported that the resolution of this flow can be improved by introducing local refinement adapted to the path of separated flow and higher order turbulence model such as detached eddy simulation des fig 14 shows the three dimensional vortical structures at static drift β 12 deg in the stern vicinity without with propeller effect depicted by q criterion hunt et al 1988 q 300 iso surface there are four major vortical structures around the hull a is originated from stern and lower edge of the rudder b is originated from bow at starboard side c is originated from upper edge of the rudder without propeller inflow direction is from upstream port to downstream starboard and thus flow separation becomes apparent at starboard side once the propeller operates accelerated axial and circulatory flows are added in the rudder vicinity propeller acceleration has straightening effect to the flow at its downstream and thus vortices a are slightly weakened while c is slightly strengthened d is generated by the effect of body force propeller since the present simulations are all steady state these vortices do not change their strength and location in time xing et al 2012 xing et al 2012 studied the instability of these vortices using des with sufficient spacial resolution and small time steps fig 15 shows experimental and computational results of x h y h n h and f n obtained from steady turn cases at δ 0 deg as a function of r fig 16 shows experimental and computational results of t from steady turn cases at δ 0 deg as a function of r among all range of r the computational results of y h and n h agree quite well with the experimental data within the average difference of 3 for x h the difference becomes more than 60 at r 0 8 for t the computational results underestimate the thrust by 14 in average over the entire range of r as t is underestimated by the present cfd propeller hull interaction is likely to be underestimated as well and thus it could be one of the reasons for large discrepancy in x h another possible reason is the lack of local flow resolution for the present cfd at r 0 8 local flow around the hull is subjected to encounter rapid change due to large angular velocity lack of resolution for such physics may yield large discrepancy in x h fig 17 summarizes the computational and experimental results of effective wake fraction obtained from static drift and steady turn at δ 0 deg as a function of β p the fitting curve based on the cfd agrees well with that of based on the experimental data yet the discrepancy between the two becomes apparent for larger β p table 9 summarizes ing parameters obtained from the results presented in figs 10 12 15 and 17 4 5 steady turn with non zero β δ 0 deg and r 0 2 fig 18 shows experimental and computational results of x h y h n h and f n obtained from steady turn cases r 0 2 at δ 0 deg as a function of v m fig 19 shows experimental and computational results of t from steady turn cases r 0 2 at δ 0 deg as a function of v m the trends of computational results in y h n h and f n are similar to the results at v m 0 shown in fig 10 i e static drift with r 0 the average difference of these forces and moment coefficients between computational and experimental results are also similar to those of shown in fig 10 with the exception in v m 0 208 β 12 deg for x h the trend is different to that of static drift with r 0 it linearly increases as a function of v m and the difference between experimental and computational results is 4 which is 1 8 times smaller than that of static drift cases shown in fig 10 the difference of t between computational and experimental results is 10 which is the similar magnitude as the static drift cases in fig 11 over the entire range of v m this indicates that the effect of r 0 2 is less significant to computational accuracy in t this makes it difficult to identify the reason of improvement for computational accuracy in x h fig 20 shows the changes of three dimensional vortical structure shown in fig 14 by the effect of r 0 2 due to the presence of r a and d are strengthened b is deformed while c is not affected by r table 10 summarizes cross coupling manoeuving parameters obtained from the results shown in fig 18 the difference is relatively large with the exception in x vr and y vvr as described in paragraph 3 4 3 known or pre estimated manoeuvring parameters from static drift simulations e g x vv x vvvv y v y vvv n v n vvv and steady turn simulations e g x rr y r y rrr n r n rrr are utilized for lscf to obtain cross coupling parameters shown in table 9 the computational accuracy in pre estimated manoeuvring parameters is likely to deteriorate the accuracy of lscf and thus yields large difference in cross coupling manoeuvring parameters 4 6 effective rudder inflow and flow straightening coefficient obtained from static drift and steady turn δ 0 deg and δ 0 deg fig 21 summarizes f n as a function of δ and u r v r as a function of β r from static drift and steady turn tests with δ 0 deg and δ 0 deg the lscf lines by eqs 27 and 28 are added to β r vs v r plot since the gradient of v r relative to β r is γ r although the γ r slightly differs between starboard helm and port helm as pointed out by the reference yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 the present study adopts the γ r from starboard helm since the experimental data to calculate γ r from port helm were not measured ueno et al 2009 at δ 0 deg the computational results of f n agree well with the experimental data while at δ 0 deg several computational results show remarkable differences to the experimental data this yields differences in u r and v r estimated by eqs 24 and 25 respectively as previously studied in the references yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 motora 1997 the γ r plays extremely important role in estimating ships manoeuvrability by modular type mathematical models fig 22 shows term by term plot of eq 24 excluding constants since eq 24 directly affects v r and resultant γ r the computational results of δ fn0 almost capture the trend of experimental data while the computational results of f n δ scatters with respect to the experimental data it is originated from inaccuracy in the computational results of f n from static drift and steady turn with δ 0 as previously discussion in section 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 the computational accuracy in f n can be improved by 1 reproducing the geometry of rudder horn 2 modifying the propeller model and 3 introducing higher order turbulence model these will also contribute to improve estimation of γ r table 11 summarizes γ r and l r obtained from the results shown in fig 21 the variables of ε and κ are put in the same table since they are closely related to γ r and l r please notice that the computational result of ε is the average of open rudder simulations at δ 10 deg and 20 deg 4 7 10 10

utilizing manoeuvring parameters which are purely obtained from present cfd simulations cfd exp mmg is the simulated results for which three limited parameters are from captive model tests and the rest of parameters are from present cfd simulations selection method for the three parameters will be described later in this section for 10 10 zig zag manoeuvre exp mmg estimates 1st osa very well compared to free run with the difference of 0 6 deg while the difference becomes 7 deg for 2nd osa cfd mmg estimates 1st osa 4 deg larger than that of free run these trends are common to the results of 1st osa for 20 20 zig zag manoeuvre since there are some discrepancies in manoeuvring motions between computational results of cfd mmg and free run exp mmg simple sensitivity analysis is carried out to identify influential manoeuvring parameters twenty one manoeuvring parameters obtained from present cfd simulations is replaced by those of obtained from captive model tests one by one and 10 10 zig zag simulations are carried out consequently y v γ r and a h show more than 10 cfd mmg of difference in ψ following such investigation cfd exp mmg simulations are carried out for which these three parameters are from captive model test and the rest of parameters are from present cfd simulations the computational results of 1st and 2nd osas from cfd exp mmg agree quite well with free run within the difference of 1 4 deg 5 conclusion viscous cfd simulations are carried out using kvlcc2 tanker geometry to identify complete sets of its manoeuvring parameters for modular type mathematical model two in house codes are utilized for the present study e g unstructured grid based rans solver surf and overset grid assembler upgrid both are developed at nmri rigorous validation studies are made for all the computational results of forces and moment coefficients of hull and rudder as well as resultant manoeuvring parameters local flows from straight ahead and static drift configurations are also subjected to the validation based on the validated complete sets of manoeuvring parameters 10 10 and 20 20 zig zag simulations with 3dof are carried out trajectories are validated with free running model tests the present cfd estimates linear hydrodynamic coefficients very well within the difference of 3 with the exception in y v for the estimation of non linear and cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients by the present cfd it is found that computational accuracy for forces and moment coefficients of the hull must be improved when large drift angle and or yaw angular velocity yet it is also found that the sensitivity of non linear and cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients to the trajectory of kvlcc2 is less significant compared to liner hydrodynamic coefficients for better estimations of propeller hull interaction coefficients by the present cfd computational accuracy for f n must be improved which can be achieved by 1 introducing higher order turbulence model 2 reproducing the geometry of rudder horn and 3 modifying the propeller model for better estimation of effective propeller inflow velocity it is crucial to estimate f n δ with sufficient accuracy inaccurate estimation of f n at static drift and steady turn with δ 0 deg yields deterioration in the effective propeller inflow velocity and resultant γ r accurate estimation of f n will also contribute to improve computational accuracy in propeller hull interaction coefficients when the manoeuvring parameters purely obtained from the present cfd are utilized for 10 10 and 20 20 zig zag simulations of kvlcc2 4 deg to 6 deg of differences are apparent to the overshoot angles from free running model tests when three manoeuvring parameters y v γ r and a h identified by simple sensitivity analysis are replaced by the variables obtained from captive model tests computational accuracy of the ship s trajectory and kinematic parameters is significantly improved acknowledgement

22547,captive model experiments are completely replaced by viscous cfd simulations in the present study aiming to obtain all the necessary parameters for mathematical model to predict yaw checking ability of kvlcc2 by zig zag manoeuvring simulations present cfd simulations successfully determine all the necessary manoeuvring parameters it is also figured out that accurate estimation in sway related linear hydrodynamic coefficient y v hull rudder interaction coefficient a h and flow straitening coefficient γ r are the key for the present manoeuvring predictions the present study is of its

coefficients of hull and rudder available local flows and the ship s kinematic parameters trajectories and ship rudder motions in zig zag motions are rigorously validated with the available experimental data keywords viscous cfd captive model tests manoeuvring modular type mathematical model 1 introduction simulation is one of the most popular and practical approaches for manoeuvring prediction of a ship there are two representative mathematical models utilized to simulate manoeuvring motion of ships e g abkowitz type model and modular type model stern et al 2011 the former was originally developed by abkowitz 1964 abkowitz 1964 in which external hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the hull were expressed as a polynomial function of acceleration velocity and rudder angle based on taylor series expansion the latter was originally developed by inter domestic project in japan in late 1970 s kose and saeki 1979 kose and saeki 1979 and it was termed mmg model the uniqueness of the mmg model compared to abkowitz type model was to decompose external hydrodynamic forces and moments into hull rudder and propeller modules to couple these modules several interaction coefficients were introduced the formulation of the mmg model was recently unified and standardized by yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 manoeuvring simulations rely on these mathematical models for which their input parameters are usually identified by captive and or dynamic model tests or by empirical based formulae based on database stern et al 2011 although scale effect is one of the issues to be overcome model test is still major option and is feasible in the conventional towing and or manoeuvring tanks yet they are sometimes expensive in cost and time in the meantime they are not flexible in design change of hull and rudder which are frequently happened during initial design stage empirical based formulae are practical yet their database must be sufficient enough to cover latest design of recent ships which is difficult to achieve to overcome these issues captive and dynamic model tests are replaced by viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations on 2008 workshop on verification and validation of ship manoeuvring simulation methods simman 2008 stern et al 2011 was held aiming to benchmark the prediction capabilities of different ship manoeuvring simulation methods including viscous cfd in simman 2008 cura hochbaum et al 2008 hochbaum et al 2008 mimicked captive and dynamic planar motion mechanism pmm tests with kvlcc1 and kvlcc2 by viscous cfd to identify all the necessary manoeuvring parameters for abkowitz type model they carried out 10 10 zig zag simulation by the mathematical model with cfd identified manoeuvring parameters and the computational results of 1st and 2nd overshoot angles agreed well with the experiments similar works have been done by shenoi et al 2016 shenoi et al 2016 and guo and zou 2017 guo and zou 2017 who carried out extensive number of cfd simulations of captive and dynamic pmm tests for s175 container ship and onr tumblehome respectively both of them selected abkowitz type mathematical model to simulate ships trajectory yet few studies can be found to identify all the necessary manoeuvring parameters for the mmg model by viscous cfd it is also feasible to reproduce free running configurations via viscous cfd simulations these approaches are flexible in design change of hull and or rudder in the meantime simulating free running configuration is rather free from assumptions relative to those of adopted in mathematical models at simman 2008 carrica and stern 2008 carrica and stern 2008 and carrica and stern 2008 carrica et al 2013 demonstrated free running simulations of kvlcc1 and model 5415 by viscous cfd the simulations were carried out with moving rudder and discretized body force propeller using structured overset grid their results were encouraging in that the simulations were able to predict not only trajectory of ships but also detailed flow structure around ships under free running configurations after simman 2008 extensive studies for free running simulation by viscous cfd have been carried out for different type of ships and submarines by chase et al 2013 chase et al 2013 mofidi and carrica 2014 mofidi and carrica 2014 martin et al 2015 martin et al 2015 shen et al 2015 shen et al 2015 carrica et al 2016 carrica et al 2016 mofidi et al 2018 mofidi et al 2018 and ohashi et al 2018 ohashi et al 2018 although free running cfd simulations has become feasible its computational costs are relatively expensive in time compared to captive model computations because such simulations must be unsteady to predict ship motions and flows around ships at the same time therefore they are sometimes challenging for practical application in consequence one of the most efficient and practical methods to estimate ships manoeuvrability is the complementary use of viscous cfd and mathematical models that is captive model tests are replaced by cfd simulations to identify complete sets of manoeuvring parameters for mathematical models and then the mathematical models simulate ships trajectory to achieve such procedure it is necessary to improve viscous cfd methods to reproduce captive model tests in the meantime to develop methodologies to identify all the necessary input parameters for mathematical models from cfd outputs based on these backgrounds present study aims to identify complete sets of manoeuvring

special discretization in convection term and diffusion term is discretized by 2nd order central differencing scheme the 1st order euler backward scheme is utilized for temporal discretization and steady state simulations are carried out with local time stepping 2 2 modular type mathematical model the mmg model adopted in the present study is the standardized version by yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 and stands for the following assumptions 1 the model is valid for single screw and single rudder configuration 2 only surge sway and yaw motions are modeled in the present study this is reasonable assumption since the target ship is relatively blunt and navigating in low speed which yields relatively large value in the meta centric height and thus the heel effect to the ship is small fig 1 describes the coordinate system of the present mmg model o 0 x 0 y 0 and o xy describe earth fixed and ship fixed frames respectively where the longitudinal position of the latter coordinate is identical to the midship of the target ship the u v m r represents dimensional surge velocity sway velocity and yaw angular velocity in the ship fixed frame respectively the subscript m for v means that the sway velocity is defined at midship ψ is the yaw angle in the earth fixed frame and is positive in clockwise observing from top the drift angle β t a n 1 v m u is in the ship fixed frame and is positive in clockwise observing from top the rudder angle δ is in the ship fixed frame and positive in anticlockwise observing from top the composite velocity u m s is defined by eq 1 as 1 u u 2 v m 2 3 simulation design 3 1 target geometry a tanker geometry kvlcc2 is of the interest in the present study this is one of the well known benchmark hull forms utilized in the international workshops in resistance and propulsion as well as manoeuvring stern et al 2011 larsson et al 2003 2013 fig 2 shows its overview with rudder under the design water line table 1 summarizes major dimensions of hull rudder and propeller where the breadth is b m the design draught is d m the block coefficient is c b the rudder height is hr the mean chord length of the rudder is b r m the aspect ratio of the rudder is λ the movable area of the rudder is a r m2 the diameter of the propeller is d p m the pitch ratio is h d p the expanded area ratio is a e and the number of propeller blades is z previous study has pointed out that the presence of rudder horn has some effects to the estimations in hull rudder interaction coefficients although it is feasible to generate rudder grid with horn total number of computational cells will be doubled this is problematic in terms of computational expense for the present therefore horn is treated as a part of rudder in the present study in other words a r utilized for the present cfd simulations is slightly larger than that of the experiment 3 2 computational grid and boundary conditions fig 3 and fig 4 show computational grid and boundary conditions utilized in the present study table 2 summarizes the number of cells for each block and their topology computational grids are separated into three blocks e g hull rudder and local refinement around the rudder for captive model simulations see fig 3 and rudder local refinement around the rudder and external block for open rudder simulations see fig 4 open rudder simulation solves flow around the rudder with certain rudder angles in uniform flow without ship hull for which the necessity of this simulation will be explained in 3 4 6 the i j and k for a hull block represent longitudinal girthwise and outward normal directions from wall respectively for a rudder block they correspond to chord normal chordwise and outward normal directions from wall respectively for a refinement block with cartesian topology the i j and k correspond to streamwise lateral and vertical directions respectively computational grid consists of hexahedra cells without hanging nodes and is generated by commercial grid generation package gridgen ver 15 18 once the grid is independently generated around hull rudder and refinement region interpolation information e g donor and receptor locations weights for donor stencils and in wall cell flagging between these blocks are computed as a preprocess utilizing upgrid for which the order of interpolation accuracy is 1st order in space total number of cell for captive model simulations is approximately 3 5 m in both sides while it is approximately 1 9 m in both sides for open rudder simulations smallest nondimensional grid spacing near the wall is set to 1 0e 06 so that nondimensional viscous length y becomes nearly 1 a requirement for the present k omega sst turbulence model for captive model simulations the forward perpendicular fp and afterward perpendicular ap of the hull lies between 0 5 x l pp 0 5 distance between fp and inflow boundary is 1 5l pp and the same distance is utilized between midship and bottom boundary distance between ap and outflow boundary is 2 0l pp as boundary conditions inflow outflow no slip and z symmetry conditions are applied for open rudder simulations hull block is replaced by rectangular external block as shown in fig 4 the size of the external block in x y and z direction is set in such a way that the length of each perimeter is at least 25c max where c max is the maximum chord length of the rudder to avoid domain size dependency in cfd solutions the rudder is completely submerged under the water 3 3 configurations of captive model tests to be simulated by the viscous cfd table 3 summarizes configurations of captive model tests to be simulated by the viscous cfd in order to obtain all the necessary manoeuvring parameters to the mmg model these configurations were carefully determined by the following criteria condition of resistance and self propulsion 1 4 in table 3 is simple e g β r and δ are all zero according to existing free running model tests yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 kvlcc2 is subjected to maximum β approximately 10 deg at 20 20 zig zag motion and thus the range of β is set as 12 deg β 12 deg for static drift configuration 5 in table 2 utilizing the same experimental data yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 it is found that the hull is subjected to maximum r at 20 20 zig zag motion approximately 0 1 however it is necessary to approximate hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the hull as a function of r therefore the range of r is set as 0 8 r 0 8 for steady turn configuration 9 in table 2 for static rudder configuration the rudder angle is set as 20 deg δ 20 deg 11 in table 3 since the maximum δ is 20 deg at 20 20 zig zag motion the maximum δ for open rudder configuration is set as 20 deg 12 in table 3 due to the same reason to estimate components of effective rudder inflow velocity u r v r flow straightening coefficient γ r and effective longitudinal coordinate of rudder position l r different δ must be set in static drift and steady turn configurations 7 and 10 in table 3 see section 3 4 for this reason to obtain cross coupling terms explained in 3 4 3 several β with non zero r must be set at static drift configuration without rudder angle 6 in table 3 3 4 identification of manoeuvring parameters for the mmg model 3 4 1 nondimensionalization forces and moments are nondimensionalized by eqs 2 and 3 as 2 f f o r c e 0 5 ρ u 2 l p p d 3 n m o m e n t 0 5 ρ u 2 l p p 2 d the same definition will be adopted to nondimensionalize hydrodynamic coefficients which will be explained in 3 4 3 and later mass is nondimensionalized by eq 4 as 4 m m a s s 0 5 ρ l p p 2 d surge and sway velocity components as well as yaw angular velocity are nondimensionalized utilizing characteristic velocity u and characteristic length l pp 3 4 2 3dof equations of motions in the mmg model the equations of motions in ship fixed coordinate system in the present mmg model are written in nondimensional form as 5 m m x u m m y v m r x g m r 2 x 6 m m y v m m m x u r x g m r y 7 i z g x g 2 m j z r x g m v m u r n m where m expresses nondimensional mass of the hull m x and m y are added mass coefficient in surge and sway direction respectively the nondimensional longitudinal centre of gravity in the ship fixed frame is x g shown in fig 1 where midship to fp is the positive x direction the nondimensional moment of inertia around z axis is i zg which assumes the radius of gyration of 0 25l pp the nondimensional added moment of inertia around z axis is j z the prime in in eqs 5 7 means that they are nondimensionalized one of the key formulations of the mmg model is to decompose the right hand side of eqs 5 7 as 8 x x h x r x p 9 y y h y r 10 n m n h n r where subscripts h r and p denote hull rudder and propeller respectively 3 4 3 hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on hull and rudder in the present study surge and sway force coefficients x h y h and yaw moment coefficient n h acting on the hull are defined by eqs 11 13 respectively following the definition of the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 as 11 x h x 0 x v v v m 2 x v r m m y v m r x r r x g m r 2 x v v v v v m 4 12 y h

coefficient of the hull excluding rudder at straight ahead configuration y 0 and n 0 are sway force and yaw moment coefficient respectively acting on the hull excluding rudder at straight ahead configuration attention must be paid when validation of x h y h and n h is carried out between experimental and computational results these variables obtained from the present cfd do not include inertial components to make direct comparison of present computational results to the experimental data centrifugal centripetal and coriolis components are analytically calculated and added to the cfd results rudder force coefficients x r y r rudder moment coefficient n r and surge interaction force coefficient x p due to propeller are expressed by eqs 14 17 respectively following the definition of the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 as 14 x r 1 t r f n sin δ 15 y r 1 a h f n cos δ 16 n r x r a h x h f n cos δ 17 x p 1 t t where f n is the rudder normal force coefficient t is the propeller thrust nondimensionalized by the same manner as eq 2 the parameters t r a h and x h are termed as hull rudder interaction coefficients the parameter x r is the nondimensinal longitudinal position of the rudder which is set to 0 5 for the present study and 1 t is the thrust deduction factor 3 4 4 estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients of the hull considering two configurations e g static drift at r 0 and steady turn at β 0 deg i e v m 0 rhs of eqs 11 13 are expressed as polynomial functions of v m and r therefore polynomial coefficients x vv x vvvv y v y vvv n v n vvv x rr y r y rrr n r n rrr are obtained by least square curve fitting lscf to obtain cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients e g x vr y vvr y vrr n vvr n vrr in eqs 11 13 static drift configuration with non zero r is considered in such case rhs of eqs 11 13 are expressed as functions of v m utilizing linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients e g x vv x vvvv y v y vvv n v n vvv x rr y r y rrr n r n rrr which are already calculated and thus known variables cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained by lscf 3 4 5 estimation of hull rudder interaction coefficients hull rudder interaction coefficients are obtained utilizing static rudder configuration according to the definition of the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 hull surge and sway force coefficients x y and yaw moment coefficient n m around the midship are defined by eqs 18 20 respectively introducing hull rudder interaction coefficients as 18 x x 0 1 t t 1 t r f n sin δ 19 y 1 a h f n cos δ 20 n m x r a h x h f n cos δ given x 0 and 1 t obtained from resistance and self propulsion conditions respectively x becomes a linear function of f n sinδ in the meantime y and n m also become linear functions of f n cosδ therefore the lscf of eqs 18 20 estimates 1 t r 1 a h and x r a h x h respectively 3 4 6 estimation of effective rudder inflow velocity and flow straightening coefficients according to the reference yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 following procedures are made to obtain nondimensional values of effective rudder inflow velocity u r v r γr and l r 1 first consider static drift r 0 and steady turn β 0 deg configurations and set zero and nonzero δ on these configurations estimate f n 2 second generate a x y plot for which x axis is δ and y axis is f n the cross point of f n 0 on x axis gives a certain value of δ for which it is termed δ fn0 in the meantime the gradient of f n with respect to δ can be obtained e g f n δ 3 third compute u r and v r by eq 24 and eq 25 respectively as 21 a f n δ δ δ f n 0 22 b l p p d a r 23 c 1 f α 1 δ f n 0 2 24 u r a b c 25 v r u r δ f n 0 where f α in eq 23 is so called gradient coefficient of rudder normal force estimated by the fujii s formula liu and hekkenberg 2017 as 26 f α 6 13 λ λ 2 25 4 forth obtain γ r and l r in eq 25 v r is a function of β at static drift configuration while it is a function of r at steady turn configuration therefore γ r will be determined by eqs 27 and 28 respectively as 27 β r β l r r 28 v r γ r β r where β r is the geometrical inflow angle to the rudder setting β equals to 0 in eq 27 re arrangement of eqs 27 and 28 yields 29 v r γ r l r r the lscf of v r as a linear function of r with known γr gives l r 3 4 7 estimation of ratio of wake fraction at rudder position relative to propeller position and empirical constant for u r the u r of the present mmg model is expressed by eq 30 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 to take the effect of accelerated flow behind the propeller and propeller open water characteristic of k t t ρn p 2 d p 4 into consideration as 30 u r ε 1 w p η 1 κ 1 8 k t π j 2 1 2 1 η where ε is the ratio of wake fraction at rudder position relative to propeller position 1 w p is the effective wake fraction in manoeuvring η d p h r κ is the empirical constant for u r to take effect of accelerated flow into consideration n p rps is the propeller rotation speed j is the advance ratio as standard procedure yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 ε and κ are iteratively estimated in such a way that u r obtained by eq 30 converges to u r obtained by eq 24 in the present study ε and κ were estimated following this procedure however the result of ε does not converge to comprehensively accepted value approximately 1 1 according to the reference motora 1997 alternative procedure is adopted to estimate ε at the beginning viscous cfd simulations of open rudder configuration are carried out at δ 10 deg and 20 deg without propeller and obtain the coefficient of rudder normal force f n0 in the meantime obtain the coefficient of rudder normal force f nb from the computational results of static rudder simulations without propeller then define two different rudder inflow velocities u 0 and u r0 where u 0 is from open rudder configuration which is 1 in non dimensional form and u r0 is from static rudder configuration respectively according to identity method of rudder normal force fujino and ishiguro 1984 u r0 is estimated by eq 31 as 31 u r 0 u 0 f n b f n 0 the u r0 is considered to be the wake fraction at rudder position without propeller effect it is defined as 1 w r then ε is estimated by eq 32 as 32 ε 1 w r 1 w p 0 where 1 w p0 is the wake fraction of self propelled straight ahead configuration with δ 0 deg empirical formula eq 33 for κ is utilized for the present study according to the reference motora 1997 as 33 κ 0 6 ε 3 4 8 effective wake fraction in manoeuvring propeller inflow velocity in manoeuvring is quite different from straight ahead and thus 1 w p should be expressed as a function of β and r in the present procedure static drift and steady turn simulations at δ 0 deg are carried out first among these simulations n p is set in such a way that the ship is in self propulsion at model point in straight ahead δ 0 deg configuration then define the geometrical inflow angle β p to the propeller in manoeuvring as 34 β p β l p r according to the present mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 the w p will be modeled by eq 35 as a function of β p 35 w p w p 0 e x p c 0 β p 2 the coefficient c 0 in the rhs of eq 35 is determined by lscf 3 4 9 expression of thrust coefficient surf has a capability to compute propeller open water characteristics including k t by simplified propeller model based on infinite bladed theory hino et al 2008 estimated k t is expressed as a 2nd order polynomial in terms of advance ratio j as 36 k t k 2 j 2 k 1 j k 0 the lscf of eq 36 will determine k 0 k 1 and k 2 3 5 computational configurations for captive model simulations by cfd and zig zag simulations by the mmg model flow conditions for captive model simulations are summarized in table 3 two nondimensional parameters are introduced to represent flow conditions the reynolds number rn and the froude number fn based on l pp and u the running attitude of the ship is fixed at even keel with designed draught for all the cases all the simulations with the exception of 2 are carried out without free surface in order to save computational expense the rn for simulations 1 2 4 5 7 9 12 is identical to the experimental condition by ueno et al 2009 ueno et al 2009 the rn for simulation 3 is the same as measurement condition of nominal wake for kvlcc2 by lee et al 2003 lee et al 2003 for which it is also adopted as validation data at gothenburg 2010 cfd workshop larsson et al 2013 the rn for simulation 8 is identical to the experimental condition by kume et al 2006 kume et al 2006 notice that the hull form used for their experiment is kvlcc2m which has minor geometrical difference in the stern region compared to kvlcc2 utilized in the present study yet the effects of the difference in c tm and nominal wake distribution at straight ahead configuration are negligibly small as reported in hino 2005 hino 2005 simulation 2 is carried out with free surface in order to estimate c w which will be one of the necessary input parameters for the mmg model this fn is the same as the experimental data for gothenburg 2010 cfd workshop larsson et al 2013 for simulation 4 self propulsion point is set at model point which is consistent to the experiment ueno et al 2009 although simulation 4 is carried out under double model flow configuration the effect of free surface is included to the propeller loading by setting the model ship correlation allowance c a being the same as c w obtained by simulations 1 and 2 by three dimensional extrapolation method table 4 summarizes the computational configurations of for zig zag simulations by the present mmg model added mass m x m y as well as added moment of inertia around z axis j z are obtained from empirical based chart by motora 1997 4 results 4 1 grid convergence study prior to identify manoeuvring parameters grid convergence study is carried out in order to confirm discretization sensitivity in space for the present computational results setting the grid used for captive model simulations shown in table 2 as medium grid coarse and fine grids are systematically prepared using the refinement ratio r g 2 0 25 in i j k directions the total number of cells is 2 31 m and 6 30 m for coarse and fine grids respectively since it is not realistic to quantify grid uncertainty for all the cases presented in table 3 three representative cases are selected for grid convergence study which are 1 resistance and self propulsion simulations 1 and 4 in tables 3 and 2 static drift at β 12 deg with δ 0 deg one case from simulation 5 in tables 3 and 3 steady turn at r 0 2 with δ 0 deg one case from simulation 9 in table 3 the parameters subjected to the analysis are total resistance coefficient c tm from resistance simulation self propulsion coefficients 1 t 1 w p0 and n p from self propulsion simulation x y n m and f n from static drift and steady turn simulations grid convergence is evaluated by the factor of safety method proposed by xing and stern 2010 xing and stern 2010 in table 5 ε 21 and ε 32 are the solution change between fine grid s1 and medium grid s2 and medium grid to coarse grid s3 respectively the convergence ratio r is defined as 37 r ε 21 ε 32 when 0 0 r 1 0 monotonic convergence is achieved and the richardson extrapolation is used to estimate the order of accuracy p g and grid error δ g defined as 38 p g ln ε 32 ε 21 ln r g 39 δ g ε 21 r g p g 1 when 1 0 r 0 0 the type of convergence is classified as oscillatory convergence when r 1 0 the grid convergence is not achieved the distant metric p is defined as 40 p p g p t h where p th is the theoretical order of accuracy which is 2 for the present study when monotonic convergence is achieved the grid uncertainty u g is estimated according to p as 41 u g f s p δ g 2 45 0 85 p δ g 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 δ g p 1 when oscillatory convergence is achieved the u g is estimated by 42 u g 0 5 s u s l where s u and s l are the oscillation maximum and oscillation minimum of the solutions from the grids table 5 summarizes the results of grid convergence study for hydrodynamic forces and moment coefficients as well as propulsion parameters for resistance self propulsion and static drift simulations most of the parameters show grid convergence in the meantime ε 21 is below 1 s1 different to these simulations only f n shows grid convergence in steady turn case it is likely that the solutions from steady turn may be more sensitive to the grid density than those from resistance self propulsion and static drift cases this implies that hydrodynamic coefficients related to yaw rate could be affected by the grid density 4 2 resistance and self propulsion cases 1 in table 3 table 6 summarizes experimental and computational results of c tm form factor 1 k 1 w p0 1 t relative rotative efficiency η r and n p at model point respectively for resistance quantities they are well estimated within 3 of difference relative to the experimental results on the other hand 7 of difference can be seen in the self propulsion quantities fig 5 describes experimental lee et al 2003 and computational results of nominal wake distribution on the propeller plane the overall trend in axial momentum defect can be predicted by the present cfd yet local quantities e g hook shape of bilge vortex and wake peak at 12 o clock could be improved further according to the reference larsson et al 2013 their computational accuracies can be improved by introducing higher order turbulence model and local grid refinement 4 3 static rudder cases fig 6 shows experimental and computational results of x y n m and f n obtained from static rudder cases as a function of δ the computational results of y and n m show excellent agreement to the experimental data within 4 of difference with the exception at δ 20 deg the computational results of f n show 16 difference to the experimental data at δ 20 deg yet its linear profile as a function of δ is well predicted in terms of x it is the difference between hull resistance and propeller thrust and thus it is one order of magnitude smaller than those of y and n m although accurate estimation of x is challenging the present cfd simulation is able to capture its parabolic profile fig 7 presents experimental and computational results of propeller thrust as a function of δ the computational results 15 smaller t than that of the experiment which is most probably due to underestimation of n p by the present cfd discussed in section 4 1 fig 8 plots the same results as fig 6 in x y and n m yet the horizontal axis is either f n sinδ or f n cosδ in order to utilize eqs 14 16 to estimate hull rudder interaction coefficients for which the results are summarized in table 7 computational result of 1 t r is 52 larger than that of the experimental data which means that longitudinal interaction between rudder and hull is underestimated by the present simulation computational result of 1 a h is approximately 10 smaller than that of the experimental data it indicates that present cfd underestimates the ratio of increase in y due to rudder deflection being 10 smaller to the experiment computational result of x h is approximately 30 smaller than that of the experimental data this implies that the present computation predicts acting point of increased y due to rudder deflection being shifted 30 toward forward perpendicular of the ship in comparison to the experiment to investigate the effect of rudder horn to f n and hull rudder interaction coefficients the results by araki et al 2015 araki et al 2015 is referenced who carried out viscous cfd simulation of kvlcc2 static rudder at δ 10 deg without with rudder horn under the same flow condition as the present study table 8 summarizes hull rudder interaction coefficients without and with rudder horn total number of cells for these simulations is almost doubled compared to the present grid to mimic the geometry of rudder horn in the meantime to construct proper overset donor receptor information specifically at thin gap between rudder horn and movable rudder fig 9 depicts distribution of pressure coefficient in the stern vicinity without and with horn in the first row of fig 9 the movable rudder is eliminated from the drawing just for visualization purpose all the hull rudder interaction coefficients estimated with rudder horn are improved relative to those of without rudder horn the presence of the rudder horn changes the negative pressure distribution the source of f n at upper half of the rudder which yields increase in f n by 4 for with horn relative to without horn one of the reasons to cause such change of pressure distribution is the flow through the gap between the horn and the movable part of the rudder which is similar to the results from cura hochbaum et al 2008 hochbaum et al 2008 the presence of rudder horn also changes pressure distribution on the hull specifically at stern overhang region where asymmetric pressure distribution between port and starboard is more pronounced in with horn than without horn in consequence reproducing rudder horn yields 1 increase f n and 2 pronounced asymmetric pressure distribution on the stern overhang region they are likely to improve the computational accuracy in hull rudder interaction coefficients 4 4 static drift and steady turn cases δ 0 deg fig 10 shows experimental and computational results of x h y h n h and f n obtained from static drift cases at δ 0deg as a function of v m at 0 069 v m 0 208 12 deg β 4 deg computational results of y h and n h agree well with the experimental data within the difference of 5 at 0 208 v m 0 069 4 deg β 12 deg the averaged difference of y h and n h between the computational and experimental results becomes 16 which indicates the computational accuracy changes depending on the sign of v m or β computational results of y h and n h almost behave as odd function with respect to v m 0 on the other hand the experimental data especially for y h is not if there were no propeller effects on flow domain y h and n h should have behaved as pure odd function with respect to v m 0 provided that r 0 it is therefore likely that the propeller hull interaction becomes apparent in the experimental data of y h and the present cfd tends to underestimate such effect especially at v m 0 or β 0 computational results of x h are approximately 7 smaller than those of experimental results among all v m possible reason to cause this difference is discussed in terms of t from static drift configuration with δ 0 deg in fig 11 and kt in fig 12 computational results of t is approximately 13 smaller than that of experiment which is consistent to the fact that the computational results of n p at self propulsion point is smaller than that of experiment in the present study n p is constant for both experiment and computation which means that t is largely affected by the computational accuracy of propeller open water characteristic of k t as well as by propeller inflow velocity e g wake distribution on the propeller plane from the past free running model tests of present hull14 the propeller working point is 0 19 j 0 27 among this range the computational results of k t in open water agree well with the experiment as shown in fig 12 therefore one reason to cause the difference in t is likely to wake distribution on the propeller plane another possible reason is the propeller modeling the present body force model does not include the effect of inclined inflow to the propeller this can be achieved by for instance the method proposed by broglia et al 2012 broglia et al 2012 in body force modeling or utilizing fully discretized propeller the former broglia et al 2012 reports the improvement in propeller hull rudder interaction computational results of f n agree well with the experimental data within the acceptable range i e the average difference between computational and experimental results over v m is approximately 9 similar to y h and n h the computational results of f n at 0 208 v m 0 069 4 deg β 12 deg is slightly worse than that of at 0 069 v m 0 208 12 deg β 4 deg the local flow around the rudder with propeller effect estimated by the present cfd may include some discrepancy to that of the experiment which yields the difference in f n as t changes circulatory and accelerated flow due to propeller effect change once the computational accuracy of t is improved it will contribute to improve computational accuracy of local flow around the rudder with propeller effect and resultant f n fig 13 shows experimental kume et al 2006 and computational results of axial flow distribution at x l pp 0 48 in the static drift β 12 deg without propeller computational result reproduces the trend of separated flow from the hull due to inflow from upstream port well compared to the experimental data yet the present computation underestimates the axial momentum defect specifically at the centre of separated flow originated from starboard bow this is due to lack of spacial resolution at its path in the meantime estimated eddy viscosity by the present turbulence model is likely to add excessive viscous diffusion to the flow xing et al 2012 xing et al 2012 reported that the resolution of this flow can be improved by introducing local refinement adapted to the path of separated flow and higher order turbulence model such as detached eddy simulation des fig 14 shows the three dimensional vortical structures at static drift β 12 deg in the stern vicinity without with propeller effect depicted by q criterion hunt et al 1988 q 300 iso surface there are four major vortical structures around the hull a is originated from stern and lower edge of the rudder b is originated from bow at starboard side c is originated from upper edge of the rudder without propeller inflow direction is from upstream port to downstream starboard and thus flow separation becomes apparent at starboard side once the propeller operates accelerated axial and circulatory flows are added in the rudder vicinity propeller acceleration has straightening effect to the flow at its downstream and thus vortices a are slightly weakened while c is slightly strengthened d is generated by the effect of body force propeller since the present simulations are all steady state these vortices do not change their strength and location in time xing et al 2012 xing et al 2012 studied the instability of these vortices using des with sufficient spacial resolution and small time steps fig 15 shows experimental and computational results of x h y h n h and f n obtained from steady turn cases at δ 0 deg as a function of r fig 16 shows experimental and computational results of t from steady turn cases at δ 0 deg as a function of r among all range of r the computational results of y h and n h agree quite well with the experimental data within the average difference of 3 for x h the difference becomes more than 60 at r 0 8 for t the computational results underestimate the thrust by 14 in average over the entire range of r as t is underestimated by the present cfd propeller hull interaction is likely to be underestimated as well and thus it could be one of the reasons for large discrepancy in x h another possible reason is the lack of local flow resolution for the present cfd at r 0 8 local flow around the hull is subjected to encounter rapid change due to large angular velocity lack of resolution for such physics may yield large discrepancy in x h fig 17 summarizes the computational and experimental results of effective wake fraction obtained from static drift and steady turn at δ 0 deg as a function of β p the fitting curve based on the cfd agrees well with that of based on the experimental data yet the discrepancy between the two becomes apparent for larger β p table 9 summarizes ing parameters obtained from the results presented in figs 10 12 15 and 17 4 5 steady turn with non zero β δ 0 deg and r 0 2 fig 18 shows experimental and computational results of x h y h n h and f n obtained from steady turn cases r 0 2 at δ 0 deg as a function of v m fig 19 shows experimental and computational results of t from steady turn cases r 0 2 at δ 0 deg as a function of v m the trends of computational results in y h n h and f n are similar to the results at v m 0 shown in fig 10 i e static drift with r 0 the average difference of these forces and moment coefficients between computational and experimental results are also similar to those of shown in fig 10 with the exception in v m 0 208 β 12 deg for x h the trend is different to that of static drift with r 0 it linearly increases as a function of v m and the difference between experimental and computational results is 4 which is 1 8 times smaller than that of static drift cases shown in fig 10 the difference of t between computational and experimental results is 10 which is the similar magnitude as the static drift cases in fig 11 over the entire range of v m this indicates that the effect of r 0 2 is less significant to computational accuracy in t this makes it difficult to identify the reason of improvement for computational accuracy in x h fig 20 shows the changes of three dimensional vortical structure shown in fig 14 by the effect of r 0 2 due to the presence of r a and d are strengthened b is deformed while c is not affected by r table 10 summarizes cross coupling manoeuving parameters obtained from the results shown in fig 18 the difference is relatively large

simulations e g x rr y r y rrr n r n rrr are utilized for lscf to obtain cross coupling parameters shown in table 9 the computational accuracy in pre estimated manoeuvring parameters is likely to deteriorate the accuracy of lscf and thus yields large difference in cross coupling manoeuvring parameters 4 6 effective rudder inflow and flow straightening coefficient obtained from static drift and steady turn δ 0 deg and δ 0 deg fig 21 summarizes f n as a function of δ and u r v r as a function of β r from static drift and steady turn tests with δ 0 deg and δ 0 deg the lscf lines by eqs 27 and 28 are added to β r vs v r plot since the gradient of v r relative to β r is γ r although the γ r slightly differs between starboard helm and port helm as pointed out by the reference yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 the present study adopts the γ r from starboard helm since the experimental data to calculate γ r from port helm were not measured ueno et al 2009 at δ 0 deg the computational results of f n agree well with the experimental data while at δ 0 deg several computational results show remarkable differences to the experimental data this yields differences in u r and v r estimated by eqs 24 and 25 respectively as previously studied in the references yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 motora 1997 the γ r plays extremely important role in estimating ships manoeuvrability by modular type mathematical models fig 22 shows term by term plot of eq 24 excluding constants since eq 24 directly affects v r and resultant γ r the computational results of δ fn0 almost capture the trend of experimental data while the computational results of f n δ scatters with respect to the experimental data it is originated from inaccuracy in the computational results of f n from static drift and steady turn with δ 0 as previously discussion in section 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 the computational accuracy in f n can be improved by 1 reproducing the geometry of rudder horn 2 modifying the propeller model and 3 introducing higher order turbulence model these will also contribute to improve estimation of γ r table 11 summarizes γ r and l r obtained from the results shown in fig 21 the variables of ε and κ are put in the same table since they are closely related to γ r and l r please notice that the computational result of ε is the average of open rudder simulations at δ 10 deg and 20 deg 4 7 10 10

compared to free run with the difference of 0 6 deg while the difference becomes 7 deg for 2nd osa cfd mmg estimates 1st osa 4 deg larger than that of free run these trends are common to the results

running model tests the present cfd estimates linear hydrodynamic coefficients very well within the difference of 3 with the exception in y v for the estimation of non linear and cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients by the present cfd it is found that computational accuracy for forces and moment coefficients of the hull must be improved when large drift angle and or yaw angular velocity yet it is also found that the sensitivity of non linear and cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients to the trajectory of kvlcc2 is less significant compared to liner hydrodynamic coefficients for better estimations of propeller hull interaction coefficients by the present cfd computational accuracy for f n must be improved which can be achieved by 1 introducing higher order turbulence model 2 reproducing the geometry of rudder horn and 3 modifying the propeller model for better estimation of effective propeller inflow velocity it is crucial to estimate f n δ with sufficient accuracy inaccurate estimation of f n at static drift and steady turn with δ 0 deg yields deterioration in the effective propeller inflow velocity and resultant γ r accurate estimation of f n will also contribute to improve computational accuracy in propeller hull interaction coefficients when the manoeuvring parameters purely obtained from the present cfd are utilized for 10 10 and 20 20 zig zag simulations of kvlcc2 4 deg to 6 deg of differences are apparent to the overshoot angles from free running model tests when three manoeuvring parameters y v γ r and a h identified by simple

22548,through reasonable structure design this work made the blades that make up the impeller of turbine automatically opened and closed under the force of ocean current realizing the capture of ocean current energy in different directions which greatly improved the power generation efficiency of the turbine the design of this turbine breaks the traditional integral single blade design idea divides the traditional integral blade that constitutes the large impeller into a series of sub blades and solves the contradiction of the opposite torque caused by the water flow in the left and right blades during the rotation of the impeller the control system composed of the fan shaped angle control grooves and the gravity tilted rotors realized the automatic opening and closing of the blades under the force of ocean current the blades were designed into fish shape based on the principle of fluid dynamics to reduce the water flow resistance the physical model test and numerical simulation of the power generation efficiency of the device were carried out to verify the feasibility of the design model and the results showed that the energy utilization efficiency of the new vertical axis ocean current turbine was higher than that of the traditional single blade turbine keywords vertical axis turbine structural design control system ocean current energy 1 introduction in the recent decades many countries have done a lot of research on the design of wind turbines developed ocean current generators based on wind turbines and put them into operation many kinds of horizontal axis wind or ocean current turbines have been designed and researched for instance traditional horizontal axis wind turbines are mainly designed as upwind configuration so in order to avoid blade strikes the rotor blades have to be positioned far enough away from the turbine tower and have to be designed as inflexible as possible wang et al 2018 and a new semi active fuzzy control strategy is proposed for controlling edgewise vibrations of wind turbine blades under extreme wind chen et al 2015 besides as a green sustainable energy source ocean current energy has also received the attention and development of all countries ocean current power does not occupy land resources and it never stops day et al 2015 zanforlin et al 2016 horizontal axis marine current turbine hamct is widely used as an obtaining devise for tidal energy blade element momentum theory bemt and cfd have been conducted on this devise noruzi et al 2015 so far it seems that horizontal axis wind turbines have won the competition with vertical axis wind turbines in the large scale wind power industry however in the field of tidal stream energy exploitation it is still too soon to make a conclusion about their competition chen et al 2018 vertical axis ocean current turbine is being improved and put into use gradually initially the vertical axis turbines are in the form of fixed declination angle structure when the fixed declination angle turbine is in operation the blades are fixed on the rotating shaft and no rotation occurs on the blades this type of structure is relatively simple and reliable with the deepening of research the shortcomings of fixed declination angle turbine are gradually found its self starting performance is poor and often requires a large flow rate to achieve self starting of fixed angle turbines low energy utilization which directly affects the economics of vertical axis turbines therefore people began to develop variable declination angle turbines which can be divided into active control and passive control according to the different angle control mechanisms previously garrett and cummins 2007 studied the maximum output power of a channel from an oceanography point of view by treating the turbine as a black box and the channel as a two dimensional flow with lateral boundary whelan et al 2009 studied the maximum output power of a channel by treating the channel as a two dimensional flow with vertical boundary recently one of the axial turbines with movable blades named as hunter turbine was investigated by yang and lawn 2011 2013 which was reported to be more efficient than conventional vertical fixed blades turbines in addition research has been done through two dimensional numerical cfd simulations to enhance the hydrodynamic performance of a low cut in speed current vertical axis tidal turbine vatt by means of the nested hybridization of savonius and darrieus ed dı n fertahi et al 2018a a 2d numerical model is built to simulate the influence of induced speed on the hydrodynamic loads of vertical axis turbines vats sheng et al 2016 and on the base of that research a vertical axis tidal turbine with movable blades was investigated using experimental and numerical methods a laboratory model of this turbine type nominated as hunter turbine was manufactured and tested in an established test rig in the next step 3d steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were solved by cfd using k ω turbulence model to predict turbine s performance derakhshan et al 2017a so we can conclude that the ocean current power generation technology has developed to some extent but there are still many technical defects for example the existing horizontal axis ocean current power generation device can effectively utilize ocean current but its structure is complicated and the stability is poor nash and phoenix 2017 zhu et al 2018 in order to realize the utilization of ocean currents in all directions a yaw axis must be set which increases the complexity of the structure and makes the device efficiency limited by the sensitivity of the yaw axis and is not universal in ocean current environment based on the above deficiencies this paper proposes a new design on vertical axis ocean current power generation device that is more applicable in a variable ocean current environment and innovatively divides the traditional monolithic blade into a plurality of sub blades which solves the problem that the left and right blades are in the contradiction of producing opposite torque subjected to water flow during the rotation of the impeller besides the vertical axis design effectively achieves 360 degree capture of the horizontal flow the fish shaped blade design reduces the water flow resistance during the opening and closing process of blades the control system consisting of the gravity inclined rotors and the fan shaped grooves realize the automatic opening and closing of the blade under the force of ocean current so the new type of ocean current turbine has more advantages in terms of stability applicability and effectiveness compared with previous design and research 2 design principle separate design concept refers to the design concept that the sub blades can move on the impeller frame to achieve automatic opening and closing and can be separated from the frame which is different from the conventional fixed blade design concept since sub blades based on this design can realize automatic opening and closing during the movement of the impeller sub blades on one side of the impeller frame can be fully opened and separated from the impeller frame during the movement of the impeller that is different from the blades on the conventional turbine impeller frame which are always fixed together with the impeller frame so this design concept is called separate design concept the control system for each blade of the power generation device is mainly composed of a fan shaped angle controlling groove a gravity tilted rotor and a direction tail the gravity tilted rotor system includes a small steel ball and a t shaped lever and the main structure of the gravity tilted rotor is fixed by providing two fixed levers at the upper portion of the frame the function of the gravity tilted rotor system is to adjust the force state of the blade our fish shaped blade design is primarily based on the principle of bionics considering when the fish swim in the water its fusiform body shape can reduce the water flow resistance the blades of this designed turbine is similar to the swimming fish in the water during their movement so the fish shaped blades have the advantages of reducing the water flow resistance this work consists of a central main shaft an outer arc frame vertical bionic fish shaped blades lower grooves horizontal bearings upper gravity tilted rotors and directional tails the power generation system includes a central main shaft fish shaped blades bearings etc in practice the base shown in the model can be fixed to the sea floor by the lower anchoring system as shown in fig 1 2 1 overall structural design traditional turbine has only one blade at the edge of each frame while the proposed turbine has multiple sub blades on each frame as shown in fig 1 thus dividing each integral blade into multiple sub blades improves power efficiency mainly because the area which bears the ocean current force is increased see figs 2 and 3 for physical model so the proposed turbine can get more ocean current energy and generate power more efficiently than conventional turbine in uni directional current which improves the power efficiency overall the turbine is based on vertical axis design to achieve 360 capture of horizontal ocean currents the central spindle is connected to the base through the generator casing and is connected to the impeller composed of the frame structure by welding the blade is connected to the frame structure through the control system and an outer arc frame is arranged at the edge of the impeller to achieve the purpose of collecting water the blade of the device is characterized in that the arcs on both sides of the blade are designed in accordance with the outer contour of the fish as shown in fig 4 the blade can form a non impacting water nozzle approximately when the impeller rotates against the direction of the water flow which can greatly reduce the impact and friction between the water flow and the blade reduce the loss of the kinetic energy of the impeller and improve the efficiency of power generation 2 2 control system design the control system for each blade of the power generation device is mainly composed of a fan shaped angle controlling groove a gravity tilted rotor and a direction tail the gravity tilted rotor system includes a small steel ball and a t shaped lever and the main structure of the gravity tilted rotor is fixed by providing two fixed levers at the upper portion of the frame the function of the gravity tilted rotor system is to adjust the force state of the blade on one hand it can control all the blades to close before the whole device is started on the other hand it can overcome the centrifugal force generated by the blade during the rotation of the impeller making the blade normally closed the lower edge of the outer frame is provided with a groove and the groove is an fan shaped groove with 2 162 opening angle the horizontal axis of the lower edge of the frame is an angle baseline the function of the fan shaped angle controlling groove is to control the rotation angle of the blade within a certain range and improve the flexibility of opening and closing the blade see figs 5 and 6 for the details of control system 2 3 device working principle macroscopically with the motion of ocean current the blades are all closed when the impeller rotates in the direction of water flow so the water flow can push the impeller to rotate and the generator generates electricity when the impeller rotates against the direction of water flow the blades are all opened under the force of water flow and the fish shaped blades can reduce the resistance of water flow to make the power generation efficiency improved meticulously due to the action of the gravity tilted rotor the blade will be completely closed in the initial state then under the force of water flow the water will impact the fully closed blade and push the impeller to rotate while when the impeller on the other side rotates against the water flow direction the blade will be opened to maintain the state parallel to the direction of water flow besides the design of the fish shaped blade can form a non impacting water nozzle approximately which greatly reduce the impact and friction between the water flow and the blade reduce the loss of the kinetic energy of the impeller and improve the power generation efficiency this allows the device to be free from changes in the direction of the ocean current and can be used to receive ocean current energy from a horizontal 360 direction see fig 8 for the physical model test that reflects the working principle therefore compared with the prior work this work has a simpler structure can be assembled on site is not subject to the changes in the direction of ocean current is applicable to a wider sea area and has higher utilization efficiency of ocean current energy 3 experimental research 3 1 experimental arrangement in order to verify the feasibility of the above working principle it is necessary to carry out physical model tests myers and bahaj 2010 derakhshan et al 2017b for this reason the small model that is fabricated and assembled on site is placed in a long open channel with a measured flow velocity of 2 m s and the test effect is observed see fig 7 the model test phenomenon is shown in fig 8 a large model test has also been conducted to test the working effect in complex flow state we found that under the complicated flow state simulated by the propeller the device can still rotate normally according to the above working principle and two lamps are lighted further verifying the feasibility of the practical application of the design model see fig 9 the left side shows the state of the right side of the blade starts to open the middle figure shows the state of the left blade starts to close the right blade is further opened the right side shows the left blade is completely closed the right side of the blade is fully open state it can be obtained that the experimental phenomenon is consistent with the above working principle thus verifying the feasibility of the practical application of the design model see fig 8 in addition in order to test the working effect of the device in complex flow state we conducted a large model test we used a propeller to simulate the complex flow state in a circular cistern and placed the produced large model into the circular pool the large model can work normally with the automatic opening and closing of the blades under the complex flow state see table 1 for the test parameter 3 2 experimental data through model test in the open channel we can obtain the following parameters including the flow velocity v 0 in front of the device and the average inlet velocity v 1 at the leading edge of the impeller as shown in table 2 the flow velocity was measured by a flow velocity meter compared with horizontal axis turbine the inlet velocity v 1 for the vertical axis turbine is not easy to be defined so the inlet velocity v 1 is approximately replaced by the average velocity of the impeller edge inlet velocity besides v 1 is measured by a propeller flow velocity meter the experimental data is used to calculate the average value of the power generation efficiency coefficient which is used to compute the approximate power of the device in the theoretical calculation section 4 theoretical calculation 4 1 force analysis we analyze the force of one of the blades at a certain time during the operation of vertical axis turbine as shown in fig 10 the radius of the turbine is r and the dotted line represents the trajectory of the blade there are two coordinate systems as shown in fig 10 the global coordinate system oxyz and the local coordinate system oxyz the origin point of the global coordinate system is at the center of the turbine and the positive direction of the x axis is the same as the direction of the water flow the origin point of the local coordinate system is taken at the blade rotation axis the x axis positive direction of the local coordinate system is from the head of the blade to the tail hou 2013 wimshurst et al 2018 the velocity of the water flow is v a the angular velocity of the turbine is ω the direction is counterclockwise and θ represents the position angle of the blade and the position of the blade rotation center o in the overall coordinate system can be determined by the position angle of the blade and the radius of the impeller 1 x y o i r i cos θ r i sin θ the force of the water flow caused by a single blade during the operation of the turbine can be decomposed into lift l and resistance d r as shown in fig 10 the force of the blade is not convenient for l and d r according to the principle of force synthesis and decomposition the force of the blade can be converted to the direction along the chord length of the blade and the direction perpendicular to the chord length the f x is used to indicate the force of the blade along the chord length and f y is the force perpendicular to the chord length the force at the center o of the local coordinate system can be expressed as follows 2 f i f x i f y i d r i l i cos α i sin α i sin α i cos α i in order to conveniently represent the force of the turbine the force of the blade can be decomposed into the radial and tangential directions of the turbine f t is the tangential force of the blade and f n is the radial force received by the blade the specific expression is as follows 3 f i f t i f n i d r i l i cos α i ϕ i sin α i ϕ i sin α i ϕ i cos α i ϕ i define f x and f y respectively representing the components of the blade along the x and y axes in the global coordinate system the force of a single blade on the turbine can be expressed as follows 4 f i f x i f y i d r i l i cos α i θ i ϕ i sin α i θ i ϕ i sin α i θ i ϕ i cos α i θ i ϕ i considering the torque at the center of the local coordinate system is m o the moment generated by the action of a single blade at the center of the turbine can be expressed as 5 q i f t i r i m o i r i l i sin α i ϕ i d r i cos α i ϕ i m o i f x is used to indicate the instantaneous thrust received by the impeller f y is the instantaneous lateral force z is the number of blades and q is the instantaneous torque we will get 6 f x i 1 z f x i f y i 1 z f y i q i 1 z q i 7 c p q ω ρ v a 3 r h where r is the radius of the turbine h is the height of the turbine c p represents the energy conversion efficiency of the turbine according to betz theorem the efficiency limit of any energy conversion device is 0 593 and no device can exceed this value c p is the most important indicator of turbine performance 4 2 power calculation in order to make the device suitable for most of sea areas combined with the multi year statistics of various sea areas the flow speed of 2 m s is used for design based on the betz theory a calculation model for solving the power generation and power generation efficiency of ocean current generators is established assume that the forward inlet flow velocity is v 0 the impeller edge inlet velocity is v 1 the induction factor is α v 1 v 0 and the impeller downstream velocity is v then 8 v 1 v 0 α v v 0 2 α 1 the mass of the fluid in the area swept by the impeller per unit time is m v 1 ρ a and the energy input into the area per unit time is 9 e 0 1 2 m v 0 2 1 2 ρ a v 1 v 0 2 similarly the output energy of the area per unit time is e 1 2 m v 2 1 2 ρ a v 1 v 2 so the impeller capture power is 10 p 1 2 ρ a v 1 v 0 2 v 2 eliminate v 0 and v we get 11 p 2 ρ a v 0 3 a 2 1 α so the energy conversion efficiency of the turbine is 12 c p p e 0 p 1 2 ρ a v 0 3 4 α 2 4 α 3 based on the average value of the power generation efficiency coefficient obtained by experimental measurement the approximate power of the device is calculated by the formula 13 p ρ v 0 3 η e η m c p d 2 8 and the relationship between the power generation of the device and the diameter of the device impeller is obtained by matlab as shown in fig 11 through this curve we can find the power generation capacity of the device can reach more than 500 kw when the impeller diameter is 20 m in fig 11 the blue curve is the generated power impeller diameter relationship curve based on experimental data and theoretical calculation while the red points represent the numerical calculation value of the generated power at several discrete points the numerical calculation value and the theoretical relationship curve are well fitted which verifies the reliability of power calculation in this paper 5 numerical simulation in the numerical simulation part the pressure distribution of a single sub blade under fluent action is firstly analyzed which shows the advantage of the fish shaped blade compared with the ordinary blade after that the fish shaped sub blades on each frame of variable angle turbine and fixed angle turbine are simulated and analyzed respectively during their movement the pressure distribution contours under different tip speed ratios show the advantages of the variable angle turbine compared with the fixed angle turbine the flow field distribution around the turbine is more orderly finally two different arrangement ways of turbines is compared which indicates the interlaced arrangement is a better turbine layout way 5 1 flow computation model two commercial computational fluid dynamic cfd software ansys fluent and starccm are used to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and simulate the flow field ansys fluent is used to simulate the pressure distribution of sub blades under fluent action starccm is used to simulate the flow field for two different arrangement ways of turbines besides the numerical computational method is finite volume method fvm the onset ocean current is turbulent as well as the flow across the turbine rotor the effect of the turbulence is modeled with a κ ω sst turbulence model across the entire domain therefore the boundary layer on the blades is also modeled as turbulent it is assumed in fact that biofouling would trigger laminar to turbulent transition at a location in the boundary layer very close to the leading edge chen et al 2018 this choice of the turbulence model is also consistent with that of other authors who tested vat s at similar reynolds numbers considering the opening and closing process of the blade the blade deflection angle of the variable angle turbine is changing if the rotation angle of the turbine at each time step is too large the calculation is not easy to converge if it is too small the calculation time is too long therefore the following scheme is adopted the turbine is rotated by 3 every time step in addition the deflection angle of the blade is also rotated every time step in order to make the deflection angle move according to the specified law it is necessary to borrow the function customization in cfx function hou 2013 in cfx the user can input any function according to his need which can be a complete function expression or a data point that can fully describe the function therefore as long as the function of the law of variation of the deflection angle is input the control of the deflection angle motion of the turbine can be realized in order to make the impeller move according to the specified rules it s necessary to use the secondary development function of cfx user fortran when cfx solves a problem the user can achieve his own calculation object by writing a fortran program the fortran program is recognized by cfx and compiled into a shared library the user can define the cfx solution at a specific time these fortran programs are called in an iteration step or in a specific flow field location and operate on the corresponding data hou 2013 using the user fortran feature as long as you know the structure of the data store you can quickly and easily call the data and reassign them to control the next iteration 5 2 grid information and computational domain a structured grid is a structure with a very regular grid distribution the position of arbitrary grids can be marked by three parameters i j k i minimum orthogonality angle j aspect ratio k mesh expansion factor the i j k between adjacent grid elements is adjacent in number the structured grid does not need to store its topology during the calculation process the structured grid has the advantages of fast dividing speed regular grid shape and neatness in this paper the professional meshing software icem cfd is used for meshing in order to improve the calculation accuracy and save the calculation time the structured grid is used for meshing the grid around the rotor moves following the rotation of the rotor and the grid around the blades rotates when the blades are changing their inclination angle around their pivots to cope with these complex motions the grid is divided into several zones as shown in fig 13 including the blade zones around each blade a rotor zone around the rotor and containing all blade zones an outer zone covering the whole computational domain and the rotor zone the grids in adjacent zones slide along the interfaces the blade zones are further divided into sub zones according to geometric features each zone or sub zone is mapped by a structural mesh with quadrilateral cells as shown in fig 12 5 3 boundary conditions and parameters setting of the model we set the atmospheric pressure as the reference air pressure set the speed inlet condition at the inlet boundary and give the uniform flow velocity v 2 m s see fig 14 the exit boundary adopts the open boundary and the side of the fluid calculation domain also adopts the open type opening besides the blade surface is a non slip wall the rotation domain gives a rotational angular velocity the rotation domain and the static domain are connected through the interface and the flow parameters at the inlet are used to initialize the flow field the transient solver is used to solve the model specific parameters setting of the tested model are listed in table 3 5 4 simulation results and analysis numerical simulation has been done to simulate the pressure distribution around the blade see fig 15 based on the result of numerical simulation which is shown in fig 16 li and li 2014 the following conclusions can be drawn on the one hand the fish shaped blade design can form a non impacting water nozzle at the front edge of the blade approximately on the other hand based on the principle of fluid mechanics a pressure difference can be formed on both sides of the blade to promote further opening of the blade besides the fish shaped sub blades on each frame of variable angle turbine and fixed angle turbine are simulated and analyzed respectively during their movement as shown in fig 17 the pressure distribution under different tip speed ratios shows the advantages of the variable angle turbine compared with the fixed angle turbine the flow field distribution around the turbine is more orderly hou 2013 fig 17 a is the pressure distribution contour for fixed angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 1 fig 17 b is the pressure distribution contour for variable angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 1 fig 17 c is the pressure distribution contour for fixed angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 2 fig 17 d is the pressure distribution contour for variable angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 2 fig 17 e is the pressure distribution contour for fixed angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 3 fig 17 f is the pressure distribution contour for variable angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 3 we can find that with the increase of tip speed ratio both of the flow field distribution around the fixed angle turbine and the variable angle turbine are more chaotic than before but the change of the flow field distribution around the variable angle turbine is smaller than that of the fixed angle turbine in addition the flow field distribution around the variable angle turbine is more orderly under the same tip speed ratio which will make the power and efficiency of the turbine improved through the numerical calculation ed dı n fertahi et al 2018b the power and efficiency of the two devices under basic sea conditions are obtained as shown in table 4 the result of numerical calculation is consistent with above numerical simulation analysis of the flow field distribution around the turbine the above results should be used carefully because of three dimensional effects and the coupling effect among the blades including those due to the arms and the finite length of blades which would reduce the power generation efficiency of the turbine the arrangement of turbines is also a problem worth considering so it is meaningful to simulate the flow field of different turbine arrangements there are two main ways to arrange turbines non interlaced and interlaced as the name implies the non interlaced turbines are not staggered along the flow direction and the interlaced turbines are staggered along the flow direction this work controls the same distance between the turbines and selects the same number of turbines only the arrangement between the turbines is changed to explore the effect of the arrangement on the operation of the ocean current turbines each turbine is simplified to a cylinder for numerical simulation parameters setting of the model are shown in table 5 careful 3d modeling of each turbine will inevitably result in a huge number of grids resulting in the inability to calculate existing computer resources considering the convenience and reliable calculation results of 2d cfd simulation 2d cfd modeling was used to conduct qualitative research hexagonal unstructured grid generated by starccm is used to mesh the zone around the turbines to improve the computation model s robustness the methods of meshing and velocity distribution contour for numerical simulation are shown in figs 18 20 through numerical simulation results we can find that the turbines in the interlaced arrangement have a smaller distribution area of the low velocity water flow region at the front edge of the impeller under the same boundary conditions and water flow conditions and a faster flow velocity can be obtained on both sides of the impeller so this arrangement is more advantageous and improves the power generation efficiency of each turbine some literatures indicate that the staggered arrangement of turbines can make good use of tidal currents guo 2013 this is mainly because the latter row of turbines can effectively avoid the wake of the previous row so the staggered arrangement is preferred which is consistent with the results of above 2d cfd numerical simulation 6 discussion the purpose of this article is to introduce a new kind of design idea of variable declination angle vertical axis turbines using more reasonable controlling strategy to realize the high efficiency use of ocean current variable declination angle vertical axis turbines can be divided into active control and passive control according to the different angle control mechanisms active control adopts cam mechanism hydraulic system or motor system to realize the change of deflection angle the structure of this control mechanism is mostly complicated and the reliability is poor the passive control mainly relies on the force generated by the fluid to realize the change of the blade deflection angle in order to control the range and amplitude of the deflection angle a damping system such as a spring or a mass is added to limit the movement of the deflection angle the structure is relatively simple and the reliability is relatively high but the precise control of the blade yaw angle cannot be achieved this vertical axis turbine based on separate design concept combines the advantages of active control and passive control on the one hand the damping system composed of gravity tilted rotors etc limits the movement of the blades and is beneficial to improve the self starting performance of the turbine on the other hand the fan shaped angle controlling grooves allow precise control of blade deflection angle compared with the horizontal axis turbine this device does not need to set the yaw axis so the structure is simpler the stability is higher the applicative sea area is wider the impact on marine life is smaller and the energy utilization rate is higher compared with the integral vertical axis turbine the control mechanism of this device has better control effect on the blades the blades have better opening and closing flexibility and can realize free feathering with the change of the water flow direction and the blade deflection angle besides the power generation efficiency is higher to realize automatic opening of blades the vertical blade with vertical shaft turbine needs to overcome the gravity effect so it is not easy to control and requires a light weight blade compared with the vertical blade turbine this vertical axis multi blade turbine can eliminate the influence of the blades gravity without limiting the blade material the automatic opening and closing of the blades of the turbine is easier to implement and the control strategy is simpler in general this turbine is applicable to wider sea area is not subject to changes in the direction of ocean current and has more energy utilization rate for ocean current it has simpler structure can be assembled on site and is easy to modularize production therefore the generator set composed of multiple turbines is expected to transport the electric energy generated by the ocean current generator to the land through the submarine cable and provide power for the urban power system as shown in fig 21 in addition the ocean current turbine can be used for the foundation of the offshore wind power structure which can reduce the scouring of the wind power structure foundation prevent the damage of the foundation and realize the comprehensive utilization of wind energy and water energy generators based on this design concept can also be used in the damping design of intelligent buildings those are the future development direction of this research thus this work has great application prospects and promotion value 7 conclusion different from the traditional ocean current power generation device this work provided a new design idea of vertical axis ocean current power generation device its innovative features and advantages are as follows 1 innovation of design concept this device breaks the traditional design idea of single piece blade and divides each integral blade into multiple sub blades which solves the contradiction between the opposite moments caused by water flow in the left and right blades during the rotation of the impeller and different from the horizontal axis ocean current power generation technology widely used at present in which the yaw axis is necessary to be set to realize the capture of ocean current in different directions this work is designed based on the vertical axis to realize the 360 degree capture of ocean current from the horizontal direction 2 control system innovation this turbine is controlled by a control system consisting of fan shaped angle control grooves gravity tilted rotors and directional tails it realizes the automatic opening and closing of the blades and improves the flexibility of opening and closing of blades under the force of ocean current the unique gravity tilted rotor design realizes that the blade automatically closes completely when it is in a natural state and the fan shaped control groove is designed to have an opening angle of 2 162 which realizes the angle control of the blade motion so this control system can make the turbine start automatically and operate stably 3 blade design innovation based on the principle of bionics the device sets the blades that make up the large impeller into fish shape so that the blade can form a non impacting water nozzle approximately when the impeller rotates against the direction of water flow this design reduces the impact and friction between water flow and blades reduces the loss of the kinetic energy of the impeller and improves the power generation efficiency 4 advantages of the turbine this vertical axis multi blade turbine has a simpler structure can be assembled on site is not subject to the changes in the direction of ocean current is applicable to a wider sea area and has higher utilization efficiency of ocean current energy the automatic opening and closing of the blades of the turbine is easier to implement without the need of setting the yaw axis and the control strategy is simpler so this work has certain social value and broad market application prospects 8 future work the main purpose of this article is to introduce a new kind of design idea of variable declination angle vertical axis turbines to control the automatic opening and closing of the sub bladess to realize the high efficiency use of ocean current so only one blade on the same frame was considered in numerical simulation part to explain the superiority of the automatic opening and closing of the blades of the proposed turbine compared with the fixed angle turbine studying the coupling effect among the blades on the same frame is our future work

22548,through reasonable structure design this work made the blades that make up the impeller of turbine automatically opened and closed under the force of ocean current realizing the capture of ocean current energy in different directions which greatly improved the power generation efficiency of the turbine the design of this turbine breaks the traditional integral single blade design idea divides the traditional integral blade that constitutes the large impeller into a series of sub blades and solves the contradiction of the opposite torque caused by the water flow in the left and right blades during the rotation of the impeller the control system composed of the fan shaped angle control grooves and the gravity tilted rotors realized the automatic opening and closing of the blades under the force of ocean current the blades were designed into fish shape based on the principle of fluid dynamics to reduce the water flow resistance the physical model test and numerical simulation of the power generation efficiency of the device were carried out to verify the feasibility of the design model and the results showed that the energy utilization efficiency of the new vertical axis ocean current turbine was higher than that of the traditional single blade turbine keywords vertical axis turbine structural design control system ocean current energy 1 introduction in the recent decades many countries have done a lot of research on the design of wind turbines developed ocean current generators based on wind turbines and put them into operation many kinds of horizontal axis wind or ocean current turbines have been designed and researched for instance traditional horizontal axis wind turbines are mainly designed as upwind configuration so in order to avoid blade strikes the rotor blades have to be positioned far enough away from the turbine tower and have to be designed as inflexible as possible wang et al 2018 and a new semi active fuzzy control strategy is proposed for controlling edgewise vibrations of wind turbine blades under extreme wind chen et al 2015 besides as a green sustainable energy source ocean current energy has also received the attention and development of all countries ocean current power does not occupy land resources and it never stops day et al 2015 zanforlin et al 2016 horizontal axis marine current turbine hamct is widely used as an obtaining devise for tidal energy blade element momentum theory bemt and cfd have been conducted on this devise noruzi et al 2015 so far it seems that horizontal axis wind turbines have won the competition with vertical axis wind turbines in the large scale wind power industry however in the field of tidal stream energy exploitation it is still too soon to make a conclusion about their competition chen et al 2018 vertical axis ocean current turbine is being improved and put into use gradually initially the vertical axis turbines are in the form of fixed declination angle structure when the fixed declination angle turbine is in operation the blades are fixed on the rotating shaft and no rotation occurs on the blades this type of structure is relatively simple and reliable with the deepening of research the shortcomings of fixed declination angle turbine are gradually found its self starting performance is poor and often requires a large flow rate to achieve self starting of fixed angle turbines low energy utilization which directly affects the economics of vertical axis turbines therefore people began to develop variable declination angle turbines which can be divided into active control and passive control according to the different angle control mechanisms previously garrett and cummins 2007 studied the maximum output power of a channel from an oceanography point of view by treating the turbine as a black box and the channel as a two dimensional flow with lateral boundary whelan et al 2009 studied the maximum output power of a channel by treating the channel as a two dimensional flow with vertical boundary recently one of the axial turbines with movable blades named as hunter turbine was investigated by yang and lawn 2011 2013 which was reported to be more efficient than conventional vertical fixed blades turbines in addition research has been done through two dimensional numerical cfd simulations to enhance the hydrodynamic performance of a low cut in speed current vertical axis tidal turbine vatt by means of the nested hybridization of savonius and darrieus ed dı n fertahi et al 2018a a 2d numerical model is built to simulate the influence of induced speed on the hydrodynamic loads of vertical axis turbines vats sheng et al 2016 and on the base of that research a vertical axis tidal turbine with movable blades was investigated using experimental and numerical methods a laboratory model of this turbine type nominated as hunter turbine was manufactured and tested in an established test rig in the next step 3d steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were solved by cfd using k ω turbulence model to predict turbine s performance derakhshan et al 2017a so we can conclude that the ocean current power generation technology has developed to some extent but there are still many technical defects for example the existing horizontal axis ocean current power generation device can effectively utilize ocean current but its structure is complicated and the stability is poor nash and phoenix 2017 zhu et al 2018 in order to realize the utilization of ocean currents in all directions a yaw axis must be set which increases the complexity of the structure and makes the device efficiency limited by the sensitivity of the yaw axis and is not universal in ocean current environment based on the above deficiencies this paper proposes a new design on vertical axis ocean current power generation device that is more applicable in a variable ocean current environment and innovatively divides the traditional monolithic blade into a plurality of sub blades which solves the problem that the left and right blades are in the contradiction of producing opposite torque subjected to water flow during the rotation of the impeller besides the vertical axis design effectively achieves 360 degree capture of the horizontal flow the fish shaped blade design reduces the water flow resistance during the opening and closing process of blades the control system consisting of the gravity inclined rotors and the fan shaped grooves realize the automatic opening and closing of the blade under the force of ocean current so the new type of ocean current turbine has more advantages in terms of stability applicability and effectiveness compared with previous design and research 2 design principle separate design concept refers to the design concept that the sub blades can move on the impeller frame to achieve automatic opening and closing and can be separated from the frame which is different from the conventional fixed blade design concept since sub blades based on this design can realize automatic opening and closing during the movement of the impeller sub blades on one side of the impeller frame can be fully opened and separated from the impeller frame during the movement of the impeller that is different from the blades on the conventional turbine impeller frame which are always fixed together with the impeller frame so this design concept is called separate design concept the control system for each blade of the power generation device is mainly composed of a fan shaped angle controlling groove a gravity tilted rotor and a direction tail the gravity tilted rotor system includes a small steel ball and a t shaped lever and the main structure of the gravity tilted rotor is fixed by providing two fixed levers at the upper portion of the frame the function of the gravity tilted rotor system is to adjust the force state of the blade our fish shaped blade design is primarily based on the principle of bionics considering when the fish swim in the water its fusiform body shape can reduce the water flow resistance the blades of this designed turbine is similar to the swimming fish in the water during their movement so the fish shaped blades have the advantages of reducing the water flow resistance this work consists of a central main shaft an outer arc frame vertical bionic fish shaped blades lower grooves horizontal bearings upper gravity tilted rotors and directional tails the power generation system includes a central main shaft fish shaped blades bearings etc in practice the base shown in the model can be fixed to the sea floor by the lower anchoring system as shown in fig 1 2 1 overall structural design traditional turbine has only one blade at the edge of each frame while the proposed turbine has multiple sub blades on each frame as shown in fig 1 thus dividing each integral blade into multiple sub blades improves power efficiency mainly because the area which bears the ocean current force is increased see figs 2 and 3 for physical model so the proposed turbine can get more ocean current energy and generate power more efficiently than conventional turbine in uni directional current which improves the power efficiency overall the turbine is based on vertical axis design to achieve 360 capture of horizontal ocean currents the central spindle is connected to the base through the generator casing and is connected to the impeller composed of the frame structure by welding the blade is connected to the frame structure through the control system and an outer arc frame is arranged at the edge of the impeller to achieve the purpose of collecting water the blade of the device is characterized in that the arcs on both sides of the blade are designed in accordance with the outer contour of the fish as shown in fig 4 the blade can form a non impacting water nozzle approximately when the impeller rotates against the direction of the water flow which can greatly reduce the impact and friction between the water flow and the blade reduce the loss of the kinetic energy of the impeller and improve the efficiency of power generation 2 2 control system design the control system for each blade of the power generation device is mainly composed of a fan shaped angle controlling groove a gravity tilted rotor and a direction tail the gravity tilted rotor system includes a small steel ball and a t shaped lever and the main structure of the gravity tilted rotor is fixed by providing two fixed levers at the upper portion of the frame the function of the gravity tilted rotor system is to adjust the force state of the blade on one hand it can control all the blades to close before the whole device is started on the other hand it can overcome the centrifugal force generated by the blade during the rotation of the impeller making the blade normally closed the lower edge of the outer frame is provided with a groove and the groove is an fan shaped groove with 2 162 opening angle the horizontal axis of the lower edge of the frame is an angle baseline the function of the fan shaped angle controlling groove is to control the rotation angle of the blade within a certain range and improve the flexibility of opening and closing the blade see figs 5 and 6 for the details of control system 2 3 device working principle macroscopically with the motion of ocean current the blades are all closed when the impeller rotates in the direction of water flow so the water flow can push the impeller to rotate and the generator generates electricity when the impeller rotates against the direction of water flow the blades are all opened under the force of water flow and the fish shaped blades can reduce the resistance of water flow to make the power generation efficiency improved meticulously due to the action of the gravity tilted rotor the blade will be completely closed in the initial state then under the force of water flow the water will impact the fully closed blade and push the impeller to rotate while when the impeller on the other side rotates against the water flow direction the blade will be opened to maintain the state parallel to the direction of water flow besides the design of the fish shaped blade can form a non impacting water nozzle approximately which greatly reduce the impact and friction between the water flow and the blade reduce the loss of the kinetic energy of the impeller and improve the power generation efficiency this allows the device to be free from changes in the direction of the ocean current and can be used to receive ocean current energy from a horizontal 360 direction see fig 8 for the physical model test that reflects the working principle therefore compared with the prior work this work has a simpler structure can be assembled on site is not subject to the changes in the direction of ocean current is applicable to a wider sea area and has higher utilization efficiency of ocean current energy 3 experimental research 3 1 experimental arrangement in order to verify the feasibility of the above working principle it is necessary to carry out physical model tests myers and bahaj 2010 derakhshan et al 2017b for this reason the small model that is fabricated and assembled on site is placed in a long open channel with a measured flow velocity of 2 m s and the test effect is observed see fig 7 the model test phenomenon is shown in fig 8 a large model test has also been conducted to test the working effect in complex flow state we found that under the complicated flow state simulated by the propeller the device can still rotate normally according to the above working principle and two lamps are lighted further verifying the feasibility of the practical application of the design model see fig 9 the left side shows the state of the right side of the blade starts to open the middle figure shows the state of the left blade starts to close the right blade is further opened the right side shows the left blade is completely closed the right side of the blade is fully open state it can be obtained that the experimental phenomenon is consistent with the above working principle thus verifying the feasibility of the practical application of the design model see fig 8 in addition in order to test the working effect of the device in complex flow state we conducted a large model test we used a propeller to simulate the complex flow state in a circular cistern and placed the produced large model into the circular pool the large model can work normally with the automatic opening and closing of the blades under the complex flow state see table 1 for the test parameter 3 2 experimental data through model test in the open channel we can obtain the following parameters including the flow velocity v 0 in front of the device and the average inlet velocity v 1 at the leading edge of the impeller as shown in table 2 the flow velocity was measured by a flow velocity meter compared with horizontal axis turbine the inlet velocity v 1 for the vertical axis turbine is not easy to be defined so the inlet velocity v 1 is approximately replaced by the average velocity of the impeller edge inlet velocity besides v 1 is measured by a propeller flow velocity meter the experimental data is used to calculate the average value of the power generation efficiency coefficient which is used to compute the approximate power of the device in the theoretical calculation section 4 theoretical calculation 4 1 force analysis we analyze the force of one of the blades at a certain time during the operation of vertical axis turbine as shown in fig 10 the radius of the turbine is r and the dotted line represents the trajectory of the blade there are two coordinate systems as shown in fig 10 the global coordinate system oxyz and the local coordinate system oxyz the origin point of the global coordinate system is at the center of the turbine and the positive direction of the x axis is the same as the direction of the water flow the origin point of the local coordinate system is taken at the blade rotation axis the x axis positive direction of the local coordinate system is from the head of the blade to the tail hou 2013 wimshurst et al 2018 the velocity of the water flow is v a the angular velocity of the turbine is ω the direction is counterclockwise and θ represents the position angle of the blade and the position of the blade rotation center o in the overall coordinate system can be determined by the position angle of the blade and the radius of the impeller 1 x y o i r i cos θ r i sin θ the force of the water flow caused by a single blade during the operation of the turbine can be decomposed into lift l and resistance d r as shown in fig 10 the force of the blade is not convenient for l and d r according to the principle of force synthesis and decomposition the force of the blade can be converted to the direction along the chord length of the blade and the direction perpendicular to the chord length the f x is used to indicate the force of the blade along the chord length and f y is the force perpendicular to the chord length the force at the center o of the local coordinate system can be expressed as follows 2 f i f x i f y i d r i l i cos α i sin α i sin α i cos α i in order to conveniently represent the force of the turbine the force of the blade can be decomposed into the radial and tangential directions of the turbine f t is the tangential force of the blade and f n is the radial force received by the blade the specific expression is as follows 3 f i f t i f n i d r i l i cos α i ϕ i sin α i ϕ i sin α i ϕ i cos α i ϕ i define f x and f y respectively representing the components of the blade along the x and y axes in the global coordinate system the force of a single blade on the turbine can be expressed as follows 4 f i f x i f y i d r i l i cos α i θ i ϕ i sin α i θ i ϕ i sin α i θ i ϕ i cos α i θ i ϕ i considering the torque at the center of the local coordinate system is m o the moment generated by the action of a single blade at the center of the turbine can be expressed as 5 q i f t i r i m o i r i l i sin α i ϕ i d r i cos α i ϕ i m o i f x is used to indicate the instantaneous thrust received by the impeller f y is the instantaneous lateral force z is the number of blades and q is the instantaneous torque we will get 6 f x i 1 z f x i f y i 1 z f y i q i 1 z q i 7 c p q ω ρ v a 3 r h where r is the radius of the turbine h is the height of the turbine c p represents the energy conversion efficiency of the turbine according to betz theorem the efficiency limit of any energy conversion device is 0 593 and no device can exceed this value c p is the most important indicator of turbine performance 4 2 power calculation in order to make the device suitable for most of sea areas combined with the multi year statistics of various sea areas the flow speed of 2 m s is used for design based on the betz theory a calculation model for solving the power generation and power generation efficiency of ocean current generators is established assume that the forward inlet flow velocity is v 0 the impeller edge inlet velocity is v 1 the induction factor is α v 1 v 0 and the impeller downstream velocity is v then 8 v 1 v 0 α v v 0 2 α 1 the mass of the fluid in the area swept by the impeller per unit time is m v 1 ρ a and the energy input into the area per unit time is 9 e 0 1 2 m v 0 2 1 2 ρ a v 1 v 0 2 similarly the output energy of the area per unit time is e 1 2 m v 2 1 2 ρ a v 1 v 2 so the impeller capture power is 10 p 1 2 ρ a v 1 v 0 2 v 2 eliminate v 0 and v we get 11 p 2 ρ a v 0 3 a 2 1 α so the energy conversion efficiency of the turbine is 12 c p p e 0 p 1 2 ρ a v 0 3 4 α 2 4 α 3 based on the average value of the power generation efficiency coefficient obtained by experimental measurement the approximate power of the device is calculated by the formula 13 p ρ v 0 3 η e η m c p d 2 8 and the relationship between the power generation of the device and the diameter of the device impeller is obtained by matlab as shown in fig 11 through this curve we can find the power generation capacity of the device can reach more than 500 kw when the impeller diameter is 20 m in fig 11 the blue curve is the generated power impeller diameter relationship curve based on experimental data and theoretical calculation while the red points represent the numerical calculation value of the generated power at several discrete points the numerical calculation value and the theoretical relationship curve are well fitted which verifies the reliability of power calculation in this paper 5 numerical simulation in the numerical simulation part the pressure distribution of a single sub blade under fluent action is firstly analyzed which shows the advantage of the fish shaped blade compared with the ordinary blade after that the fish shaped sub blades on each frame of variable angle turbine and fixed angle turbine are simulated and analyzed respectively during their movement the pressure distribution contours under different tip speed ratios show the advantages of the variable angle turbine compared with the fixed angle turbine the flow field distribution around the turbine is more orderly finally two different arrangement ways of turbines is compared which indicates the interlaced arrangement is a better turbine layout way 5 1 flow computation model two commercial computational fluid dynamic cfd software ansys fluent and starccm are used to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and simulate the flow field ansys fluent is used to simulate the pressure distribution of sub blades under fluent action starccm is used to simulate the flow field for two different arrangement ways of turbines besides the numerical computational method is finite volume method fvm the onset ocean current is turbulent as well as the flow across the turbine rotor the effect of the turbulence is modeled with a κ ω sst turbulence model across the entire domain therefore the boundary layer on the blades is also modeled as turbulent it is assumed in fact that biofouling would trigger laminar to turbulent transition at a location in the boundary layer very close to the leading edge chen et al 2018 this choice of the turbulence model is also consistent with that of other authors who tested vat s at similar reynolds numbers considering the opening and closing process of the blade the blade deflection angle of the variable angle turbine is changing if the rotation angle of the turbine at each time step is too large the calculation is not easy to converge if it is too small the calculation time is too long therefore the following scheme is adopted the turbine is rotated by 3 every time step in addition the deflection angle of the blade is also rotated every time step in order to make the deflection angle move according to the specified law it is necessary to borrow the function customization in cfx function hou 2013 in cfx the user can input any function according to his need which can be a complete function expression or a data point that can fully describe the function therefore as long as the function of the law of variation of the deflection angle is input the control of the deflection angle motion of the turbine can be realized in order to make the impeller move according to the specified rules it s necessary to use the secondary development function of cfx user fortran when cfx solves a problem the user can achieve his own calculation object by writing a fortran program the fortran program is recognized by cfx and compiled into a shared library the user can define the cfx solution at a specific time these fortran programs are called in an iteration step or in a specific flow field location and operate on the corresponding data hou 2013 using the user fortran feature as long as you know the structure of the data store you can quickly and easily call the data and reassign them to control the next iteration 5 2 grid information and computational domain a structured grid is a structure with a very regular grid distribution the position of arbitrary grids can be marked by three parameters i j k i minimum orthogonality angle j aspect ratio k mesh expansion factor the i j k between adjacent grid elements is adjacent in number the structured grid does not need to store its topology during the calculation process the structured grid has the advantages of fast dividing speed regular grid shape and neatness in this paper the professional meshing software icem cfd is used for meshing in order to improve the calculation accuracy and save the calculation time the structured grid is used for meshing the grid around the rotor moves following the rotation of the rotor and the grid around the blades rotates when the blades are changing their inclination angle around their pivots to cope with these complex motions the grid is divided into several zones as shown in fig 13 including the blade zones around each blade a rotor zone around the rotor and containing all blade zones an outer zone covering the whole computational domain and the rotor zone the grids in adjacent zones slide along the interfaces the blade zones are further divided into sub zones according to geometric features each zone or sub zone is mapped by a structural mesh with quadrilateral cells as shown in fig 12 5 3 boundary conditions and parameters setting of the model we set the atmospheric pressure as the reference air pressure set the speed inlet condition at the inlet boundary and give the uniform flow velocity v 2 m s see fig 14 the exit boundary adopts the open boundary and the side of the fluid calculation domain also adopts the open type opening besides the blade surface is a non slip wall the rotation domain gives a rotational angular velocity the rotation domain and the static domain are connected through the interface and the flow parameters at the inlet are used to initialize the flow field the transient solver is used to solve the model specific parameters setting of the tested model are listed in table 3 5 4 simulation results and analysis numerical simulation has been done to simulate the pressure distribution around the blade see fig 15 based on the result of numerical simulation which is shown in fig 16 li and li 2014 the following conclusions can be drawn on the one hand the fish shaped blade design can form a non impacting water nozzle at the front edge of the blade approximately on the other hand based on the principle of fluid mechanics a pressure difference can be formed on both sides of the blade to promote further opening of the blade besides the fish shaped sub blades on each frame of variable angle turbine and fixed angle turbine are simulated and analyzed respectively during their movement as shown in fig 17 the pressure distribution under different tip speed ratios shows the advantages of the variable angle turbine compared with the fixed angle turbine the flow field distribution around the turbine is more orderly hou 2013 fig 17 a is the pressure distribution contour for fixed angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 1 fig 17 b is the pressure distribution contour for variable angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 1 fig 17 c is the pressure distribution contour for fixed angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 2 fig 17 d is the pressure distribution contour for variable angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 2 fig 17 e is the pressure distribution contour for fixed angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 3 fig 17 f is the pressure distribution contour for variable angle turbine when the tip speed ratio is 3 we can find that with the increase of tip speed ratio both of the flow field distribution around the fixed angle turbine and the variable angle turbine are more chaotic than before but the change of the flow field distribution around the variable angle turbine is smaller than that of the fixed angle turbine in addition the flow field distribution around the variable angle turbine is more orderly under the same tip speed ratio which will make the power and efficiency of the turbine improved through the numerical calculation ed dı n fertahi et al 2018b the power and efficiency of the two devices under basic sea conditions are obtained as shown in table 4 the result of numerical calculation is consistent with above numerical simulation analysis of the flow field distribution around the turbine the above results should be used carefully because of three dimensional effects and the coupling effect among the blades including those due to the arms and the finite length of blades which would reduce the power generation efficiency of the turbine the arrangement of turbines is also a problem worth considering so it is meaningful to simulate the flow field of different turbine arrangements there are two main ways to arrange turbines non interlaced and interlaced as the name implies the non interlaced turbines are not staggered along the flow direction and the interlaced turbines are staggered along the flow direction this work controls the same distance between the turbines and selects the same number of turbines only the arrangement between the turbines is changed to explore the effect of the arrangement on the operation of the ocean current turbines each turbine is simplified to a cylinder for numerical simulation parameters setting of the model are shown in table 5 careful 3d modeling of each turbine will inevitably result in a huge number of grids resulting in the inability to calculate existing computer resources considering the convenience and reliable calculation results of 2d cfd simulation 2d cfd modeling was used to conduct qualitative research hexagonal unstructured grid generated by starccm is used to mesh the zone around the turbines to improve the computation model s robustness the methods of meshing and velocity distribution contour for numerical simulation are shown in figs 18 20 through numerical simulation results we can find that the turbines in the interlaced arrangement have a smaller distribution area of the low velocity water flow region at the front edge of the impeller under the same boundary conditions and water flow conditions and a faster flow velocity can be obtained on both sides of the impeller so this arrangement is more advantageous and improves the power generation efficiency of each turbine some literatures indicate that the staggered arrangement of turbines can make good use of tidal currents guo 2013 this is mainly because the latter row of turbines can effectively avoid the wake of the previous row so the staggered arrangement is preferred which is consistent with the results of above 2d cfd numerical simulation 6 discussion the purpose of this article is to introduce a new kind of design idea of variable declination angle vertical axis turbines using more reasonable controlling strategy to realize the high efficiency use of ocean current variable declination angle vertical axis turbines can be divided into active control and passive control according to the different angle control mechanisms active control adopts cam mechanism hydraulic system or motor system to realize the change of deflection angle the structure of this control mechanism is mostly complicated and the reliability is poor the passive control mainly relies on the force generated by the fluid to realize the change of the blade deflection angle in order to control the range and amplitude of the deflection angle a damping system such as a spring or a mass is added to limit the movement of the deflection angle the structure is relatively simple and the reliability is relatively high but the precise control of the blade yaw angle cannot be achieved this vertical axis turbine based on separate design concept combines the advantages of active control and passive control on the one hand the damping system composed of gravity tilted rotors etc limits the movement of the blades and is beneficial to improve the self starting performance of the turbine on the other hand the fan shaped angle controlling grooves allow precise control of blade deflection angle compared with the horizontal axis turbine this device does not need to set the yaw axis so the structure is simpler the stability is higher the applicative sea area is wider the impact on marine life is smaller and the energy utilization rate is higher compared with the integral vertical axis turbine the control mechanism of this device has better control effect on the blades the blades have better opening and closing flexibility and can realize free feathering with the change of the water flow direction and the blade deflection angle besides the power generation efficiency is higher to realize automatic opening of blades the vertical blade with vertical shaft turbine needs to overcome the gravity effect so it is not easy to control and requires a light weight blade compared with the vertical blade turbine this vertical axis multi blade turbine can eliminate the influence of the blades gravity without limiting the blade material the automatic opening and closing of the blades of the turbine is easier to implement and the control strategy is simpler in general this turbine is applicable to wider sea area is not subject to changes in the direction of ocean current and has more energy utilization rate for ocean current it has simpler structure can be assembled on site and is easy to modularize production therefore the generator set composed of multiple turbines is expected to transport the electric energy generated by the ocean current generator to the land through the submarine cable and provide power for the urban power system as shown in fig 21 in addition the ocean current turbine can be used for the foundation of the offshore wind power structure which can reduce the scouring of the wind power structure foundation prevent the damage of the foundation and realize the comprehensive utilization of wind energy and water energy generators based on this design concept can also be used in the damping design of intelligent buildings those are the future development direction of this research thus this work has great application prospects and promotion value 7 conclusion different from the traditional ocean current power generation device this work provided a new design idea of vertical axis ocean current power generation device its innovative features and advantages are as follows 1 innovation of design concept this device breaks the traditional design idea of single piece blade and divides each integral blade into multiple sub blades which solves the contradiction between the opposite moments caused by water flow in the left and right blades during the rotation of the impeller and different from the horizontal axis ocean current power generation technology widely used at present in which the yaw axis is necessary to be set to realize the capture of ocean current in different directions this work is designed based on the vertical axis to realize the 360 degree capture of ocean current from the horizontal direction 2 control system innovation this turbine is controlled by a control system consisting of fan shaped angle control grooves gravity tilted rotors and directional tails it realizes the automatic opening and closing of the blades and improves the flexibility of opening and closing of blades under the force of ocean current the unique gravity tilted rotor design realizes that the blade automatically closes completely when it is in a natural state and the fan shaped control groove is designed to have an opening angle of 2 162 which realizes the angle control of the blade motion so this control system can make the turbine start automatically and operate stably 3 blade design innovation based on the principle of bionics the device sets the blades that make up the large impeller into fish shape so that the blade can form a non impacting water nozzle approximately when the impeller rotates against the direction of water flow this design reduces the impact and friction between water flow and blades reduces the loss of the kinetic energy of the impeller and improves the power generation efficiency 4 advantages of the turbine this vertical axis multi blade turbine has a simpler structure can be assembled on site is not subject to the changes in the direction of ocean current is applicable to a wider sea area and has higher utilization efficiency of ocean current energy the automatic opening and closing of the blades of the turbine is easier to implement without the need of setting the yaw axis and the control strategy is simpler so this work has certain social value and broad market application prospects 8 future work the main purpose of this article is to introduce a new kind of design idea of variable declination angle vertical axis turbines to control the automatic opening and closing of the sub bladess to realize the high efficiency use of ocean current so only one blade on the same frame was considered in numerical simulation part to explain the superiority of the automatic opening and closing of the blades of the proposed turbine compared with the fixed angle turbine studying the coupling effect among the blades on the same frame is our future work

22549,large waves generated by typhoons can pose a serious threat to human life and property in the coastal areas of taiwan we hypothesize that an accurate hindcast of typhoon generated significant wave heights swhs is highly dependent on an accurate typhoon wind field this paper evaluated the performance of swh modeling for typhoons on the northeastern coast of taiwan using different wind fields and a fully coupled tide surge wave model wind products from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr era interim era and cross calibrated multi platform v2 ccmpv2 were blended into the parametric typhoon models hybrid wind models to serve as the main forcing in the fully coupled model the results of model data comparison for swhs reveal that the hindcasts only using the cfsr era and ccmpv2 own the excellent skill indexes ranging from 0 92 to 0 94 the use of hybrid wind models indicated a consistent improvement in swh hindcasting and the ccmpv2 combined with the parametric typhoon model has the best overall performance however the extremely large typhoon induced swhs exceeding 11 m can only be well matched when the cfsr merged with the parametric typhoon model was imposed on the fully coupled model keywords cfsr era interim ccmpv2 wind forcing wave hindcasting hybrid wind model 1 introduction ocean waves associated with typhoons also known as tropical cyclones in the south pacific and indian ocean and hurricanes in the north atlantic central north pacific and eastern north pacific are among the most severe threats to coastal zones nearshore waters and navigational safety shao et al 2018a shih et al 2018 chang et al 2018 therefore predicting typhoon induced wave heights is important for reducing loss of human life and property and mitigating coastal disasters lewis et al 2013 shih et al 2018a chang et al 2018 additionally estimations of typhoon driven extreme wave height with different return periods are necessary for the design of coastal and marine structures such as sea levees power plants oil platforms and undersea pipelines akpınar et al 2016 the wave models are mainly driven by wind fields in severe sea conditions however ocean wave height responds rapidly to changes in a typhoon s wind speed and the overall wave field is also driven by the size or radius of a typhoon s strongest winds and its forward speed in storm surge inundation modeling the uncertainty of wind and pressure fields has been shown to greatly effect flood risk estimates lewis et al 2014 thus the accuracy of wave hindcasts relies on highly accurate wind forcing data appendini et al 2013 which is particularly true for large waves created by typhoons wang et al 2018 evaluated the sensitivity of wave models simulations to different wind forcing products and pointed out that the improvements of model predictions for the large wave events are significant at all buoys when observed wind data were imposed on models parametric typhoon models and reanalysis wind data have been widely employed to create wind fields that are required for wave modeling murty et al 2016 sandhya et al 2016 zheng and li 2017 kang and kim 2015 however many studies for wave forecasting or wave hindcasting note that large significant wave heights swhs especially extreme swhs during typhoon events are underestimated bidlot et al 2002 cavaleri 2009 ellenson and özkan haller 2018 wave modeling is highly uncertain due to the model circulation wave or wind wave models coupling uncoupling the wind fields the nonlinear interactions of sea surface roughness and wind speed additionally the observational uncertainties such as wave buoy lean over in high wind speeds and thus recording higher wave heights due to the inclination and thus greater movement of the accelerometer also account for the underestimation of swhs in the last decade many studies about hindcasting of typhoon driven storm wave and storm surge have been carried out through the numerical models for example mori et al 2014 found that the seiche oscillation could amplify the storm tides water surface elevations inside the leyte gulf in addition to the strong winds of super typhoon haiyan terry and lau 2018 indicated that the coastal waves could reached over 10 m in height during tropical cyclone typhoon winston in 2016 the most powerful storm on record to make landfall in the fiji islands yu et al 2019 assessed the potential highest storm tide hazards in taiwan by hindcasting the historical storm surges the post event survey is an alternative option for evaluating typhoon caused waves and surges cox et al 2019 investigated coastal impacts in the united states virgin islands after hurricanes typhoons irma and maria of 2017 they reported that wave run up dominated inundation in almost all coastal low lying areas the hindcasts of long term significant wave height swh distributions in the offshore and nearshore waters utilizing a numerical model are advantageous to the coastal developments because wave buoys cannot be deployed throughout the entire marine area li et al 2016 osorio et al 2016 orimolade et al 2016 muraleedharan et al 2016 lau et al 2016 for instance assessments of wave energy and identifying the optimal areas for wave energy converter deployments are highly dependent on the creation of wave parameters for ocean areas back to those years when the observations are inexistent i e wave hindcasting su et al 2018 shih et al 2018b moreover understanding the processes of wave generation and propagation benefits greatly from wave hindcasting appendini et al 2013 the development of wind wave numerical models has led to advanced third generation models the wamdi group 1988 tolman 1989 booij et al 1999 and allows wave behavior to be predicted at times and places where there are no observations these well developed numerical models have been used for wave forecasting wave hindcasting wave characterization and wave climate studies due to the advent of high performance computers and the evolution of several advanced numerical techniques thomas and dwarakish 2015 wave current interactions should be included for swh hindcasting although third generation wind wave models can be employed to predict wave heights assuming that accurate wind fields over the computational domain are provided lewis et al 2019 found that some regions in the irish sea were subjected to a 20 increase in high water wave height because the wave field propagating into a coastal region can be affect by tidal currents and water surface elevations the overall simulation accuracy of typhoon induced waves can be slightly improved when interactions between wave and ocean current are considered sun et al 2013 sun et al 2018 manifested that the effect of storm induced currents on swhs is as much as approximately 10 for the distribution of swhs along the track of a typhoon ocean depth is another critical factor in wave height tides can also influence waves by means of variable depths in shallow water and wave height plummets as water shallows bindu et al 2016 therefore tidal variations must also be considered in wind wave models coupling of ocean circulation and wave models allows wave age wind induced current ocean tidal current sea surface elevation to be dynamically included in the wave generation solver the coupled tide surge wave model enables to provide reliable predictions or hindcasts and analyses long term changes of ocean surface wave and circulation conditions in particular during extreme events e g typhoons staneva et al 2016 the main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the wind field effect and to find out the better wind forcing for hindcasting of typhoon driven large waves in taiwanese waters using a tide surge wave fully coupled model the paper is divided into five sections section 2 briefly describes the numerical model wind fields and observational data that will be used in the present study section 3 presents the comparisons between model hindcasts and measurements for swhs using different wind fields section 4 provides a discussion of the results conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 schism hydrodynamic model the community coastal hydrodynamic model schism semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model was utilized for simulating the sea surface elevations and tidal currents in taiwanese waters the schism includes many enhancements and improvements to the original selfe semi implicit eulerian lagrangian finite element volume zhang and baptista 2008 model such as a new extension to simulate large scale eddying regimes and a seamless cross scale capability ranging from creeks to oceans zhang et al 2016 both schism and selfe have been widely used for numerical studies on the propagation of tsunami waves zhang et al 2011 the generation of coastal inundation maps fortunato et al 2013 chen and liu 2016 typhoon or hurricane induced flooding in river basins or urban areas chen and liu 2014 wang et al 2014 and the evaluation of tidal current power chen et al 2017a the surface circulation feature is similar to that on the bottom during spring wu et al 2007 and the vertical mixing only causes weak winter stratification in waters surrounding taiwan oey et al 2010 therefore a vertically integrated two dimensional barotropic schism model schism 2d was employed in the present study the governing equations of the schism 2d in the cartesian coordinate system and two dimensional form are as follows 1 η t u h x v h y 0 2 d u d t f v x g η α ψ ˆ p a ρ 0 τ s x τ r x τ b x ρ 0 h 3 d v d t f u y g η α ψ ˆ p a ρ 0 τ s y τ r y τ b y ρ 0 h where η x y t is the surface elevation u x y t and v x y t are the horizontal velocity components in the x and y directions respectively h η h is the total water depth h is the reference depth below the mean sea level f is the coriolis coefficient g is the gravitational acceleration ψ ˆ is the earth s tidal potential α is the effective earth elasticity factor ρ 0 is the reference density and p a x y t is the surface atmospheric pressure the wind stress components in the x and y directions τ s x and τ s y respectively can be expressed as follows 4a τ s x ρ a c s w x 2 w y 2 w x 4b τ s y ρ a c s w x 2 w y 2 w y where c s is the wind drag coefficient ρ a is the air density and w x w y are the wind speed components 10 m above the sea surface in the x and y directions respectively c s is often regarded as an increasing function of wind velocity however powell et al 2003 suggested that c s should be limited at high wind speeds for a typhoon and thus a formula modified from smith 1980 with a cap at high wind speed 50 m s was adopted to calculate c s in schism 2d 5 c s 1 0 3 0 61 0 063 6 0 w s 10 6 0 0 61 0 063 w s 10 6 0 w s 10 50 0 0 61 0 063 50 0 w s 10 50 0 where w s10 is the resultant wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface the bottom shear stress components in the x and y directions τ b x and τ b y respectively are computed by the following formulas 6a τ b x ρ 0 c d u 2 v 2 u 6b τ b y ρ 0 c d u 2 v 2 v the hydraulic friction c d in the schism 2d is computed by manning s n formula 7 c d g n 2 h 1 3 a manning coefficient n of 0 025 was set in the model based on the type of sea bottom material therefore c d varies with h according to equation 7 the wave induced radiation stress components in the x and y directions are represented as τ r x and τ r y respectively and can be obtained via the approaches suggested by longuet higgin and stewart 1962 and longuet higgin and stewart 1964 as shown below 8a τ r x s x x x s x y y 8b τ r y s x y x s y y y where s x x s x y and s y y are the wave radiation stress tensor components which are represented according to battjes 1974 9a s x x 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p sin θ d θ d σ 9b s x y s y x 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p cos 2 θ 1 1 2 d θ d σ 9c s y y 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p sin 2 θ 1 1 2 d θ d σ where n is the wave action density spectrum σ is the relative frequency of waves θ is the wave direction and c g and c p are the wave group velocity and wave phase velocity respectively 2 2 wwm iii wind wave model 15 the wwm iii wind wave model iii is an unstructured grid state of the art third generation spectral wind wave model and has been adopted to hindcast the significant wave heights swhs in the nearshore waters of taiwan the wave balance equation that governs the wwm iii is given as 10 n t c g x u n x c g y v n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t σ where c g x and c g y are the x axis and y axis components of the group velocity respectively c σ and c θ are the propagation velocities in spectral space σ θ respectively and s t o t is the sum of the source terms for wave variance defined as follows 11 s t o t s i n s n l 3 s n l 4 s w c s b o s b r where s in is the wind induced wave growth s nl3 is the nonlinear wave energy transfer from triad interaction s nl4 is the nonlinear wave energy transfer due to quadruplet interaction s wc is the wave decay from white capping s bo is the dissipation caused by bottom friction and s br is the dissipation induced by wave breaking based on the formulation of the joint north sea wave project jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 the peak enhancement and bottom friction factors are set to 3 3 and 0 067 respectively the method proposed by battjes and janssen 1978 with a constant wave breaking coefficient of 0 78 was used for computing waves breaking in shallow water areas in the wwm iii the wave directions are equally discretized into 36 bins over a range of 0 360 in the wwm iii the low and high frequency limits of the discrete wave frequency are 0 03 hz and 1 0 hz respectively and are also divided into 36 bins the nonlinear term for the quadruplet wave wave interactions is dealt with by discrete interaction approximation dia proposed by hasselmann et al 1985 and used and discussed in shao et al 2018b roland 2009 overhauled the wwm iii based on the source code from hsu et al 2005 and compared the wwm ii the previous version of wwm iii to the well known swan simulating waves nearshore booij et al 1999 model for the continental shelf refraction test case the comparison results pointed out that the explicit higher order schemes implemented in the wwm ii are able to accurately resolve directional spread over a continental shelf profile and the simulations are better than those using the higher order scheme in the swan the schism 2d supplies wind velocities water surface elevations and depth averaged currents to the wwm iii the wwm iii then computes the radiation stress gradients and transfers them back to the schism 2d after solving the wave action equation a schematic diagram for the coupling processes of the schism wwm iii is shown in fig 1 more details about the schism wwm iii coupling procedures can be found in roland et al 2012 previous studies have shown that the schism wwm iii is suited ideally to simulate wave heights and wave propagation from deep water to complicated nearshore systems shih et al 2018a 2018b su et al 2018 chen et al 2017b this advantage of the schism wwm iii makes it quite suitable for modeling sea states in waters surrounding taiwan 2 3 bathymetry and computational mesh the present study utilized a global and a local dataset to construct the gridded bathymetry data for the schism wwm iii the global dataset the gebco 2014 grid has a resolution of 30 arc seconds which was received from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco the gebco 2014 grid was generated by combining quality controlled ship depth soundings with interpolation between sounding points guided by satellite derived gravity data the local dataset has a resolution of 200 m and was provided by the department of land administration and the ministry of the interior in taiwan the extent of the local dataset is over a range of longitudes from 100 e to 128 e and latitudes from 4 n to 29 n by merging the gebco 2014 grid and the local dataset the bathymetry data for the schism wwm iii computational domain were produced the surface water modeling system sms software was employed for combining the two datasets and merging the values in some order of priority the gebco 2014 grid data points in a set are considered to have lower priority than the local data points when overlap occurs thus low resolution global data are not included in the final merged set when no overlap occurs all data points are merged the high resolution local data are preserved through this approach the computational domain covers the extent from 111 e to 135 e and 18 n to 30 n which has been shown to be sufficiently wide for simulating sea states driven by typhoons traveling long distances from the east to the west of taiwan as shown in fig 2 a the schism wwm iii meshes were comprised entirely of 327 955 triangular cells and 168 829 unstructured grids the resolutions of the triangular meshes can be varied from tens of kilometers to hundreds of meters on the open ocean boundaries coarse meshes with a resolution of 40 km were arranged while fine meshes with a resolution of 200 m were used along the coastlines of islands fig 2b after the unstructured grids were created the final merged gridded bathymetry dataset was interpolated to each node to represent the seafloor elevations for the schism wwm iii fig 2a to achieve model stability a time step of 120 s was chosen for schism 2d in the present unstructured grid system wwm iii is unconditionally stable therefore its time step can be relatively large the present hindcasts utilized a time step of 600 s for wwm iii and the adopted coupling interval was the same as the wwm iii time step i e schism 2d and wwm iii exchanged outputs every 5 hydrodynamic steps 2 4 tidal forcing of the open boundary a regional inverse tidal model with a resolution of 1 30 china seas indonesia zu et al 2008 was adopted to generate the harmonic constants for eight main tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 in the waters surrounding taiwan the extracted harmonic constants accounted for meteorological forcing by imposing an inverted barometer effect the resultant tides sea surface elevations were therefore served as tidal forcing for the open boundary to drive the schism wwm iii model at each time step 2 5 typhoon wind forcing designing a wind field specification for typhoons is not a straightforward task cardone and cox 2009 however accurate wind forcing is indispensable for obtaining accurate simulations of wind waves janssen 2004 different wind fields for the same period were adopted to obtain the acceptable swh hindcasts 2 5 1 parametric typhoon wind models the radial variation of typhoon winds depends upon the values of a few parameters such as the maximum wind and the radius of the maximum wind speed in a parametric typhoon model willoughby and rahn 2004 many analytical parametric typhoon models have been developed to construct wind and air pressure fields for typhoons and to provide meteorological information for modeling typhoon driven storm surges or storm waves fujita 1952 jelesnianski 1965 holland 1980 phadke et al 2003 wang et al 2004 macafee and pearson 2006 wood et al 2013 even though jakobsen and madsen 2004 revealed that the analytical typhoon models provide very similar air pressure and tangential wind speed distributions the modified rankine vortex phadke et al 2003 hereafter mrv wind field model provides a more consistent match to wind speed observations bastidas et al 2016 and produces accurate typhoon winds for ocean wave modeling phadke et al 2003 tolman and alves 2005 the parametric typhoon model proposed by holland 1980 i e the holland model hereafter h80 and mrv were therefore employed in the present study to obtain better hybrid wind fields of typhoons an exponential distribution of air pressure for typhoons proposed by schloemer 1954 and modified by holland 1980 is given as 12 p a p c p n p c exp r max r b where p a is the air pressure at an arbitrary point p n is the ambient pressure p c is the central air pressure of the typhoon r max is the radius of the maximum wind speed r is the radial distance from the typhoon s center to an arbitrary point and b is a characterized parameter that can be empirically defined by b 1 5 980 p c 120 hubbert et al 1991 the speed of gradient wind of h80 w g h80 is then given as follows 13 w g h 80 b p n p c ρ a r max r b exp r max r b r f 2 2 r f 2 where ρ a is the air density and f is the coriolis factor equation 13 leads to the maximum wind speed for h80 w max h80 14 w m a x h 80 b p n p c ρ a e the mrv model contains a shape parameter to adjust the distribution of gradient wind speeds w g mrv 15 w g m r v w max m r v r r max α for r r max w max m r v r max r α for r r max where α is a tuning parameter that was chosen as 0 5 based on recommendations in cheung et al 2007 and bastidas et al 2016 an empirical relationship of w max mrv and p c constructed by atkinson and holliday 1997 for typhoons in the northwest pacific ocean was employed 16 w m a x m r v 3 44 1010 p c 0 644 a boundary layer wind speed correction was applied to obtain surface winds w s10 wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface following the relation presented by harper et al 2001 17 w s 10 0 81 w g for w g 6 m s 0 81 2 96 10 3 w g 6 for 6 m s w g 19 5 m s 0 77 4 31 10 3 w g 19 5 for 19 5 m s w g 45 m s 0 66 w g for w g 45 m s where w g can be w g h80 or w g mrv willoughby and rahn 2004 and willoughby et al 2006 found a logarithmic fit to r max as a function of w max and the latitude of typhoon s center ϕ 18 r max 46 4 exp 0 155 w max 0 0169 ϕ where w max can be w max h80 or w max mrv thus r max was derived from equation 18 in the presented study the original h80 and mrv models cannot represent the asymmetric wind field structure of a typhoon even if the highly asymmetric wind field structure of a typhoon often leads to large errors in storm surge and wind wave forecasting georgiou 1985 introduced a translation speed w t to overcome this restriction then the h80 or mrv parametric typhoon wind w pc becomes 19 w p c w s 10 w t 0 5 sin ϑ where ϑ is the angle of the typhoon s direction of motion 2 5 2 cfsr reanalysis wind data the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis hereafter cfsr is a third generation reanalysis product that is a global high resolution coupled atmosphere ocean land surface sea ice system saha et al 2010 the cfsr provided continuous and consistent coverage of atmospheric conditions for 31 years from 1979 to 2009 and was extended to march 2011 the current cfsr will be extended as an operational real time product in the future the cfsr wind data w cfsr were obtained from the research data archive computational information system lab of the national center for atmospheric research ncar the temporal and spatial resolutions are 1 h and 0 312 0 312 respectively 2 5 3 era interim reanalysis wind data the era interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis from 1979 and is continuously updated per month at a delay of two months dee et al 2011 reanalysis wind fields w era produced by the era interim hereafter era were acquired from the public datasets of the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the spatial resolution of the era original grid data set is 0 75 0 75 approximately 80 km in the present study the 10 m u and v wind components of typhoons were extracted from the era reanalysis interpolated product at a temporal resolution of 6 h four analysis fields per day at 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 utc and a spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 2 5 4 ccmp wind vector analysis product the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp is a near global high spatial 0 25 0 25 and temporal 6 h resolution dataset for gridded surface vector winds that are produced using the variational analysis method and acquired data from satellites moored buoys and numerical models atlas et al 2011 the ccmp provides a consistent gap free long term time series of ocean surface wind vector analysis fields from 1987 to present an updated improved and consistently reprocessed version 2 ccmp hereafter ccmpv2 ocean vector wind analysis dataset w ccmp created by scott et al 2016 was utilized in the present study the dynamical wind fields w cfsr w era and w ccmp were converted to each unstructured grid of the schism wwm iii using the inverse distance weighting idw method 2 5 5 hybrid typhoon wind model the reanalysis product is superior to the parametric typhoon model for the wind fields away from the center of the typhoon i e typhoon position from the rsmc however the parametric typhoon model generally creates wind fields of much higher accuracy near the center of a typhoon compared to those of the reanalysis product li et al 2018 therefore the combined usage of the reanalysis wind data and the parametric typhoon model is believed to generate a better entire wind field for typhoons the superposition method is an optimized combination of the wind data from the reanalysis product and the parametric typhoon model pan et al 2016 two formulas proposed by li et al 2018 and shao et al 2018a were employed to reconstruct the hybrid wind fields for typhoons hereafter w h 1 and w h 2 w h 1 is represented as follows 20 w h 1 w p c r r 1 1 α w p c α w r w r 1 r r 2 w r w r r 2 where w rw is the reanalysis wind which can be w cfsr w era or w ccmp and α r r 1 r 2 r 1 r 1 and r 2 are two boundary limits in the transition zone and were set to 8r max and 10r max respectively based on the results of surge wave coupled simulations in the typhoon prone coastal areas of china feng et al 2018 then w h 2 is represented as follows 21 w h 2 w p c r 2 r max β 0 70 β 0 06 w p c 1 β 0 72 1 β 0 28 w r w 2 r max r 7 r max w r w r 7 r max where β 7 r r max 5 in equations 20 and 21 α and β are used to adjust the reanalysis and parametric typhoon model wind α and β play an important role near r 1 8r max and 2rmax while 1 α and 1 β are crucial around r 2 10r max and 7rmax for w h 1 and w h 2 respectively 2 6 typhoon track and buoy data the swh hindcasting was for september 1 to september 30 in 2008 and two typhoon events namely typhoons sinlaku and jangmi occurred during that period those two typhoons were category 2 storms according to the central weather bureau cwb of taiwan fig 3 demonstrates the tracks of typhoons sinlaku fig 3a and jangmi fig 3b the locations of the longdong guishan island and hualien buoys can also be found in fig 3 the past data of typhoons sinlaku and jangmi were obtained from the regional specialized meteorological center rsmc tokyo typhoon center the rsmc provides information on typhoons in the western north pacific and the south china sea including historical present and forecasted positions as well as on the movement and intensity of typhoons 2 7 verification metrics mentaschi et al 2013 suggested that smaller values of the normalized root mean square error nrmse root mean square error rmse and scatter index si do not always identify better numerical simulation performance additionally these indicators are not always reliable for assessing numerical model accuracy the error indicator hh proposed by hanna and heinold 1985 was therefore employed to develop a reliability analysis of wave generation and propagation the hh indicator provides more reliable and accurate information about the accuracy of the results of numerical models and the use of hh therefore allows the performances of simulations and their agreement with observations to be correctly interpreted mentaschi et al 2013 willmott 1981 developed an index of agreement skill to overcome the insensitivity of correlation based measures to differences between measured and simulated means and variances model performance for the hindcast of swhs was evaluated by hh and skill in the present study a lower value of hh expresses better performance a skill value of 1 means a perfect performance a skill value ranging between 0 65 and 1 0 indicates excellent performance a very good performance ranges from 0 5 to 0 65 a good performance ranges from 0 2 to 0 5 and a skill value less than 0 2 represents a poor performance chen et al 2016 the formulas for hh and skill are

served as meteorological conditions for the schism wwm iii tide surge wave fully coupled model to reproduce the historical swhs in the nearshore waters of taiwan the swh observations measured at three wave buoys by the cwb of taiwan in september 2008 were adopted to evaluate the most adequate wind field for hindcasting typhoon driven swhs in the northeastern coastal waters of taiwan the results of model data comparisons were also used to validate the performance of the schism wwm iii in the swh hindcasts it should be noted that the swhs were compared only because the main goal of the present study is to assess the wind forcing effects on hindcasts of storm waves 3 1 hindcasting of swhs using the wind forcing from cfsr era and ccmpv2 fig 4 a f depict the snapshots of the cfsr fig 4a and d era fig 4b and e and ccmpv2 fig 4c and f wind fields imposed on the schism wwm iii for typhoons sinlaku fig 4a c and jangmi fig 4d f as shown in fig 4 the wind velocity from the cfsr is higher than that from the era and ccmpv2 for typhoon sinlaku nevertheless the cfsr produced maximum wind speed resembles that of the ccmpv2 except for location fig 4d and f and is also notably higher than the era in typhoon jangmi the wind speed reached 30 m s for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi using the cfsr but only approached 24 m s when the era wind data were employed the ccmpv2 wind velocity was lower than 24 m s but slightly exceeded 30 m s for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi respectively furthermore the cfsr typhoon wind field is more concentrated than those of the era and ccmpv2 the corresponding snapshots of swh distribution driven by the cfsr era and ccmpv2 are shown in fig 5 a f the cfsr generated swhs of the typhoons fig 5a and d were relatively high and wide compared to those induced by the era fig 5b and e and ccmpv2 fig 5c and f the cfsr generated maximum swhs were more than 12 m while the maximum swhs induced by the era were 8 9 m and 9 10 m for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi respectively in the deep ocean the ccmpv2 only drove the maximum swhs of 6 7 m for typhoon sinlaku but 11 12 m for typhoon jangmi fig 6 presents the time series model data comparison for swhs from sep 5 to sep 30 2008 fig 6a c shows the longdong guishan island and hualien buoys respectively the measured maximum swhs were approximately 7 5 m at the longdong buoy figs 6a 6 0 m at the guishan island buoy figs 6b and 6 5 m at the hualien buoy fig 6c during typhoon sinlaku sep 10 to sep 16 2008 nevertheless the measured maximum swh had exceeded 11 m at the longdong and guishan island buoys and reached up to 10 m at the hualien buoy through typhoon jangmi sep 26 to sep 30 2008 the hindcasts of swhs using the era and ccmpv2 wind fields slightly underestimate the measurements but are greatly inferior to the maximum swhs caused by typhoons sinlaku and jangmi the swhs hindcasted by adopting the wind field from the cfsr are always higher than those hindcasted by employing the era and ccmpv2 the simulated maximum swh even overestimates the observation measured at the longdong buoy during typhoon sinlaku fig 6a the hindcasting maximum swhs for typhoon jangmi are severely underestimated at the longdong and guishan island buoys by the use of the cfsr era and ccmpv2 for which the measured maximal swhs exceeded 11 m this phenomenon is quite obvious for the guishan island buoy where the difference in the era driven and measured maximum swhs can reach 6 m fig 6b the insignificant difference is found at the hualien buoy due to the cfsr wind fields exerted on the model fig 6c the statistical errors of the differences between the model hindcasts and the observations averaged over the three wave buoys were calculated and listed in table 1 although the minimal values of hh and the highest skill values are 0 35 and 0 94 respectively for the ccmpv2 the employment of the cfsr brings minimal averaged difference in the maximum swhs of the typhoons 1 22 m 3 2 hindcasting of swhs using the wind forcing from hybrid wind models the parametric typhoon wind models h80 and mrv were first incorporated into the cfsr to create the hybrid wind fields by means of equation 20 since the minimum error of the maximum swh was acquired for purposes of simplification when blended with h80 and mrv adopting equation 20 the cfsr is denoted the cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 respectively the instantaneous distributions of the reanalysis wind data hybrid wind fields using the cfsr cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 are shown in fig 7 a f fig 7a b and 7c represent the wind fields from the cfsr cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 for typhoon sinlaku while fig 7d f illustrate the wind fields of typhoon jangmi produced by the cfsr cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 the wind speeds of the cfsr h80 h1 fig 7b and e and cfsr mrv h1 fig 7c and f are higher than those of the cfsr moreover the wind fields from the cfsr h80 h and cfsr mrv h1 are intensified around the centers of the typhoons the snapshots of swh distributions corresponding to fig 7a f are demonstrated in fig 8 a f compared to the swhs displayed in fig 5 the cfsr h80 h1 fig 8b and e and cfsr mrv h1 driven fig 8c and f swhs are larger than those generated by the cfsr era and ccmpv2 only the instantaneous maximum swhs exceed 12 m for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi similar to the wind fields shown in fig 7 the hybrid wind induced maximum swhs are closer to the centers of the typhoons additionally the instantaneous maximum swhs appear in the right forward quadrants of the typhoons centers because wind velocities along the right sides of the typhoons are enhanced by the translational speeds of the typhoons moon et al 2003 the time series comparison of hindcasting swhs among the usages of the cfsr cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 wind fields for the three wave buoys can be found in fig 9 the hindcasting swhs generated by the cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 were more consistent with those observed at the longdond and guishan island buoys for typhoon sinlaku fig 9a and b although the overestimations are found at guishan island buoy adopting the cfsr h80 h1 the hindcasting maximum swh of typhoon jangmi was improved by exerting the hybrid winds and this phenomenon is particularly notable for the longdong and guishan island buoys when the cfsr mrv h1 was imposed the maximum swh hindcasts of typhoon jangmi are approximately increased 2 5 3 0 and 0 2 m for the longdong guishan island and hualien buoys respectively compared with using the cfsr only the mrv model was therefore combined with the cfsr through equations 20 and 21 to examine the performance of the merging methods due to the significant improvement of the hindcasting maximum swh the hybrid wind fields were known as the cfsr mrv h1 and cfsr mrv h2 for employing equations 20 and 21 respectively fig 10 illustrates the model data comparisons for swhs using the cfsr cfsr mrv h1 and cfsr mrv h2 there is almost no difference in swh hindcasts between the introduction of the cfsr mrv h1 and cfsr mrv h2 except for typhoon jangmi the hindcasting maximum swhs were slightly raised owing to the exertion of the cfsr mrv h2 winds fig 10b and c the mrv model paired by equation 21 was regarded as the best method for creating the hybrid wind fields of the typhoons according to the results from figs 9 and 10 thus the era and ccmpv2 wind products were incorporate into the mrv model via equation 21 era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 to investigate the improvements of the swh hindcasts the time series and hindcasted swhs employing cfsr mrv h2 era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 are shown in fig 11 comparing the results in figs 6 and 11 a massive increase in the hindcasting maximum swhs was expected for typhoon jangmi although the underestimations remain table 1 summarizes the statistical errors for adopting the wind fields from the cfsr mrv h2 era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 the overall accuracy of swh hindcasting is improved due to usage of the hybrid winds the skill was increased 0 01 from 0 94 for the ccmpv2 to 0 95 for the ccmp mrv h2 and 0 02 from 0 92 for the cfsr to 0 94 for the cfsr mrv h2 and from 0 93 for the era to 0 95 for the era mrv h2 and the hh was decreased 0 01 from 0 38 for the era to 0 37 for the era mrv h2 0 04 from 0 35 for the ccmpv2 to 0 31 for the ccmpv2 mrv h2 and 0 05 from 0 40 for the cfsr to 0 35 for the cfsr mrv h2 the statistical model data differences of swh for the individual wave buoy are listed in tables 2 4 table 2 for the longdong buoy table 3 for the guishan island buoy and table 3 for the hualien buoy the overall errors for the longdong and guishan buoys are slighter than those for the hualien buoy the better performance of swhs hindcasting is expected at the wave buoy located in the right side of typhoon as shown in fig 3 4 discussion combining the reanalysis products and the parametric typhoon models i e hybrid wind fields greatly improves the hindcasting swhs it can be found from the comparisons in figs 6 fig 9 figs 10 and 11 that the exertions of the hybrid wind fields over the schism wwm iii not only increase swhs but also correct the phases of the maximum swhs the maximum swh of typhoon sinlaku hindcasted by the cfsr era and ccmpv2 is much earlier than that by all the hybrid wind fields the averaged time mismatch was reduced from 7 h for the cfsr to 3 h for cfsr mrv h2 from 7 h for the era to 1 h for era mrv h2 and from 6 h for the ccmpv2 to 1 h for ccmp mrv h2 as listed in table 1 these results reveal that the tracks and arrival times of the typhoons acquired from the rsmc are highly accurate even though the wind field from the ccmp mrv h2 brings a maximal skill and achieves the minimal hh for the overall swh hindcasting an exact prediction of typhoon generated maximum swhs is indispensable for the purpose of disaster prevention table 1 lists the averaged differences of the maximum swhs for different wind forcings the dramatic reductions are found because the use of the hybrid winds the cfsr mrv h2 wind field leads the minimal averaged differences of the maximum swh 0 62 m the results show that the typhoon driven extreme large swhs can only be mimicked if the hybrid wind fields especially the cfsr mrv h2 are imposed on the schism wwm iii fig 12 describes the extent of the hindcasting maximal swhs during the periods of typhoons sinlaku fig 12a c and jangmi fig 12d f using the wind fields from the cfsr era and ccmpv2 the maximum extents of maximal swhs for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi over 12 15 m are shown in fig 12a and d respectively for which the cfsr was utilized whereas the employment of the era and ccmpv2 creates the smaller extents of maximal swhs which are only 8 10 m for typhoon sinlaku fig 12b and c and 11 12 m for typhoon jangmi fig 12e and f the distributions of the hindcasting maximal swhs for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi utilizing the wind speeds from the hybrid wind fields are displayed in fig 13 the cfsr mrv h2 era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 produce similar extents of maximal swh for typhoon sinlaku fig 13a c the appearance of the maximal swh distributions for the era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 are shown separately fig 13b and c the maximum extents of maximal swhs over 15 m for typhoon jangmi are huge fig 13d f which is particularly true for the use of the cfsr mrv h2 fig 13d moreover similar to typhoon sinlaku the discrete maximal swh distributions occur when employing the winds from the era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 fig 13e and f these phenomena might be due to their lower temporal resolution 6 h the asymmetrical appearances existed through all the maximal swh distributions given that the maximum wind speeds always occur on the right sides of typhoons in the northern hemisphere the spatial distributions of percentage difference for the maximal swh by the employment of the hybrid wind model minus the dynamical winds are presented in fig 14 introducing the combinations of the parametric typhoon model and the reanalysis products usually lead to a larger typhoon induced swh than using the reanalysis products only the percentage differences could reach to 20 60 and 20 100 for the cfsr mrv h2 minus cfsr during typhoons sinlaku fig 14a and jangmi fig 14b respectively the percentage differences also range from 20 to 100 for the era mrv h2 minus era and the ccmp mrv h2 minus ccmp during the typhoons sinlaku and jangmi fig 14c f the sensitive areas are found along the right sides of typhoons in deep ocean the cfsr has coarse spatial resolution but high temporal resolution nevertheless the era and ccmpv2 have high spatial resolution but coarse temporal resolution the results from the present study reveal that the hindcasts of swh from the ccmpv2 have the minimal statistical errors for typhoon and non typhoon conditions but typhoon driven large waves are well matched by adopting the winds from the cfsr although it is difficult to provide any insight into whether high spatial or high temporal resolution is more important to the swh hindcasting the wind fields with higher temporal resolution i e the cfsr create a reasonable maximal swh distribution for typhoons fig 12a and d this is more important for hindcasting of typhoon driven large waves the swhs hindcasted by the wwm iii only i e circulation wave uncoupled were conduct to compare the influence of model coupling on typhoon generated storm waves fig 15 a c depict the comparisons of swh hindcasts for the longdong fig 15a guishan island fig 15b and hualien fig 15c buoys using the fully coupled fcp schism wwm iii and uncoupled ucp wwm iii only models and the wind forcing from the cfsr mrv h2 the hindcasts of swh by the fcp model are in good agreement with those adopting the ucp model except slightly higher at the hualien buoy for typhoon jangmi this sensitivity test revealed that the performance of swh hindcasting is more sensitive to wind forcing products than coupling or decoupling effects of circulation and wave models compared to figs 6 9 11 and 15 in other words the uncertainty of typhoon wind field for storm waves hindcasting could be diminished if the hybrid wind models are utilized although the main object of the present study is to evaluate the wind forcing effects on storm wave hindcasting the model data comparisons for two important wave parameters i e mean period and wave direction were conducted by exerting the winds form the cfsr mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 on the schism wwm iii because the minimal swh differences for wave buoys were create via these two wind products tables 1 4 figs 16 and 17 illustrate the results of comparison for mean period fig 16 and wave direction fig 17 respectively the similar trends were made by the cfsr mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 however the hindcasting mean periods and wave directions are more accordant with measurements when the cfsr mrv h2 winds were used to drive the schism wwm iii blank lines in figs 16 and 17 swh may be overestimated due to the nonlinear interaction of sea surface roughness and wind speed e g charnock drag even if wind field is given accurately in the present study however typhoon generated large waves were significantly underestimated owing to the weaker typhoon wind speed from the cfsr era and ccmpv2 the schism wwm iii only receives wind data from the atmospheric model or the hybrid wind model this is so called one way coupling for wave and wind models in two way coupling the wave model could send the computed sea surface roughness back to the atmospheric model the two way atmosphere wave coupling leads to a reduction of both surface wind speeds and simulated wave heights and improves the simulation of wind and wave parameters of the model wahle et al 2017 thus the implementation of a fully coupled atmosphere wave ocean model is need for accurate predicting or hindcasting ocean surface waves in the future 5 conclusions in this study the significant wave heights swhs in taiwanese waters during the period of sep 2008 were hindcasted using a high resolution unstructured grid tide surge wave fully coupled model called schism wwm iii the model acquired the wind fields of typhoons from difference sources the reanalysis products were provided by the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr era interim era and cross calibrated multi platform version 2 ccmpv2 the hybrid wind fields were generated by a combination of two parametric typhoon models the holland model h80 and the modified rankine vortex model mrv and the cfsr era and ccmpv2 using two equations the hindcasts of swhs employing the hybrid models and reanalysis winds were compared with observations to determine the wind field estimates resulting in the best performances of swh hindcasting typhoon driven large waves are particularly important the typhoon generated extreme large swhs exceeding 11 m are severely underestimated if only the cfsr era or ccmpv2 wind field was utilized the results presented in this paper reveal that the wind fields obtained from the ccmpv2 and blended into the mrv via equation 21 ccmp mrv h2 could reproduce the swhs over typhoon and nontyphoon conditions the minimal hh and maximal skill however the maximal swhs of typhoons are only well matched when the cfsr was merged with mrv by means of equation 21 cfsr mrv h2 and served as meteorological forcing for the schism wwm iii additionally the phases of typhoon driven swhs during the hindcasting period sep 2008 are corrected by using the hybrid wind fields the wind forcing from the ccmp mrv h2 might be an adequate solution to long term simulation of wave climate regarding the prevention of coastal disasters or designing infrastructure in the nearshore waters the cfsr mrv h2 is the most suitable source of wind fields for modeling swhs induced by typhoons the wind forcings from the hybrid typhoon wind fields can improve the performance of wave computation models that disaster managers and structural engineers rely on for guidance acknowledgments this research was supported by the ministry of science and technology most taiwan grant no most 107 2625 m 865 001 and 108 2625 m 865 001 the authors

22549,large waves generated by typhoons can pose a serious threat to human life and property in the coastal areas of taiwan we hypothesize that an accurate hindcast of typhoon generated significant wave heights swhs is highly dependent on an accurate typhoon wind field this paper evaluated the performance of swh modeling for typhoons on the northeastern coast of taiwan using different wind fields and a fully coupled tide surge wave model wind products from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr era interim era and cross calibrated multi platform v2 ccmpv2 were blended into the parametric typhoon models hybrid wind models to serve as the main forcing in the fully coupled model the results of model data comparison for swhs reveal that the hindcasts only using the cfsr era and ccmpv2 own the excellent skill indexes ranging from 0 92 to 0 94 the use of hybrid wind models indicated a consistent improvement in swh hindcasting and the ccmpv2 combined with the parametric typhoon model has the best overall performance however the extremely large typhoon induced swhs exceeding 11 m can only be well matched when the cfsr merged with the parametric typhoon model was imposed on the fully coupled model keywords cfsr era interim ccmpv2 wind forcing wave hindcasting hybrid wind model 1 introduction ocean waves associated with typhoons also known as tropical cyclones in the south pacific and indian ocean and hurricanes in the north atlantic central north pacific and eastern north pacific are among the most severe threats to coastal zones nearshore waters and navigational safety shao et al 2018a shih et al 2018 chang et al 2018 therefore predicting typhoon induced wave heights is important for reducing loss of human life and property and mitigating coastal disasters lewis et al 2013 shih et al 2018a chang et al 2018 additionally estimations of typhoon driven extreme wave height with different return periods are necessary for the design of coastal and marine structures such as sea levees power plants oil platforms and undersea pipelines akpınar et al 2016 the wave models are mainly driven by wind fields in severe sea conditions however ocean wave height responds rapidly to changes in a typhoon s wind speed and the overall wave field is also driven by the size or radius of a typhoon s strongest winds and its forward speed in storm surge inundation modeling the uncertainty of wind and pressure fields has been shown to greatly effect flood risk estimates lewis et al 2014 thus the accuracy of wave hindcasts relies on highly accurate wind forcing data appendini et al 2013 which is particularly true for large waves created by typhoons wang et al 2018 evaluated the sensitivity of wave models simulations to different wind forcing products and pointed out that the improvements of model predictions for the large wave events are significant at all buoys when observed wind data were imposed on models parametric typhoon models and reanalysis wind data have been widely employed to create wind fields that are required for wave modeling murty et al 2016 sandhya et al 2016 zheng and li 2017 kang and kim 2015 however many studies for wave forecasting or wave hindcasting note that large significant wave heights swhs especially extreme swhs during typhoon events are underestimated bidlot et al 2002 cavaleri 2009 ellenson and özkan haller 2018 wave modeling is highly uncertain due to the model circulation wave or wind wave models coupling uncoupling the wind fields the nonlinear interactions of sea surface roughness and wind speed additionally the observational uncertainties such as wave buoy lean over in high wind speeds and thus recording higher wave heights due to the inclination and thus greater movement of the accelerometer also account for the underestimation of swhs in the last decade many studies about hindcasting of typhoon driven storm wave and storm surge have been carried out through the numerical models for example mori et al 2014 found that the seiche oscillation could amplify the storm tides water surface elevations inside the leyte gulf in addition to the strong winds of super typhoon haiyan terry and lau 2018 indicated that the coastal waves could reached over 10 m in height during tropical cyclone typhoon winston in 2016 the most powerful storm on record to make landfall in the fiji islands yu et al 2019 assessed the potential highest storm tide hazards in taiwan by hindcasting the historical storm surges the post event survey is an alternative option for evaluating typhoon caused waves and surges cox et al 2019 investigated coastal impacts in the united states virgin islands after hurricanes typhoons irma and maria of 2017 they reported that wave run up dominated inundation in almost all coastal low lying areas the hindcasts of long term significant wave height swh distributions in the offshore and nearshore waters utilizing a numerical model are advantageous to the coastal developments because wave buoys cannot be deployed throughout the entire marine area li et al 2016 osorio et al 2016 orimolade et al 2016 muraleedharan et al 2016 lau et al 2016 for instance assessments of wave energy and identifying the optimal areas for wave energy converter deployments are highly dependent on the creation of wave parameters for ocean areas back to those years when the observations are inexistent i e wave hindcasting su et al 2018 shih et al 2018b moreover understanding the processes of wave generation and propagation benefits greatly from wave hindcasting appendini et al 2013 the development of wind wave numerical models has led to advanced third generation models the wamdi group 1988 tolman 1989 booij et al 1999 and allows wave behavior to be predicted at times and places where there are no observations these well developed numerical models have been used for wave forecasting wave hindcasting wave characterization and wave climate studies due to the advent of high performance computers and the evolution of several advanced numerical techniques thomas and dwarakish 2015 wave current interactions should be included for swh hindcasting although third generation wind wave models can be employed to predict wave heights assuming that accurate wind fields over the computational domain are provided lewis et al 2019 found that some regions in the irish sea were subjected to a 20 increase in high water wave height because the wave field propagating into a coastal region can be affect by tidal currents and water surface elevations the overall simulation accuracy of typhoon induced waves can be slightly improved when interactions between wave and ocean current are considered sun et al 2013 sun et al 2018 manifested that the effect of storm induced currents on swhs is as much as approximately 10 for the distribution of swhs along the track of a typhoon ocean depth is another critical factor in wave height tides can also influence waves by means of variable depths in shallow water and wave height plummets as water shallows bindu et al 2016 therefore tidal variations must also be considered in wind wave models coupling of ocean circulation and wave models allows wave age wind induced current ocean tidal current sea surface elevation to be dynamically included in the wave generation solver the coupled tide surge wave model enables to provide reliable predictions or hindcasts and analyses long term changes of ocean surface wave and circulation conditions in particular during extreme events e g typhoons staneva et al 2016 the main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the wind field effect and to find out the better wind forcing for hindcasting of typhoon driven large waves in taiwanese waters using a tide surge wave fully coupled model the paper is divided into five sections section 2 briefly describes the numerical model wind fields and observational data that will be used in the present study section 3 presents the comparisons between model hindcasts and measurements for swhs using different wind fields section 4 provides a discussion of the results conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 schism hydrodynamic model the community coastal hydrodynamic model schism semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model was utilized for simulating the sea surface elevations and tidal currents in taiwanese waters the schism includes many enhancements and improvements to the original selfe semi implicit eulerian lagrangian finite element volume zhang and baptista 2008 model such as a new extension to simulate large scale eddying regimes and a seamless cross scale capability ranging from creeks to oceans zhang et al 2016 both schism and selfe have been widely used for numerical studies on the propagation of tsunami waves zhang et al 2011 the generation of coastal inundation maps fortunato et al 2013 chen and liu 2016 typhoon or hurricane induced flooding in river basins or urban areas chen and liu 2014 wang et al 2014 and the evaluation of tidal current power chen et al 2017a the surface circulation feature is similar to that on the bottom during spring wu et al 2007 and the vertical mixing only causes weak winter stratification in waters surrounding taiwan oey et al 2010 therefore a vertically integrated two dimensional barotropic schism model schism 2d was employed in the present study the governing equations of the schism 2d in the cartesian coordinate system and two dimensional form are as follows 1 η t u h x v h y 0 2 d u d t f v x g η α ψ ˆ p a ρ 0 τ s x τ r x τ b x ρ 0 h 3 d v d t f u y g η α ψ ˆ p a ρ 0 τ s y τ r y τ b y ρ 0 h where η x y t is the surface elevation u x y t and v x y t are the horizontal velocity components in the x and y directions respectively h η h is the total water depth h is the reference depth below the mean sea level f is the coriolis coefficient g is the gravitational acceleration ψ ˆ is the earth s tidal potential α is the effective earth elasticity factor ρ 0 is the reference density and p a x y t is the surface atmospheric pressure the wind stress components in the x and y directions τ s x and τ s y respectively can be expressed as follows 4a τ s x ρ a c s w x 2 w y 2 w x 4b τ s y ρ a c s w x 2 w y 2 w y where c s is the wind drag coefficient ρ a is the air density and w x w y are the wind speed components 10 m above the sea surface in the x and y directions respectively c s is often regarded as an increasing function of wind velocity however powell et al 2003 suggested that c s should be limited at high wind speeds for a typhoon and thus a formula modified from smith 1980 with a cap at high wind speed 50 m s was adopted to calculate c s in schism 2d 5 c s 1 0 3 0 61 0 063 6 0 w s 10 6 0 0 61 0 063 w s 10 6 0 w s 10 50 0 0 61 0 063 50 0 w s 10 50 0 where w s10 is the resultant wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface the bottom shear stress components in the x and y directions τ b x and τ b y respectively are computed by the following formulas 6a τ b x ρ 0 c d u 2 v 2 u 6b τ b y ρ 0 c d u 2 v 2 v the hydraulic friction c d in the schism 2d is computed by manning s n formula 7 c d g n 2 h 1 3 a manning coefficient n of 0 025 was set in the model based on the type of sea bottom material therefore c d varies with h according to equation 7 the wave induced radiation stress components in the x and y directions are represented as τ r x and τ r y respectively and can be obtained via the approaches suggested by longuet higgin and stewart 1962 and longuet higgin and stewart 1964 as shown below 8a τ r x s x x x s x y y 8b τ r y s x y x s y y y where s x x s x y and s y y are the wave radiation stress tensor components which are represented according to battjes 1974 9a s x x 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p sin θ d θ d σ 9b s x y s y x 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p cos 2 θ 1 1 2 d θ d σ 9c s y y 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p sin 2 θ 1 1 2 d θ d σ where n is the wave action density spectrum σ is the relative frequency of waves θ is the wave direction and c g and c p are the wave group velocity and wave phase velocity respectively 2 2 wwm iii wind wave model 15 the wwm iii wind wave model iii is an unstructured grid state of the art third generation spectral wind wave model and has been adopted to hindcast the significant wave heights swhs in the nearshore waters of taiwan the wave balance equation that governs the wwm iii is given as 10 n t c g x u n x c g y v n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t σ where c g x and c g y are the x axis and y axis components of the group velocity respectively c σ and c θ are the propagation velocities in spectral space σ θ respectively and s t o t is the sum of the source terms for wave variance defined as follows 11 s t o t s i n s n l 3 s n l 4 s w c s b o s b r where s in is the wind induced wave growth s nl3 is the nonlinear wave energy transfer from triad interaction s nl4 is the nonlinear wave energy transfer due to quadruplet interaction s wc is the wave decay from white capping s bo is the dissipation caused by bottom friction and s br is the dissipation induced by wave breaking based on the formulation of the joint north sea wave project jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 the peak enhancement and bottom friction factors are set to 3 3 and 0 067 respectively the method proposed by battjes and janssen 1978 with a constant wave breaking coefficient of 0 78 was used for computing waves breaking in shallow water areas in the wwm iii the wave directions are equally discretized into 36 bins over a range of 0 360 in the wwm iii the low and high frequency limits of the discrete wave frequency are 0 03 hz and 1 0 hz respectively and are also divided into 36 bins the nonlinear term for the quadruplet wave wave interactions is dealt with by discrete interaction approximation dia proposed by hasselmann et al 1985 and used and discussed in shao et al 2018b roland 2009 overhauled the wwm iii based on the source code from hsu et al 2005 and compared the wwm ii the previous version of wwm iii to the well known swan simulating waves nearshore booij et al 1999 model for the continental shelf refraction test case the comparison results pointed out that the explicit higher order schemes implemented in the wwm ii are able to accurately resolve directional spread over a continental shelf profile and the simulations are better than those using the higher order scheme in the swan the schism 2d supplies wind velocities water surface elevations and depth averaged currents to the wwm iii the wwm iii then computes the radiation stress gradients and transfers them back to the schism 2d after solving the wave action equation a schematic diagram for the coupling processes of the schism wwm iii is shown in fig 1 more details about the schism wwm iii coupling procedures can be found in roland et al 2012 previous studies have shown that the schism wwm iii is suited ideally to simulate wave heights and wave propagation from deep water to complicated nearshore systems shih et al 2018a 2018b su et al 2018 chen et al 2017b this advantage of the schism wwm iii makes it quite suitable for modeling sea states in waters surrounding taiwan 2 3 bathymetry and computational mesh the present study utilized a global and a local dataset to construct the gridded bathymetry data for the schism wwm iii the global dataset the gebco 2014 grid has a resolution of 30 arc seconds which was received from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco the gebco 2014 grid was generated by combining quality controlled ship depth soundings with interpolation between sounding points guided by satellite derived gravity data the local dataset has a resolution of 200 m and was provided by the department of land administration and the ministry of the interior in taiwan the extent of the local dataset is over a range of longitudes from 100 e to 128 e and latitudes from 4 n to 29 n by merging the gebco 2014 grid and the local dataset the bathymetry data for the schism wwm iii computational domain were produced the surface water modeling system sms software was employed for combining the two datasets and merging the values in some order of priority the gebco 2014 grid data points in a set are considered to have lower priority than the local data points when overlap occurs thus low resolution global data are not included in the final merged set when no overlap occurs all data points are merged the high resolution local data are preserved through this approach the computational domain covers the extent from 111 e to 135 e and 18 n to 30 n which has been shown to be sufficiently wide for simulating sea states driven by typhoons traveling long distances from the east to the west of taiwan as shown in fig 2 a the schism wwm iii meshes were comprised entirely of 327 955 triangular cells and 168 829 unstructured grids the resolutions of the triangular meshes can be varied from tens of kilometers to hundreds of meters on the open ocean boundaries coarse meshes with a resolution of 40 km were arranged while fine meshes with a resolution of 200 m were used along the coastlines of islands fig 2b after the unstructured grids were created the final merged gridded bathymetry dataset was interpolated to each node to represent the seafloor elevations for the schism wwm iii fig 2a to achieve model stability a time step of 120 s was chosen for schism 2d in the present unstructured grid system wwm iii is unconditionally stable therefore its time step can be relatively large the present hindcasts utilized a time step of 600 s for wwm iii and the adopted coupling interval was the same as the wwm iii time step i e schism 2d and wwm iii exchanged outputs every 5 hydrodynamic steps 2 4 tidal forcing of the open boundary a regional inverse tidal model with a resolution of 1 30 china seas indonesia zu et al 2008 was adopted to generate the harmonic constants for eight main tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 in the waters surrounding taiwan the extracted harmonic constants accounted for meteorological forcing by imposing an inverted barometer effect the resultant tides sea surface elevations were therefore served as tidal forcing for the open boundary to drive the schism wwm iii model at each time step 2 5 typhoon wind forcing designing a wind field specification for typhoons is not a straightforward task cardone and cox 2009 however accurate wind forcing is indispensable for obtaining accurate simulations of wind waves janssen 2004 different wind fields for the same period were adopted to obtain the acceptable swh hindcasts 2 5 1 parametric typhoon wind models the radial variation of typhoon winds depends upon the values of a few parameters such as the maximum wind and the radius of the maximum wind speed in a parametric typhoon model willoughby and rahn 2004 many analytical parametric typhoon models have been developed to construct wind and air pressure fields for typhoons and to provide meteorological information for modeling typhoon driven storm surges or storm waves fujita 1952 jelesnianski 1965 holland 1980 phadke et al 2003 wang et al 2004 macafee and pearson 2006 wood et al 2013 even though jakobsen and madsen 2004 revealed that the analytical typhoon models provide very similar air pressure and tangential wind speed distributions the modified rankine vortex phadke et al 2003 hereafter mrv wind field model provides a more consistent match to wind speed observations bastidas et al 2016 and produces accurate typhoon winds for ocean wave modeling phadke et al 2003 tolman and alves 2005 the parametric typhoon model proposed by holland 1980 i e the holland model hereafter h80 and mrv were therefore employed in the present study to obtain better hybrid wind fields of typhoons an exponential distribution of air pressure for typhoons proposed by schloemer 1954 and modified by holland 1980 is given as 12 p a p c p n p c exp r max r b where p a is the air pressure at an arbitrary point p n is the ambient pressure p c is the central air pressure of the typhoon r max is the radius of the maximum wind speed r is the radial distance from the typhoon s center to an arbitrary point and b is a characterized parameter that can be empirically defined by b 1 5 980 p c 120 hubbert et al 1991 the speed of gradient wind of h80 w g h80 is then given as follows 13 w g h 80 b p n p c ρ a r max r b exp r max r b r f 2 2 r f 2 where ρ a is the air density and f is the coriolis factor equation 13 leads to the maximum wind speed for h80 w max h80 14 w m a x h 80 b p n p c ρ a e the mrv model contains a shape parameter to adjust the distribution of gradient wind speeds w g mrv 15 w g m r v w max m r v r r max α for r r max w max m r v r max r α for r r max where α is a tuning parameter that was chosen as 0 5 based on recommendations in cheung et al 2007 and bastidas et al 2016 an empirical relationship of w max mrv and p c constructed by atkinson and holliday 1997 for typhoons in the northwest pacific ocean was employed 16 w m a x m r v 3 44 1010 p c 0 644 a boundary layer wind speed correction was applied to obtain surface winds w s10 wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface following the relation presented by harper et al 2001 17 w s 10 0 81 w g for w g 6 m s 0 81 2 96 10 3 w g 6 for 6 m s w g 19 5 m s 0 77 4 31 10 3 w g 19 5 for 19 5 m s w g 45 m s 0 66 w g for w g 45 m s where w g can be w g h80 or w g mrv willoughby and rahn 2004 and willoughby et al 2006 found a logarithmic fit to r max as a function of w max and the latitude of typhoon s center ϕ 18 r max 46 4 exp 0 155 w max 0 0169 ϕ where w max can be w max h80 or w max mrv thus r max was derived from equation 18 in the presented study the original h80 and mrv models cannot represent the asymmetric wind field structure of a typhoon even if the highly asymmetric wind field structure of a typhoon often leads to large errors in storm surge and wind wave forecasting georgiou 1985 introduced a translation speed w t to overcome this restriction then the h80 or mrv parametric typhoon wind w pc becomes 19 w p c w s 10 w t 0 5 sin ϑ where ϑ is the angle of the typhoon s direction of motion 2 5 2 cfsr reanalysis wind data the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis hereafter cfsr is a third generation reanalysis product that is a global high resolution coupled atmosphere ocean land surface sea ice system saha et al 2010 the cfsr provided continuous and consistent coverage of atmospheric conditions for 31 years from 1979 to 2009 and was extended to march 2011 the current cfsr will be extended as an operational real time product in the future the cfsr wind data w cfsr were obtained from the research data archive computational information system lab of the national center for atmospheric research ncar the temporal and spatial resolutions are 1 h and 0 312 0 312 respectively 2 5 3 era interim reanalysis wind data the era interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis from 1979 and is continuously updated per month at a delay of two months dee et al 2011 reanalysis wind fields w era produced by the era interim hereafter era were acquired from the public datasets of the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the spatial resolution of the era original grid data set is 0 75 0 75 approximately 80 km in the present study the 10 m u and v wind components of typhoons were extracted from the era reanalysis interpolated product at a temporal resolution of 6 h four analysis fields per day at 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 utc and a spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 2 5 4 ccmp wind vector analysis product the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp is a near global high spatial 0 25 0 25 and temporal 6 h resolution dataset for gridded surface vector winds that are produced using the variational analysis method and acquired data from satellites moored buoys and numerical models atlas et al 2011 the ccmp provides a consistent gap free long term time series of ocean surface wind vector analysis fields from 1987 to present an updated improved and consistently reprocessed version 2 ccmp hereafter ccmpv2 ocean vector wind analysis dataset w ccmp created by scott et al 2016 was utilized in the present study the dynamical wind fields w cfsr w era and w ccmp were converted to each unstructured grid of the schism wwm iii using the inverse distance weighting idw method 2 5 5 hybrid typhoon wind model the reanalysis product is superior to the parametric typhoon model for the wind fields away from the center of the typhoon i e typhoon position from the rsmc however the parametric typhoon model generally creates wind fields of much higher accuracy near the center of a typhoon compared to those of the reanalysis product li et al 2018 therefore the combined usage of the reanalysis wind data and the parametric typhoon model is believed to generate a better entire wind field for typhoons the superposition method is an optimized combination of the wind data from the reanalysis product and the parametric typhoon model pan et al 2016 two formulas proposed by li et al 2018 and shao et al 2018a were employed to reconstruct the hybrid wind fields for typhoons hereafter w h 1 and w h 2 w h 1 is represented as follows 20 w h 1 w p c r r 1 1 α w p c α w r w r 1 r r 2 w r w r r 2 where w rw is the reanalysis wind which can be w cfsr w era or w ccmp and α r r 1 r 2 r 1 r 1 and r 2 are two boundary limits in the transition zone and were set to 8r max and 10r max respectively based on the results of surge wave coupled simulations in the typhoon prone coastal areas of china feng et al 2018 then w h 2 is represented as follows 21 w h 2 w p c r 2 r max β 0 70 β 0 06 w p c 1 β 0 72 1 β 0 28 w r w 2 r max r 7 r max w r w r 7 r max where β 7 r r max 5 in equations 20 and 21 α and β are used to adjust the reanalysis and parametric typhoon model wind α and β play an important role near r 1 8r max and 2rmax while 1 α and 1 β are crucial around r 2 10r max and 7rmax for w h 1 and w h 2 respectively 2 6 typhoon track and buoy data the swh hindcasting was for september 1 to september 30 in 2008 and two typhoon events namely typhoons sinlaku and jangmi occurred during that period those two typhoons were category 2 storms according to the central weather bureau cwb of taiwan fig 3 demonstrates the tracks of typhoons sinlaku fig 3a and jangmi fig 3b the locations of the longdong guishan island and hualien buoys can also be found in fig 3 the past data of typhoons sinlaku and jangmi were obtained from the regional specialized meteorological center rsmc tokyo typhoon center the rsmc provides information on typhoons in the western north pacific and the south china sea including historical present and forecasted positions as well as on the movement and intensity of typhoons 2 7 verification metrics mentaschi et al 2013 suggested that smaller values of the normalized root mean square error nrmse root mean square error rmse and scatter index si do not always identify better numerical simulation performance additionally these indicators are not always reliable for assessing numerical model accuracy the error indicator hh proposed by hanna and heinold 1985 was therefore employed to develop a reliability analysis of wave generation and propagation the hh indicator provides more reliable and accurate information about the accuracy of the results of numerical models and the use of hh therefore allows the performances of simulations and their agreement with observations to be correctly interpreted mentaschi et al 2013 willmott 1981 developed an index of agreement skill to overcome the insensitivity of correlation based measures to differences between measured and simulated means and variances model performance for the hindcast of swhs was evaluated by hh and skill in the present study a lower value of hh expresses better performance a skill value of 1 means a perfect performance a skill value ranging between 0 65 and 1 0 indicates excellent performance a very good performance ranges from 0 5 to 0 65 a good performance ranges from 0 2 to 0 5 and a skill value less than 0 2 represents a poor performance chen et al 2016 the formulas for hh and skill are as follows 22 h h i 1 m o i h o i o 2 i 1 m o i h o i o 23 s k i l l 1 i 1 m o i h o i o 2 i 1 m o i h o o o i o o o 2 where m is the total number of data points o i h is the hindcast o i o is the observation and o o is the mean value of the observations 3 results the cfsr w cfsr era w era and ccmpv2 w ccmp paired with the parametric typhoon wind models with the two superposition formulas served as meteorological conditions for the schism wwm iii tide surge wave fully coupled model to reproduce the historical swhs in the nearshore waters of taiwan the swh observations measured at three wave buoys by the cwb of taiwan in september 2008 were adopted to evaluate the most adequate wind field for hindcasting typhoon driven swhs in the northeastern coastal waters of taiwan the results of model data comparisons were also used to validate the performance of the schism wwm iii in the swh hindcasts it should be noted that the swhs were compared only because the main goal of the present study is to assess the wind forcing effects on hindcasts of storm waves 3 1 hindcasting of swhs using the wind forcing from cfsr era and ccmpv2 fig 4 a f depict the snapshots of the cfsr fig 4a and d era fig 4b and e and ccmpv2 fig 4c and f wind fields imposed on the schism wwm iii for typhoons sinlaku fig 4a c and jangmi fig 4d f as shown in fig 4 the wind velocity from the cfsr is higher than that from the era and ccmpv2 for typhoon sinlaku nevertheless the cfsr produced maximum wind speed resembles that of the ccmpv2 except for location fig 4d and f and is also notably higher than the era in typhoon jangmi the wind speed reached 30 m s for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi using the cfsr but only approached 24 m s when the era wind data were employed the ccmpv2 wind velocity was lower than 24 m s but slightly exceeded 30 m s for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi respectively furthermore the cfsr typhoon wind field is more concentrated than those of the era and ccmpv2 the corresponding snapshots of swh distribution driven by the cfsr era and ccmpv2 are shown in fig 5 a f the cfsr generated swhs of the typhoons fig 5a and d were relatively high and wide compared to those induced by the era fig 5b and e and ccmpv2 fig 5c and f the cfsr generated maximum swhs were more than 12 m while the maximum swhs induced by the era were 8 9 m and 9 10 m for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi respectively in the deep ocean the ccmpv2 only drove the maximum swhs of 6 7 m for typhoon sinlaku but 11 12 m for typhoon jangmi fig 6 presents the time series model data comparison for swhs from sep 5 to sep 30 2008 fig 6a c shows the longdong guishan island and hualien buoys respectively the measured maximum swhs were approximately 7 5 m at the longdong buoy figs 6a 6 0 m at the guishan island buoy figs 6b and 6 5 m at the hualien buoy fig 6c during typhoon sinlaku sep 10 to sep 16 2008 nevertheless the measured maximum swh had exceeded 11 m at the longdong and guishan island buoys and reached up to 10 m at the hualien buoy through typhoon jangmi sep 26 to sep 30 2008 the hindcasts of swhs using the era and ccmpv2 wind fields slightly underestimate the measurements but are greatly inferior to the maximum swhs caused by typhoons sinlaku and jangmi the swhs hindcasted by adopting the wind field from the cfsr are always higher than those hindcasted by employing the era and ccmpv2 the simulated maximum swh even overestimates the observation measured at the longdong buoy during typhoon sinlaku fig 6a the hindcasting maximum swhs for typhoon jangmi are severely underestimated at the longdong and guishan island buoys by the use of the cfsr era and ccmpv2 for which the measured maximal swhs exceeded 11 m this phenomenon is quite obvious for the guishan island buoy where the difference in the era driven and measured maximum swhs can reach 6 m fig 6b the insignificant difference is found at the hualien buoy due to the cfsr wind fields exerted on the model fig 6c the statistical errors of the differences between the model hindcasts and the observations averaged over the three wave buoys were calculated and listed in table 1 although the minimal values of hh and the highest skill values are 0 35 and 0 94 respectively for the ccmpv2 the employment of the cfsr brings minimal averaged difference in the maximum swhs of the typhoons 1 22 m 3 2 hindcasting of swhs using the wind forcing from hybrid wind models the parametric typhoon wind models h80 and mrv were first incorporated into the cfsr to create the hybrid wind fields by means of equation 20 since the minimum error of the maximum swh was acquired for purposes of simplification when blended with h80 and mrv adopting equation 20 the cfsr is denoted the cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 respectively the instantaneous distributions of the reanalysis wind data hybrid wind fields using the cfsr cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 are shown in fig 7 a f fig 7a b and 7c represent the wind fields from the cfsr cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 for typhoon sinlaku while fig 7d f illustrate the wind fields of typhoon jangmi produced by the cfsr cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 the wind speeds of the cfsr h80 h1 fig 7b and e and cfsr mrv h1 fig 7c and f are higher than those of the cfsr moreover the wind fields from the cfsr h80 h and cfsr mrv h1 are intensified around the centers of the typhoons the snapshots of swh distributions corresponding to fig 7a f are demonstrated in fig 8 a f compared to the swhs displayed in fig 5 the cfsr h80 h1 fig 8b and e and cfsr mrv h1 driven fig 8c and f swhs are larger than those generated by the cfsr era and ccmpv2 only the instantaneous maximum swhs exceed 12 m for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi similar to the wind fields shown in fig 7 the hybrid wind induced maximum swhs are closer to the centers of the typhoons additionally the instantaneous maximum swhs appear in the right forward quadrants of the typhoons centers because wind velocities along the right sides of the typhoons are enhanced by the translational speeds of the typhoons moon et al 2003 the time series comparison of hindcasting swhs among the usages of the cfsr cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 wind fields for the three wave buoys can be found in fig 9 the hindcasting swhs generated by the cfsr h80 h1 and cfsr mrv h1 were more consistent with those observed at the longdond and guishan island buoys for typhoon sinlaku fig 9a and b although the overestimations are found at guishan island buoy adopting the cfsr h80 h1 the hindcasting maximum swh of typhoon jangmi was improved by exerting the hybrid winds and this phenomenon is particularly notable for the longdong and guishan island buoys when the cfsr mrv h1 was imposed the maximum swh hindcasts of typhoon jangmi are approximately increased 2 5 3 0 and 0 2 m for the longdong guishan island and hualien buoys respectively compared with using the cfsr only the mrv model was therefore combined with the cfsr through equations 20 and 21 to examine the performance of the merging methods due to the significant improvement of the hindcasting maximum swh the hybrid wind fields were known as the cfsr mrv h1 and cfsr mrv h2 for employing equations 20 and 21 respectively fig 10 illustrates the model data comparisons for swhs using the cfsr cfsr mrv h1 and cfsr mrv h2 there is almost no difference in swh hindcasts between the introduction of the cfsr mrv h1 and cfsr mrv h2 except for typhoon jangmi the hindcasting maximum swhs were slightly raised owing to the exertion of the cfsr mrv h2 winds fig 10b and c the mrv model paired by equation 21 was regarded as the best method for creating the hybrid wind fields of the typhoons according to the results from figs 9 and 10 thus the era and ccmpv2 wind products were incorporate into the mrv model via equation 21 era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 to investigate the improvements of the swh hindcasts the time series and hindcasted swhs employing cfsr mrv h2 era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 are shown in fig 11 comparing the results in figs 6 and 11 a massive increase in the hindcasting maximum swhs was expected for typhoon jangmi although the underestimations remain table 1 summarizes the statistical errors for adopting the wind fields from the cfsr mrv h2 era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 the overall accuracy of swh hindcasting is improved due to usage of the hybrid winds the skill was increased 0 01 from 0 94 for the ccmpv2 to 0 95 for the ccmp mrv h2 and 0 02 from 0 92 for the cfsr to 0 94 for the cfsr mrv h2 and from 0 93 for the era to 0 95 for the era mrv h2 and the hh was decreased 0 01 from 0 38 for the era to 0 37 for the era mrv h2 0 04 from 0 35 for the ccmpv2 to 0 31 for the ccmpv2 mrv h2 and 0 05 from 0 40 for the cfsr to 0 35 for the cfsr mrv h2 the statistical model data differences of swh for the individual wave buoy are listed in tables 2 4 table 2 for the longdong buoy table 3 for the guishan island buoy and table 3 for the hualien buoy the overall errors for the longdong and guishan buoys are slighter than those for the hualien buoy the better performance of swhs hindcasting is expected at the wave buoy located in the right side of typhoon as shown in fig 3 4 discussion combining the reanalysis products and the parametric typhoon models i e hybrid wind fields greatly improves the hindcasting swhs it can be found from the comparisons in figs 6 fig 9 figs 10 and 11 that the exertions of the hybrid wind fields over the schism wwm iii not only increase swhs but also correct the phases of the maximum swhs the maximum swh of typhoon sinlaku hindcasted by the cfsr era and ccmpv2 is much earlier than that by all the hybrid wind fields the averaged time mismatch was reduced from 7 h for the cfsr to 3 h for cfsr mrv h2 from 7 h for the era to 1 h for era mrv h2 and from 6 h for the ccmpv2 to 1 h for ccmp mrv h2 as listed in table 1 these results reveal that the tracks and arrival times of the typhoons acquired from the rsmc are highly accurate even though the wind field from the ccmp mrv h2 brings a maximal skill and achieves the minimal hh for the overall swh hindcasting an exact prediction of typhoon generated maximum swhs is indispensable for the purpose of disaster prevention table 1 lists the averaged differences of the maximum swhs for different wind forcings the dramatic reductions are found because the use of the hybrid winds the cfsr mrv h2 wind field leads the minimal averaged differences of the maximum swh 0 62 m the results show that the typhoon driven extreme large swhs can only be mimicked if the hybrid wind fields especially the cfsr mrv h2 are imposed on the schism wwm iii fig 12 describes the extent of the hindcasting maximal swhs during the periods of typhoons sinlaku fig 12a c and jangmi fig 12d f using the wind fields from the cfsr era and ccmpv2 the maximum extents of maximal swhs for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi over 12 15 m are shown in fig 12a and d respectively for which the cfsr was utilized whereas the employment of the era and ccmpv2 creates the smaller extents of maximal swhs which are only 8 10 m for typhoon sinlaku fig 12b and c and 11 12 m for typhoon jangmi fig 12e and f the distributions of the hindcasting maximal swhs for typhoons sinlaku and jangmi utilizing the wind speeds from the hybrid wind fields are displayed in fig 13 the cfsr mrv h2 era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 produce similar extents of maximal swh for typhoon sinlaku fig 13a c the appearance of the maximal swh distributions for the era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 are shown separately fig 13b and c the maximum extents of maximal swhs over 15 m for typhoon jangmi are huge fig 13d f which is particularly true for the use of the cfsr mrv h2 fig 13d moreover similar to typhoon sinlaku the discrete maximal swh distributions occur when employing the winds from the era mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 fig 13e and f these phenomena might be due to their lower temporal resolution 6 h the asymmetrical appearances existed through all the maximal swh distributions given that the maximum wind speeds always occur on the right sides of typhoons in the northern hemisphere the spatial distributions of percentage difference for the maximal swh by the employment of the hybrid wind model minus the dynamical winds are presented in fig 14 introducing the combinations of the parametric typhoon model and the reanalysis products usually lead to a larger typhoon induced swh than using the reanalysis products only the percentage differences could reach to 20 60 and 20 100 for the cfsr mrv h2 minus cfsr during typhoons sinlaku fig 14a and jangmi fig 14b respectively the percentage differences also range from 20 to 100 for the era mrv h2 minus era and the ccmp mrv h2 minus ccmp during the typhoons sinlaku and jangmi fig 14c f the sensitive areas are found along the right sides of typhoons in deep ocean the cfsr has coarse spatial resolution but high temporal resolution nevertheless the era and ccmpv2 have high spatial resolution but coarse temporal resolution the results from the present study reveal that the hindcasts of swh from the ccmpv2 have the minimal statistical errors for typhoon and non typhoon conditions but typhoon driven large waves are well matched by adopting the winds from the cfsr although it is difficult to provide any insight into whether high spatial or high temporal resolution is more important to the swh hindcasting the wind fields with higher temporal resolution i e the cfsr create a reasonable maximal swh distribution for typhoons fig 12a and d this is more important for hindcasting of typhoon driven large waves the swhs hindcasted by the wwm iii only i e circulation wave uncoupled were conduct to compare the influence of model coupling on typhoon generated storm waves fig 15 a c depict the comparisons of swh hindcasts for the longdong fig 15a guishan island fig 15b and hualien fig 15c buoys using the fully coupled fcp schism wwm iii and uncoupled ucp wwm iii only models and the wind forcing from the cfsr mrv h2 the hindcasts of swh by the fcp model are in good agreement with those adopting the ucp model except slightly higher at the hualien buoy for typhoon jangmi this sensitivity test revealed that the performance of swh hindcasting is more sensitive to wind forcing products than coupling or decoupling effects of circulation and wave models compared to figs 6 9 11 and 15 in other words the uncertainty of typhoon wind field for storm waves hindcasting could be diminished if the hybrid wind models are utilized although the main object of the present study is to evaluate the wind forcing effects on storm wave hindcasting the model data comparisons for two important wave parameters i e mean period and wave direction were conducted by exerting the winds form the cfsr mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 on the schism wwm iii because the minimal swh differences for wave buoys were create via these two wind products tables 1 4 figs 16 and 17 illustrate the results of comparison for mean period fig 16 and wave direction fig 17 respectively the similar trends were made by the cfsr mrv h2 and ccmp mrv h2 however the hindcasting mean periods and wave directions are more accordant with measurements when the cfsr mrv h2 winds were used to drive the schism wwm iii blank lines in figs 16 and 17 swh may be overestimated due to the nonlinear interaction of sea surface roughness and wind speed e g charnock drag even if wind field is given accurately in the present study however typhoon generated large waves were significantly underestimated owing to the weaker typhoon wind speed from the cfsr era and ccmpv2 the schism wwm iii only receives wind data from the atmospheric model or the hybrid wind model this is so called one way coupling for wave and wind models in two way coupling the wave model could send the computed sea surface roughness back to the atmospheric model the two way atmosphere wave coupling leads to a reduction of both surface wind speeds and simulated wave heights and improves the simulation of wind and wave parameters of the model wahle et al 2017 thus the implementation of a fully coupled atmosphere wave ocean model is need for accurate predicting or hindcasting ocean surface waves in the future 5 conclusions in this study the significant wave heights swhs in taiwanese waters during the period of sep 2008 were hindcasted using a high resolution unstructured grid tide surge wave fully coupled model called schism wwm iii the model acquired the wind fields of typhoons from difference sources the reanalysis products were provided by the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr era interim era and cross calibrated multi platform version 2 ccmpv2 the hybrid wind fields were generated by a combination of two parametric typhoon models the holland model h80 and the modified rankine vortex model mrv and the cfsr era and ccmpv2 using two equations the hindcasts of swhs employing the hybrid models and reanalysis winds were compared with observations to determine the wind field estimates resulting in the best performances of swh hindcasting typhoon driven large waves are particularly important the typhoon generated extreme large swhs exceeding 11 m are severely underestimated if only the cfsr era or ccmpv2 wind field was utilized the results presented in this paper reveal that the wind fields obtained from the ccmpv2 and blended into the mrv via equation 21 ccmp mrv h2 could reproduce the swhs over typhoon and nontyphoon conditions the minimal hh and maximal skill however the maximal swhs of typhoons are only well matched when the cfsr was merged with mrv by means of equation 21 cfsr mrv h2 and served as meteorological forcing for the schism wwm iii additionally the phases of typhoon driven swhs during the hindcasting period sep 2008 are corrected by using the hybrid wind fields the wind forcing from the ccmp mrv h2 might be an adequate solution to long term simulation of wave climate regarding the prevention of coastal disasters or designing infrastructure in the nearshore waters the cfsr mrv h2 is the most suitable source of wind fields for modeling swhs induced by typhoons the wind forcings from the hybrid typhoon wind fields can improve the performance of wave computation models that disaster managers and structural engineers rely on for guidance acknowledgments this research was supported by the ministry of science and technology most taiwan grant no most 107 2625 m 865 001 and 108 2625 m 865 001 the authors
