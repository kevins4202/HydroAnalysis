7065,natural soils and aquifers are inherently heterogenous and chemical transport through them is anomalous characterized by an early arrival followed by a persistent tail how to describe such anomalous phenomena has been an interest and as a result a number of approaches have been proposed over the past few decades among others the fractional advection dispersion equation fade is a model able to describe anomalous transport when the dispersion is regional rather than local as presumed in the classical advection dispersion equation practical application of fade needs numerical solutions which is challenging because its spatial discretization gives rise to a full coefficient matrix in this paper we propose a lattice boltzmann model to solve the two dimensional fade given that the anomalous dispersion in soils and aquifers is hydrodynamic and caused by spatial variation in water velocity across the pore space and that the chemical plume spreads preferentially along the mean water flow direction the dispersion coefficient and the order of the fractional derivative should be both anisotropic the anisotropies are solved by the two relaxation time lattice boltzmann model using different relaxation parameters in different directions compared with existing numerical methods for the fade the proposed model has advantages that it is explicit second order accurate in both time and space mass conservative and free of numerical dispersion its stability is independent of dispersion coefficient we verify the model against the analytical solution of a benchmark problem and then apply it to simulate cl movement in a tracer experiment conducted on an up catchment hillslope the results show that the fade with backward skewness can reproduce the breakthrough curves measured from the experiment keywords two dimensional fractional advection dispersion equation lattice boltzmann model anomalous dispersion tracer experiment 1 introduction solute transport in geological formations plays an important role in many fields ranging from geological sequestration of carbon dioxide to uptake of nutrients by plant roots from soils and its numerical simulation has been an interest in the past century berkowitz et al 2006 the spreading of soluble chemicals in the subsurface is hydrodynamic and caused by variation in water velocity across the pore space in early models aimed for large scales the spatial dispersion of the chemicals was often assumed to be normal but recent studies have found that even in columns filled with repacked soil solute transport is anomalous rather than gaussian as preciously presumed cortis and berkowitz 2004 zhang and lv 2007 theoretically an anomalous dispersion would undergo a transition becoming normal if sufficient time is allowed in practical applications however both time and space are limited and such a transition might never complete how to describe anomalous dispersion is thus an interest and a number of approaches have been developed over the past few decades berkowitz et al 2006 simunek et al 2003 the early models separated the water in a medium into a slow flow region and a fast flow region assuming that solute dispersion in each region can be described by an advection dispersion equation and that the anomaly emerges from the mass exchange between the two regions gerke and van genuchten 1993 when water in the slow region is stagnant it reduces to the mobile immobile model coats and smith 1964 an approach widely used to simulate solute transport in aggregated soils hu et al 2014 van genuchten 1980 the two region model is able to describe the anomalous dispersion feehley et al 2000 sardin et al 1991 but how to spatially divide the water cannot be determined a priori and has to be calculated by calibration against experimental data haggerty and gorelick 1995 for media that do not have distinguishable hierarchical structures such as columns packed with round glass beads desmedt and wierenga 1984 spatially dividing the water into mobile and immobile regions is arbitrary and not physically sound as such a more appropriate approach is to use a model that is capable of describing the erratic variation of the water velocity across the pore space which is the origin of the anomalous dispersion one of such approaches is the continuous time random walk ctrw developed in the 1970s to model anomalous movement of electrons in amorphous solid scher and montroll 1975 berkowitz and scher 1995 introduced it to hydrogeology to simulate chemical transport in structured media the ctrw views solute transport in a porous material as a series of transitions and the ensemble average of the transport is determined by the joint probability distribution of these transitions metzler and klafter 2000 when the length of these transitions follows a levy distribution in which the soluble chemicals have appreciable chances to move long distances the ctrw reduces to the fractional advection dispersion equation fade when the probability of these long distances follow a power law the fade captures some key features often seen in the breakthrough curves measured from tracer experiments benson et al 2000a zhang et al 2007a and benson and his colleagues introduced it to hydrogeology benson et al 2001 benson et al 2004 benson et al 2000b zhang et al 2007b unlike the classical advection dispersion equation the fade is difficult to solve analytically even under simple boundary conditions its practical applications therefore rely on numerical solution since the dispersion in fade is regional its spatial discretization in numerical solution gives rise to a full coefficient matrix which is expensive to solve wang and du 2014 how to efficiently solve the fade has been an interest and different methods ranging from finite difference method ercan and kavvas 2017 finite volume method zhang et al 2005 to finite element method huang et al 2008 zhao et al 2017 have been proposed the early study on numerical solution of fade focused on one dimension and it has been recently extended to two dimensions with the transport domain discretized using either regular or irregular grids bu et al 2014 pang et al 2016 sun et al 2017 wang and basu 2012 yang et al 2017 zeng et al 2014 one issue in using fade to simulate solute transport in porous media is how to define and treat different types of boundaries zhang et al 2007a the lattice boltzmann lb model is an alternative method to solve transport problems the lb model was proposed to simulate fluid dynamics chen and doolen 1998 and it has been developed into an efficient method to solve solute transport in both surface and subsurface water anwar and sukop 2009 liu et al 2016 servan camas and tsai 2009 zhang et al 2002a unlike traditional numerical methods the lb model simulates fluid flow by tracking the movement and collisions of a number of fictitious particles under constraint that the collisions conserve mass and momentum qian et al 1992 for simulating solute transport the lb model has advantages that it is insusceptible to numerical dispersion and its stability is independent of dispersion coefficient ginzburg 2005b zhang et al 2002b over the past two decades the lb model has been used to simulate a wide variety of processes in porous media at various scales and zhou et al 2016 recently applied it to solve the one dimensional fade the anomaly emerging in chemical transport in the subsurface is caused by variation in water velocity across the pore scale and the solute movement in natural soils and aquifers is normally multi dimensional even the regional groundwater flow could be approximated as one dimensional in this paper we propose an lb model to solve the two dimensional fade we acknowledge that the multi dimensional fade for solute transport in the subsurface is complicated meerschaert et al 1999 and in this paper we focus on a simple scenario where the average water flow is one dimensional and the dispersion is two dimensional the solute plume in the subsurface is stretched predominately along the mean water flow direction and as a result like the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient which is caused by fluid velocity variation the order of the fractional derivative is also anisotropic the dispersion in fade is regional and to ensure that the collision in the lb model conserves mass we use the two relaxation time approach in which both the equilibrium distribution functions and the particle distribution functions are assumed to comprise a symmetric part and an asymmetric part the collision associated with each part is calculated separately using different relaxation time parameters we first verify the model against the analytical solution of a benchmark problem and then apply it to simulate cl movement through fractured soil in a tracer experiment conducted on an up catchment hillslope we also discuses the pros and cons of the model in comparison with other numerical models 2 the model and boundary treatment the dispersion of solute in porous formations is hydrodynamic and caused by variation in water velocity across the pore space solute spreads more quickly in the mean water flow direction than in other directions as such like the dispersion coefficient the order of the fractional derivative is also anisotropic different lb models have been proposed to solve the classic anisotropic advection dispersion equation chai et al 2016 ginzburg 2005a zhang et al 2002a and in this paper we use the two relaxation time trt approach developed by ginzburg 2005a because the dispersive flux in fade depends on global concentration rather than local concentration gradient as in the classical ade in the trt model both particle distribution function and the equilibrium distribution function are divided into a symmetric part and an asymmetric part and the collision involved in each part is calculated separately using different relaxation time parameters 2 1 the model the spatiotemporal propagation of all particle distribution functions in the trt model is described by the following formulae li and huang 2008 1 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t τ 0 f i e q x t f i x t τ i f i e q x t f i x t f i e q x t f i eq x t f i eq x t 2 f i x t f i x t f i x t 2 where x is the coordinate of a point defined in the cartesian coordinate system t is time f i x t is the particle distribution function at location x and t moving with lattice velocity e i f i eq x t is the equilibrium distribution function the value of f i x t at equilibrium τi and τ0 are dimensionless relaxation parameters δt it a time step and the subscripts i and i means e i e i in eq 1 f i e q and f i e q are the symmetric and the asymmetric equilibrium distribution functions respectively in the direction i and f i and f i are their associated particle distribution functions the dispersion we consider in this paper is anisotropic but there is no diagonal dispersive flux as such we use the d2q5 rather than the d2q9 commonly used in the literature for anisotropic dispersion ginzburg 2005b zhang et al 2002a the computational cost of lb model is proportional to the number of lattice velocities and using the d2q5 can therefore improve computational efficiency approximately by 44 compared to the d2q9 in short the five lattice velocities are based on rectangular grids and defined as follows 2 e i 0 0 i 0 δ x δ t 0 i 1 2 0 δ y δ t i 3 4 where δx and δy are the length and width of the rectangular grids as shown in fig 1 to divide the transport domain the equilibrium distribution functions in the five directions are defined as follows 3 f i eq δ x γ x 1 ω x 2 5 c e i u e i e i 5 i 1 2 f i eq δ y γ y 1 ω y 2 5 c e i u e i e i 5 i 3 4 f 0 eq c i 1 4 f i eq where c is concentration γ x and γ y are parameters and u is the mean water flow velocity from the definition in eq 1 the symmetric and the asymmetric parts of the equilibrium distribution functions are 4 f i e q δ x γ x 1 ω x 5 i 1 2 f i e q δ y γ y 1 ω y 5 i 3 4 f 0 e q c i 1 4 f i eq f i e q 0 5 c e i u e i e i i 1 2 3 4 f 0 e q 0 from eq 4 we therefore have 5a i 0 4 f i e q c i 0 4 f i e q i 0 4 f i 0 for ease of analysis we assume that the transport domain is rectangular with x y 0 l x 0 l y to ensure that the dispersion described by the above model is regional the two terms in eq 3 ω x and ω y are defined as follows 5b ω x 1 γ 1 γ x 1 ρ 0 x c ξ t x ξ γ x d ξ ρ x l x c ξ t ξ x γ x d ξ ω y 1 γ 1 γ y 1 θ 0 y c ξ t y ξ γ y d ξ θ y l y c ξ t ξ y γ y d ξ where γ x is the gamma function ρ and θ are skew parameters and γ x 0 γ x 1 and γ y 0 γ y 1 are related to the order of the fractional derivative in the x and y directions respectively spatial spreading of solute in soils and aquifers is anisotropic and is solved in this paper by setting the relaxation parameter varying with direction as follows 6 τ i τ x i 1 2 τ y i 3 4 the collision in eq 1 needs to conserve mass meaning that the following condition needs to be satisfied 7 i 0 4 τ 0 f i e q f i τ i f i e q f i 0 from the definition of f i e q and f i as well as the relationship in eq 6 we have 8 i 0 4 τ i f i e q i 0 4 τ i f i e q i 0 4 τ 0 f i i 0 4 τ i f i 0 c i 0 4 f i e q i 0 4 f i i 0 4 f i as proven in the appendix at the limits the above lattice boltzmann model recovers the following equation 9 c t u c x x d x γ x c x γ x d x γ x c x γ x y d y γ y c y γ y y d y γ y c y γ y γ x c x γ x 1 γ 1 γ x 0 x c x ξ γ x d ξ γ x c x γ x 1 γ 1 γ x x l x c ξ x γ x d ξ γ y c y γ y 1 γ 1 γ y 0 y c y ξ γ y d ξ γ y c y γ y 1 γ 1 γ y 0 y c ξ y γ y d ξ where the dispersion coefficients are given by 10 d x 2 5 1 τ x 1 2 δ x 1 γ x δ t d y 2 5 1 τ y 1 2 δ y 1 γ y δ t the relaxation parameter τ0 is a free parameter and does not affect solute spreading in numerical solutions the integrals in eq 9 are approximately by 11 0 x i c ξ t x ξ γ x d ξ δ x 1 γ x n 0 i 1 c n j c n 1 j 2 i n 1 γ x i 1 n 1 γ x 1 γ

δ y 1 γ y m i m 1 c i m c i m 1 2 m 1 j 1 γ y m j 1 γ y 1 γ y implementation of the above method involves two steps the first one is to calculate all terms on the right hand side of eq 1 using the data available at time t i e to calculate f i f i x t τ 0 f i e q x t f i x t τ i f i e q x t f i x t and the second step is to stream f i to a new position at x e i δ t during the time period of δt 2 2 boundary treatment the boundary comes into play during the streaming step when the particle distribution functions hit the boundary the boundary treatment in the lb model is to deal with these particle distribution functions and it is not as straightforward as in other numerical methods such as the finite volume and the finite element methods huang et al 2008 zhang et al 2005 in this work we consider two types of boundaries one is prescribed concentration boundary and the other one is prescribed flux boundary solving prescribed concentration boundary is straightforward and we take the scenario shown in fig 1 as an illustrative example where the boundary is represented by the line ab during the streaming step the particle distribution function f 1 comes from outside the domain and does not physically exist when solving a boundary where the concentration is specified the particle distribution function coming from outside the domain can be calculated as follows to ensure that the prescribed concentration on the boundary is maintained 12 f 1 c 0 f 0 f 2 f 3 f 4 where c0 is the prescribed concentration for solving the prescribed flux boundary we need to establish the relationship between the flux and the particle distribution functions as proven in the appendix taking the scenario shown in fig 1 as an illustrative example the mass flux across the boundary ab can be calculated as follows using the particle distribution functions 13 q x 2 0 5 τ x u c 1 0 5 τ x f 1 f 2 q y 1 0 5 τ y f 3 f 4 therefore if the flux on the boundary ab is known the particle distribution function coming from outside the domain is calculated by 14 f 1 q 0 2 0 5 τ x u c 1 0 5 τ x 1 f 2 where q 0 is the prescribed flux one common boundary in solute transport in the subsurface is the interface between stream and aquifer which is usually assumed to be a free drainage boundary at which the flux is convective i e q 0 u c from eq 14 it can be proven that in the lb model the stream aquifer interface can be solved by 15 f 1 f 2 u c eq 15 reduces to the standard bounce back method when the water velocity at the boundary becomes zero 3 validation and application 3 1 validation against analytical solution we verified the model mathematically against the following benchmark problem taken from bu et al 2014 although it does not have a physical background 16 c t 1

f x y t 15 e t y 2 y 2 y cos ψ x π x 1 2 ψ x 1 x 1 2 ψ x γ 2 2 ψ x 2 x 2 2 ψ x 2 1 x 2 2 ψ x γ 3 2 ψ x 10 e t x 2 x cos ψ y π y 1 2 ψ y 1 y 1 2 ψ y γ 2 2 ψ y 2 y 2 2 ψ y 2 1 y 2 2 ψ y γ 3 2 ψ y the analytical solution of the above fade is c 10 exp t x x 2 y y 2 the orders of the fractional derivatives in the lb simulations were assumed to be γ x 0 4 and γ y 0 8 and the transport domain was divided into 20 20 grids the time step used in the simulations was 0 01 the analytical solutions and the simulated results are compared in fig 2 they agree well 3 2 application to a hillslope tracer experiment a tracer experiment was conducted on a hillslope in a small catchment in north scotland detailed description of the physical and chemical properties of the soil in the catchment as well as the tracer experiment can be found in the literature deeks et al 2004 stutter et al 2005 zhang et al 2005 for completeness however we briefly present it here the soil at the experimental site is ferritic podzol and consists of an organic horizon o horizon a very thin a horizon and a slightly indurated b horizon extending to the base rock the b horizon is fractured as shown in fig 3 a and these fractures provide pathways for soluble chemicals the experiment was conducted over a plot of 15 m 60 m with the longer side parallel to the slope 4 5 as shown in fig 3b and c prior to the experiment the soil in the plot was brought to saturation by keeping water level in a trench on the top of the plot level with the ground surface and the water was therefore driven to flow by gravity once water flow was deemed to have reached steady state a pulse of dissolved nacl was added to the middle of the trench followed by 140 hour flushing with water taken from a stream downstream of the plot the concentration of cl in the soil water was measured from two rows of piezometers downstream of the trench after each four hour up to 64 h the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix in the o and the b horizons measured using a permeameter was 1 24 m day and 6 48 m day respectively while the time at which cl peaked in the measured breakthrough curves was faster than predicted using these hydraulic conductivities indicating that the convective movement of cl was predominantly through the fracture networks the prolonged tails in the breakthrough curves imply that there was a mass exchange between the soil matrix and the fractures previous studies approximated the tracer movement in the above experiment using the one dimensional factional advection dispersion equation zhang et al 2005 while in reality the salt movement was two dimensional and we hence simulate it using the 2d lb model compared with the classical advection dispersion equation the fade involves more parameters and most of them including the order of the fractional derivative cannot be determined a priori and need to be calculated by calibration against experimental data calculating the parameters in fade is an area where progress is still being made and in this paper we used the trial errors to calculate them by manually adjusting the parameters until the simulated results can match the observations we acknowledge that different combinations of parameters might give the same results and to reduce such uncertainties we assumed that the dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the mean water flow direction is normal i e γ y 1 and that the anomaly occurs only in the mean water flow direction this is rational as the abnormal dispersion is hydrodynamic and caused by water velocity variation across the pore space also based on the available study on solute transport in heterogenous media characterized with fast flow pathways ferreira and pinto 2016 we chose the skewness parameter to be either ρ 0 or ρ 1 in all simulations the x direction is along the slope and the downstream boundary is set at the edge of a downstream stream as illustrated in fig 3 the upstream boundary is set 1 m away from the trench through which the tracer was injected the background cl concentration is 5 mg l and in all simulations we subtracted it from the simulated concentration as an illustration we first demonstrate the impact of the skewness parameter and the order of the fractional derivative on migration and spatial distribution of the plume as they are the key parameters controlling the anomaly fig 4 shows three snapshots at time t 50 h simulated using different combinations of ρ and γ x with other parameters kept the same at ux 1 0 m h δ x δ y 0 5 m δ 0 1 h and d y 0 088 m 2 h in the figures the simulated concentration is normalised as c x y c max where cmax is the peak concentration in each map the plume skews backward when ρ 0 5 and forward when ρ 0 5 for comparison with the measurements we first show the results calculated using the fully backward fade with ρ 0 0 the diameter of all piezometers used to sample the water for measuring cl concentration was approximately 2 cm and the change of the concentration measured from them was highly irregular several piezometers did not show any significant change in cl concentration we therefore only compared the results for locations where the piezometers showed significant changes in cl concentration during the experiment the comparison is shown in fig 5 a in which for easy to read we only plot the simulated breakthrough curves for the locations of piezometers 3 and 5 shown in fig 3 with the simulated breakthrough curves for other piezometers between the best fitting parameters for the two curves are ρ 0 0 ux 0 6 m h dx 16 5 m1 45 h and dy 0 664 m2 h the forward skewed fractional fade associated with ρ 1 0 had been used by some researchers to describe the anomalous dispersion benson 2001 but it is not accurate enough to describe the persistent trails in the breakthrough curves measured from the experiment the best we could achieve using the forward skewed fade is shown in fig 5b the best fitting parameters in which are ρ 1 0 ux 1 5 m h dx 15 3 m1 6 h and dy 0 51 m2 h comparing fig 5a and 5b reveals that the forward skewed fade overestimates the early arrival while it underestimates the prolonged tails the likely reason is that there are no well connected big fractures at the experiment site to quickly move the tracer downstream as implied in the forward skewed fade and using ρ 1 is hence unable to capture the slow movement or even stagnation of solute within the soil matrix in contrast the backward skewed fade reproduces the breakthrough curves reasonably well including the early breakthrough and the delayed arrival the backward skewed fade improves the fitting but except for piezometer 2 it still slightly underestimates the persistent tails in the breakthrough curves measured from other three piezometers indicating that a significant portion of the solute in the matrix might be stagnant a recent study on tracer movement in single well and push pull tests also found that using the spatial fade alone is insufficient to reproduce the heavy tails in the measured breakthrough curves due to the stagnation of solute in impermeable zones and that combining the spatial fade with the fractal mobile immobile model can improve the matching chen et al 2017 as the overarching purpose of this paper is to introduce the lb model for solving the spatial fade with exemplary application we did not explore further on how to improve the fitting as an illustration to mimic how the tracer migrated over the slope during the experiment fig 6 shows three snapshots simulated when the cl moved through the soils it is worth pointing out that other approaches such as the multi region model and the ctrw model dentz and berkowitz 2003 li et al 2018 might also be able to reproduce the measured breakthrough curves since the purpose of this paper is to present the lb model for the 2d fade and to show that it can correctly simulate anomalous dispersion in soils and aquifers we did not compare different models 4 conclusions the fractional advection dispersion equation fade can capture some key features in the breakthrough curves measured from tracer movement in both surface and subsurface water and has been widely used to simulate solute transport in soils and aquifers unlike the classical advection dispersion equation the fade is difficult to solve numerically because its spatial discretization leads to a full coefficient matrix which is expensive to solve especially in multi dimensions tremendous efforts have been expended over the past decade to improve the efficiency of numerical solution of the fade and in this paper we propose a lb model for 2d fade where water flow is one dimensional and the dispersion is two dimensional since the spreading of solute in porous media is caused by variation of water velocity across the pore space the order of the factional derivative along with the dispersion coefficient should be anisotropic to reflect that if solute movement can be viewed as a series of jumps bijeljic and blunt 2006 the probability distribution of these jumps in the direction parallel with mean water flow should differ from that in the direction normal to the mean water flow the proposed model is based on the two time relaxation lb approach by dividing each particle distribution function and its associated equilibrium distribution function into a symmetric part and an asymmetric part with each part relaxed differently in calculating the collision the anisotropy in the dispersion coefficient and the order of the fractional derivative are recovered by varying the relaxation parameter with direction we derive the relationship between the particle distribution functions and the mass flux and discuss how to solve different types of boundaries the model is verified against the analytical solution of a benchmark problem and is then applied to simulate cl movement in a tracer experiment conducted on a hillslope with a fractured b horizon compared with other numerical methods such as the finite difference method and the finite element method the proposed model has advantages that it is explicit fully mass conservative and second order accurate in both time and space in addition its stability is independent of dispersion coefficient which differs from other numerical methods existing in the literature however like the lb model for fluid flow and other transport problems the proposed model is explicit and numerically stable only when the mach number is relatively small as shown in the appendix acknowledgements we thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript the research of fw xjs and

anomalous rather than gaussian as preciously presumed cortis and berkowitz 2004 zhang and lv 2007 theoretically an anomalous dispersion would undergo a transition becoming normal if sufficient time is allowed in practical applications however both time and space are limited and such a transition might never complete how to describe anomalous dispersion is thus an interest and a number of approaches have been developed over the past few decades berkowitz et al 2006 simunek et al 2003 the early models separated the water in a medium into a slow flow region and a fast flow region assuming that solute dispersion in each region can be described by an advection dispersion equation and that the anomaly emerges from the mass exchange between the two regions gerke and van genuchten 1993 when water in the slow region is stagnant it reduces to the mobile immobile model coats and smith 1964 an approach widely used to simulate solute transport in aggregated soils hu et al 2014 van genuchten 1980 the two region model is able to describe the anomalous dispersion feehley et al 2000 sardin et al 1991 but how to spatially divide the water cannot be determined a priori and has to be calculated by calibration against experimental data haggerty and gorelick 1995 for media that do not have distinguishable hierarchical structures such as columns packed with round glass beads desmedt and wierenga 1984 spatially dividing the water into mobile and immobile regions is arbitrary and not physically sound as such a more appropriate approach is to use a model that is capable of describing the erratic variation of the water velocity across the pore space which is the origin of the anomalous dispersion one of such approaches is the continuous time random walk ctrw developed in the 1970s to model anomalous movement of electrons in amorphous solid scher and montroll 1975 berkowitz and scher 1995 introduced it to hydrogeology to simulate chemical transport in structured media the ctrw views solute transport in a porous material as a series of transitions and the ensemble average of the transport is determined by the joint probability distribution of these transitions metzler and klafter 2000 when the length of these transitions follows a levy distribution in which the soluble chemicals have appreciable chances to move long distances the ctrw reduces to the fractional advection dispersion equation fade when the probability of these long distances follow a power law the fade captures some key features often seen in the breakthrough curves measured from tracer experiments benson et al 2000a zhang et al 2007a and benson and his colleagues introduced it to hydrogeology benson et al 2001 benson et al 2004 benson et al 2000b zhang et al 2007b unlike the classical advection dispersion equation the fade is difficult to solve analytically even under simple boundary conditions its practical applications therefore rely on numerical solution since the dispersion in fade is regional its spatial discretization in numerical solution gives rise to a full coefficient matrix which is expensive to solve wang and du 2014 how to efficiently solve the fade has been an interest and different methods ranging from finite difference method ercan and kavvas 2017 finite volume method zhang et al 2005 to finite element method huang et al 2008 zhao et al 2017 have been proposed the early study on numerical solution of fade focused on one dimension and it has been recently extended to two dimensions with the transport domain discretized using either regular or irregular grids bu et al 2014 pang et al 2016 sun et al 2017 wang and basu 2012 yang et al 2017 zeng et al 2014 one issue in using fade to simulate solute transport in porous media is how to define and treat different types of boundaries zhang et al 2007a the lattice boltzmann lb model is an alternative method to solve transport problems the lb model was proposed to simulate fluid dynamics chen and doolen 1998 and it has been developed into an efficient method to solve solute transport in both surface and subsurface water anwar and sukop 2009 liu et al 2016 servan camas and tsai 2009 zhang et al 2002a unlike traditional numerical methods the lb model simulates fluid flow by tracking the movement and collisions of a number of fictitious particles under constraint that the collisions conserve mass and momentum qian et al 1992 for simulating solute transport the lb model has advantages that it is insusceptible to numerical dispersion and its stability is independent of dispersion coefficient ginzburg 2005b zhang et al 2002b over the past two decades the lb model has been used to simulate a wide variety of processes in porous media at various scales and zhou et al 2016 recently applied it to solve the one dimensional fade the anomaly emerging in chemical transport in the subsurface is caused by variation in water velocity across the pore scale and the solute movement in natural soils and aquifers is normally multi dimensional even the regional groundwater flow could be approximated as one dimensional in this paper we propose an lb model to solve the two dimensional fade we acknowledge that the multi dimensional fade for solute transport in the subsurface is complicated meerschaert et al 1999 and in this paper we focus on a simple scenario where the average water flow is one dimensional and the dispersion is two dimensional the solute plume in the subsurface is stretched predominately along the mean water flow direction and as a result like the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient which is caused by fluid velocity variation the order of the fractional derivative is also anisotropic the dispersion in fade is regional and to ensure that the collision in the lb model conserves mass we use the two relaxation time approach in which both the equilibrium distribution functions and the particle distribution functions are assumed to comprise a symmetric part and an asymmetric part the collision associated with each part is calculated separately using different relaxation time parameters we first verify the model against the analytical solution of a benchmark problem and then apply it to simulate cl movement through fractured soil in a tracer experiment conducted on an up catchment hillslope we also discuses the pros and cons of the model in comparison with other numerical models 2 the model and boundary treatment the dispersion of solute in porous formations is hydrodynamic and caused by variation in water velocity across the pore space solute spreads more quickly in the mean water flow direction than in other directions as such like the dispersion coefficient the order of the fractional derivative is also anisotropic different lb models have been proposed to solve the classic anisotropic advection dispersion equation chai et al 2016 ginzburg 2005a zhang et al 2002a and in this paper we use the two relaxation time trt approach developed by ginzburg 2005a because the dispersive flux in fade depends on global concentration rather than local concentration gradient as in the classical ade in the trt model both particle distribution function and the equilibrium distribution function are divided into a symmetric part and an asymmetric part and the collision involved in each part is calculated separately using different relaxation time parameters 2 1 the model the spatiotemporal propagation of all particle distribution functions in the trt model is described by the following formulae li and huang 2008 1 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t τ 0 f i e q x t f i x t τ i f i e q x t f i x t f i e q x t f i eq x t f i eq x t 2 f i x t f i x t f i x t 2 where x is the coordinate of a point defined in the cartesian coordinate system t is time f i x t is the particle distribution function at location x and t moving with lattice velocity e i f i eq x t is the equilibrium distribution function the value of f i x t at equilibrium τi and τ0 are dimensionless relaxation parameters δt it a time step and the subscripts i and i means e i e i in eq 1 f i e q and f i e q are the symmetric and the asymmetric equilibrium distribution functions respectively in the direction i and f i and f i are their associated particle distribution functions the dispersion we consider in this paper is anisotropic but there is no diagonal dispersive flux as such we use the d2q5 rather than the d2q9 commonly used in the literature for anisotropic dispersion ginzburg 2005b zhang et al 2002a the computational cost of lb model is proportional to the number of lattice velocities and using the d2q5 can therefore improve computational efficiency approximately by 44 compared to the d2q9 in short the five lattice velocities are based on rectangular grids and defined as follows 2 e i 0 0 i 0 δ x δ t 0 i 1 2 0 δ y δ t i 3 4 where δx and δy are the length and width of the rectangular grids as shown in fig 1 to divide the transport domain the equilibrium distribution functions in the five directions are defined as follows 3 f i eq δ x γ x 1 ω x 2 5 c e i u e i e i 5 i 1 2 f i eq δ y γ y 1 ω y 2 5 c e i u e i e i 5 i 3 4 f 0 eq c i 1 4 f i eq where c is concentration γ x and γ y are parameters and u is the mean water flow velocity from the definition in eq 1 the symmetric and the asymmetric parts of the equilibrium distribution functions are 4 f i e q δ x γ x 1 ω x 5 i 1 2 f i e q δ y γ y 1 ω y 5 i 3 4 f 0 e q c i 1 4 f i eq f i e q 0 5 c e i u e i e i i 1 2 3 4 f 0 e q 0 from eq 4 we therefore have 5a i 0 4 f i e q c i 0 4 f i e q i 0 4 f i 0 for ease of analysis we assume that the transport domain is rectangular with x y 0 l x 0 l y to ensure that the dispersion described by the above model is regional the two terms in eq 3 ω x and ω y are defined as follows 5b ω x 1 γ 1 γ x 1 ρ 0 x c ξ t x ξ γ x d ξ ρ x l x c ξ t ξ x γ x d ξ ω y 1 γ 1 γ y 1 θ 0 y c ξ t y ξ γ y d ξ θ y l y c ξ t ξ y γ y d ξ where γ x is the gamma function ρ and θ are skew parameters and γ x 0 γ x 1 and γ y 0 γ y 1 are related to the order of the fractional derivative in the x and y directions respectively spatial spreading of solute in soils and aquifers is anisotropic and is solved in this paper by setting the relaxation parameter varying with direction as follows 6 τ i τ x i 1 2 τ y i 3 4 the collision in eq 1 needs to conserve mass meaning that the following condition needs to be satisfied 7 i 0 4 τ 0 f i e q f i τ i f i e q f i 0 from the definition of f i e q and f i as well as the relationship in eq 6 we have 8 i 0 4 τ i f i e q i 0 4 τ i f i e q i 0 4 τ 0 f i i 0 4 τ i f i 0 c i 0 4 f i e q i 0 4 f i i 0 4 f i as proven in the appendix at the limits the above lattice boltzmann model recovers the following equation 9

parameter and does not affect solute spreading in numerical solutions the integrals in eq 9 are approximately by 11 0 x i c ξ t x ξ γ x d ξ δ x 1 γ x n 0 i 1 c n j c n 1 j 2 i n 1 γ x i 1 n 1 γ x 1 γ

δ y 1 γ y m i m 1 c i m c i m 1 2 m 1 j 1 γ y m j 1 γ y 1 γ y implementation of the above method involves two steps the first one is to calculate all terms on the right hand side of eq 1 using the data available at time t i e to calculate f i f i x t τ 0 f i e q x t f i x t τ i f i e q x t f i x t and the second step is to stream f i to a new position at x e i δ t during the time period of δt 2 2 boundary treatment the boundary comes into play during the streaming step when the particle distribution functions hit the boundary the boundary treatment in the lb model is to deal with these particle distribution functions and it is not as straightforward as in other numerical methods such as the finite volume and the finite element methods huang et al 2008 zhang et al 2005 in this work we consider two types of boundaries one is prescribed concentration boundary and the other one is prescribed flux boundary solving prescribed concentration boundary is straightforward and we take the scenario shown in fig 1 as an illustrative example where the boundary is represented by the line ab during the streaming step the particle distribution function f 1 comes from outside the domain and does not physically exist when solving a boundary where the concentration is specified the particle distribution function coming from outside the domain can be calculated as follows to ensure that the prescribed concentration on the boundary is maintained 12 f 1 c 0 f 0 f 2 f 3 f 4 where c0 is the prescribed concentration for solving the prescribed flux boundary we need to establish the relationship between the flux and the particle distribution functions as proven in the appendix taking the scenario shown in fig 1 as an illustrative example the mass flux across the boundary ab can be calculated as follows using the particle distribution functions 13 q x 2 0 5 τ x u c 1 0 5 τ x f 1 f 2 q y 1 0 5 τ y f 3 f 4 therefore if the flux on the boundary ab is known the particle distribution function coming from outside the domain is calculated by 14 f 1 q 0 2 0 5 τ x u c 1 0 5 τ x 1 f 2 where q 0 is the prescribed flux one common boundary in solute transport in the subsurface is the interface between stream and aquifer which is usually assumed to be a free drainage boundary at which the flux is convective i e q 0 u c from eq 14 it can be proven that in the lb model the stream aquifer interface can be solved by 15 f 1 f 2 u c eq 15 reduces to the standard bounce back method when the water velocity at the boundary becomes zero 3 validation and application 3 1 validation against analytical solution we verified the model mathematically against the following benchmark problem taken from bu et al 2014 although it does not have a physical background 16 c t 1

analytical solution of the above fade is c 10 exp t x x 2 y y 2 the orders of the fractional derivatives in the lb simulations were assumed to be γ x 0 4 and γ y 0 8 and the transport domain was divided into 20 20 grids the time step used in the simulations was 0 01 the analytical solutions and the simulated results are compared in fig 2 they agree well 3 2 application to a hillslope tracer experiment a tracer experiment was conducted on a hillslope in a small catchment in north scotland detailed description of the physical and chemical properties of the soil in the catchment as well as the tracer experiment can be found in the literature deeks et al 2004 stutter et al 2005 zhang et al 2005 for completeness however we briefly present it here the soil at the experimental site is ferritic podzol and consists of an organic horizon o horizon a very thin a horizon and a slightly indurated b horizon extending to the base rock the b horizon is fractured as shown in fig 3 a and these fractures provide pathways for soluble chemicals the experiment was conducted over a plot of 15 m 60 m with the longer side parallel to the slope 4 5 as shown in fig 3b and c prior to the experiment the soil in the plot was brought to saturation by keeping water level in a trench on the top of the plot level with the ground surface and the water was therefore driven to flow by gravity once water flow was deemed to have reached steady state a pulse of dissolved nacl was added to the middle of the trench followed by 140 hour flushing with water taken from a stream downstream of the plot the concentration of cl in the soil water was measured from two rows of piezometers downstream of the trench after each four hour up to 64 h the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix in the o and the b horizons measured using a permeameter was 1 24 m day and 6 48 m day respectively while the time at which cl peaked in the measured breakthrough curves was faster than predicted using these hydraulic conductivities indicating that the convective movement of cl was predominantly through the fracture networks the prolonged tails in the breakthrough curves imply that there was a mass exchange between the soil matrix and the fractures previous studies approximated the tracer movement in the above experiment using the one dimensional factional advection dispersion equation zhang et al 2005 while in reality the salt movement was two dimensional and we hence simulate it using the 2d lb model compared with the classical advection dispersion equation the fade involves more parameters and most of them including the order of the fractional derivative cannot be determined a priori and need to be calculated by calibration against experimental data calculating the parameters in fade is an area where progress is still being made and in this paper we used the trial errors to calculate them by manually adjusting the parameters until the simulated results can match the observations we acknowledge that different combinations of parameters might give the same results and to reduce such uncertainties we assumed that the dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the mean water flow direction is normal i e γ y 1 and that the anomaly occurs only in the mean water flow direction this is rational as the abnormal dispersion is hydrodynamic and caused by water velocity variation across the pore space also based on the available study on solute transport in heterogenous media characterized with fast flow pathways ferreira and pinto 2016 we chose the skewness parameter to be either ρ 0 or ρ 1 in all simulations the x direction is along the slope and the downstream boundary is set at the edge of a downstream stream as illustrated in fig 3 the upstream boundary is set 1 m away from the trench through which the tracer was injected the background cl concentration is 5 mg l and in all simulations we subtracted it from the simulated concentration as an illustration we first demonstrate the impact of the skewness parameter and the order of the fractional derivative on migration and spatial distribution of the plume as they are the key parameters controlling the anomaly fig 4 shows three snapshots at time t 50 h simulated using different combinations of ρ and γ x with other parameters kept the same at ux 1 0 m h δ x δ y 0 5 m δ 0 1 h and d y 0 088 m 2 h in the figures the simulated concentration is normalised as c x y c max where cmax is the peak concentration in each map the plume skews backward when ρ 0 5 and forward when ρ 0 5 for comparison with the measurements we first show the results calculated using the fully backward fade with ρ 0 0 the diameter of all piezometers used to sample the water for measuring cl concentration was approximately 2 cm and the change of the concentration measured from them was highly irregular several piezometers did not show any significant change in cl concentration we therefore only compared the results for locations where the piezometers showed significant changes in cl concentration during the experiment the comparison is shown in fig 5 a in which for easy to read we only plot the simulated breakthrough curves for the locations of piezometers 3 and 5 shown in fig 3 with the simulated breakthrough curves for other piezometers between the best fitting parameters for the two curves are ρ 0 0 ux 0 6 m h dx 16 5 m1 45 h and dy 0 664 m2 h the forward skewed fractional fade associated with ρ 1 0 had been used by some researchers to describe the anomalous dispersion benson 2001 but it is not accurate enough to describe the persistent trails in the breakthrough curves measured from the experiment the best we could achieve using the forward skewed fade is shown in fig 5b the best fitting parameters in which are ρ 1 0 ux 1 5 m h dx 15 3 m1 6 h and dy 0 51 m2 h comparing fig 5a and 5b reveals that the forward skewed fade overestimates the early arrival while it underestimates the prolonged tails the likely reason is that there are no well connected big fractures at the experiment site to quickly move the tracer downstream as implied in the forward skewed fade and using ρ 1 is hence unable to capture the slow movement or even stagnation of solute within the soil matrix in contrast the backward skewed fade reproduces the breakthrough curves reasonably well including the early breakthrough and the delayed arrival the backward skewed fade improves the fitting but except for piezometer 2 it still slightly underestimates the persistent tails in the breakthrough curves measured from other three piezometers indicating that a significant portion of the solute in the matrix might be stagnant a recent study on tracer movement in single well and push pull tests also found that using the spatial fade alone is insufficient to reproduce the heavy tails in the measured breakthrough curves due to the stagnation of solute in impermeable zones and that combining the spatial fade with the fractal mobile immobile model can improve the matching chen et al 2017 as the overarching purpose of this paper is to introduce the lb model for solving the spatial fade with exemplary application we did not explore further on how to improve the fitting as an illustration to mimic how the tracer migrated over the slope during the experiment fig 6 shows three snapshots simulated when the cl moved through the soils it is worth pointing out that other approaches such as the multi region model and the ctrw model dentz and berkowitz 2003 li et al 2018 might also be able to reproduce the measured breakthrough curves since the purpose of this paper is to present the lb model for the 2d fade and to show that it can correctly simulate anomalous dispersion in soils and aquifers we did not compare different models 4 conclusions the fractional advection dispersion equation fade can capture some key features in the breakthrough curves measured from tracer movement in both surface and subsurface water and has been widely used to simulate solute transport in soils and aquifers unlike the classical advection dispersion equation the fade is difficult to solve numerically because its spatial discretization leads to a full coefficient matrix which is expensive to solve especially in multi dimensions tremendous efforts have been expended over the past decade to improve the efficiency of numerical solution of the fade and in this paper we propose a lb model for 2d fade where water flow is one dimensional and the dispersion is two dimensional since the spreading of solute in porous media is caused by variation of water velocity across the pore space the order of the factional derivative along with the dispersion coefficient should be anisotropic to reflect that if solute movement can be viewed as a series of jumps bijeljic and blunt 2006 the probability distribution of these jumps in the direction parallel with mean water flow should differ from that in the direction normal to the mean water flow the proposed model is based on the two time relaxation lb approach by dividing each particle distribution function and its associated equilibrium distribution function into a symmetric part and an asymmetric part with each part relaxed differently in calculating the collision the anisotropy in the dispersion coefficient and the order of the fractional derivative are recovered by varying the relaxation parameter with direction we derive the relationship between the particle distribution functions and the mass flux and discuss how to solve different types of boundaries the model is verified against the analytical solution of a benchmark problem and is then applied to simulate cl movement in a tracer experiment conducted on a hillslope with a fractured b horizon compared with other numerical methods such as the finite difference method and the finite element method the proposed model has advantages that it is explicit fully mass conservative and second order accurate in both time and space in addition its stability is independent of dispersion coefficient which differs from other numerical methods existing in the literature however like the lb model for fluid flow and other transport problems the proposed model is explicit and numerically stable only when the mach number is relatively small as shown in the appendix acknowledgements we thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript the research of fw xjs and

7066,high level of arsenic containing groundwater has been used for irrigation purposes for several decades in asia leading to fluctuating water table and redox conditions in the unsaturated zone thereby potentially affecting the mobilization of arsenic in the unsaturated and saturated zones a field plot experiment was conducted in the arsenic affected area of the datong basin china to determine the effects of irrigation return flow on the hydrogeochemical behavior of arsenic and iron in the unsaturated zone high arsenic groundwater was extracted from a shallow aquifer far from the irrigation site and used as irrigation water soil water shallow groundwater and soil sediment samples were collected at different depths from the field site during the experiment water samples were analyzed to determine hydrochemical properties and arsenic concentrations and soil sediment samples were analyzed to determine total iron and arsenic infiltration of irrigation water into the unsaturated zone led to fluctuations in the water table varying redox conditions and the redistribution of arsenic and iron in the near surface soil sediment soil sediment bulk geochemical analysis results indicate obvious increases of arsenic and iron in topsoil after irrigation infiltration of irrigation water carrying organic matter sulfate and nitrate into the subsurface affects the bio geochemistry of the unsaturated and saturated zones and ultimately the behavior of arsenic and iron geochemical modeling results suggest desorption and leaching processes are responsible for the temporal changes of arsenic concentrations in both pore water groundwater and sediment during irrigation the results of this study indicate that flood irrigation using arsenic contaminated groundwater should be controlled and gradually replaced by drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation or irrigation using non contaminated water resources to mitigate arsenic accumulation in the unsaturated zone and

behavior of as gillispie et al 2015 infiltration of irrigation water with sufficient air oxygen leads to a variety of complex redox conditions that play an important role in the subsurface farnsworth et al 2012 the behavior of as is closely related to that of fe minerals bose and sharma 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 desorption of as from fe hydro oxides and reductive dissolution of as sorbed fe hydro oxides phases in the sediments under reducing conditions were found to be the dominant processes of as im mobilization in the aquifer wang et al 2017 therefore the mobilization and immobilization of as is more synchronized with the precipitation and dissolution of fe minerals xie et al 2015 which can be important with respect to the geochemical behavior of as in the unsaturated zone during irrigation moreover irrigation induced phreatic water table fluctuation is likely to influence the redox conditions of the subsurface farnsworth et al 2012 tong et al 2016 and as such affect the fate of as and fe in the unsaturated zone thus better understanding of the characteristics and mechanism of as im mobilization during irrigation and consequent water table fluctuation in the unsaturated zone is urgently needed studies on the geogenic high as groundwater system of the datong basin have been carried out to understand the mechanism of as transportation in groundwater saturated zone xie et al 2011 2012a and remediation of as contaminated groundwater pi et al 2016 xie et al 2016a b highlighting the high risk of as in food and drinking water wang et al 2017 pointing out the spatial distribution and seasonal change of as levels in groundwater could be related to the anthropogenic activities such as extracting shallow groundwater for periodic irrigation practices and domestic purposes xie et al 2015 characterizing the temporal changes in as concentration under irrigation activities is important for understanding the geochemical processes controlling as mobilization in the unsaturated zone however the effect of high as groundwater irrigation on geochemical behavior of as in the unsaturated zone is not well understood and studied till now in the present study therefore a field plot experiment was conducted to explore the characteristics and mechanism of as mobilization in the unsaturated zone at the dy site of the datong basin by monitoring multi level wells for temporal variation in hydrochemical parameters to accurately simulate datong basin irrigation high as groundwater was extracted from a semi confined aquifer residing from about 20 to 24 m below the land surface and used to irrigate the experimental plot geochemical processes that occurred during irrigation were interpreted using geochemical inverse modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the datong basin a typical cenozoic sedimentary basin and arid semi arid region located in the region of the east asian monsoons in shanxi province northern china receives 300 400 mm of mean annual rainfall but has a mean evaporation more than 2000 mm per year with the mean annual temperatures of 7 c wang et al 2009 due to the strong evaporation conditions saline soils are widely distributed in this area xie et al 2013a b c shallow groundwater mainly occurs in the quaternary alluvial pluvial lacustrine and alluvial lacustrine aquifers wang et al 2009 intensive extraction of groundwater for agricultural activities over many decades has resulted in irrigation return flow and salt flushing water becoming an important source of recharge for shallow aquifers in the datong basin xie et al 2012b dy site is located in the central of the datong basin fig 1 a and b including the characteristics of sluggish groundwater flow from sw toward the ne with gentle hydraulic gradient strong evaporation conditions and high as groundwater aquifers pi et al 2016b xie et al 2016b the experiment was carried out on the barren land of 30 50 m2 in the middle of the dy site fig 1c the soils sediments in the experiment plot from the ground to the depth 3 0 m underground are tawny silt with clay from 0 to nearly 1 7 m underground and fine sand with grey silt from nearly 1 7 3 0 m underground 2 2 field measurements and sampling the field experiment was conducted in three stages pre irrigation before august 10 irrigation from august 11 to 18 and post irrigation from august 19 to 24 2016 during the experiment period the weather was sunny or cloudy without rain nine multi level soil water extractions made by the porous ceramic tube and pvc pipe with depths of 0 5 2 0 m were installed at the field site to collect soil water groundwater samples fig 1d before conducting the experiment wellbores were drilled to designed depth by the hand drills then soil water extractions porous ceramic tube and pvc pipe were buried respectively soil sediment samples were excavated close to the 9 well at intervals of 0 2 m from depths ranging from 0 to 2 0 m on august 10 pre irrigation and august 24 post irrigation soil sediment samples were capped immediately with pvc pipe and wax sealed to minimize exposure to the atmosphere soil water groundwater samples from the monitoring wells were collected before irrigation august 10 preirri during irrigation august 13 irri1 august 16 irri2 as well as post irrigation august 20 postirri1 august 23 postirri2 at the experiment plot a semi confined aquifer residing from about 20 24 m below the land surface was selected as the sources aquifer for the flood irrigation with the flow rate of 0 23 l s fig 1d in addition the experiment plot is out of the influenced radius of the pumping well during the field experiment the phreatic water level was measured periodically using a levelogger model 3001 solinst

alkalinity was immediately measured after sampling in the field laboratory all soil water groundwater samples were collected in pre cleansed 50 ml hdpe bottles after filtration 0 45 μm samples for major cation and trace metal concentrations were acidified with ultra pure hno3 to ph 2 immediately after collection and filtration samples for anions were not acidified samples for δ18o and δ2h analysis were collected immediately without any treatment samples for as analysis were collected with acidification to ph 2 using ultra pure hcl after filtration 2 3 laboratory analysis major cations including k na ca2 and mg2 in acidified soil water groundwater samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp while trace metal compositions were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms pe elan drc e anion concentrations including cl no3 and so4 2 in un acidified soil water groundwater samples were

stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer iwa 35ep concentration deviations obtained for sample replicates fell within 5 precision for δ2h and δ18o analyses was 1 0 and 0 1 respectively the contents of as and fe in the sediments were characterized by the parallel chemical extractions mai et al 2014 the extraction process included four parts table 1 as follows step1 0 5 m sodium bicarbonate nahco3 at ph 8 5 was used to extract adsorbed ions hiemstra et al 2010 step 2 easily dissolvable carbonates and phosphates in the sediment were extracted by formic acid at ph 3 step 3 ascorbic acid at ph 3 was used to extract ferrihydrite and poorly crystalline goethite α feooh larsen and postma 2001 step 4 crystalline iron oxides were dissolved by the combined oxalate ascorbate extractant wenzel et al 2001 total as in the sediment samples was determined by dissolving in aqua regia and then icp ms analysis while total fe was determined following digestion in a muffle furnace at 450 c for 8 h dissolution in hcl at 100 c for 6 h poulton and canfield 2005 and then finally icp aes analysis sample replicates were chosen at random concentration deviations obtained for sample replicates fell within 5 2 4 geochemical modeling to better understand the mobilization and transportation of as within the unsaturated zone during the irrigation periods geochemical inverse modeling was conducted using the code phreeqc interactive 3 3 8 with the wateq4f database charlton and parkhurst 2011 the reactive minerals in the model were selected according to the results of x ray diffraction xrd and parallel chemical extraction results the soil water groundwater chemical compositions of hco3 so4 2 cl ca2 na and fe concentrations as well as ph and orp were used in the modeling the uncertainty limits are conditioned to satisfy the balance of the simulation including the mole balance the charge balance for the element and valance state selected and the solution chosen within the model in phreeqc the uncertainty limit is chosen for 0 025 for all the models and the cl concentration was adjusted to ensure the charge balance the potential mineral phases in the modeling were defined as precipitation or dissolution using a conceptual model of general trends according to the hydrochemical data and the saturation indices calculated by phreeqc 3 results 3 1 water table fluctuation before the field experiment the phreatic water level was 1 725 m below the ground august 10 during irrigation the measured phreatic levels were 1 678 m august 11 1 156 m august 13 1 123 m august 16 and 1 102 m august 18 below the ground respectively after irrigation the monitored of the phreatic level were 1 515 m august 20 1 588 m august 23 and 1 612 m august 24 below the ground 3 2 general hydrochemistry of the soil water groundwater in this study water samples from the nine monitoring wells during the whole experiment period were collected for the physical and hydrochemical parameters measurements at site in addition samples from 9 7 and 4 wells were collected and measured for the major ions as and isotope components due to the intensive evaporation the soil moisture content in pre irrigation period was not high enough to extract soil water through negative pressure method thus the soil water samples of pre irrigation period were just collected at 2 0 m depth for major ions and as analysis the irrigation water was extracted for the hydrochemical analyses and the concentrations of as and fe in the irrigation water were 409 μg l and 0 145 mg l respectively according to the burial depth of the shallow groundwater five shallow groundwater samples were collected at the depth of 2 0 m during the experiment preirri irri1 irri2 postirri1 postirri2 from each well 9 7 and 4 in addition two groundwater samples were collected at depth of 1 5 m irri1 irri2 from each well 9 7 and 4 during irrigation due to the rising up of water table the primary anion was hco3 in the irrigation water but cl and so4 2 were the dominated anions in the monitoring water samples during irrigation fig 2 a with ongoing irrigation average values of cl so4 2 cl so4 2 hco3 of soil water samples decreased from 0 80 irri to 0 70 postirri but that of groundwater samples decreased from 0 74 irri to 0 65 postirri respectively the significant evaporation has aggravated the salinization of the subsurface soil and resulted in high concentrations of salt accumulated in both soil water and shallow groundwater during irrigation the infiltration of irrigation water brought a certain amount of hco3 into the soil water and shallow groundwater making the concentrations of hco3 increased at first and then decreased after the irrigation in the initial period of irrigation infiltration of irrigation water dissolved salt in the unsaturated zone but with the increasing amount of irrigation water the salinity of the water samples was diluted the ec values of the soil water samples gradually decreased from 14 7 ms cm 0 5 m 6 97 ms cm 1 0 m 6 15 ms cm 1 5 m and 5 21 ms cm 2 0 m on average along the soil profile from the surface to depth of 2 0 m fig 2a eh values of the soil water samples ranged from 4 3 to 238 mv over the course of the field experiment values in the unsaturated zone obviously decreased during irrigation to post irrigation but gradually increased thereafter fig 2b during the initial period of irrigation monitored eh values indicate an oxidizing condition and then gradually became reducing due to the infiltration of irrigation water and the rising up of water table the values continued to decrease from irrigation to post irrigation period which could be related to the input of chemicals such as organic carbon and so4 2 that enhance biogeochemical processes exhaust oxygen and promote the prevailing reducing conditions however after the irrigation period air and oxygen was again introduced into the unsaturated zone resulting in gradually increasing in eh values as concentrations in the monitoring water samples from the three monitoring wells varied from 1 15 to 124 μg l with 29 4 of samples having as concentrations exceeding 10 μg l however all water samples with high as concentrations were collected from the depth of 2 0 m fig 2c during the experiment the δ18o values of water samples ranged from 12 1 to 9 98 and the vertical infiltration of irrigation carrying large amount of salt from land surface results in acutely increases in cl concentration with little variation in δ18o values fig 3 a it s worth to note that two trends can be detected clearly in the plot of δ18o vs as concentration fig 3b all high as groundwater samples fall close to the low evaporation but high leaching line with all low as soil water samples falling close to the evaporation line indicating that fast vertical recharge promotes mobilization of as in the unsaturated zone 3 3 soil sediment analysis geochemical analysis of sediments was conducted to determine the potential effects of as and fe minerals on as mobilization the geochemical analysis results of soils collected before and after irrigation indicates most of the total as co exists with crystalline iron oxides extraction step 4 in the soils fig 4 e as associated with the exchangeable phase extraction step 1 and co precipitated with carbonates and phosphates extraction step 2 only occurred in minor amounts fig 4c and d and nearly no as was associated with ferrihydrite and poorly crystalline goethite extraction step 3 total as contents in pre irrigation and post irrigation sediment samples ranged from 6 52 to 8 19 mg kg and 6 44 to 8 37 mg kg respectively with the fe content ranging from 16 6 to 26 9 g kg pre irrigation and 18 3 to 23 8 mg kg post irrigation respectively the results for as and fe content in surface soil samples from 0 to 0 4 m are particularly notable with the obvious change from pre irrigation to post irrigation fig 4a and b as is predominantly associated with crystalline iron oxides extraction step 4 fig 4g in both pre irrigation and post irrigation samples but as associated with carbonates and phosphates extraction step 2 fig 4f desorbable fe extraction step 1 and poorly crystalline goethite extraction step 3 are also present in minor amounts 3 4 geochemical inverse modeling geochemical inverse modeling was performed to further interpret the geochemical behavior of as and fe in the unsaturated zone during irrigation the chemical extraction results indicate the amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides and crystallized fe oxyhydr oxide are closely related to the fate of as during irrigation thus goethite and fe oh 3 a were selected for the inverse model because of the high salinity of topsoil and high concentrations of na ca2 hco3 so4 2 and cl detected in soil water samples calcite gypsum and halite were also included as potential mineral phases in the model carbonate dissolution would increase the concentration of hco3 which in turn produces dissolved co2 input of organic matter during the infiltration would produce dissolved co2 which in turn would increase hco3 therefore co2 g was included in the model cation exchange reactions were also considered in the model the solubility product and saturation indices of the potential mineral phases selected in the model are given in table 2 the cl values were calculated to ensure that the data was adequate to proceed with the geochemical modeling to constrain the inverse model minerals and gases were set to precipitate or dissolve to achieve equilibrium the results of the most optimum inverse model for the phase mole transfers of minerals and gases are shown in table 3 modeling results indicate that calcite co2 g fe oh 3 a nax and mgx2 are generally precipitating in the subsurface while goethite and cax2 are dissolving the fe minerals content of samples from 0 5 m change considerably during irrigation irri1 to irri2 and post irrigation postirri1 to postirri2 while that of soil water samples from 1 0 m obviously evolve from postirri1 to postirri2 however samples from 1 5 m undergo moderate changes without fe minerals changes throughout these three respective periods and fe minerals content of samples from 2 0 m depth undergo a moderate change from irri1 to irr2 but considerably changes in the three other periods preirri to irri1 irri2 to postirri1 and postirri1 to postirri2 precipitation and transformation of fe oxides hydroxides occur repeatedly in the model which is essential for the oxidation of fe oxides hydroxides and the immobilization of aquatic as however the immobilization of as distinctly appears during the irrigation period resulting in low concentrations of aquatic as detected at depths of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m fig 2c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of irrigation on redox conditions under oxidizing conditions high eh the fe iii forms solid phase fe iii oxyhydr oxides accordingly as is immobilized by fe iii oxyhydr oxides as as v species fig 5 clearly shows that as v and fe iii are the dominant as and fe species in soil water groundwater samples and only a few samples collected post irrigation indicate the dominant as form is as iii after irrigation samples from depths below the water table are in a stable reducing environment at the beginning of the irrigation irri1 water samples had lower ph and higher eh with ongoing irrigation the ph increased and the eh decreased measured ph values of most samples ranged from 7 5 to 8 5 under such conditions negatively charged as v is immobilized by sorption onto the positively charged surfaces of feooh resulting in decreased aquatic as concentrations sharma et al 2014 xie et al 2016b according to the non linear adsorption isotherm behavior of as v decreasing ph is beneficial for the adsorption of as v onto the surface of fe minerals smedley and kinniburgh 2002 however eh values ranging from 0 24 to 0 13 v indicate the redox environment of the unsaturated zone changes from oxidizing to reducing with ongoing irrigation as such the dominant species of as could change from as v to as iii and fe mineral phase transformations could occur due to the weak association between as iii and fe bearing minerals dixit and hering 2003 the change from as v to as iii from irrigation to postirri1 led to the vertical infiltration of as and increasing aquatic as concentrations at depths around 1 7 m the irrigation water reaches shallow groundwater and the vertical movement of infiltration water is significantly retarded as a result as carried by the intense vertical infiltration from the unsaturated zone accumulates in shallow groundwater at this depth 4 2 variations of as and fe minerals during irrigation during the irrigation experiment as accumulation in the sediments is different than in the soil water and groundwater results of parallel chemical extractions show a small amount of as combined with poorly crystalline fe oxides which occur in minor amounts in the sediment in the datong basin the high as groundwater generally contains some amount of fe wang et al 2014 therefore during irrigation the extracted irrigation groundwater reducing mixes with water in the medium oxidizing triggering the precipitation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides that incorporate some amount of as this process is very similar to the interaction between groundwater and surface water postma et al 2010 as a result the input of dissolved oxygen increases the formation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides and decreases the mobility of as pi et al 2015 an increase in the as and fe content of soil sediment after irrigation indicates that irrigation using high as groundwater leads to some degree of as accumulation in surface soil adsorption of as onto amorphous fe iii minerals is considered as a key process controlling the distribution of as in an oxidizing environment dixit and hering 2003 zhao et al 2011 qi and pichler 2016 during irrigation the irrigation water introduces fe ii into the unsaturated zone and fe ii is quickly oxidized to form amorphous fe iii minerals under such situation aquatic as was adsorbed by amorphous fe iii minerals within the unsaturated zone when irrigation ended the unsaturated zone is in constant contact with air and oxygen and therefore amorphous fe iii minerals would transform into more stable fe iii oxyhydr oxides cudennec and lecerf 2006 hence during the whole experiment period as in soil sediment mainly combined with crystalline and amorphous fe oxides via co precipitation and sorption in the unsaturated zone as corroborated by the results of chemical extraction fig 4 chemical extraction results and the good correlation between total as and fe fig 6 a in soil sediments both indicate that as is closely associated with fe minerals before irrigation the results of the chemical extraction fig 6b further indicate as co existing with the crystalline fe oxides is the major process of sequestration of as in soil sediments before irrigation however a poor correlation between as and fe observed after irrigation fig 6a suggests a subsequent disassociation between as and fe fate fig 5 clearly shows that the variation in eh during irrigation leads to the conversion of as species from as v to as iii which can cause the release of as from solid phases to the aqueous phase in addition during irrigation the decrease of eh can also cause the changes of fe minerals phases from crystalline fe iii hydr oxides to amorphous fe iii minerals the chemical extraction results indicate the transformation of fe iii minerals occurs despite the eh not reaching the critical value for fe iii hydr oxide reduction in addition the poor correlation between as and crystalline fe forms after irrigation fig 6b further illustrates the disassociation between as and fe that occurs during irrigation the modeling results also agree well with the observation that as separated from fe iii hydr oxides during irrigation table 3 the precipitation of amorphous fe iii minerals and the dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides from irri1 to irri2 at a depth of 0 5 m reflects the change of redox condition from the oxidizing conditions at the beginning of irrigation to the reducing conditions gradually with the irrigation ongoing during irrigation irri1 to irri2 the dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides at a depth of 0 5 m weakens the association with as and fast vertical infiltration transports as from the unsaturated to saturated zone resulting in the enrichment of aqueous as in the saturated zone in contrast the geochemical inverse modeling results indicate that the gradual increase of oxidation after irrigation postirri1 to postirri2 at a depth of 2 0 m resulting in the less amount precipitation of amorphous fe iii minerals from the period three irri2 to postirri1 to the period four postirri1 to postirri2 which is consistent with the observed eh values in the soil water fig 2b although fe mineral phases changed during irrigation the poor correlation between as and fe after irrigation fig 6 further confirms the disassociation between as and fe occurred as discussed above 4 3 mechanism of as mobilization in the unsaturated zone during irrigation the irrigation process can be generalized as shown in fig 7 according to a comprehensive analysis that incorporates the hydrogeochemical parameter data and geochemical inverse modeling results before irrigation the unsaturated zone is in full contact with air oxidizing conditions and the phreatic water table is located 1 7 m below the ground surface the correlation between as and fe in soil sediments shows as co exists with crystalline fe iii hydr oxides and the anoxic conditions prevalent in the saturated zone have a minor effect on as immobilization as in the irrigation water is directed adsorbed by fe iii oxyhydr oxides due to the oxidation of fe ii present in the irrigation water in the initial stages of irrigation the oxidation of the small amounts of fe ii in the irrigation water to fe iii oxyhydr oxide results in the adsorption saturation being reached quickly and fast vertical infiltration to the saturated zone as and fe contents in the topsoil noticeably increase but the aqueous as concentration does not conspicuously change with pores gradually occupied by irrigation water concurrent with a rise in the water table redox conditions in the unsaturated zone change from oxidizing to moderately reducing as such the dominant as species changes from as v to as iii and the weaker association between as iii and fe iii minerals causes the release of as from solid phases to the aqueous phase in addition the change of fe mineral phases from crystalline fe iii hydr oxides to amorphous fe iii minerals also decreased the amount of as co existing with fe iii minerals unlike the limited irrigation has lower possibility of groundwater contamination reedy et al 2007 strong vertical infiltration from the unsaturated to saturated zone and the retarded vertical movement in the saturated zone ultimately result in a sudden increase in aqueous as concentration in the saturated zone from irri1 to irri2 with irrigation water infiltration other materials and organic matter are carried from the surface to the subsurface harvey et al 2002 dissolved organic matter can enhance redox reactions bhattacharya et al 2006 nath et al 2008a b resulting in the reduction of iron oxyhydr oxides that in turn releases dissolved as farooq et al 2010 when irrigation stopped the residual irrigation water on the land surface is in full contact with the air therefore the infiltration of the residual oxidizing water decreases results in the gradual increasing of eh values detected from the soil water fig 2b the stronger oxidizing conditions strengthen the absorption of as onto fe iii minerals as reflected in gradually decreasing concentrations of aqueous as the migration of as during irrigation is clearly influenced by redox conditions fe iii mineral phase changes and the input of organic matter with the irrigated water infiltrating from the land surface to the unsaturated and saturated zone resulting in the change of shallow groundwater table moreover the mobilization and transformation of as is more intensive in topsoil due to the frequent oxic anoxic alternation mladenov et al 2010 long term use of as contaminated groundwater for irrigation can increase as accumulation in agriculture soils and the food chain this study shows that irrigation induced water table fluctuations can lead to the accumulation of as in topsoil and shallow groundwater excessive exploitation of groundwater might result in sharp water table fluctuations and acute changes in redox conditions in the unsaturated zone consequently flood irrigation using as contaminated groundwater should be gradually replaced by drip irrigation or irrigation using a non contaminated water resource to reduce concerns with respect to as accumulation in the food chain and support stable agricultural management 5 conclusions irrigation practice obviously affects the concentrations of major ions as well as trace metals in soil water and shallow groundwater specifically irrigation water has a significant impact on the mobilization and migration of as in the unsaturated zone here infiltration of as contaminated irrigation water alters redox conditions in the unsaturated zone introduces as and fe into the unsaturated zone and affects the water table both rising and dropping resulting in the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii minerals that absorb as and ultimately result in increasing as and fe content in the topsoil with increased input of organic matter fe iii oxides hydroxides undergo reductive dissolution during irrigation fe iii oxides hydroxides might be the main sink for as before irrigation but the extraction analysis confirms that as also disassociates with other fe minerals after irrigation moreover geochemical modeling and sample analysis suggest that several geochemical evolutions that reflect absorption leaching and cation exchange processes occurred during the field experiment this work suggests that flood irrigation using as contaminated groundwater should be gradually replaced by drip irrigation or irrigation

7066,high level of arsenic containing groundwater has been used for irrigation purposes for several decades in asia leading to fluctuating water table and redox conditions in the unsaturated zone thereby potentially affecting the mobilization of arsenic in the unsaturated and saturated zones a field plot experiment was conducted in the arsenic affected area of the datong basin china to determine the effects of irrigation return flow on the hydrogeochemical behavior of arsenic and iron in the unsaturated zone high arsenic groundwater was extracted from a shallow aquifer far from the irrigation site and used as irrigation water soil water shallow groundwater and soil sediment samples were collected at different depths from the field site during the experiment water samples were analyzed to determine hydrochemical properties and arsenic concentrations and soil sediment samples were analyzed to determine total iron and arsenic infiltration of irrigation water into the unsaturated zone led to fluctuations in the water table varying redox conditions and the redistribution of arsenic and iron in the near surface soil sediment soil sediment bulk geochemical analysis results indicate obvious increases of arsenic and iron in topsoil after irrigation infiltration of irrigation water carrying organic matter sulfate and nitrate into the subsurface affects the bio geochemistry of the unsaturated and saturated zones and ultimately the behavior of arsenic and iron geochemical modeling results suggest desorption and leaching processes are responsible for the temporal changes of arsenic concentrations in both pore water groundwater and sediment during irrigation the results of this study indicate that flood irrigation using arsenic contaminated groundwater should be controlled and gradually replaced by drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation or irrigation using non contaminated water resources to mitigate arsenic accumulation in the unsaturated zone and shallow groundwater keywords arsenic flood irrigation redox conditions iron oxyhydr oxides field plot experiment 1 introduction arsenic as contamination of water and soil has been recognized as a grand challenge for humans mandal and suzuki 2002 roberts et al 2007 hossain et al 2008 rahman and hasegawa 2011 the recommended limit for as in drinking water is 10 μg l who 1996 people who use geogenic high as 10 μg l groundwater for their basic living requirements are at high risk for chronic as poisoning and lethal cancers brammer and ravenscroft 2009 fendorf et al 2010 this is especially true in east south and southeast asia for example many residents of inland areas in northern china including the datong basin are adversely affected by as exposure through drinking groundwater wang et al 2009 guo et al 2014 considerable attention has been paid to the safety of the food chain with respect to the accumulation of as in topsoil due to anthropogenic activity williams et al 2007 precipitation flood and drainage cycles significantly affect as dynamics in agricultural soils and plants takahashi et al 2004 honma et al 2016 ruíz huerta et al 2017 flood and other water management strategies make topsoil as more active and increase its bioavailability arao et al 2009 liao et al 2016 in particular high as groundwater utilized for irrigation practices has the potential to increase as accumulation in topsoil harvey et al 2006 heikens 2006 saha and ali 2007 brammer 2009 recent research has explored the as soil plant system in rice fields in the ganges brahmaputra delta of bangladesh and the mekong delta of cambodia where the enrichment of as in topsoil under irrigation with as contaminated groundwater has occurred polizzotto et al 2008 2013 roberts et al 2011 the accumulated as in topsoil sediments can be released into shallow groundwater via hydrological and biogeochemical reactions kocar et al 2008 studies conducted in some well known as affected areas show the significance of determining the mechanism of as mobilization in the unsaturated zone neumann et al 2014 rahman 2015 where both natural processes and anthropogenic factors determine the geochemical behavior of as gillispie et al 2015 infiltration of irrigation water with sufficient air oxygen leads to a variety of complex redox conditions that play an important role in the subsurface farnsworth et al 2012 the behavior of as is closely related to that of fe minerals bose and sharma 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 desorption of as from fe hydro oxides and reductive dissolution of as sorbed fe hydro oxides phases in the sediments under reducing conditions were found to be the dominant processes of as im mobilization in the aquifer wang et al 2017 therefore the mobilization and immobilization of as is more synchronized with the precipitation and dissolution of fe minerals xie et al 2015 which can be important with respect to the geochemical behavior of as in the unsaturated zone during irrigation moreover irrigation induced phreatic water table fluctuation is likely to influence the redox conditions of the subsurface farnsworth et al 2012 tong et al 2016 and as such affect the fate of as and fe in the unsaturated zone thus better understanding of the characteristics and mechanism of as im mobilization during irrigation and consequent water table fluctuation in the unsaturated zone is urgently needed studies on the geogenic high as groundwater system of the datong basin have been carried out to understand the mechanism of as transportation in groundwater saturated zone xie et al 2011 2012a and remediation of as contaminated groundwater pi et al 2016 xie et al 2016a b highlighting the high risk of as in food and drinking water wang et al 2017 pointing out the spatial distribution and seasonal change of as levels in groundwater could be related to the anthropogenic activities such as extracting shallow groundwater for periodic irrigation practices and domestic purposes xie et al 2015 characterizing the temporal changes in as concentration under irrigation activities is important for understanding the geochemical processes controlling as mobilization in the unsaturated zone however the effect of high as groundwater irrigation on geochemical behavior of as in the unsaturated zone is not well understood and studied till now in the present study therefore a field plot experiment was conducted to explore the characteristics and mechanism of as mobilization in the unsaturated zone at the dy site of the datong basin by monitoring multi level wells for temporal variation in hydrochemical parameters to accurately simulate datong basin irrigation high as groundwater was extracted from a semi confined aquifer residing from about 20 to 24 m below the land surface and used to irrigate the experimental plot geochemical processes that occurred during irrigation were interpreted using geochemical inverse modeling 2 materials and

0 5 2 0 m were installed at the field site to collect soil water groundwater samples fig 1d before conducting the experiment wellbores were drilled to designed depth by the hand drills then soil water extractions porous ceramic tube and pvc pipe were buried respectively soil sediment samples were excavated close to the 9 well at intervals of 0 2 m from depths ranging from 0 to 2 0 m on august 10 pre irrigation and august 24 post irrigation soil sediment samples were capped immediately with pvc pipe and wax sealed to minimize exposure to the atmosphere soil water groundwater samples from the monitoring wells were collected before irrigation august 10 preirri during irrigation august 13 irri1 august 16 irri2 as well as post irrigation august 20 postirri1 august 23 postirri2 at the experiment plot a semi confined aquifer residing from about 20 24 m below the land surface was selected as the sources aquifer for the flood irrigation with the flow rate of 0 23 l s fig 1d in addition the experiment plot is out of the influenced radius of the pumping well during the field experiment the phreatic water level was measured periodically using a levelogger model 3001 solinst canada hydrochemical parameters including temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec and redox potential eh were measured on site using a hach portable meter hq 40 d calibrated before using the

including k na ca2 and mg2 in acidified soil water groundwater samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp while trace metal compositions were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms pe elan drc e anion concentrations including cl no3 and so4 2 in un acidified soil water groundwater samples were

stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer iwa 35ep concentration deviations obtained for sample replicates fell within 5 precision for δ2h and δ18o analyses was 1 0 and 0 1 respectively the contents of as and fe in the sediments were characterized by the parallel chemical extractions mai et al 2014 the extraction process included four parts table 1 as follows step1 0 5 m sodium bicarbonate nahco3 at ph 8 5 was used to extract adsorbed ions hiemstra et al 2010 step 2 easily dissolvable carbonates and phosphates in the sediment were extracted by formic acid at ph 3 step 3 ascorbic acid at ph 3 was used to extract ferrihydrite and poorly crystalline goethite α feooh larsen and postma 2001 step 4 crystalline iron oxides were dissolved by the combined oxalate ascorbate extractant wenzel et al 2001 total as in the sediment samples was determined by dissolving in aqua regia and then icp ms analysis while total fe was determined following digestion in a muffle furnace at 450 c for 8 h dissolution in hcl at 100 c for 6 h poulton and canfield 2005 and then finally icp aes analysis sample replicates were chosen at random concentration deviations obtained for sample replicates fell within 5 2 4 geochemical modeling to better understand the mobilization and transportation of as within the unsaturated zone during the irrigation periods geochemical inverse modeling was conducted using the code phreeqc interactive 3 3 8 with the wateq4f database charlton and parkhurst 2011 the reactive minerals in the model were selected according to the results of x ray diffraction xrd and parallel chemical extraction results the soil water groundwater chemical compositions of hco3 so4 2 cl ca2 na and fe concentrations as well as ph and orp were used in the modeling the uncertainty limits are conditioned to satisfy the balance of the simulation including the mole balance the charge balance for the element and valance state selected and the solution chosen within the model in phreeqc the uncertainty limit is chosen for 0 025 for all the models and the cl concentration was adjusted to ensure the charge balance the potential mineral phases in the modeling were defined as precipitation or dissolution using a conceptual model of general trends according to the hydrochemical data and the saturation indices calculated by phreeqc 3 results 3 1 water table fluctuation before the field experiment the phreatic water level was 1 725 m below the ground august 10 during irrigation the measured phreatic levels were 1 678 m august 11 1 156 m august 13 1 123 m august 16 and 1 102 m august 18 below the ground respectively after irrigation the monitored of the phreatic level were 1 515 m august 20 1 588 m august 23 and 1 612 m august 24 below the ground 3 2 general hydrochemistry of the soil water groundwater in this study water samples from the nine monitoring wells during the whole experiment period were collected for the physical and hydrochemical parameters measurements at site in addition samples from 9 7 and 4 wells were collected and measured for the major ions as and isotope components due to the intensive evaporation the soil moisture content in pre irrigation period was not high enough to extract soil water through negative pressure method thus the soil water samples of pre irrigation period were just collected at 2 0 m depth for major ions and as analysis the irrigation water was extracted for the hydrochemical analyses and the concentrations of as and fe in the irrigation water were 409 μg l and 0 145 mg l respectively according to the burial depth of the shallow groundwater five shallow groundwater samples were collected at the depth of 2 0 m during the experiment preirri irri1 irri2 postirri1 postirri2 from each well 9 7 and 4 in addition two groundwater samples were collected at depth of 1 5 m irri1 irri2 from each well 9 7 and 4 during irrigation due to the rising up of water table the primary anion was hco3 in the irrigation water but cl and so4 2 were the dominated anions in the monitoring water samples during irrigation fig 2 a with ongoing irrigation average values of cl so4 2 cl so4 2 hco3 of soil water samples decreased from 0 80 irri to 0 70 postirri but that of groundwater samples decreased from 0 74 irri to 0 65 postirri respectively the significant evaporation has aggravated the salinization of the subsurface soil and resulted in high concentrations of salt accumulated in both soil water and shallow groundwater during irrigation the infiltration of irrigation water brought a certain amount of hco3 into the soil water and shallow groundwater making the concentrations of hco3 increased at first and then decreased after the irrigation in the initial period of irrigation infiltration of irrigation water dissolved salt in the unsaturated zone but with the increasing amount of irrigation water the salinity of the water samples was diluted the ec values of the soil water samples gradually decreased from 14 7 ms cm 0 5 m 6 97 ms cm 1 0 m 6 15 ms cm 1 5 m and 5 21 ms cm 2 0 m on average along the soil profile from the surface to depth of 2 0 m fig 2a eh values of the soil water samples ranged from 4 3 to 238 mv over the course of the field experiment values in the unsaturated zone obviously decreased during irrigation to post irrigation but gradually increased thereafter fig 2b during the initial period of irrigation monitored eh values indicate an oxidizing condition and then gradually became reducing due to the infiltration of irrigation water and the rising up of water table the values continued to decrease from irrigation to post irrigation period which could be related to the input of chemicals such as organic carbon and so4 2 that enhance biogeochemical processes exhaust oxygen and promote the prevailing reducing conditions however after the irrigation period air and oxygen was again introduced into the unsaturated zone resulting in gradually increasing in eh values as concentrations in the monitoring water samples from the three monitoring wells varied from 1 15 to 124 μg l with 29 4 of samples having as concentrations exceeding 10 μg l however all water samples with high as concentrations were collected from the depth of 2 0 m fig 2c during the experiment the δ18o values of water samples ranged from 12 1 to 9 98 and the vertical infiltration of irrigation carrying large amount of salt from land surface results in acutely increases in cl concentration with little variation in δ18o values fig 3 a it s worth to note that two trends can be detected clearly in the plot of δ18o vs as concentration fig 3b all high as groundwater samples fall close to the low evaporation but high leaching line with all low as soil water samples falling close to the evaporation line indicating that fast vertical recharge promotes mobilization of as in the unsaturated zone 3 3 soil sediment analysis geochemical analysis of sediments was conducted to determine the potential effects of as and fe minerals on as mobilization the geochemical analysis results of soils collected before and after irrigation indicates most of the total as co exists with crystalline iron oxides extraction step 4 in the soils fig 4 e as associated with the exchangeable phase extraction step 1 and co precipitated with carbonates and phosphates extraction step 2 only occurred in minor amounts fig 4c and d and nearly no as was associated with ferrihydrite and poorly crystalline goethite extraction step 3 total as contents in pre irrigation and post irrigation sediment samples ranged from 6 52 to 8 19 mg kg and 6 44 to 8 37 mg kg respectively with the fe content ranging from 16 6 to 26 9 g kg pre irrigation and 18 3 to 23 8 mg kg post irrigation respectively the results for as and fe content in surface soil samples from 0 to 0 4 m are particularly notable with the obvious change from pre irrigation to post irrigation fig 4a and b as is predominantly associated with crystalline iron oxides extraction step 4 fig 4g in both pre irrigation and post irrigation samples but as associated with carbonates and phosphates extraction step 2 fig 4f desorbable fe extraction step 1 and poorly crystalline goethite extraction step 3 are also present in minor amounts 3 4 geochemical inverse modeling geochemical inverse modeling was performed to further interpret the geochemical behavior of as and fe in the unsaturated zone during irrigation the chemical extraction results indicate the amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides and crystallized fe oxyhydr oxide are closely related to the fate of as during irrigation thus goethite and fe oh 3 a were selected for the inverse model because of the high salinity of topsoil and high concentrations of na ca2 hco3 so4 2 and cl detected in soil water samples calcite gypsum and halite were also included as potential mineral phases in the model carbonate dissolution would increase the concentration of hco3 which in turn produces dissolved co2 input of organic matter during the infiltration would produce dissolved co2 which in turn would increase hco3 therefore co2 g was included in the model cation exchange reactions were also considered in the model the solubility product and saturation indices of the potential mineral phases selected in the model are given in table 2 the cl values were calculated to ensure that the data was adequate to proceed with the geochemical modeling to constrain the inverse model minerals and gases were set to precipitate or dissolve to achieve equilibrium the results of the most optimum inverse model for the phase mole transfers of minerals and gases are shown in table 3 modeling results indicate that calcite co2 g fe oh 3 a nax and mgx2 are generally precipitating in the subsurface while goethite and cax2 are dissolving the fe minerals content of samples from 0 5 m change considerably during irrigation irri1 to irri2 and post irrigation postirri1 to postirri2 while that of soil water samples from 1 0 m obviously evolve from postirri1 to postirri2 however samples from 1 5 m undergo moderate changes without fe minerals changes throughout these three respective periods and fe minerals content of samples from 2 0 m depth undergo a moderate change from irri1 to irr2 but considerably changes in the three other periods preirri to irri1 irri2 to postirri1 and postirri1 to postirri2 precipitation and transformation of fe oxides hydroxides occur repeatedly in the model which is essential for the oxidation of fe oxides hydroxides and the immobilization of aquatic as however the immobilization of as distinctly appears during the irrigation period resulting in low concentrations of aquatic as detected at depths of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m fig 2c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of irrigation on redox conditions under oxidizing conditions high eh the fe iii forms solid phase fe iii oxyhydr oxides accordingly as is immobilized by fe iii oxyhydr oxides as as v species fig 5 clearly shows that as v and fe iii are the dominant as and fe species in soil water groundwater samples and only a few samples collected post irrigation indicate the dominant as form is as iii after irrigation samples from depths below the water table are in a stable reducing environment at the beginning of the irrigation irri1 water samples had lower ph and higher eh with ongoing irrigation the ph increased and the eh decreased measured ph values of most samples ranged from 7 5 to 8 5 under such conditions negatively charged as v is immobilized by sorption onto the positively charged surfaces of feooh resulting in decreased aquatic as concentrations sharma et al 2014 xie et al 2016b according to the non linear adsorption isotherm behavior of as v decreasing ph is beneficial for the adsorption of as v onto the surface of fe minerals smedley and kinniburgh 2002 however eh values ranging from 0 24 to 0 13 v indicate the redox environment of the unsaturated zone changes from oxidizing to reducing with ongoing irrigation as such the dominant species of as could change from as v to as iii and fe mineral phase transformations could occur due to the weak association between as iii and fe bearing minerals dixit and hering 2003 the change from as v to as iii from irrigation to postirri1 led to the vertical infiltration of as and increasing aquatic as concentrations at depths around 1 7 m the irrigation water reaches shallow groundwater and the vertical movement of infiltration water is significantly retarded as a result as carried by the intense vertical infiltration from the unsaturated zone accumulates in shallow groundwater at this depth 4 2 variations of as and fe minerals during irrigation during the irrigation experiment as accumulation in the sediments is different than in the soil water and groundwater results of parallel chemical extractions show a small amount of as combined with poorly crystalline fe oxides which occur in minor amounts in the sediment in the datong basin the high as groundwater generally contains some amount of fe wang et al 2014 therefore during irrigation the extracted irrigation groundwater reducing mixes with water in the medium oxidizing triggering the precipitation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides that incorporate some amount of as this process is very similar to the interaction between groundwater and surface water postma et al 2010 as a result the input of dissolved oxygen increases the formation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides and decreases the mobility of as pi et al 2015 an increase in the as and fe content of soil sediment after irrigation indicates that irrigation using high as groundwater leads to some degree of as accumulation in surface soil adsorption of as onto amorphous fe iii minerals is considered as a key process controlling the distribution of as in an oxidizing environment dixit and hering 2003 zhao et al 2011 qi and pichler 2016 during irrigation the irrigation water introduces fe ii into the unsaturated zone and fe ii is quickly oxidized to form amorphous fe iii minerals under such situation aquatic as was adsorbed by amorphous fe iii minerals within the unsaturated zone when irrigation ended the unsaturated zone is in constant contact with air and oxygen and therefore amorphous fe iii minerals would transform into more stable fe iii oxyhydr oxides cudennec and lecerf 2006 hence during the whole experiment period as in soil sediment mainly combined with crystalline and amorphous fe oxides via co precipitation and sorption in the unsaturated zone as corroborated by the results of chemical extraction fig 4 chemical extraction results and the good correlation between total as and fe fig 6 a in soil sediments both indicate that as is closely associated with fe minerals before irrigation the results of the chemical extraction fig 6b further indicate as co existing with the crystalline fe oxides is the major process of sequestration of as in soil sediments before irrigation however a poor correlation between as and fe observed after irrigation fig 6a suggests a subsequent disassociation between as and fe fate fig 5 clearly shows that the variation in eh during irrigation leads to the conversion of as species from as v to as iii which can cause the release of as from solid phases to the aqueous phase in addition during irrigation the decrease of eh can also cause the changes of fe minerals phases from crystalline fe iii hydr oxides to amorphous fe iii minerals the chemical extraction results indicate the transformation of fe iii minerals occurs despite the eh not reaching the critical value for fe iii hydr oxide reduction in addition the poor correlation between as and crystalline fe forms after irrigation fig 6b further illustrates the disassociation between as and fe that occurs during irrigation the modeling results also agree well with the observation that as separated from fe iii hydr oxides during irrigation table 3 the precipitation of amorphous fe iii minerals and the dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides from irri1 to irri2 at a depth of 0 5 m reflects the change of redox condition from the oxidizing conditions at the beginning of irrigation to the reducing conditions gradually with the irrigation ongoing during irrigation irri1 to irri2 the dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides at a depth of 0 5 m weakens the association with as and fast vertical infiltration transports as from the unsaturated to saturated zone resulting in the enrichment of aqueous as in the saturated zone in contrast the geochemical inverse modeling results indicate that the gradual increase of oxidation after irrigation postirri1 to postirri2 at a depth of 2 0 m resulting in the less amount precipitation of amorphous fe iii minerals from the period three irri2 to postirri1 to the period four postirri1 to postirri2 which is consistent with the observed eh values in the soil water fig 2b although fe mineral phases changed during irrigation the poor correlation between as and fe after irrigation fig 6 further confirms the disassociation between as and fe occurred as discussed above 4 3 mechanism of as mobilization in the unsaturated zone during irrigation the irrigation process can be generalized as shown in fig 7 according to a comprehensive analysis that incorporates the hydrogeochemical parameter data and geochemical inverse modeling results before irrigation the unsaturated zone is in full contact with air oxidizing conditions and the phreatic water table is located 1 7 m below the ground surface the correlation between as and fe in soil sediments shows as co exists with crystalline fe iii hydr oxides and the anoxic conditions prevalent in the saturated zone have a minor effect on as immobilization as in the irrigation water is directed adsorbed by fe iii oxyhydr oxides due to the oxidation of fe ii present in the irrigation water in the initial stages of irrigation the oxidation of the small amounts of fe ii in the irrigation water to fe iii oxyhydr oxide results in the adsorption saturation being reached quickly and fast vertical infiltration to the saturated zone as and fe contents in the topsoil noticeably increase but the aqueous as concentration does not conspicuously change with pores gradually occupied by irrigation water concurrent with a rise in the water table redox conditions in the unsaturated zone change from oxidizing to moderately reducing as such the dominant as species changes from as v to as iii and the weaker association between as iii and fe iii minerals causes the release of as from solid phases to the aqueous phase in addition the change of fe mineral phases from crystalline fe iii hydr oxides to amorphous fe iii minerals also decreased the amount of as co existing with fe iii minerals unlike the limited irrigation has lower possibility of groundwater contamination reedy et al 2007 strong vertical infiltration from the unsaturated to saturated zone and the retarded vertical movement in the saturated zone ultimately result in a sudden increase in aqueous as concentration in the saturated zone from irri1 to irri2 with irrigation water infiltration other materials and organic matter are carried from the surface to the subsurface harvey et al 2002 dissolved organic matter can enhance redox reactions bhattacharya et al 2006 nath et al 2008a b resulting in the reduction of iron oxyhydr oxides that in turn releases dissolved as farooq et al 2010 when irrigation stopped the residual irrigation water on the land surface is in full contact with the air therefore the infiltration of the residual oxidizing water decreases results in the gradual increasing of eh values detected from the soil water fig 2b the stronger oxidizing conditions strengthen the absorption of as onto fe iii minerals as reflected in gradually decreasing concentrations of aqueous as the migration of as during irrigation is clearly influenced by redox conditions fe iii mineral phase changes and the input of organic matter with the irrigated water infiltrating from the land surface to the unsaturated and saturated zone resulting in the change of shallow groundwater table moreover the mobilization and transformation of as is more intensive in topsoil due to the frequent oxic anoxic alternation mladenov et al 2010 long term use of as contaminated groundwater for irrigation can increase as accumulation in agriculture soils and the food chain this study shows that irrigation induced water table fluctuations can lead to the accumulation of as in topsoil and shallow groundwater excessive exploitation of groundwater might result in sharp water table fluctuations and acute changes in redox conditions in the unsaturated zone consequently flood irrigation using as contaminated groundwater should be gradually replaced by drip irrigation or irrigation using a non contaminated water resource to reduce concerns with respect to as accumulation in the food chain and support stable agricultural management 5 conclusions irrigation practice obviously affects the concentrations of major ions as well as trace metals in soil water and shallow groundwater specifically irrigation water has a significant impact on the mobilization and migration of as in the unsaturated zone here infiltration of as contaminated irrigation water alters redox conditions in the unsaturated zone introduces as and fe into the unsaturated zone and affects the water table both rising and dropping resulting in the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii minerals that absorb as and ultimately result in increasing as and fe content in the topsoil with increased input of organic matter fe iii oxides hydroxides undergo reductive dissolution during irrigation fe iii oxides hydroxides might be the main sink for as before irrigation but the extraction analysis confirms that as also disassociates with other fe minerals after irrigation moreover geochemical modeling and sample analysis suggest that several geochemical evolutions that reflect absorption leaching and cation exchange processes occurred during the field experiment this work suggests that flood irrigation using as contaminated groundwater should be gradually replaced by drip irrigation or irrigation

modelled the interdependence between activities that affect wetland characteristics and land utilization patterns nature based solutions nbs can provide benefits for society the economy and nature the nbs solution for wetland bioremediation is proposed through a combination of ecosystem value provided by nature based or artificial arable land we constructed a model to simulate the dynamic spatial and temporal changes in the regulating function of a wetland to study the impact of agricultural and fishing activities on the functions and services of a wetland ecosystem the model was used to determine the relationship between land use change wetland range water quality and fish stocks huangqihai lake hqhl is a relatively isolated lake in an area interlaced with agriculture and pasture zones from 1973 to 2014 the shrinkage of the water area of hqhl approached 60 under the influence of humans and natural disturbances the hqhl wetland faced enormous ecological risks water pollution area reduction sharp biodiversity reduction and fish extinction the phosphorus p concentration seems to be a key factor affecting both the reed growth in the nearshore areas of the huangqihai lake wetland and the breeding of phytoplankton in the core lake water area dividing this value by the 25 821 ha of the core wetland area affected by the reclamation the cost per unit of lost fish production is usd 166 ha yr after deducting the externalities of the fishery the net sustainable income from the conversion is usd 1717 ha the spatial distribution of nutrient load externalities varies with the use of wetlands in terms of fishery value the additional nutrient load associated with the conversion of wetland uses would result in a reduction of at least 8 of the maximum

land farmers usd 8 1 m yr it is theoretically feasible to implement an ecosystem service payment system that can effectively compensate for the loss of nutrient buffer function caused by the conversion of wetlands the approach based on bns we described may also have value in other ecosystems where regulatory functions include similar mechanisms keywords regulating function nature based solutions optimal decision making phosphorus wetland ecosystem service huangqihai lake wetland 1 introduction a wetland ecosystem is a kind of system formed over water or wet areas wetland ecosystems have characteristics of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems which result in them having a very special ecosystem value wetland ecosystems are important sources of water large suppliers of goods and energy eco environment optimizers and collections of species resources mitsch et al 2009 wetlands supply service values of sewage treatment freshwater supply and material production such as fish and reeds through their nutrient absorption function reyers et al 2013 however the main value of wetlands in absorbing nutrients is reflected in regulating fish supply fishing and breeding are both very important in developing countries langan et al 2018 with the rapid development of aquaculture the fishing industry is shrinking worldwide myers and worm 2003 although wetlands have important implications for both fishing and breeding the modelling issues described in this paper refer to only fishing we modelled the role of wetlands in regulating the negative externalities produced by terrestrial activities on freshwater fishing we focused on the regulating functions of water purification and waste treatment services provided by wetland ecosystem services this regulating function was interpreted to provide insurance that was not to compensate for the financial loss but to ensure that the fishery could be maintained under certain conditions brown et al 2018 the value of wetland regulating functions comes from the interaction between multiple ecosystem functions and service value the property rights of wetland resources involved in the production and consumption of ecosystem services need to be clearly defined when both parties involved in the transaction have full information the transaction price of the commodity is their social opportunity cost jia et al 2018 effective regulation of services is the key to the sustainable use of wetland ecosystems with regard to the modelling of various wetland characteristics hydrologists ecologists fishery scientists and limnologists have conducted extensive research jackson et al 2013 vigerstol and aukema 2011 namaalwa et al 2013 farmer et al 2011 rodrigo et al 2018 schroder et al 2018 the inflow of terrestrial nutrients may lead to eutrophication of lakes with low nutrient levels the dynamic impacts of wetlands that are affected by nutrient loading on fisheries in open water are receiving increasing attention in many cases changes in aquatic systems resulting from changes in the nutrient loading of terrestrial economic activities are the externalities yu et al 2016 roebeling et al 2016 the research on the interaction mechanism between ecological pattern ecological process and water soil change process has attracted increasing attention ecological hydrological models have been used to reveal the relationship of dynamic changes between the intrinsic structures of wetland systems and the external environment and quantitatively evaluate the ecological environmental impact of wetland development activities mei et al 2018 based on a trading oriented mechanism zeng et al 2017 analysed the ecological effects of wetland ecosystems and found that land utilization patterns and pollution mitigation schemes could improve the ecological function of the yongnianwa wetland land based activities damage the aquatic systems of wetlands but zeng et al 2017 ignored the consequences of land based activities because the services provided by these systems are not traded on the market although people have realized that internalizing these externalities should be used to study the interaction between land based activities and aquatic systems few studies have attempted to model this problem early approaches either focused on the simple correlation between changes in watersheds and changes in fisheries or focused on identifying the impact of land based activities on fisheries worm et al 2006 laitin 2013 limnologists have studied the impact of changes in land use vegetation and fertilization patterns on freshwater ecosystems recently economists began to consider the ethical issues that arise from the interaction between lake utilization and basin resources mäler et al 2003 however few studies have attempted to model the interactions in real ecosystems or estimate the external value between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems this study modelled a specific land water interaction in hqhl in inner mongolia of north china we attempted to elaborate the impact of wetland protection on lake ecology nutrient enrichment has a positive effect on fishery production in a nutrient limited environment such as one with low or medium nutrient levels knowler and barbier 2005 however if an aquatic system becomes highly eutrophic the sustainability of total fish stocks will decline at higher nutrient levels feng et al 2017 excessive nutrients will affect fishery productivity and wetland ecosystem services through two ways changing the amount of food available and habitat quality the loss of oxygen in the water increases the natural mortality of fish sediments have an adverse effect on the fry base and may damage the eggs when both water pollution and high fishing pressures are present both effects may have serious impacts on fish stocks and fishery production whitfield 2016 nutrients are caused by nutrient inflows from agricultural land and urban sewage along lakes the nutrient load of agricultural land surrounding hqhl is derived from the use of fertilizers and livestock breeding the conversion of wetlands to other uses results in a decline in the ecological services of lakeside wetlands the land use transition matrixes showed that the increase in farmland led to the degeneration of the wetlands song et al 2010 over the past decade or so water analysis reports have shown that hqhl has gradually shifted from moderate to eutrophic the total nitrogen and total phosphorus levels in the water body are high as is the water turbidity which have degraded the water environment and caused a decrease in the number of aquatic organisms the value of wetland regulation depends not only on the land use structure in the upper basin but also on the resource utilization patterns downstream of the basin since each land user in the basin produces a degree of externality based on the physical characteristics of the land we should estimate the spatial distribution of pollution externalities to estimate the value of the wetland function based on the support function of the wetland to the fishery wetlands are important wetlands support the regulation of water quality by reducing pollutant loadings capturing and retaining pollutants and recycling nutrients as industrialization process demand for land increases and wetlands are frequently drained filled in and built upon so how we overcome these challenges nature based solutions nbs encompasses the existing concepts such as natural capital and ecosystem services in economics and landscape functions in environmental planning the criteria of nbs were found in the examples of coastal management and the restoration of floodplains hoang et al 2018 morris et al 2018 nbs could help the recovery of cognitive natural resources and wellbeing panno et al 2017 we used the agricultural nbs for improving farm productivity and smallholder livelihoods in huangqihai lake watershed peter et al 2017 using the nbs wetland restoration modelling on huangqihai lake we assessed the feasibility of human well being activities and performances in evaluating social success for ecosystem management this method can be used to determine and calculate the nutrient buffer function that results from wetland conservation or agricultural activities affecting the nutrient load of a fishery

zones hqhl is a small enclosed lake in inner mongolia of china and is located in the central part of chahar youyiqianqi wulanchabu city and the geographic coordinates are 113 10 113 26 e and 40 45 41 07 n the area of the hqhl watershed is 4511 20 km2 fig 1 the huangqihai lake watershed belongs to a closed inland river basin the water source of the lake is mainly from the input of 19 rivers such as the quanyulinhe river bawanghe river and mozishanhe river the topography of huangqihai lake watershed is sloping from the north to the south and is covered by hills high plains and salt lake plains the terrain is high in the north low in the south high in the west low in the east and the elevation is average the average altitude is 1600 m the surface morphology is dominated by plains the hilly area is 848 21 km2 accounting for 18 80 of the total basin area the high plain area is 1961 89 km2 accounting for 43 49 of the total basin area the saline alkali land plain area is 1701 09 km2 accounting for 37 71 of the total basin area fig 2 the average annual precipitation in the hqhl watershed is 363 mm and the precipitation shows a decreasing trend the annual decrease is 0 81 mm fu et al 2017 the average annual evaporation of hqhl is 1200 mm and the evaporation is significantly higher than the precipitation the main water supply sources in hqhl are natural precipitation surface runoff and underground runoff and the discharge is mainly evaporation the hqhl watershed has various ecosystem types such as lake river salt marsh and shrub the hqhl wetland is 39 km long from north to south the width of the east west is 23 km and the total area is 368 23 km2 the core area of the wetland is 33 42 km2 which is covered by water diversified ecological types and native wetland ecosystems make the animal and plant resources abundant thus the hqhl wetland is the ideal site for birds amphibians and fish to inhabit and reproduce the wetland is also an important transfer station for bird migration and the biodiversity constitutes many species and gene libraries due to the unique natural environment the hqhl wetland has special ecological functions to regulate the local climate and salt alkali concentrations the hqhl wetland has rich plant species and wide ranges of hay grassland mountain shrub grassland mountain meadow grassland low humid saline alkaline grassland and farmland weeds before the 1950s a large number of reeds and bulrushes grew along hqhl the hqhl wetland has home to nomadic people for generations however after the 1970s due to the arid climate the amount of water used for industrial and agricultural purposes increased water conservancy projects were established throughout the watershed therefore the upstream water was intercepted the amount of water entering the lake decreased the water area gradually decreased and the degree of soil salinization gradually increased except for some native reeds on the northern bank of hqhl the rest of the area was replaced by typical halophytic vegetation the current plant coverage rate of huangqihai lake wetland is only 10 18 the vegetation mainly consists of low humidity saline grassland arable land and woodland see fig 3 the lake area has constantly fluctuated since the holocene but the overall trend is decreasing the wetland suffers from serious degradation caused mainly by the irrational exploitation of groundwater as well as the drying of climate change during recent decades from 1973 to 2015 the water area of hqhl shrunk from 81 92 km2 to 33 42 km2 and the shrinkage approached 60 the change in the hqhl water area from 1987 to 2014 is shown in fig 4 due to human and natural disturbances the hqhl wetland faces enormous ecological risks such as increased severity of water pollution reduction in wetland area and decreased numbers of wetland biological species after the 1990s large amounts of sediment and industrial wastewater were continuously discharged into the lake as a result the silt in the lake area continued to accumulate the bottom of the lake rose and the central area of the lake began to plateau the water quality of the lake deteriorated and the native plants were destroyed huangqihai lake which was once known as the guancun carp has almost completely died the ecosystem services functions of hqhl such as regulating floods providing biological habitats and purifying water quality have greatly decreased 2 2 model description the model was used to determine the relationship between land use change wetland range water quality and fish stocks the beneficiaries of wetland protection were downstream economic activities fisheries and the value depended on the water quality water quality affected the total productivity of the fishery the concentrations of pollutants in the water bodies were affected not only by the breadth and intensity of upstream agricultural production but also by the buffering functions such as the purification of water pollution and retaining of solid pollutants by vegetation of wetlands as the impacts of upstream activities were not reflected in market prices any gains costs brought to other economic sectors by upstream land users were ignored to estimate the impact of externalities on the regulatory function of wetlands we modelled the interdependence between activities that affected wetland characteristics and land utilization patterns in the model the areas of agricultural land la and wetland lw are summed and the sum is the watershed area l 0 in agricultural land any land of the ith hectare was fallow in production or both given β as the fallow proportion of agricultural land the soil productivity was maintained by taking turns to fallow and cultivate crops the formula is 1 l 0 l a l w i 1 n f α i β i l 0 where 0 αi 1 0 βi 1 αi and βi is the ratio of agricultural land fallow land in the ith hectare agricultural land respectively to determine the externalities of land use in the watershed we introduced a nutrient inflow function to calculate the total phosphorus tp the function described the process of phosphorus p flowing from agricultural land into wetlands in acidic soils p is tightly bound to soil particles therefore soil erosion was almost the entire source of p content in water roy and misra 2003 the nutrient inflow function was expressed as follows 2 g t i 1 α l 0 g it q it p it β it ω i where gt is the annual p loading into the wetland t yr qit is the p content 20 cm below the surface soil kg ha pit is the annual amount of p fertilizer kg ha ωi is the

erosion t ha δ is the enrichment factor of p in soil θ is the density factor of the soil si is the transport ratio of sediment 0 si 1 t is the time scale yr the p content in soil depends on soil erosion planting structure of the agricultural land and dynamic changes in the soil soil dynamic changes are a simplified nutrient balance equation smaling et al 1996 the formula for calculating the p

time scale yr regulatory wetland functions were given according to the changes in nutrient retention a previous study used a p balance model to reflect the changes in wetland range kadlec and knight 1996a b the specific expression of the model was 5 z g t α t g t w α t g t exp 10 4 k 1 α t l 0 v where zt is the annual p loss from the wetland to the water t gt is the annual p input to the wetland

is the maximum nutrient amount that was lost to the water body given α t is the time scale yr the impact of nutrient loading on water was modelled according to its direct impact on the productivity of the lake fishery when the contaminant content in the water changed from a low nutrient state to a eutrophic state fishery productivity would rapidly decline this paper constructed an eco economic model of fisheries that clearly illustrated the impact of water quality simonit and perrings 2005 kasulo and perrings 2006 this paper constructed a damage function depending on nutrient load when nutrient flow and fishing occur the dynamic equation for fish stocks is 6 δ x x x t d z t j 1 n h x t e jt δ x rx t d z t x t k j 1 n q e jt x t where xt is fish stock d zt 1 is the damage function for nutrient loading zt x and h are the growth and fishing functions respectively r k q and et are the parameters of the gordon schaefer model gordon 1954 schaefer 1954 schaefer 1957 et collectively term fishing effort r k and q are constants the damage function was represented by the concentration function of chlorophyll a as follows 7 d z t w z t c w 2 z t where wt is the concentration of chlorophyll a mg m3 c is the coefficient zt is the nutrient loading the concentration changes of chlorophyll a are the result of nutrient loading inflow in the river basin until a certain level is reached nutrient loading has a positive effect on the growth of fish stocks above this level the increase in nutrient loading would lead to the loss of fish stocks therefore environmental variables could affect the growth rate of fish simonit and perrings 2005 studies have shown that the growth of alpine meadow plants is most likely to be limited by the availability of p in the soil elser et al 2007 in the huangqihai lake watershed nitrogen is a relatively limited nutrient in farmland and p concentration seems to be a key factor affecting the reed growth in the nearshore areas of the huangqihai lake wetland and the breeding of phytoplankton in the core area of lake water zhang et al 2010 we used p to represent nutrients in the paper which was appropriate 2 3 optimal decision making the modelling of decision problems takes place in a variety of ways the type of land allocation α fallow ratio β and the p fertilizer application p has an impact on downstream fisheries according to the different fisheries resource acquisition rules fishermen either maximized their profits or made the total return equal to the total cost when considering the external influence of fishing effort e and nutrient loading z on fish stocks the decision problem could be expressed as 8 m ax e t 0 j 1 n ρ t π jf x t e jt t 0 j 1 n ρ t p q e jt x t c f e jt where π jf is the profit function for the jth fisherman p is the price of fish cf is the cost of fishing ρ 1 δ t is discount factor δ is discount rate to achieve the maximum fishing profit the current hamiltonian value was

stock x yield y and fishing intensity e can be obtained when the profit is maximized table 1 table 1 supplies the steady state solution under two cases namely the open access to fisheries resources and the regulated situations table 1 also compares these results with the results of the standard gordon schaefer model without external environmental interference farmers maximize profits by

caused by the marginal changes in α β and p on the wetland revenue sector the externality value is the optimal value of the covariate variable μ and the covariate variable μ stands for the shadow value of the abandoned fish yield eq 16 shows that when the proportion of fallow area made the marginal income equal to the sum of the marginal cost of soil nutrients to the agricultural sector and the marginal cost of the fishery sector the social benefits could be maximized when the marginal benefit of increasing the nutrient balance of the soil equalled the marginal cost to the fishery sector the optimal fertilizing amount could be determined eq 16 also shows the value of the nutrient buffer function of the wetland at the given nutrient load level gt along an optimal path eq 16 implies that the marginal benefits of wetland depletion measured by the extra net income from agricultural production should be equal to the marginal cost of wetland depletion measured by the value of abandoned nutrient buffer service specifically when the nutrient influx of the wetland was given this was the value of the marginal impact of changes in wetland area to the growth of fish stocks the marginal impact of wetland area change depended on both the wetland nutrient retention effect z w w αt gt w αt and the damage associated with changes in nutrient loading d z the value of the latter depended on the state of the ecosystem if the ecosystem was initially in a low nutrient state the marginal effect of wetland depletion could be either positive or negative depending on the initial nutrient loading however when the ecosystem was at the critical point of either low or high nutrient status the marginal damage caused by changes in wetland area may be very high if the ecosystem was initially in a high nutrient state the marginal impact of further changes in wetland area on fish stocks may be small or absent the user discounted cost ρμt 1 for fish stocks depended on both the solution to the optimal fishing problem and the market price of fish as well as the allocation of access to resources the regulation method and the fish breeding target 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of phosphorus to obtain an estimate of the damage function we used the conservation of p mass model proposed by vollenweider 1969 to relate the nutrient load to the density of phytoplankton i e the concentration of chlorophyll a since there was no specific research on huangqihai lake we used the relevant literature on chlorophyll and nutrient contents in other water ecosystems to determine the model parameters prairie et al 1989 there was a positive correlation between tp and chlorophyll a in may and july and a negative correlation in september in may and july the average concentration of tp in lake water were 0 123 and 0 082 mg l respectively the tp concentration was high which promoted the growth of algae taking chlorophyll a as an example p in lake water could still meet the needs of algae growth with the algae growth the phosphorus was continuously consumed in lake water causing the tp concentration in lake water in july to be lower than may the average concentration of tp in september was 0 06 mg l which was lower than that in may and july indicating that the amount of p consumed in lake water from july to september was insufficient and the increase in chlorophyll a exacerbated the concentration decline of tp chlorophyll a was negatively correlated with tp from may to september the continuous decrease of tp concentration in lake water indicates that the tp requirement of algae growth is greater than the total amount of exogenous input and endogenous transformation p is one of the limiting nutrients for the growth and reproduction of algae in hqhl wetland we chose the general equation proposed by dilon and rigler 1974 to describe the effect of total phosphorus content in water on total phytoplankton as shown in table 2 the nutrient balance equation flowing into the lake is provided in eq 18 in addition this input was supplemented by atmospheric deposition and nutrient loading elsewhere in hqhl waters as the fertilization impact is highly sensitive to the relevant conditions in the river basin this paper discussed the marginal impact of nutrient loading per hectare of the river basin on the growth of aquatic organisms fish stocks the marginal impact of nutrient loading on the environmental variable w i e the concentration of chlorophyll a is a function of the load g wetland area and a set of

of the lake m s is the settling velocity of p mole l year t is the time scale yr other variables are defined above we used the geographic information system 9 2 software and a digital elevation model dem to determine the boundary of hqhl watershed and the river network based on this we calculated the amount of soil erosion and sediment transport which are the key factors in determining the nutrient load based on the soil erosion equation we obtained soil erosion raster data based on the overlay of rain erosion soil erosion length gradient and land cover factor map layers in this process the rain erosion layer is determined from the annual average rainfall map the coefficients used in this study were derived from the regression results of long term rainfall on erosive forces we determined the length gradient grid based on the dem moore and bruch 1985 soil erosion data were derived from the soil characteristics map provided by china soil database http vdb3 soil csdb cn the area of fallow land is approximately equal to the area of grassland vegetation the density of grassland vegetation can be represented by the spatial distribution of parameter β to calculate the soil erosion rate of the hqhl watershed we used the functional relationship proposed by vanoni 1975 to draw the spatial distribution grid of the sediment transport ratio str we multiplied the soil transport maps by the str and the soil erosion grid to represent the net soil erosion in the dynamic soil equation the initial value of the average p concentration in the soil was taken from field experiments in the hetao plain inner mongolia autonomous region wang et al 2010 the average content of nutrients in the soil depends on the bulk density of the surface soil we calculated the soil bulk density factor based on the bulk density data 1 30 g cm3 of the top 20 cm of soil the atmospheric deposition of p was estimated from the empirical function of the inner mongolia autonomous region and the rainfall distribution map that indicated the average annual rainfall in the hqhl wetland the agricultural production function was adapted from the maize production model in china yang et al 2017 for the huangqihai lake watershed there is no reliable estimate of p consumption some regional studies have shown that the average amount of p fertilizer applied is approximately 82 7 kg ha it has been predicted that the balance of p in the soil of huangqihai lake watershed is negative and it is no longer possible to self sustain in the long term without increasing the amount of fertilizers or changing land use and the existence of soil management measures to reduce runoff zhang et al 2008 therefore the p was chosen as the representative nutrient in the paper which affects the breeding and growth of phytoplankton in the hqhl wetland the nitrogen use efficiency of target forage species alfalfa ryegrass and oat grass was higher than 60 but p use efficiency was relatively low therefore p fertilizer was the most important input of p in these kinds of forage wei et al 2018 phytoplankton plays a key role in energy transformation to grazers and material circulation of the wetland ecosystem silva et al 2012 in winter and spring the biomass and growth rate of phytoplankton in taihu lake increased with the concentration of p in the water which suggests that the growth of phytoplankton is mainly limited by p xu et al 2010 the limiting nutrient element of phytoplankton growth was analyzed by nutrient enrichment bioassay experiment in dianshan lake the results showed that the content of phosphorus was positively correlated with the biomass of phytoplankton rmax 0 980 zhang et al 2010 cropland soil p use efficiency decreased from 0 6 in the 1960s to 0 3 at present cropland soil p balance had a positive relationship with cropland soil p inputs while soil p use efficiency followed the opposite trend there were significant correlations between amount of fertilizer and yield response p was the main limiting factor for crop yield according to the results of water quality monitoring of representative sampling points of hqhl wetland in the winter of 2012 integrated ecological protection plan of huangqihai lake in inner mongolia autonomous region 2017 the over standard rate of chemical oxygen demand cod in wetland is 100 the minimum multiple super scale level iv water quality is 1 7 and the maximum value is 3 52 the over standard rate of tn is 100 exceeding 1 73 30 3 times the over standard rate of tp is 57 14 exceeding the standard level iv water quality of 3 56 82 8 times therefore the water quality of hqhl wetland in 2012 was inferior to level v water quality the degree of eutrophication in hqhl wetland is enhanced the tn and tp are high the water body is turbid and the water environment is deteriorated therefore the aquatic organisms are reduced in the hqhl wetland chlorophyll a concentration ρchl a was positively related to phosphorus in the water of hqhl the ρchl a is low the annual average is only 2 49 mg m3 and the monthly mean value is between 1 43 and 4 11 mg m3 ρchl a is higher in july and september and relatively lower in spring to estimate the magnitude of the nutrient buffering effect of the hqhl wetlands we assumed that the amount of p fertilizer could ensure the sustainability of agriculture we estimated the impact of wetlands on nutrient uptake in the presence and absence of measures to reduce runoff the soil erosion was affected by natural and human factors the natural factors mainly included topography underlying surface conditions and soil type the human factors mainly consisted of vegetation coverage precipitation land use crop cultivation and cultivated land farming methods moreover mountainous areas have great soil erosion hong et al 2012 the hqhl watershed had a large cultivated land area therefore soil erosion was more likely due to the difference in land use the amount of fertilization needed per hectare varies depending on the natural conditions affecting soil erosion and soil use intensity βi βi affects soil erosion through land cover factors ci and affects the dynamic changes of p content in the soil this paper used the soil nutrient balance in eq 4 to determine the amount of sustainable fertilizer application for each hectare of land the result of eq 4 is an expression for p i which is a function of βi and net soil erosion or sediment production siai on the assumption that the initial soil p content per hectare of land qit 0 equalled 30 kg ha we used the grass cover and sediment production maps to divide the grid we used the raster data in arcgis to solve the equation the calculation results indicated the spatial distribution of p fertilizer application as shown in fig 5 many fertilizers and pesticides have been applied to the farmland and organophosphate pesticides accounted for 40 of the total pesticides wang 2012 the paddy fields brown soil and dry lands were mainly distributed in the hqhl watershed downstream therefore the p loading in these plains areas was higher li et al 2007 correspondingly the cities and counties with large proportions of farmland have higher tp output loading based on the values in table 2 and using the 2014 fish prices usd 1788 t and wetland core area from the initial 36 823 ha reduced to 11 002 ha we determined that the maximum sustainable yield reduction in fisheries will occur the loss will determine the extent of the impact caused by the reclamation of the wetland assuming that the amount of fertilizer pi was exactly equal to the amount of p needed to maintain the nutrient balance in the huangqihai lake watershed we can calculate the effect of the decrease in wetland area on the change in the stock market ymsyi if the wetland core area was reduced by 70 the inflow of p load in lake water would increase from 81 t to 110 t and the maximum sustainable production of fish catch would decrease from 2400 t yr to 0 with a loss of 2400 t yr and the value was usd 4 29 m dividing this value by the 25 821 ha 36 823 ha minus 11 002 ha of the core area of the wetland that are affected by the reclamation the unit cost per unit of lost fish production is usd 166 ha yr this measure of the value of wetland regulation services was used to assess the benefits of reclamation wetlands and assess the feasibility of alternative mechanisms that provide the same regulatory services if we ignored the cost of conversion the maximum potential yield of maize was 6 1 t ha yr if the price is usd 350 83 t the sustainable annual return of wetland to arable land is usd 55 28 m the reduction rate of wetlands is 70 15 which is about 25821 ha yr the grain production per hectare of cultivated land is 6 1 t the price is usd 350 83 t the total value is usd 55 28 m or usd 2140 ha yr because of the need to apply 95 kg of p per hectare which costs usd 257 ha the net sustainable income from the conversion was usd 1883 ha or usd 1717 ha after deducting the externalities of the fishery 3 2 wetland ecosystem regulating function the value of the wetland buffer function is very sensitive to both shore and coastal conditions based on topography landform soil types and land development status in the watershed the upper streams of the watershed have high vegetation coverage less farmland and low pollutant loading while the lower areas have more farmland high fertilizer application rates and high soil erosion and pollution loading yin et al 2011 in summary the spatial characteristics of p loading resulted from comprehensive effects of precipitation runoff characteristics soil properties soil erosion and vegetation coverage therefore to effectively control p loading and soil erosion in the hqhl watershed the bmps fallow measures of cultivated fields wetland vegetation restoration and soil and water conservation in the upper stream are the most important measures to implement we added up the load in the catchment and obtained a baseline phosphorus load g of 210 t yr we used the gis grid calculator grassland coverage maps phosphate fertilizer application maps and fish price data usd 1788 t to determine the spatial distribution of externalities of nutrient loads nutrient externalities ranged from 0 to usd 2100 ha yr which indicates that the externalities of the least eroded plots were almost 0 and the externalities of the most soil eroded plots were as high as usd 2100 ha yr the spatial distribution of nutrient load externalities varies with the use of wetlands to determine the additional damage to hqhl caused by the reduced wetland area we determined the spatial distribution of the value of the buffer function based on the difference between the two grids this represented a spatial distribution of the externality of reclamation of wetlands due to the differences in land use and initial physical characteristics the externality of reclamation varied greatly among farmers if all of the externalities were allocated to converted areas the damage associated with the use conversion would be usd 166 ha yr assuming that the net benefits of maize could potentially reach a maximum value of usd 1883 ha yr the conversion of wetland use still appeared to be a reasonable use of resources of course the return to cost difference in use conversion depended on the marginal impact of wetland use conversions on fisheries in terms of fishery value the additional nutrient load associated with the conversion of wetland uses would result in a reduction of at least 8 usd 166 usd 1883 of the maximum sustainable yield however the loss of wetlands definitely comes at a cost so a natural problem was whether there was an alternative way that allowed us to obtain the adjustment service of the wetland at a small price the spatial distribution of externalities means that we can assess the effectiveness of alternative methods for providing the same services specifically if some change in land management measures could reduce the nutrient load then it was worth considering whether this cost effectiveness was a solution we pondered whether there was a set of payments from conversion benefits of wetland uses that brought the same benefits to the fisheries as wetlands under the premise that the amount of p fertilizer can maintain the nutrient balance in the soil 176 1 t yr upstream farmers should be provided with enough remuneration to fund their behaviour in order to change their farming methods the conversion of wetland uses has resulted in the loss of nutrient buffering functions if a payment could replace the regulatory services provided by the government the total cost of these payments would provide arable land farmers with compensation for the farmland s nutrient load buffer service with a compensation quota of usd 8 1 m yr the change area of wetland is 25 821 ha the compensation standard is usd 312 usd 2100 minus usd 1788 which would cover only 15 usd 8 1 m usd 55 28 m of the total revenue from the conversion of wetlands to crop production therefore it is theoretically feasible to implement an ecosystem service payment system that can effectively compensate for the loss of nutrient buffer function caused by the conversion of wetlands the results reveal that the proposed methodology is an available tool that can be used for sustainable development with resolving payment for ecosystem services pes amounts among different regions under social and environmental constraints by considering the ecosystem services of hqhl wetland based on nbs fu et al 2018 4 conclusion implementation of the ecosystem services approach based on nbs was aiming to enhance the sustainability management of environmental systems by reducing socio ecological risks and wetland degradation this paper described the specific modelling issue that was based on the integration of wetland nutrient retention and dynamic changes in freshwater fisheries the extent to which the change in nutrient load affects a fish stock changes depending on the initial level of nutrient load and the initial state of the ecosystem the nutrient retention function of a wetland is reversible if the area of wetlands or fish stocks increases nutrient retention will also increase when the amount of fertilizer replaces the end of stream buffer function erosion control and nutrient retention replace each other this model allowed us to estimate the value of nutrient absorption externalities resulting from the conversion of wetland uses thereby predicting the consequences of alternative wetland use conversion measures as well as distinguishing different sources of the same service although wetlands also provide many other types of ecosystem services the nutrient absorption function and its impact on commercial fisheries in lakes are probably the most important we provided the climate soil and agricultural planting conditions of the time and used the measure of this service as the minimum nutrient supply provided the approach we described may also have some value in other ecosystems where regulatory functions include similar

7067,the regulating function is the least understood but probably most valuable service provided by an ecosystem to estimate the impact of externalities on the regulating function of a wetland we modelled the interdependence between activities that affect wetland characteristics and land utilization patterns nature based solutions nbs can provide benefits for society the economy and nature the nbs solution for wetland bioremediation is proposed through a combination of ecosystem value provided by nature based or artificial arable land we constructed a model to simulate the dynamic spatial and temporal changes in the regulating function of a wetland to study the impact of agricultural and fishing activities on the functions and services of a wetland ecosystem the model was used to determine the relationship between land use change wetland range water quality and fish stocks huangqihai lake hqhl is a relatively isolated lake in an area interlaced with agriculture and pasture zones from 1973 to 2014 the shrinkage of the water area of hqhl approached 60 under the influence of humans and natural disturbances the hqhl wetland faced enormous ecological risks water pollution area reduction sharp biodiversity reduction and fish extinction the phosphorus p concentration seems to be a key factor affecting both the reed growth in the nearshore areas of the huangqihai lake wetland and the breeding of phytoplankton in the core lake water area dividing this value by the 25 821 ha of the core wetland area affected by the reclamation the cost per unit of lost fish production is usd 166 ha yr after deducting the externalities of the fishery the net sustainable income from the conversion is usd 1717 ha the spatial distribution of nutrient load externalities varies with the use of wetlands in terms of fishery value the additional nutrient load associated with the conversion of wetland uses would result in a reduction of at least 8 of the maximum sustainable yield the conversion of wetland uses resulted in the loss of nutrient buffering functions to compensate for the farmland s nutrient load buffer service the government should provide arable land farmers usd 8 1 m yr it is theoretically feasible to implement an ecosystem service payment system that can effectively compensate for the loss of nutrient buffer function caused by the conversion of wetlands the approach based on bns we described may also have value in other ecosystems where regulatory functions include similar mechanisms keywords regulating function nature based solutions optimal decision making phosphorus wetland ecosystem service huangqihai lake wetland 1 introduction a wetland ecosystem is a kind of system formed over water or wet areas wetland ecosystems have characteristics of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems which result in them having a very special ecosystem value wetland ecosystems are important sources of water large suppliers of goods and energy eco environment optimizers and collections of species resources mitsch et al 2009 wetlands supply service values of sewage treatment freshwater supply and material production such as fish and reeds through their nutrient absorption function reyers et al 2013 however the main value of wetlands in absorbing nutrients is reflected in regulating fish supply fishing and breeding are both very important in developing countries langan et al 2018 with the rapid development of aquaculture the fishing industry is shrinking worldwide myers and worm 2003 although wetlands have important implications for both fishing and breeding the modelling issues described in this paper refer to only fishing we modelled the role of wetlands in regulating the negative externalities produced by terrestrial activities on freshwater fishing we focused on the regulating functions of water purification and waste treatment services provided by wetland ecosystem services this regulating function was interpreted to provide insurance that was not to compensate for the financial loss but to ensure that the fishery could be maintained under certain conditions brown et al 2018 the value of wetland regulating functions comes from the interaction between multiple ecosystem functions and service value the property rights of wetland resources involved in the production and consumption of ecosystem services need to be clearly defined when both parties involved in the transaction have full information the transaction price of the commodity is their social opportunity cost jia et al 2018 effective regulation of services is the key to the sustainable use of wetland ecosystems with regard to the modelling of various wetland characteristics hydrologists ecologists fishery scientists and limnologists have conducted extensive research jackson et al 2013 vigerstol and aukema 2011 namaalwa et al 2013 farmer et al 2011 rodrigo et al 2018 schroder et al 2018 the inflow of terrestrial nutrients may lead to eutrophication of lakes with low nutrient levels the dynamic impacts of wetlands that are affected by nutrient loading on fisheries in open water are receiving increasing attention in many cases changes in aquatic systems resulting from changes in the nutrient loading of terrestrial economic activities are the externalities yu et al 2016 roebeling et al 2016 the research on the interaction mechanism between ecological pattern ecological process and water soil change process has attracted increasing attention ecological hydrological models have been used to reveal the relationship of dynamic changes between the intrinsic structures of wetland systems and the external environment and quantitatively evaluate the ecological environmental impact of wetland development activities mei et al 2018 based on a trading oriented mechanism zeng et al 2017 analysed the ecological effects of wetland ecosystems and found that land utilization patterns and pollution mitigation schemes could improve the ecological function of the yongnianwa wetland land based activities damage the aquatic systems of wetlands but zeng et al 2017 ignored the consequences of land based activities because the services provided by these systems are not traded on the market although people have realized that internalizing these externalities should be used to study the interaction between land based activities and aquatic systems few studies have attempted to model this problem early approaches either focused on the simple correlation between changes in watersheds and changes in fisheries or focused on identifying the impact of land based activities on fisheries worm et al 2006 laitin 2013 limnologists have studied the impact of changes in land use vegetation and fertilization patterns on freshwater ecosystems recently economists began to consider the ethical issues that arise from the interaction between lake utilization and basin resources mäler et al 2003 however few studies have attempted to model the interactions in real ecosystems or estimate the external value between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems this study modelled a specific land water interaction in hqhl in inner mongolia of north china we attempted to elaborate the impact of wetland protection on lake ecology nutrient enrichment has a positive effect on fishery production in a nutrient limited environment such as one with low or medium nutrient levels knowler and barbier 2005 however if an aquatic system becomes highly eutrophic the sustainability of total fish stocks will decline at higher nutrient levels feng et al 2017 excessive nutrients will affect fishery productivity and wetland ecosystem services through two ways changing the amount of food available and habitat quality the loss of oxygen in the water increases the natural mortality of fish sediments have an adverse effect on the fry base and may damage the eggs when both water pollution and high fishing pressures are present both effects may have serious impacts on fish stocks and fishery production whitfield 2016 nutrients are caused by nutrient inflows from agricultural land and urban sewage along lakes the nutrient load of agricultural land surrounding hqhl is derived from the use of fertilizers and livestock breeding the conversion of wetlands to other uses results in a decline in the ecological services of lakeside wetlands the land use transition matrixes showed that the increase in farmland led to the degeneration of the wetlands song et al 2010 over the past decade or so water analysis reports have shown that hqhl has gradually shifted from moderate to eutrophic the total nitrogen and total phosphorus levels in the water body are high as is the water turbidity which have degraded the water environment and caused a decrease in the number of aquatic organisms the value of wetland regulation depends not only on the land use structure in the upper basin but also on the resource utilization patterns downstream of the basin since each land user in the basin produces a degree of externality based on the physical characteristics of the land we should estimate the spatial distribution of pollution externalities to estimate the value of the wetland function based on the support function of the wetland to the fishery wetlands are important wetlands support the regulation of water quality by reducing pollutant loadings capturing and retaining pollutants and recycling nutrients as industrialization process demand for land increases and wetlands are frequently drained filled in and built upon so how we overcome these challenges nature based solutions nbs encompasses the existing concepts such as natural capital and ecosystem services in economics and landscape functions in environmental planning the criteria of nbs were found in the examples of coastal management and the restoration of floodplains hoang et al 2018 morris et al 2018 nbs could help the recovery of cognitive natural resources and wellbeing panno et al 2017 we used the agricultural nbs for improving farm productivity and smallholder livelihoods in huangqihai lake watershed peter et al 2017 using the nbs wetland restoration modelling on huangqihai lake we assessed the feasibility of human well being activities and performances in evaluating social success for ecosystem management this method can be used to determine and calculate the nutrient buffer function that results from wetland conservation or agricultural activities affecting the nutrient load of a fishery this paper is structured as follows 1 the introduction elaborating on the background and theoretical significance of the research subject in this paper 2 materials and methods with subsections on the 1 the characteristics of huangqihai lake 2 model description which is based on land use change wetland range water quality and fish stocks and 3 optimal decision making standard gordon schaefer model hamiltonian value 3 results and discussion and 4 conclusions 2 materials methods 2 1 study area huangqihai lake hqhl is a relatively isolated lake in an area interlaced with agriculture and pasture zones hqhl is a small enclosed lake in inner mongolia of china and is located in the central part of chahar youyiqianqi wulanchabu city and the geographic coordinates are 113 10 113 26 e and 40 45 41 07 n the area of the hqhl watershed is 4511 20 km2 fig 1 the huangqihai lake watershed belongs to a closed inland river basin the water source of the lake is mainly from the input of 19 rivers such as the quanyulinhe river bawanghe river and mozishanhe river the topography of huangqihai lake watershed is sloping from the north to the south and is covered by hills high plains and salt lake plains the terrain is high in the north low in the south high in the west low in the east and the elevation is average the average altitude is 1600 m the surface morphology is dominated by plains the hilly area is 848 21 km2 accounting for 18 80 of the total basin area the high plain area is 1961 89 km2 accounting for 43 49 of the total basin area the saline alkali land plain area is 1701 09 km2 accounting for 37 71 of the total basin area fig 2 the average annual precipitation in the hqhl watershed is 363 mm and the precipitation shows a decreasing trend the annual decrease is 0 81 mm fu et al 2017 the average annual evaporation of hqhl is 1200 mm and the evaporation is significantly higher than the precipitation the main water supply sources in hqhl are natural precipitation surface runoff and underground runoff and the discharge is mainly evaporation the hqhl watershed has various ecosystem types such as lake river salt marsh and shrub the hqhl wetland is 39 km long from north to south the width of the east west is 23 km and the total area is 368 23 km2 the core area of the wetland is 33 42 km2 which is covered by water diversified ecological types and native wetland ecosystems make the animal and plant resources abundant thus the hqhl wetland is the ideal site for birds amphibians and fish to inhabit and reproduce the wetland is also an important transfer station for bird migration and the biodiversity constitutes many species and gene libraries due to the unique natural environment the hqhl wetland has special ecological functions to regulate the local climate and salt alkali concentrations the hqhl wetland has rich plant species and wide ranges of hay grassland mountain shrub grassland mountain meadow grassland low humid saline alkaline grassland and farmland weeds before the 1950s a large number of reeds and bulrushes grew along hqhl the hqhl wetland has home to nomadic people for generations however after the 1970s due to the arid climate the amount of water used for industrial and agricultural purposes increased water conservancy projects were established throughout the watershed therefore the upstream water was intercepted the amount of water entering the lake decreased the water area gradually decreased and the degree of soil salinization gradually increased except for some native reeds on the northern bank of hqhl the rest of the area was replaced by typical halophytic vegetation the current plant coverage rate of huangqihai lake wetland is only 10 18 the vegetation mainly consists of low humidity saline grassland arable land and woodland see fig 3 the lake area has constantly fluctuated since the holocene but the overall trend is decreasing the wetland suffers from serious degradation caused mainly by the irrational exploitation of groundwater as well as the drying of climate change during recent decades from 1973 to 2015 the water area of hqhl shrunk from 81 92 km2 to 33 42 km2 and the shrinkage approached 60 the change in the hqhl water area from 1987 to 2014 is shown in fig 4 due to human and natural disturbances the hqhl wetland faces enormous ecological risks such as increased severity of water pollution reduction in wetland area and decreased numbers of wetland biological species after the 1990s large amounts of sediment and industrial wastewater were continuously discharged into the lake as a result the silt in the lake area continued to accumulate the bottom of the lake rose and the central area of the lake began to plateau the water quality of the lake deteriorated and the native plants were destroyed huangqihai lake which was once known as the guancun carp has almost completely died the ecosystem services functions of hqhl such as regulating floods providing biological habitats and purifying water quality have greatly decreased 2 2 model description the model was used to determine the relationship between land use change wetland range water quality and fish stocks the beneficiaries of wetland protection were downstream economic activities fisheries and the value depended on the water quality water quality affected the total productivity of the fishery the concentrations of pollutants in the water bodies were affected not only by the breadth and intensity of upstream agricultural production but also by the buffering functions such as the purification of water pollution and retaining of solid pollutants by vegetation of wetlands as the impacts of upstream activities were not reflected in market prices any gains costs brought to other economic sectors by upstream land users were ignored to estimate the impact of externalities on the regulatory function of wetlands we modelled the interdependence between activities that affected wetland characteristics and land utilization patterns in the model the areas of agricultural land la and wetland lw are summed and the sum is the watershed area l 0 in agricultural land any land of the ith hectare was fallow in production or both given β as the fallow proportion of agricultural land the soil productivity was maintained by taking turns to fallow and cultivate crops the formula is 1 l 0 l a l w i 1 n f α i β i l 0 where 0 αi 1 0 βi 1 αi and βi is the ratio of agricultural land fallow land in the ith hectare agricultural land respectively to determine the externalities of land use in the watershed we introduced a nutrient inflow function to calculate the total phosphorus tp the function described the process of phosphorus p flowing from agricultural land into wetlands in acidic soils p is tightly bound to soil particles therefore soil erosion was almost the entire source of p content in water roy and misra 2003 the nutrient inflow function was expressed as follows 2 g t i 1 α l 0 g it q it p it β it ω i where gt is the annual p loading into the wetland t yr qit is the p content 20 cm below the surface soil kg ha pit is the annual amount of p fertilizer kg ha ωi is the average rainfall mm yr t is the time scale yr the specific form of nutrient inflow function is expressed as 3 g t i 1 α l 0 s i a it β it ω i δ θ q it 1000 where ait is the annual amount of soil erosion t ha δ is the enrichment factor of p in soil θ is the density factor of the soil si is the transport ratio of sediment 0 si 1 t is the time scale yr the p content in soil depends on soil erosion planting structure of the agricultural land and dynamic changes in the soil soil dynamic changes are a simplified nutrient balance equation smaling et al 1996 the formula for calculating the p

coefficients yit is the annual grain yield on the ith ha of land t ha η is the p content in the harvested crop kg t ϕ i is the annual atmospheric deposition of p on the ith ha of land kg ha t is the time scale yr regulatory wetland functions were given according to the changes in nutrient retention a previous study used a p balance model to reflect the changes in wetland range kadlec and knight 1996a b the specific expression of the model was 5 z g t α t g t w α t g t exp 10 4 k 1 α t l 0 v where zt is the annual p loss from the wetland to the water t gt is the annual p input to the wetland t w is the nutrient loading retention per unit which is a function of the wetland area v is the volume of water flowing into the wetland m3 k is the annual p removal rate in a fixed area mol l z gt αt is the maximum nutrient amount that was lost to the water body given α t is the time scale yr the impact of nutrient loading on water was modelled according to its direct impact on the productivity of the lake fishery when the contaminant content in the water changed from a low nutrient state to a eutrophic state fishery productivity would rapidly decline this paper constructed an eco economic model of fisheries that clearly illustrated the impact of water quality simonit and perrings 2005 kasulo and perrings 2006 this paper constructed a damage function depending on nutrient load when nutrient flow and fishing occur the dynamic equation for fish stocks is 6 δ x x x t d z t j 1 n h x t e jt δ x rx t d z t x t k j 1 n q e jt x t where xt is fish stock d zt 1 is the damage function for nutrient loading zt x and h are the growth and fishing functions respectively r k q and et are the parameters of the gordon schaefer model gordon 1954 schaefer 1954 schaefer 1957 et collectively term fishing effort r k and q are constants the damage function was represented by the concentration function of chlorophyll a as follows 7 d z t w z t c w 2 z t where wt is the concentration of chlorophyll a mg m3 c is the coefficient zt is the nutrient loading the concentration changes of chlorophyll a are the result of nutrient loading inflow in the river basin until a certain level is reached nutrient loading has a positive effect on the growth of fish stocks above this level the increase in nutrient loading would lead to the loss of fish stocks therefore environmental variables could affect the growth rate of fish simonit and perrings 2005 studies have shown that the growth of alpine meadow plants is most likely to be limited by the availability of p in the soil elser et al 2007 in the huangqihai lake watershed nitrogen is a relatively limited nutrient in farmland and p concentration seems to be a key factor affecting the reed growth in the nearshore areas of the huangqihai lake wetland and the breeding of phytoplankton in the core area of lake water zhang et al 2010 we used p to represent nutrients in the paper which was appropriate 2 3 optimal decision making the modelling of decision problems takes place in a variety of ways the type of land allocation α fallow ratio β and the p fertilizer application p has an impact on downstream fisheries according to the different fisheries resource acquisition rules fishermen either maximized their profits or made the total return equal to the total cost when considering the external influence of fishing effort e and nutrient loading z on fish stocks the decision problem could be expressed as 8 m ax e t 0 j 1 n ρ t π jf x t e jt t 0 j 1 n ρ t p q e jt x t c f e jt where π jf is the profit function for the jth fisherman p is the price of fish cf is the cost of fishing ρ 1 δ t is discount factor δ is discount rate to achieve the maximum fishing profit the current hamiltonian value was defined by naz et al 2014 9 h j 1 n π jf x t e jt ρ μ t 1 x x t d z t h x t e jt the first order necessary condition is 10 h e t j 1 n π jf e jt ρ μ t 1 h e jt 0 ρ λ t 1 λ t h x t j 1 n π jf x t ρ μ t 1 x x t h x t 0 x t 1 x t r x t d z t x t k j 1 n q e jt x t 0 the solution of the system can be obtained by calculating the solution to eq 10 under the steady state and the stable solution of fish stock x yield y and fishing intensity e can be obtained when the profit is maximized table 1 table 1 supplies the steady state solution under two cases namely the open access to fisheries resources and the regulated situations table 1 also compares these results with the results of the standard gordon schaefer model without external environmental interference farmers maximize profits by

caused by the marginal changes in α β and p on the wetland revenue sector the externality value is the optimal value of the covariate variable μ and the covariate variable μ stands for the shadow value of the abandoned fish yield eq 16 shows that when the proportion of fallow area made the marginal income equal to the sum of the marginal cost of soil nutrients to the agricultural sector and the marginal cost of the fishery sector the social benefits could be maximized when the marginal benefit of increasing the nutrient balance of the soil equalled the marginal cost to the fishery sector the optimal fertilizing amount could be determined eq 16 also shows the value of the nutrient buffer function of the wetland at the given nutrient load level gt along an optimal path eq 16 implies that the marginal benefits of wetland depletion measured by the extra net income from agricultural production should be equal to the marginal cost of wetland depletion measured by the value of abandoned nutrient buffer service specifically when the nutrient influx of the wetland was given this was the value of the marginal impact of changes in wetland area to the growth of fish stocks the marginal impact of wetland area change depended on both the wetland nutrient retention effect z w w αt gt w αt and the damage associated with changes in nutrient loading d z the value of the latter depended on the state of the ecosystem if the ecosystem was initially in a low nutrient state the marginal effect of wetland depletion could be either positive or negative depending on the initial nutrient loading however when the ecosystem was at the critical point of either low or high nutrient status the marginal damage caused by changes in wetland area may be very high if the ecosystem was initially in a high nutrient state the marginal impact of further changes in wetland area on fish stocks may be small or absent the user discounted cost ρμt 1 for fish stocks depended on both the solution to the optimal fishing problem and the market price of fish as well as the allocation of access to resources the regulation method and the fish breeding target 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of phosphorus to obtain an estimate of the damage function we used the conservation of p mass model proposed by vollenweider 1969 to relate the nutrient load to the density of phytoplankton i e the concentration of chlorophyll a since there was no specific research on huangqihai lake we used the relevant literature on chlorophyll and nutrient contents in other water ecosystems to determine the model parameters prairie et al 1989 there was a positive correlation between tp and chlorophyll a in may and july and a negative correlation in september in may and july the average concentration of tp in lake water were 0 123 and 0 082 mg l respectively the tp concentration was high which promoted the growth of algae taking chlorophyll a as an example p in lake water could still meet the needs of algae growth with the algae growth the phosphorus was continuously consumed in lake water causing the tp concentration in lake water in july to be lower than may the average concentration of tp in september was 0 06 mg l which was lower than that in may and july indicating that the amount of p consumed in lake water from july to september was insufficient and the increase in chlorophyll a exacerbated the concentration decline of tp chlorophyll a was negatively correlated with tp from may to september the continuous decrease of tp concentration in lake water indicates that the tp requirement of algae growth is greater than the total amount of exogenous input and endogenous transformation p is one of the limiting nutrients for the growth and reproduction of algae in hqhl wetland we chose the general equation proposed by dilon and rigler 1974 to describe the effect of total phosphorus content in water on total phytoplankton as shown in table 2 the nutrient balance equation flowing into the lake is provided in eq 18 in addition this input was supplemented by atmospheric deposition and nutrient loading elsewhere in hqhl waters as the fertilization impact is highly sensitive to the relevant conditions in the river basin this paper discussed the marginal impact of nutrient loading per hectare of the river basin on the growth of aquatic organisms fish stocks the marginal impact of nutrient loading on the environmental variable w i e the concentration of chlorophyll a is a function of the load g wetland area and a set of parameters that describe the long term average state of hqhl i e 18 w t 0 8 10 12 g it p it β it q it ω i exp 10 4 k 1 α t l 0 v j n u s v h 1 45 where j is the long term average of atmospheric p

of the lake m s is the settling velocity of p mole l year t is the time scale yr other variables are defined above we used the geographic information system 9 2 software and a digital elevation model dem to determine the boundary of hqhl watershed and the river network based on this we calculated the amount of soil erosion and sediment transport which are the key factors in determining the nutrient load based on the soil erosion equation we obtained soil erosion raster data based on the overlay of rain erosion soil erosion length gradient and land cover factor map layers in this process the rain erosion layer is determined from the annual average rainfall map the coefficients used in this study were derived from the regression results of long term rainfall on erosive forces we determined the length gradient grid based on the dem moore and bruch 1985 soil erosion data were derived from the soil characteristics map provided by china soil database http vdb3 soil csdb cn the area of fallow land is approximately equal to the area of grassland vegetation the density of grassland vegetation can be represented by the spatial distribution of parameter β to calculate the soil erosion rate of the hqhl watershed we used the functional relationship proposed by vanoni 1975 to draw the spatial distribution grid of the sediment transport ratio str we multiplied the soil transport maps by the str and the soil erosion grid to represent the net soil erosion in the dynamic soil equation the initial value of the average p concentration in the soil was taken from field experiments in the hetao plain inner mongolia autonomous region wang et al 2010 the average content of nutrients in the soil depends on the bulk density of the surface soil we calculated the soil bulk density factor based on the bulk density data 1 30 g cm3 of the top 20 cm of soil the atmospheric deposition of p was estimated from the empirical function of the inner mongolia autonomous region and the rainfall distribution map that indicated the average annual rainfall in the hqhl wetland the agricultural production function was adapted from the maize production model in china yang et al 2017 for the huangqihai lake watershed there is no reliable estimate of p consumption some regional studies have shown that the average amount of p fertilizer applied is approximately 82 7 kg ha it has been predicted that the balance of p in the soil of huangqihai lake watershed is negative and it is no longer possible to self sustain in the long term without increasing the amount of fertilizers or changing land use and the existence of soil management measures to reduce runoff zhang et al 2008 therefore the p was chosen as the representative nutrient in the paper which affects the breeding and growth of phytoplankton in the hqhl wetland the nitrogen use efficiency of target forage species alfalfa ryegrass and oat grass was higher than 60 but p use efficiency was relatively low therefore p fertilizer was the most important input of p in these kinds of forage wei et al 2018 phytoplankton plays a key role in energy transformation to grazers and material circulation of the wetland ecosystem silva et al 2012 in winter and spring the biomass and growth rate of phytoplankton in taihu lake increased with the concentration of p in the water which suggests that the growth of phytoplankton is mainly limited by p xu et al 2010 the limiting nutrient element of phytoplankton growth was analyzed by nutrient enrichment bioassay experiment in dianshan lake the results showed that the content of phosphorus was positively correlated with the biomass of phytoplankton rmax 0 980 zhang et al 2010 cropland soil p use efficiency decreased from 0 6 in the 1960s to 0 3 at present cropland soil p balance had a positive relationship with cropland soil p inputs while soil p use efficiency followed the opposite trend there were significant correlations between amount of fertilizer and yield response p was the main limiting factor for crop yield according to the results of water quality monitoring of representative sampling points of hqhl wetland in the winter of 2012 integrated ecological protection plan of huangqihai lake in inner mongolia autonomous region 2017 the over standard rate of chemical oxygen demand cod in wetland is 100 the minimum multiple super scale level iv water quality is 1 7 and the maximum value is 3 52 the over standard rate of tn is 100 exceeding 1 73 30 3 times the over standard rate of tp is 57 14 exceeding the standard level iv water quality of 3 56 82 8 times therefore the water quality of hqhl wetland in 2012 was inferior to level v water quality the degree of eutrophication in hqhl wetland is enhanced the tn and tp are high the water body is turbid and the water environment is deteriorated therefore the aquatic organisms are reduced in the hqhl wetland chlorophyll a concentration ρchl a was positively related to phosphorus in the water of hqhl the ρchl a is low the annual average is only 2 49 mg m3 and the monthly mean value is between 1 43 and 4 11 mg m3 ρchl a is higher in july and september and relatively lower in spring to estimate the magnitude of the nutrient buffering effect of the hqhl wetlands we assumed that the amount of p fertilizer could ensure the sustainability of agriculture we estimated the impact of wetlands on nutrient uptake in the presence and absence of measures to reduce runoff the soil erosion was affected by natural and human factors the natural factors mainly included topography underlying surface conditions and soil type the human factors mainly consisted of vegetation coverage precipitation land use crop cultivation and cultivated land farming methods moreover mountainous areas have great soil erosion hong et al 2012 the hqhl watershed had a large cultivated land area therefore soil erosion was more likely due to the difference in land use the amount of fertilization needed per hectare varies depending on the natural conditions affecting soil erosion and soil use intensity βi βi affects soil erosion through land cover factors ci and affects the dynamic changes of p content in the soil this paper used the soil nutrient balance in eq 4 to determine the amount of sustainable fertilizer application for each hectare of land the result of eq 4 is an expression for p i which is a function of βi and net soil erosion or sediment production siai on the assumption that the initial soil p content per hectare of land qit 0 equalled 30 kg ha we used the grass cover and sediment production maps to divide the grid we used the raster data in arcgis to solve the equation the calculation results indicated the spatial distribution of p fertilizer application as shown in fig 5 many fertilizers and pesticides have been applied to the farmland and organophosphate pesticides accounted for 40 of the total pesticides wang 2012 the paddy fields brown soil and dry lands were mainly distributed in the hqhl watershed downstream therefore the p loading in these plains areas was higher li et al 2007 correspondingly the cities and counties with large proportions of farmland have higher tp output loading based on the values in table 2 and using the 2014 fish prices usd 1788 t and wetland core area from the initial 36 823 ha reduced to 11 002 ha we determined that the maximum sustainable yield reduction in fisheries will occur the loss will determine the extent of the impact caused by the reclamation of the wetland assuming that the amount of fertilizer pi was exactly equal to the amount of p needed to maintain the nutrient balance in the huangqihai lake watershed we can calculate the effect of the decrease in wetland area on the change in the stock market ymsyi if the wetland core area was reduced by 70 the inflow of p load in lake water would increase from 81 t to 110 t and the maximum sustainable production of fish catch would decrease from 2400 t yr to 0 with a loss of 2400 t yr and the value was usd 4 29 m dividing this value by the 25 821 ha 36 823 ha minus 11 002 ha of the core area of the wetland that are affected by the reclamation the unit cost per unit of lost fish production is usd 166 ha yr this measure of the value of wetland regulation services was used to assess the benefits of reclamation wetlands and assess the feasibility of alternative mechanisms that provide the same regulatory services if we ignored the cost of conversion the maximum potential yield of maize was 6 1 t ha yr if the price is usd 350 83 t the sustainable annual return of wetland to arable land is usd 55 28 m the reduction rate of wetlands is 70 15 which is about 25821 ha yr the grain production per hectare of cultivated land is 6 1 t the price is usd 350 83 t the total value is usd 55 28 m or usd 2140 ha yr because of the need to apply 95 kg of p per hectare which costs usd 257 ha the net sustainable income from the conversion was usd 1883 ha or usd 1717 ha after deducting the externalities of the fishery 3 2 wetland ecosystem regulating function the value of the wetland buffer function is very sensitive to both shore and coastal conditions based on topography landform soil types and land development status in the watershed the upper streams of the watershed have high vegetation coverage less farmland and low pollutant loading while the lower areas have more farmland high fertilizer application rates and high soil erosion and pollution loading yin et al 2011 in summary the spatial characteristics of p loading resulted from comprehensive effects of precipitation runoff characteristics soil properties soil erosion and vegetation coverage therefore to effectively control p loading and soil erosion in the hqhl watershed the bmps fallow measures of cultivated fields wetland vegetation restoration and soil and water conservation in the upper stream are the most important measures to implement we added up the load in the catchment and obtained a baseline phosphorus load g of 210 t yr we used the gis grid calculator grassland coverage maps phosphate fertilizer application maps and fish price data usd 1788 t to determine the spatial distribution of externalities of nutrient loads nutrient externalities ranged from 0 to usd 2100 ha yr which indicates that the externalities of the least eroded plots were almost 0 and the externalities of the most soil eroded plots were as high as usd 2100 ha yr the spatial distribution of nutrient load externalities varies with the use of wetlands to determine the additional damage to hqhl caused by the reduced wetland area we determined the spatial distribution of the value of the buffer function based on the difference between the two grids this represented a spatial distribution of the externality of reclamation of wetlands due to the differences in land use and initial physical characteristics the externality of reclamation varied greatly among farmers if all of the externalities were allocated to converted areas the damage associated with the use conversion would be usd 166 ha yr assuming that the net benefits of maize could potentially reach a maximum value of usd 1883 ha yr the conversion of wetland use still appeared to be a reasonable use of resources of course the return to cost difference in use conversion depended on the marginal impact of wetland use conversions on fisheries in terms of fishery value the additional nutrient load associated with the conversion of wetland uses would result in a reduction of at least 8 usd 166 usd 1883 of the maximum sustainable yield however the loss of wetlands definitely comes at a cost so a natural problem was whether there was an alternative way that allowed us to obtain the adjustment service of the wetland at a small price the spatial distribution of externalities means that we can assess the effectiveness of alternative methods for providing the same services specifically if some change in land management measures could reduce the nutrient load then it was worth considering whether this cost effectiveness was a solution we pondered whether there was a set of payments from conversion benefits of wetland uses that brought the same benefits to the fisheries as wetlands under the premise that the amount of p fertilizer can maintain the nutrient balance in the soil 176 1 t yr upstream farmers should be provided with enough remuneration to fund their behaviour in order to change their farming methods the conversion of wetland uses has resulted in the loss of nutrient buffering functions if a payment could replace the regulatory services provided by the government the total cost of these payments would provide arable land farmers with compensation for the farmland s nutrient load buffer service with a compensation quota of usd 8 1 m yr the change area of wetland is 25 821 ha the compensation standard is usd 312 usd 2100 minus usd 1788 which would cover only 15 usd 8 1 m usd 55 28 m of the total revenue from the conversion of wetlands to crop production therefore it is theoretically feasible to implement an ecosystem service payment system that can effectively compensate for the loss of nutrient buffer function caused by the conversion of wetlands the results reveal that the proposed methodology is an available tool that can be used for sustainable development with resolving payment for ecosystem services pes amounts among different regions under social and environmental constraints by considering the ecosystem services of hqhl wetland based on nbs fu et al 2018 4 conclusion implementation of the ecosystem services approach based on nbs was aiming to enhance the sustainability management of environmental systems by reducing socio ecological risks and wetland degradation this paper described the specific modelling issue that was based on the integration of wetland nutrient retention and dynamic changes in freshwater fisheries the extent to which the change in nutrient load affects a fish stock changes depending on the initial level of nutrient load and the initial state of the ecosystem the nutrient retention function of a wetland is reversible if the area of wetlands or fish stocks increases nutrient retention will also increase when the amount of fertilizer replaces the end of stream buffer function erosion control and nutrient retention replace each other this model allowed us to estimate the value of nutrient absorption externalities resulting from the conversion of wetland uses thereby predicting the consequences of alternative wetland use conversion measures as well as distinguishing different sources of the same service although wetlands also provide many other types of ecosystem services the nutrient absorption function and its impact on commercial fisheries in lakes are probably the most important we provided the climate soil and agricultural planting conditions of the time and used the measure of this service as the minimum nutrient supply provided the approach we described may also have some value in other ecosystems where regulatory functions include similar

7068,the atmospheric water supply and demand dynamics determine a region s potential water resources the hydrologic ratios such as aridity index evaporation ratio and runoff coefficients are useful indicators to quantify the atmospheric water dynamics at watershed to regional scales in this study we developed a modeling framework using a machine learning approach to predict hydrologic ratios for watersheds located in contiguous united states conus by utilizing a set of climate soil vegetation and topographic variables overall the proposed modeling framework is able to simulate the hydrologic ratios at watershed scale with a considerable accuracy the concept of non parametric elasticity was applied to study the potential influence of the estimated hydrologic ratios on various drought characteristics resilience vulnerability and exposure for river basins located in conus spatial sensitivity of drought indicators to hydrologic ratios suggests that an increase in hydrologic ratios may result in augmentation of magnitude of drought indicators in majority of the river basins aridity index seems to have higher influence on drought characteristics in comparison to other hydrologic ratios it was observed that the machine learning approach based on random forests algorithm can efficiently estimate the spatial distribution of hydrologic ratios provided sufficient data is available in addition to that the non parametric based elasticity approach can identify the potential influence of hydrologic ratios on spatial drought characteristics keywords hydrologic ratio drought random forest sensitivity analysis 1 introduction determining the long term natural water availability is extremely important for domestic agricultural and industrial sectors to develop policy and decision makings at local to regional scale vorosmarty et al 2000 gleick 2003 biswas 2004 veettil and mishra 2016 this long term natural availability of water resources is mostly dependent on the regional atmospheric dynamics controlled by precipitation streamflow and evapotranspiration oki and kanae 2006 arnell 1999 huntington 2006 therefore spatial variability in these hydro climate variables might lead to regional alterations in the supply and demand of water resources availability these changes may influence the resilience vulnerability and exposure of hydrologic extreme events in any given river basin cook et al 2004 in addition the degree of influence with which these variables might affect the drought indicators can vary spatially within a river basin van loon et al 2014 mishra and singh 2011 therefore quantifying the potential influence of hydro climatic variables on extreme events are crucial to improve water resources management in a river basin the atmospheric water balance can be quantified using several metrics among them the aridity index evaporation ratio and runoff coefficient received a lot of interest due to their ability to capture the dynamics of the hydrologic cycle schaake et al 2006 aridity index ai defined as the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation which represents the atmospheric potential water availability over atmospheric water demand this definition of ai is widely accepted for characterizing climate boundaries maestre et al 2012 in addition to investigating the degree of aridity across the world nastos et al 2013 also the aridity index was used to assess the effects of climate change on runoff vegetation and desertification sawicz et al 2011 therefore ai serves to identify and locate regions that suffer from available water deficit the runoff coefficient rc is defined based on the ratio between the annual runoff and the annual rainfall and it can be a very good indicator to study the degree of moisture recycling as well as water holding capacity in a given area savenije 1996 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 by using rc it is possible to investigate the role of canopy architecture leaf characteristics and biomass in controlling the runoff within the catchment muzylo et al 2009 rao et al 2011 ferreira et al 2016 similar to r index yao 1974 we calculated the relative evaporation ratio er that is defined as the ratio between actual evapotranspiration aet to potential evapotranspiration pet in addition these three indices can formulate useful metrics for hydrologic ratios schaake et al 2006 and it forms the basis for budyko hypothesis which is a widely used framework to examine energy and water fluxes at watersheds budyko 1974 in regions where high quality long term observations are scarce these hydrologic ratios can be quantified using land surface models however these models are subject to uncertainties from inputs simplification and parameterization ek et al 2003 li et al 2011 further these models can be computationally expensive often requiring high performance computing when running models over larger areas and may limit a comprehensive assessment of uncertainty in forcing data or climate change scenarios bosshard et al 2013 elsner et al 2014 in order to overcome such limitations statistical models which require a limited number of input variables can be used as an alternative tool to investigate spatial characteristics of surface hydroclimate processes schneider 1996 mccabe and wolock 2011 abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 previous studies have established that statistical models have potential to predict spatio temporal hydrologic processes based on a set of controlling factors abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 deshmukh and singh 2016 van loon and laaha 2015 among them random forest rf approach is one of the most popular and powerfulmachine learning algorithms that are built based on the principle of various combinations of classification and regressions trees breiman 2001 the rf algorithm is a natural and non linear modelling tool that provides estimates regarding the hierarchy of variables in the classification and thus it can estimate individual variable s contribution to the spatial distribution of hydrologic ratios in hydrology the rf algorithm has been applied to eco hydrological distribution modeling peters et al 2007 prediction of natural flow regimes carlisle et al 2010 and groundwater mapping naghibi et al 2016 a great deal of theoretical and empirical studies have detailed the advantages of rf which includes high forecast accuracy acceptable tolerance to outliers and noise and easy avoidance of over fitting problems therefore rf model can be applied to spatial prediction and for rectifying multi variable and non linear issues among the hydrologic extreme events droughts are known to have impacts on multiple sectors such as domestic agriculture energy production and fishery mishra and singh 2010 droughts usually span over large geographical areas and often last for months to years representing a dominant three dimensional latitude longitude and time space time structure unlike other hydrologic extreme events lloyd hughes 2012 konapala and mishra 2017 in addition climate models have projected an increase in future drought severity and duration over continental usa wehner et al 2011 konapala and mishra 2017 therefore investigating the potential influence of hydrologic ratios on drought characteristics can further improve our understanding on identifying critical sensitive areas leading to superior drought management strategies as a result we determine the various characteristics of droughts using the concepts of resilience exposure vulnerability and duration estimation of these values at a catchment scale can help water resources managers to develop tools for studying catchment s vulnerability to droughts ability to recover resilience frequency and its exposure to drought conditions the overall goal of this study is to i develop a random forest model that can spatially predict the hydrologic ratios based on a set of geospatial climate vegetation and topographic variables and ii to evaluate the potential influence of estimated hydrological ratios on spatial drought characteristics for river basins located in conus through this work we also investigated the dominant factors responsible for the spatial distributions of hydrologic ratios to achieve the objectives the data sources and the adopted statistical methodology are explained in section 2 in section 3 the various features of the calibrated random forest model and sensitivity of drought characteristics are discussed finally the conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 study area data and methodology 2 1 data description to address our objectives the datasets are collected from multiple sources we first describe the data that used for building rf model majority of the data for building rf model was obtained from model parameter estimation experiment mopex basin the watersheds considered in mopex are considered to have minimum human interference schaake et al 2006 the dataset covers a wide range of climate soil and vegetation characteristics for conus the watershed characteristics table 1 of 438 mopex basins distributed over the conus are acquired from the following sources the mean annual precipitation and temperature data is processed from the national weather service river forecast system nwsrfs the nwsrfs uses interpolation method based on inverse distance algorithm of prism schaake et al 2006 daly et al 1994 data set using the climatology of 1961 1990 within the mopex basins watershed s physical characteristics is derived using the digital elevation model dem obtained from the national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc vegetation type was obtained from the university of maryland land cover database porosity is derived from statgo soils information database and ndvi is derived from modis dataset https lpdaac usgs gov the spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation the hydrological ratios ndvi and mean annual potential evapotranspiration across the mopex basins are illustrated in fig 1 more information about the data sources can be found in schaake et al 2006 the watershed slope and available water content awc are derived from national gap analysis program and statgo database respectively the selected variables table 1 for the watersheds across conus are collected and aggregated from various sources the pearson s correlation coefficients between geospatial variables watershed characteristics and hydrologic ratios table 1 for the 438 mopex basins distributed over the conus suggests possible relationship positive negative between them the usgs defined watersheds hydrologic unit code huc 8 and major river basins huc 2 are obtained from usgs watershed boundary dataset https nhd usgs gov wbd html the spatial distribution of major river basins is illustrated in fig 2 the mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are obtained and aggregated from prism dataset http www prism oregonstate edu the ndvi over all the watersheds of conus are obtained from modis ndvi dataset the spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and ndvi over the selected watersheds of conus are shown in fig 3 for estimating drought characteristics we used standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei dataset developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 and available at speibase v 2 5 http spei csic es database html spei is an extension to the widely used standardized precipitation index spi however unlike spi the spei takes into account both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet and thus captures the impact of increased temperature on water demand vicente serrano et al 2010 in addition to that spei can also be computed at different time scales facilitating its usage for drought impacts on various water resources needs mishra and singh 2010 2011 therefore in this study we utilize the 3 month spei for seasonal scale drought characteristics 2 2 random forest rf model the rf modeling approach uses classification and regression trees as building blocks to derive effective prediction models james et al 2013 unlike the other tree based methods rf increases diversity among the classification trees by resampling data and randomly changing the predictive variable sets for different tree induction processes therefore the key parameters for rf models are the number of trees and predictors used to determine the split at each node vorpahl et al 2012 here the random forest rf breiman 2001 model was first developed based on the mopex watersheds then the model was applied to predict the hydrological ratios of huc8 watersheds fig 4 illustrates the steps used to develop rf prediction model for hydrologic ratios for watersheds in conus as shown in the flowchart both response and predictor variables of mopex dataset divided into 2 separate groups i e training and testing the splitting of data set into training and testing data set is based on two conditions a does the dataset training and testing large enough to yield statistically meaningful results and b does the dataset is a representative of whole therefore split between training and testing may vary in each study for example bachmair et al 2016 applied rf modeling approach for predicting the drought impacts of each drought indicator by splitting the train and test data to 90 10 whereas rahmati et al 2016 split the train and test data to 70 30 for mapping the groundwater potential over the mehran region located in the northern part of iran similarly our study also showed an acceptable result for splitting the mpex datasets to 70 testing data and 30 testing data in terms of correlation coefficient r and mse here the response variables are hydrologic ratios and the predictor variables are geospatial variables that are listed in table 1 during the training phase we utilized 500 trees derived from 500 bootstrapped data sets to build random forest model then based on each bootstrapped sample 500 regression trees are constructed split points of these regression trees were chosen from a random subset of all available predictor variables then we averaged the resulting 500 predictions generated from individual regression tree the individual tree may have higher variance therefore by averaging these 500 trees likely to reduce the overall variance thus rf modeling approach has potential to improve prediction simulation accuracy by combining hundreds of trees into a single procedure james et al 2013 finally we predicted the hydrologic ratios by applying the rf algorithm and validated with 30 data which was not included in the model development the random forest model used in this study was built using the randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 in the r software project r core team 2014 subsequently the model prediction accuracy was evaluated based on mean square error mse james et al 2013 and strength of correlation r between the predicted and observed hydrological ratios in the second phase of the analysis we applied the calibrated rf model to predict hydrological ratios over the conus by using the predictors aggregated at huc 8 level watershed scale 2 3 drought resilience vulnerability exposure and frequency we evaluated the watershed s drought conditions based on the concepts of resilience vulnerability exposure and frequency these concepts hashimoto et al 1982 loucks and van beek 2017 are widely used in the water resources systems loucks and van beek 2017 asefa et al 2014 brown and williams 2015 ayyub 2014 in this study we applied these concepts to characterize droughts in any given watershed for illustration purpose we develop a hypothetical example based on spei 03 as drought indicator for a period of 24 months shown in fig 6 in this study we consider that the drought condition likely to be prevalent in a watershed if the spei 03 value is below 1 for a period more than 2 months however selection of these thresholds can vary depending on the research interest and stakeholders need therefore the hypothetical scenario exhibits two instances of the water shortage ranging for a period of 3 and 5 months in the following text we illustrate these drought indicators based on the example provided in fig 5 2 3 1 drought resilience drought resilience re can be defined as the ability of a watershed to recover from water shortage to water availability state hoque et al 2016 loucks and van beek 2017 sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 in our case we defined re based on a temporal scale as adopted previously by maity et al 2012 and sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 as a result we express drought resilience re as the inverse of average drought duration given by eq 1 1 re m i 1 m d d i where m is the number of events and dd is the drought duration in our hypothetical scenario fig 5 we can observe that m 2 and i 1 m d d i 3 5 indicating that re is 0 4 months as evident from the formulation it can be seen that higher is the average drought duration lesser will be resilient of a watershed to droughts therefore high values of re indicates that the watersheds are more resilient to drought 2 3 2 vulnerability drought vulnerability vu can be defined as the average depletion of available water due to drought in our case the drought vulnerability is measured based on the magnitude of spei during the drought event sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 therefore in the present study we estimated the drought vulnerability of each watershed as sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 2 vu spei 1 spei m in the context of our hypothetical example fig 5 drought vulnerability is given by 2 2 2 6 1 9 2 1 2 9 2 5 2 1 2 2 higher value of vu indicates that the watershed exhibits higher degree of vulnerability to droughts 2 3 3 exposure drought exposure ex can be defined as the relative amount of time the watershed is exposed to drought conditions liu et al 2013 in this case we define this phenomenon based on temporal scale and as a result ex is calculated as the ratio between total time periods liu et al 2013 a watershed is undergoing drought to the total duration of the study period it can be estimated as 3 ex i 1 m d d i td where td represents the total number of months in the study period therefore in context of fig 5 drought exposure can be estimated as 3 5 24 as evident from the formulation higher values of ex represent high degree of drought exposure in the watersheds 2 3 4 drought frequency the drought frequency fr can be defined as the number of occurrences of drought event exceeding a certain threshold per unit time blenkinsop and fowler 2007 spinoni et al 2014 in our case we expressed drought frequency on a yearly scale given by the total number of qualifying drought events spei 1 and dd 2 months divided by the total number years as 4 fr m n where n is the number of years considered in this study and m is the number of drought events with spei03 value below 1 simultaneously for a period more than 2 months therefore for the case of fig 5 drought frequency is estimated as 2 2 indicating the frequency as a single drought event per year in this study spei 03 was used as drought index to calculate drought resilience vulnerability exposure and frequency for conus at a spatial resolution of 0 50 0 50 for the period of 1961 1990 we aggregated these gridded values to generate information for individual watersheds the spatial distribution of re vu ex and fr for the major river basins are shown in fig 6 2 4 sensitivity analysis between drought characteristics and hydrologic ratios to quantify the spatial response of the estimated drought indicators to hydrologic ratios we utilized the concept of non parametric sensitivity introduced by sankarasubramanian et al 2001 this approach is useful to quantify the relative change in one variable may affect the other variable this sensitivity konapala and mishra 2016 ahiablame et al 2017 can be expressed as 5 φ m e d i a n y i f y f x i f x f x f y f where x ai e r r c and y re e x v u f r f can be any one of the selected major river basins and i is the i th watershed belonging to the river basin f whereas y and x represents the spatial mean of x and y variables within the watersheds in a given river basin f the value φ represents the spatial variation in drought characteristics with respect to the change in hydrologic ratio of watersheds within a river basin in addition the φ value also indicates the degree of spatial influence of the hydrologic ratios on drought characteristics within a river basin the higher value of φ for a river basin indicates that the drought characteristics of watersheds in the river basin are highly sensitive to the hydrologic ratios another advantage of this approach is that it distinguishes between positive and negative sensitivities for instance a positive φ value in case of aridity index and resilience indicate that an increase in aridity index may result in increase in resilience over the river basin whereas a negative φ value indicates that an increase in aridity index might result in decrease in drought resilience therefore this approach is found to be suitable for assessing the spatial influence of hydrologic ratios on drought properties within a river basin then the statistical significance of φ was evaluated with a bootstrap approach as mentioned in konapala and mishra 2016 by considering 999 samples only the φ values with p values less than 0 05 are considered in this analysis 3 results 3 1 evaluation of random forest model as a first step we evaluated the performance of random forest rf model to predict hydrologic ratios ai er and rc over the mopex basins the scatter plot between observed and predicted hydrologic ratios are provided in fig 7 the random forest model for predicting ai rf ai have a pearson correlation value of 0 81 and an mse of 0 07 whereas the rf model for er rf er shows a pearson correlation value of 0 9 and mse of 0 002 and the rf model for rc rf rc shows a pearson correlation of 0 91 and mse of 0 007 even though all these models were able to replicate the index values with a considerable accuracy the rf rc model performs the best among the three models in case of rf ai and rf er models the annual mean precipitation annual mean potential evapotranspiration ndvi and percentage of forest cover were the most important variables in predicting the ai and er across the watersheds of usa whereas in case of rf rc model standard deviation of potential evapotranspiration also played an important role in predicting the rc in rf ai model the ai values greater than 2 are less accurately predicted whereas the ai values from 0 5 to 2 are more accurately predicted as a result the model might not accurately represent the humid conditions in case of rf er model the values which are at the lower end i e 0 3 to 0 6 are less accurately predicted compared to the values in the range of 0 6 to 0 9 finally in case of rf rc model the predicted values greater than 0 5 witness higher uncertainty 3 2 spatial pattern of modeled aridity index across the major river basins the calibrated rf models are applied to predict the hydrologic ratios at huc 8 level watersheds in general huc 8 maps the sub basin level similar to medium sized river basins about 2200 nationwide fig 8 a illustrates the spatial distribution of aridity index for the conus the unep 1992 classified the aridity index climatic zone to hyper arid 0 05 arid 0 05 0 20 semi arid 0 20 0 50 sub humid 0 50 0 65 and humid 0 65 zones nastos et al 2013 based on our analysis it was observed that most of the watershed were located in semi arid sub humid or humid and none of these watersheds depicted either hyper arid or arid climatic zone as classified by the unep 1992 the ai values for the eastern river basins were relatively higher and homogeneous in nature for example in south atlantic river basin the ai values range from 0 9 to 1 5 with a coefficient of variation cv of 11 where the mean annual precipitation was also homogeneous throughout the watersheds the lower mississippi river basin located in southeastern conus showed minimum cv 5 in terms of predicted ai values with the values range from 1 05 to 1 6 whereas for the great lake river basin located in the northeast of the conus exhibited maximum cv 14 however unlike the eastern river basins the central river basins showed more diverse distribution of the ai values for instance the missouri river basin arkansas white red region and texas gulf region showed an ai value range of 0 39 0 91 0 43 1 29 and 0 53 1 32 respectively however as we go from east to west the indices value further reduced and the spatial pattern of ai becomes more heterogeneous in nature sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 majority of the watersheds in the southwestern united states are classified as dry hence their ai is less than 0 65 except few watersheds located in the california river basin unlike the watersheds in the southwestern usa the pacific northwest river basin showed high values of ai possibly due to the frontal weather systems arising from the pacific ocean and the cascade mountains schillinger et al 2010 it was observed that within the pacific northwest river basin the ai values range from 0 38 to 2 9 with a cv of 72 this observed variability in ai may be associated with spatial variability in precipitation in the pacific northwest river basin bracken et al 2015 where the annual precipitation ranges from 87 mm to 3300 mm the increase in temperature leads to increased evapotranspiration and lower ai values proedrou et al 1997 feidas et al 2004 philandras et al 2008 in many watersheds the maximum pet was observed in the watersheds located in the southwestern river basins for instance california and lower colorado river basins have number of watersheds with a higher pet which may lead the watersheds of these river basins to lower aridity values however the spatial distribution of pet was more heterogeneous compared to the precipitation pattern the mean annual normalized vegetation index ndvi is one of the important variables influencing the ai over the major river basins similar to the mean annual precipitation the spatial distribution of ndvi was homogenous across the river basins of eastern usa we also noticed that the correlation between ndvi and ai was comparatively less in the eastern united states where the majority of the land cover is dominated by forest cover nlcd 2011 whereas the ndvi for the western river basins showed high correlation with the aridity values e g pacific northwest river basin california region great basin region which suggests that ndvi has major role in controlling the ai in most of the watersheds located in western usa however the result from the rf model suggests that the relationship between watershed slope and awc are weak with ai indicating that topography and soil characteristics have relatively less role in governing the ai across the watersheds 3 3 spatial pattern of modeled evaporation ratio across the major river basins a higher value of relative evaporation ratio er indicates that the region has optimum water that is necessary for the vegetation the fig 8 b illustrates the modeled er based on rf modeling for the conus the er values vary from 0 33 to 0 86 with a cv of 28 over the watersheds located in conus similar to the ai the er values for the eastern river basins were relatively higher and homogeneous in nature for example the er values of the new england river basin mid and south atlantic river basins range from 0 63 to 0 77 0 56 0 76 and 0 63 0 82 respectively in addition to that the er values typically follows the spatial pattern of mean annual precipitation whereas the river basins located in the central united states exhibits relatively high variability of er for instance the missouri river basin arkansas white red region and texas gulf region showed a cv of 24 27 and 23 respectively in contrast to ai the spatial distribution of er values were more homogenous throughout the southwestern river basins e g lower colorado and rio grande region the southwestern river basins exhibited lower range of er values however unlike the lower colorado and rio grande region the er value for california river basin range from 0 3 to 0 75 similar to the ai the pacific northwest river basin depicted high variation of er values with a cv of 33 the major contributing variables for estimating er in the rf model were mean annual precipitation pet and vegetation cover the percentage of forest cover also showed a better relationship with the er in the random forest modeling overall the combination of minimum precipitation higher pet and less vegetation growth may attribute to the lower er in the southwestern parts of the conus the land cover has a strong influence on er liu et al 2017 therefore the role of land use pattern in defining er of a river basin is analyzed for instance tennessee river basin and ohio river basins located in the eastern usa has forest land cover of 58 and 48 showed relatively less variation of er throughout the basins whereas for the western usa where the forest cover is comparatively less exhibited higher variation in er although the er of a region also depends upon crop type stage of growth soil moisture health of plants and cultivation practices ayars and hanson 2014 we did not include all these variables in rf model due to limitation in available data overall it was observed that rf modeling framework is appropriate for predicting the er at a regional or watershed scale 3 4 spatial pattern of modeled runoff coefficient across the major river basins the spatial distribution of runoff coefficient rc across the continental usa is illustrated in fig 8 c similar to ai and er the river basins located in eastern conus witnessed a homogenous distribution of rc sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 comparatively with a higher magnitude chang et al 2014 varies from 0 1 to 0 54 however unlike the other eastern river basins the great lake river basin of northeastern usa exhibited high variation of rc river basins located in central usa i e missouri river basin arkansas river basin and texas gulf region showed more diverse pattern of rc across the watersheds in contrast to the ai values the spatial pattern of rc was more homogeneous across the southwestern e g lower colorado river basin and midwestern e g great basin region river basins for example lower colorado river basin showed a cv of 8 and great basin region showed a cv of 16 whereas in california river basin the rc varies from 0 07 to 0 52 with a cv of 66 similar to the result presented by chang et al 2014 we also observed that pacific northwest river basin watersheds exhibited the high values of rc among the conus watersheds where the rc was ranging from 0 04 to 0 54 possibly due to the spatial variability in precipitation mean annual precipitation mean annual pet and ndvi were the important variables which control the spatial pattern of runoff coefficient across the conus watersheds as we mentioned the range of ndvi was comparatively lesser in western united states but it showed higher correlation with rc for instance the correlation between ndvi and runoff coefficient in pacific northwest basin was 0 81 which is comparatively higher than the river basins of eastern usa therefore in the random forest modeling the ndvi may have a significant role in predicting the rc over western river basins overall the spatial analysis of ai er and rc showed distinct spatial pattern across the watersheds of conus chang et al 2014 sawicz et al 2011 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 we also noticed that basins with low hydrologic ratios typically have higher cv e g pacific northwest and california region on the other hand basins with higher hydrologic ratios depicted low cv e g south atlantic gulf region and lower mississippi region 3 5 sensitivity of drought indicators to hydrologic ratios fig 9 illustrates the spatial pattern of sensitivity of various drought characteristics to ai in the major river basins of conus the basins in grey color are not statistically significant in nature fig 9 a indicates sensitivity of drought resilience to ai value the sensitivity of northeast great lakes region and north central souris red rainy region regions showed a positive sensitivity with great lakes region and souris red rainy region exhibiting around 111 and 16 of increase in drought resilience it indicates that within the river basin an increase in ai of watersheds would result in increase of drought resilience of these watersheds we also noticed that the great lakes region has the high positive sensitivity value to the aridity index whereas the tennessee lower and upper mississippi river basins showed a decrease in drought resilience with respect to aridity index the tennessee river basin showed a decrease of 53 and lower mississippi river basin showed a decrease of 34 in the western part of usa the only region that is significantly sensitive to ai is upper colorado river basin where it showed a negative sensitivity value of 19 this indicates that in those river basins an increase in ai values in watersheds are accompanied by an increase of drought resilience also it is interesting to note that the observed magnitude of positive sensitivity is more than the observed magnitude of negative sensitivity therefore it may indicate that in the basins where humidity increases due to precipitation drought resilience also increases sherwood and fu 2014 in case of sensitivity of drought vulnerability to ai fig 9 b we can see that all the north eastern river basins exhibit a positive sensitivity except the new england region among them the great lakes region has a high sensitivity of around 50 and the mid atlantic region has a low sensitivity of around 11 california region seems to be more sensitive than all the river basins in the conus region whereas the rio grande and souris red rainy region exhibit negative sensitivity values of 28 and 16 respectively in case of drought vulnerability too the observed magnitude of positive sensitivity is more than the observed magnitude of negative sensitivity therefore the similar conclusion of basins where ai value increases prone to increased drought vulnerability may be implied in case of sensitivity of drought frequency to ai fig 9 c the northeastern river basins are considerably more sensitive than the other regions the great lakes river basin and new england river basin exhibits the high positive sensitivity whereas the river basins in southeast showed comparatively low but negative and significant sensitivities the california river basin western usa and arkansas river basin of central usa also showed a negative sensitivity of almost 10 the spatial sensitivity of drought frequency also showed that more number of river basins 13 in total are sensitive to aridity index in this case also we can see that the river basins exhibiting positive sensitivity values are more in number than the negative sensitivity values also as in the case of other drought indicators in the northeastern region the number of drought events is positively sensitive to aridity index among them the great lakes river basin has the highest positive sensitivity of more than 100 whereas the pacific northwest region has the least positive sensitivity of 12 in addition it is interesting to see that the drought frequency in the rio grande and lower colorado river basins were moderately sensitive 38 and 22 respectively to ai overall we can see that the drought indicators are more positively sensitive to ai value than negatively finally in case of sensitivity of drought exposure to ai fig 9 d all the eastern river basins except new england are sensitive among them the south atlantic and tennessee river basin exhibits the high negative sensitivity whereas the river basins in western usa showed comparatively low but positive and significant sensitivities e g pacific north west upper and lower colorado river basins as in the case of re vu and fr drought exposure ex also showed more number of positively sensitive river basins across the conus fig 10 illustrates the spatial pattern of sensitivity of various drought indicators to er of watersheds in major river basins of conus region compared to ai we can see that in general drought characteristics in more number of river basins are sensitive to er among the observed positive sensitivities great basin region showed the highest sensitivity followed by great lakes region whereas in case of negative sensitivities lower mississippi and ohio river region has high negative sensitivities and upper and lower colorado exhibits moderate sensitivities overall it can be observed that in these river basins an increase in er would lead to increase in drought resilience in case of drought vulnerability fig 10 b we can see that the ohio and lower mississippi river basins has the higher positive sensitivity followed by tennessee and great basin region whereas in case of negative sensitivities pacific northwest river basin has the higher negative magnitude followed by north atlantic river basin in addition to that the rio grande and texas gulf region has negative sensitivity values whereas in case of frequency 13 river basins found to be significantly sensitive to er however in the case of sensitivity of drought frequency to er fig 10 c eastern river basins have shown statistically significant sensitivity values among them great lakes river basin has the highest sensitivity value whereas the least sensitivity is observed in pacific northwestern river basin finally the sensitivity of er fig 10 d to drought exposure ex has relatively higher number of river basins 16 out of 18 river basins among them the north eastern river basins witness higher magnitudes of sensitivities both positive and negative in comparison to the western river basins among them the ohio river basin and upper mississippi river basin exhibit higher positive sensitivity values followed by the lower mississippi region whereas the lower atlantic and tennessee river basin exhibit higher negative sensitivity values fig 11 illustrates the spatial pattern of sensitivity of various drought indicators to rc of watersheds in major river basins of conus in case of drought resilience fig 11 a great lakes river basin is the only basin exhibiting positive sensitivity to rc whereas the lower mississippi and tennessee river basins are negatively sensitive in the western conus region the upper and lower colorado region along with the great river basin also exhibit negative sensitivity in case of vulnerability fig 11 b the arkansas river basin shows a negative sensitivity to rc whereas the lower mississippi ohio and tennessee river basins exhibit positive sensitivity followed by upper colorado and great basins but the great lakes region is shown to have less magnitude positive sensitivity in case of frequency fig 11 c overall 11 river basins have shown sensitivity to rc including arkansas and great lakes river basins exhibiting negative sensitive values whereas the north eastern river basins along with lower mississippi river basin have high positive sensitivity values in case of drought exposure fig 11 d the northeastern river basins witness positive sensitivity with new england river basin showing the higher sensitivity whereas in southern atlantic and tennessee river basin have positive sensitivities as a result in general we can say that an increase in hydrologic ratios would cause an increase in the magnitude of drought indicators however the spatial sensitivities are not as prominent as in the case of temporal sensitivities in general aridity index is calculated as a ratio of the long term average annual precipitation to the long term average annual evapotranspiration whereas drought event is characterized by abnormally dry weather conditions sufficiently long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance for a specific geographic location a drought event may extend for a season a year or several years mishra and singh 2010 schneider 1996 this indicates that aridity is permanent while drought is temporary in other words while the increase in aridity less humid may refer to the background climatology of the geographic location however it may not necessarily signify drought sherwood and fu 2014 li et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 in addition the less humid area may have less influence of aridity on water availability gudmundsson et al 2016 therefore a change in the aridity index may cause either positive or negative sensitivity over the river basins considered in this study also zarch et al 2015 suggested that for a long term record of datasets an increasing trend of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration may lead to a decrease in aridity index in the present study we quantify drought across the continental usa by using spei 3 accumulation period of 3 months the temporal scale of aridity index is considered as the long term annual average and temporal scale of drought is considered as the long term average of spei 3 this may lead the correlation between the spei drought and hydrologic ratios over the river basin to lesser values in our analysis in addition the snow cover of the watersheds are not considered in this study the snow cover can form potential long term moisture storage in a watershed in the form of snow ice arora 2002 this may influence the assumption that the hydrologic ratios ai er and rc are prominently controlled by the evapotranspiration precipitation and surface runoff especially in the western and northern watersheds this analysis is based on the natural environment therefore any discrepancy can be attributed to the neglecting human factors in the analysis it was observed that the increase in hydrologic ratios may cause an increase in the severity of drought indicators in majority of the river basins among the considered hydrologic ratios relative evaporation ratio was found out to be more sensitive in influencing the drought indicators of most of the basin drought indicators of northeast river basins especially the great lake region is more prone to sensitivity due to the spatial change in hydrologic ratios whereas the missouri river basin seems to be least sensitive drought region to all the hydrologic ratios the magnitude of drought vulnerability frequency and exposure showed a positive relation with the runoff coefficient across the majority of the river basins indicating that drought severity in watersheds of these river basins are increasing with runoff coefficient similarly in case of aridity index majority of the river basins showed positive relation with the drought indicators representing that precipitation may have more control over drought indicators than potential evapotranspiration 4 conclusion in this study we utilize random forest model to predict the spatial pattern of hydrologic ratios which includes aridity index ai relative evaporation ratio er and runoff coefficient rc for the watersheds located in continental united states the developed statistical modeling framework incorporates a set of geospatial climate soil vegetation and topographic variables for predicting these hydrologic ratios conceptually our results agree with the previous research that investigated the spatial distribution of long term natural water availability over the conus chang et al 2014 moreover the variables used for modeling the hydrologic ratios are widely available therefore the proposed statistical model can be expanded to any part of the world to investigate and improve the quantification of water availability and related water scarcity however there is room for further enhancement for instance i anthropogenic interventions e g reservoir operation irrigation water use are excluded for explaining the hydrologic ratios the addition of such anthropogenic variables can significantly improve prediction of runoff coefficient ii quantification of groundwater contribution to the hydrologic ratio might improve the model prediction and iii the proposed model may have limited potential to capture hydrologic ratios in regions with higher landscape disturbance such as agricultural land as well as a result of increase in urban sprawl abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 hamel and guswa 2015 overall the proposed random forest prediction framework can be used for analyzing the distribution and variation of hydrologic ratios within the major river basins of conus the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a the watersheds located in the pacific northwest river basin showed maximum value of aridity index however within the pacific northwest river basin the aridity index values can vary from 0 38 to 2 9 with a coefficient of variation of 72 b important variables used in rf model for quantifying the relative evaporation ratio includes mean annual precipitation mean annual pet and vegetation cover additionally the combination of minimum precipitation higher pet and less vegetation cover may attribute to low relative evaporation ratio the spatial distribution of evaporation ratio was more homogenous throughout the southwestern river basins e g lower colorado and rio grande region c the spatial pattern of runoff coefficient was homogeneous across the eastern e g mid atlantic tennessee river basins southwestern e g lower colorado river basin and mid western e g great basin region river basins moreover the influence of vegetation ndvi on runoff coefficient was clearly visible in the western river basins of conus e g pacific northwest river basin california river basin d overall the spatial analysis of hydrologic ratios showed distinct spatial pattern across the watersheds of the conus additionally basins with low hydrologic ratios typically have high cv e g pacific northwest and california region and on the other hand basins with high hydrologic ratios depicted low cv e g south atlantic gulf region and lower mississippi region e the sensitivity of drought indicators to the hydrologic ratios for the 18 major river basins was also investigated the sensitivity analysis can inform the change in drought indicators such as resilience vulnerability frequency and exposure with respect to the spatial change in hydrologic ratios it was observed that the hydrologic ratios are considerably sensitive to drought characteristics in majority of the river basins among the considered hydrologic ratios relative evaporation ratio seems to be more sensitive to influence the drought indicators of most of the basin drought indicators of northeast river basins especially the great lake region is more sensitive to the spatial change in hydrologic ratios whereas the missouri river basin seems to be least sensitive to all the hydrologic ratios the addition of anthropogenic factors wan et al 2017 2018 such as land use change water demand and reservoir operation may improve the analysis specifically for evaluating the response of drought to hydrologic ratios for instance changes in land use and land cover affect local and regional climate process and related hydrologic ratios it may lead to variation of sensitivity of drought to hydrologic ratios with in a river basin future investigation is necessary for the better understanding of the effect of climate change projection on hydrologic ratios and related sensitivity on drought indicators and consideration of groundwater and snow related variables may improve the quantification of hydrologic ratios across the watersheds of continental usa acknowledgement this study was supported by the national science

7068,the atmospheric water supply and demand dynamics determine a region s potential water resources the hydrologic ratios such as aridity index evaporation ratio and runoff coefficients are useful indicators to quantify the atmospheric water dynamics at watershed to regional scales in this study we developed a modeling framework using a machine learning approach to predict hydrologic ratios for watersheds located in contiguous united states conus by utilizing a set of climate soil vegetation and topographic variables overall the proposed modeling framework is able to simulate the hydrologic ratios at watershed scale with a considerable accuracy the concept of non parametric elasticity was applied to study the potential influence of the estimated hydrologic ratios on various drought characteristics resilience vulnerability and exposure for river basins located in conus spatial sensitivity of drought indicators to hydrologic ratios suggests that an increase in hydrologic ratios may result in augmentation of magnitude of drought indicators in majority of the river basins aridity index seems to have higher influence on drought characteristics in comparison to other hydrologic ratios it was observed that the machine learning approach based on random forests algorithm can efficiently estimate the spatial distribution of hydrologic ratios provided sufficient data is available in addition to that the non parametric based elasticity approach can identify the potential influence of hydrologic ratios on spatial drought characteristics keywords hydrologic ratio drought random forest sensitivity analysis 1 introduction determining the long term natural water availability is extremely important for domestic agricultural and industrial sectors to develop policy and decision makings at local to regional scale vorosmarty et al 2000 gleick 2003 biswas 2004 veettil and mishra 2016 this long term natural availability of water resources is mostly dependent on the regional atmospheric dynamics controlled by precipitation streamflow and evapotranspiration oki and kanae 2006 arnell 1999 huntington 2006 therefore spatial variability in these hydro climate variables might lead to regional alterations in the supply and demand of water resources availability these changes may influence the resilience vulnerability and exposure of hydrologic extreme events in any given river basin cook et al 2004 in addition the degree of influence with which these variables might affect the drought indicators can vary spatially within a river basin van loon et al 2014 mishra and singh 2011 therefore quantifying the potential influence of hydro climatic variables on extreme events are crucial to improve water resources management in a river basin the atmospheric water balance can be quantified using several metrics among them the aridity index evaporation ratio and runoff coefficient received a lot of interest due to their ability to capture the dynamics of the hydrologic cycle schaake et al 2006 aridity index ai defined as the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation which represents the atmospheric potential water availability over atmospheric water demand this definition of ai is widely accepted for characterizing climate boundaries maestre et al 2012 in addition to investigating the degree of aridity across the world nastos et al 2013 also the aridity index was used to assess the effects of climate change on runoff vegetation and desertification sawicz et al 2011 therefore ai serves to identify and locate regions that suffer from available water deficit the runoff coefficient rc is defined based on the ratio between the annual runoff and the annual rainfall and it can be a very good indicator to study the degree of moisture recycling as well as water holding capacity in a given area savenije 1996 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 by using rc it is possible to investigate the role of canopy architecture leaf characteristics and biomass in controlling the runoff within the catchment muzylo et al 2009 rao et al 2011 ferreira et al 2016 similar to r index yao 1974 we calculated the relative evaporation ratio er that is defined as the ratio between actual evapotranspiration aet to potential evapotranspiration pet in addition these three indices can formulate useful metrics for hydrologic ratios schaake et al 2006 and it forms the basis for budyko hypothesis which is a widely used framework to examine energy and water fluxes at watersheds budyko 1974 in regions where high quality long term observations are scarce these hydrologic ratios can be quantified using land surface models however these models are subject to uncertainties from inputs simplification and parameterization ek et al 2003 li et al 2011 further these models can be computationally expensive often requiring high performance computing when running models over larger areas and may limit a comprehensive assessment of uncertainty in forcing data or climate change scenarios bosshard et al 2013 elsner et al 2014 in order to overcome such limitations statistical models which require a limited number of input variables can be used as an alternative tool to investigate spatial characteristics of surface hydroclimate processes schneider 1996 mccabe and wolock 2011 abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 previous studies have established that statistical models have potential to predict spatio temporal hydrologic processes based on a set of controlling factors abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 deshmukh and singh 2016 van loon and laaha 2015 among them random forest rf approach is one of the most popular and powerfulmachine learning algorithms that are built based on the principle of various combinations of classification and regressions trees breiman 2001 the rf algorithm is a natural and non linear modelling tool that provides estimates regarding the hierarchy of variables in the classification and thus it can estimate individual variable s contribution to the spatial distribution of hydrologic ratios in hydrology the rf algorithm has been applied to eco hydrological distribution modeling peters et al 2007 prediction of natural flow regimes carlisle et al 2010 and groundwater mapping naghibi et al 2016 a great deal of theoretical and empirical studies have detailed the advantages of rf which includes high forecast accuracy acceptable tolerance to outliers and noise and easy avoidance of over fitting problems therefore rf model can be applied to spatial prediction and for rectifying multi variable and non linear issues among the hydrologic extreme events droughts are known to have impacts on multiple sectors such as domestic agriculture energy production and fishery mishra and singh 2010 droughts usually span over large geographical areas and often last for months to years representing a dominant three dimensional latitude longitude and time space time structure unlike other hydrologic extreme events lloyd hughes 2012 konapala and mishra 2017 in addition climate models have projected an increase in future drought severity and duration over continental usa wehner et al 2011 konapala and mishra 2017 therefore investigating the potential influence of hydrologic ratios on drought characteristics can further improve our understanding on identifying critical sensitive areas leading to superior drought management strategies as a result we determine the various characteristics of droughts using the concepts of resilience exposure vulnerability and duration estimation of these values at a catchment scale can help water resources managers to develop tools for studying catchment s vulnerability to droughts ability to recover resilience frequency and its exposure to drought conditions the overall goal of this study is to i develop a random forest model that can spatially predict the hydrologic ratios based on a set of geospatial climate vegetation and topographic variables and ii to evaluate the potential influence of estimated hydrological ratios on spatial drought characteristics for river basins located in conus through this work we also investigated the dominant factors responsible for the spatial distributions of hydrologic ratios to achieve the objectives the data sources and the adopted statistical methodology are explained in section 2 in section 3 the various features of the calibrated random forest model and sensitivity of drought characteristics are discussed finally the conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 study area data and methodology 2 1 data description to address our objectives the datasets are collected from multiple sources we first describe the data that used for building rf model majority of the data for building rf model was obtained from model parameter estimation experiment mopex basin the watersheds considered in mopex are considered to have minimum human interference schaake et al 2006 the dataset covers a wide range of climate soil and vegetation characteristics for conus the watershed characteristics table 1 of 438 mopex basins distributed over the conus are acquired from the following sources the mean annual precipitation and temperature data is processed from the national weather service river forecast system nwsrfs the nwsrfs uses interpolation method based on inverse distance algorithm of prism schaake et al 2006 daly et al 1994 data set using the climatology of 1961 1990 within the mopex basins watershed s physical characteristics is derived using the digital elevation model dem obtained from the national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc vegetation type was obtained from the university of maryland land cover database porosity is derived from statgo soils information database and ndvi is derived from modis dataset https lpdaac usgs gov the spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation the hydrological ratios ndvi and mean annual potential evapotranspiration across the mopex basins are illustrated in fig 1 more information about the data sources can be found in schaake et al 2006 the watershed slope and available water content awc are derived from national gap analysis program and statgo database respectively the selected variables table 1 for the watersheds across conus are collected and aggregated from various sources the pearson s correlation coefficients between geospatial variables watershed characteristics and hydrologic ratios table 1 for the 438 mopex basins distributed over the conus suggests possible relationship positive negative between them the usgs defined watersheds hydrologic unit code huc 8 and major river basins huc 2 are obtained from usgs watershed boundary dataset https nhd usgs gov wbd html the spatial distribution of major river basins is illustrated in fig 2 the mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are obtained and aggregated from prism dataset http www prism oregonstate edu the ndvi over all the watersheds of conus are obtained from modis ndvi dataset the spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and ndvi over the selected watersheds of conus are shown in fig 3 for estimating drought characteristics we used standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei dataset developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 and available at speibase v 2 5 http spei csic es database html spei is an extension to the widely used standardized precipitation index spi however unlike spi the spei takes into account both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet and thus captures the impact of increased temperature on water demand vicente serrano et al 2010 in addition to that spei can also be computed at different time scales facilitating its usage for drought impacts on various water resources needs mishra and singh 2010 2011 therefore in this study we utilize the 3 month spei for seasonal scale drought characteristics 2 2 random forest rf model the rf modeling approach uses classification and regression trees as building blocks to derive effective prediction models james et al 2013 unlike the other tree based methods rf increases diversity among the classification trees by resampling data and randomly changing the predictive variable sets for different tree induction processes therefore the key parameters for rf models are the number of trees and predictors used to determine the split at each node vorpahl et al 2012 here the random forest rf breiman 2001 model was first developed based on the mopex watersheds then the model was applied to predict the hydrological ratios of huc8 watersheds fig 4 illustrates the steps used to develop rf prediction model for hydrologic ratios for watersheds in conus as shown in the flowchart both response and predictor variables of mopex dataset divided into 2 separate groups i e training and testing the splitting of data set into training and testing data set is based on two conditions a does the dataset training and testing large enough to yield statistically meaningful results and b does the dataset is a representative of whole therefore split between training and testing may vary in each study for example bachmair et al 2016 applied rf modeling approach for predicting the drought impacts of each drought indicator by splitting the train and test data to 90 10 whereas rahmati et al 2016 split the train and test data to 70 30 for mapping the groundwater potential over the mehran region located in the northern part of iran similarly our study also showed an acceptable result for splitting the mpex datasets to 70 testing data and 30 testing data in terms of correlation coefficient r and mse here the response variables are hydrologic ratios and the predictor variables are geospatial variables that are listed in table 1 during the training phase we utilized 500 trees derived from 500 bootstrapped data sets to build random forest model then based on each bootstrapped sample 500 regression trees are constructed split points of these regression trees were chosen from a random subset of all available predictor variables then we averaged the resulting 500 predictions generated from individual regression tree the individual tree may have higher variance therefore by averaging these 500 trees likely to reduce the overall variance thus rf modeling approach has potential to improve prediction simulation accuracy by combining hundreds of trees into a single procedure james et al 2013 finally we predicted the hydrologic ratios by applying the rf algorithm and validated with 30 data which was not included in the model development the random forest model used in this study was built using the randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 in the r software project r core team 2014 subsequently the model prediction accuracy was evaluated based on mean square error mse james et al 2013 and strength of correlation r between the predicted and observed hydrological ratios in the second phase of the analysis we applied the calibrated rf model to predict hydrological ratios over the conus by using the predictors aggregated at huc 8 level watershed scale 2 3 drought resilience vulnerability exposure and frequency we evaluated the watershed s drought conditions based on the concepts of resilience vulnerability exposure and frequency these concepts hashimoto et al 1982 loucks and van beek 2017 are widely used in the water resources systems loucks and van beek 2017 asefa et al 2014 brown and williams 2015 ayyub 2014 in this study we applied these concepts to characterize droughts in any given watershed for illustration purpose we develop a hypothetical example based on spei 03 as drought indicator for a period of 24 months shown in fig 6 in this study we consider that the drought condition likely to be prevalent in a watershed if the spei 03 value is below 1 for a period more than 2 months however selection of these thresholds can vary depending on the research interest and stakeholders need therefore the hypothetical scenario exhibits two instances of the water shortage ranging for a period of 3 and 5 months in the following text we illustrate these drought indicators based on the example provided in fig 5 2 3 1 drought resilience drought resilience re can be defined as the ability of a watershed to recover from water shortage to water availability state hoque et al 2016 loucks and van beek 2017 sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 in our case we defined re based on a temporal scale as adopted previously by maity et al 2012 and sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 as a result we express drought resilience re as the inverse of average drought duration given by eq 1 1 re m i 1 m d d i where m is the number of events and dd is the drought duration in our hypothetical scenario fig 5 we can observe that m 2 and i 1 m d d i 3 5 indicating that re is 0 4 months as evident from the formulation it can be seen that higher is the average drought duration lesser will be resilient of a watershed to droughts therefore high values of re indicates that the watersheds are more resilient to drought 2 3 2 vulnerability drought vulnerability vu can be defined as the average depletion of available water due to drought in our case the drought vulnerability is measured based on the magnitude of spei during the drought event sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 therefore in the present study we estimated the drought vulnerability of each watershed as sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 2 vu spei 1 spei m in the context of our hypothetical example fig 5 drought vulnerability is given by 2 2 2 6 1 9 2 1 2 9 2 5 2 1 2 2 higher value of vu indicates that the watershed exhibits higher degree of vulnerability to droughts 2 3 3 exposure drought exposure ex can be defined as the relative amount of time the watershed is exposed to drought conditions liu et al 2013 in this case we define this phenomenon based on temporal scale and as a result ex is calculated as the ratio between total time periods liu et al 2013 a watershed is undergoing drought to the total duration of the study period it can be estimated as 3 ex i 1 m d d i td where td represents the total number of months in the study period therefore in context of fig 5 drought exposure can be estimated as 3 5 24 as evident from the formulation higher values of ex represent high degree of drought exposure in the watersheds 2 3 4 drought frequency the drought frequency fr can be defined as the number of occurrences of drought event exceeding a certain threshold per unit time blenkinsop and fowler 2007 spinoni et al 2014 in our case we expressed drought frequency on a yearly scale given by the total number of qualifying drought events spei 1 and dd 2 months divided by the total number years as 4 fr m n where n is the number of years considered in this study and m is the number of drought events with spei03 value below 1 simultaneously for a period more than 2 months therefore for the case of fig 5 drought frequency is estimated as 2 2 indicating the frequency as a single drought event per year in this study spei 03 was used as drought index to calculate drought resilience vulnerability exposure and frequency for conus at a spatial resolution of 0 50 0 50 for the period of 1961 1990 we aggregated these gridded values to generate information for individual watersheds the spatial distribution of re vu ex and fr for the major river basins are shown in fig 6 2 4 sensitivity analysis between drought characteristics and hydrologic ratios to quantify the spatial response of the estimated drought indicators to hydrologic ratios we utilized the concept of non parametric sensitivity introduced by sankarasubramanian et al 2001 this approach is useful to quantify the relative change in one variable may affect the other variable this sensitivity konapala and mishra 2016 ahiablame et al 2017 can be expressed as 5 φ m e d i a n y i f y f x i f x f x f y f where x ai e r r c and y re e x v u f r f can be any one of the selected major river basins and i is the i th watershed belonging to the river basin f whereas y and x represents the spatial mean of x and y variables within the watersheds in a given river basin f the value φ represents the spatial variation in drought characteristics with respect to the change in hydrologic ratio of watersheds within a river basin in addition the φ value also indicates the degree of spatial influence of the hydrologic ratios on drought characteristics within a river basin the higher value of φ for a river basin indicates that the drought characteristics of watersheds in the river basin are highly sensitive to the hydrologic ratios another advantage of this approach is that it distinguishes between positive and negative sensitivities for instance a positive φ value in case of aridity index and resilience indicate that an increase in aridity index may result in increase in resilience over the river basin whereas a negative φ value indicates that an increase in aridity index might result in decrease in drought resilience therefore this approach is found to be suitable for assessing the spatial influence of hydrologic ratios on drought properties within a river basin then the statistical significance of φ was evaluated with a bootstrap approach as mentioned in konapala and mishra 2016 by considering 999 samples only the φ values with p values less than 0 05 are considered in this analysis 3 results 3 1 evaluation of random forest model as a first step we evaluated the performance of random forest rf model to predict hydrologic ratios ai er and rc over the mopex basins the scatter plot between observed and predicted hydrologic ratios are provided in fig 7 the random forest model for predicting ai rf ai have a pearson correlation value of 0 81 and an mse of 0 07 whereas the rf model for er rf er shows a pearson correlation value of 0 9 and mse of 0 002 and the rf model for rc rf rc shows a pearson correlation of 0 91 and mse of 0 007 even though all these models were able to replicate the index values with a considerable accuracy the rf rc model performs the best among the three models in case of rf ai and rf er models the annual mean precipitation annual mean potential evapotranspiration ndvi and percentage of forest cover were the most important variables in predicting the ai and er across the watersheds of usa whereas in case of rf rc model standard deviation of potential evapotranspiration also played an important role in predicting the rc in rf ai model the ai values greater than 2 are less accurately predicted whereas the ai values from 0 5 to 2 are more accurately predicted as a result the model might not accurately represent the humid conditions in case of rf er model the values which are at the lower end i e 0 3 to 0 6 are less accurately predicted compared to the values in the range of 0 6 to 0 9 finally in case of rf rc model the predicted values greater than 0 5 witness higher uncertainty 3 2 spatial pattern of modeled aridity index across the major river basins the calibrated rf models are applied to predict the hydrologic ratios at huc 8 level watersheds in general huc 8 maps the sub basin level similar to medium sized river basins about 2200 nationwide fig 8 a illustrates the spatial distribution of aridity index for the conus the unep 1992 classified the aridity index climatic zone to hyper arid 0 05 arid 0 05 0 20 semi arid 0 20 0 50 sub humid 0 50 0 65 and humid 0 65 zones nastos et al 2013 based on our analysis it was observed that most of the watershed were located in semi arid sub humid or humid and none of these watersheds depicted either hyper arid or arid climatic zone as classified by the unep 1992 the ai values for the eastern river basins were relatively higher and homogeneous in nature for example in south atlantic river basin the ai values range from 0 9 to 1 5 with a coefficient of variation cv of 11 where the mean annual precipitation was also homogeneous throughout the watersheds the lower mississippi river basin located in southeastern conus showed minimum cv 5 in terms of predicted ai values with the values range from 1 05 to 1 6 whereas for the great lake river basin located in the northeast of the conus exhibited maximum cv 14 however unlike the eastern river basins the central river basins showed more diverse distribution of the ai values for instance the missouri river basin arkansas white red region and texas gulf region showed an ai value range of 0 39 0 91 0 43 1 29 and 0 53 1 32 respectively however as we go from east to west the indices value further reduced and the spatial pattern of ai becomes more heterogeneous in nature sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 majority of the watersheds in the southwestern united states are classified as dry hence their ai is less than 0 65 except few watersheds located in the california river basin unlike the watersheds in the southwestern usa the pacific northwest river basin showed high values of ai possibly due to the frontal weather systems arising from the pacific ocean and the cascade mountains schillinger et al 2010 it was observed that within the pacific northwest river basin the ai values range from 0 38 to 2 9 with a cv of 72 this observed variability in ai may be associated with spatial variability in precipitation in the pacific northwest river basin bracken et al 2015 where the annual precipitation ranges from 87 mm to 3300 mm the increase in temperature leads to increased evapotranspiration and lower ai values proedrou et al 1997 feidas et al 2004 philandras et al 2008 in many watersheds the maximum pet was observed in the watersheds located in the southwestern river basins for instance california and lower colorado river basins have number of watersheds with a higher pet which may lead the watersheds of these river basins to lower aridity values however the spatial distribution of pet was more heterogeneous compared to the precipitation pattern the mean annual normalized vegetation index ndvi is one of the important variables influencing the ai over the major river basins similar to the mean annual precipitation the spatial distribution of ndvi was homogenous across the river basins of eastern usa we also noticed that the correlation between ndvi and ai was comparatively less in the eastern united states where the majority of the land cover is dominated by forest cover nlcd 2011 whereas the ndvi for the western river basins showed high correlation with the aridity values e g pacific northwest river basin california region great basin region which suggests that ndvi has major role in controlling the ai in most of the watersheds located in western usa however the result from the rf model suggests that the relationship between watershed slope and awc are weak with ai indicating that topography and soil characteristics have relatively less role in governing the ai across the watersheds 3 3 spatial pattern of modeled evaporation ratio across the major river basins a higher value of relative evaporation ratio er indicates that the region has optimum water that is necessary for the vegetation the fig 8 b illustrates the modeled er based on rf modeling for the conus the er values vary from 0 33 to 0 86 with a cv of 28 over the watersheds located in conus similar to the ai the er values for the eastern river basins were relatively higher and homogeneous in nature for example the er values of the new england river basin mid and south atlantic river basins range from 0 63 to 0 77 0 56 0 76 and 0 63 0 82 respectively in addition to that the er values typically follows the spatial pattern of mean annual precipitation whereas the river basins located in the central united states exhibits relatively high variability of er for instance the missouri river basin arkansas white red region and texas gulf region showed a cv of 24 27 and 23 respectively in contrast to ai the spatial distribution of er values were more homogenous throughout the southwestern river basins e g lower colorado and rio grande region the southwestern river basins exhibited lower range of er values however unlike the lower colorado and rio grande region the er value for california river basin range from 0 3 to 0 75 similar to the ai the pacific northwest river basin depicted high variation of er values with a cv of 33 the major contributing variables for estimating er in the rf model were mean annual precipitation pet and vegetation cover the percentage of forest cover also showed a better relationship with the er in the random forest modeling overall the combination of minimum precipitation higher pet and less vegetation growth may attribute to the lower er in the southwestern parts of the conus the land cover has a strong influence on er liu et al 2017 therefore the role of land use pattern in defining er of a river basin is analyzed for instance tennessee river basin and ohio river basins located in the eastern usa has forest land cover of 58 and 48 showed relatively less variation of er throughout the basins whereas for the western usa where the forest cover is comparatively less exhibited higher variation in er although the er of a region also depends upon crop type stage of growth soil moisture health of plants and cultivation practices ayars and hanson 2014 we did not include all these variables in rf model due to limitation in available data overall it was observed that rf modeling framework is appropriate for predicting the er at a regional or watershed scale 3 4 spatial pattern of modeled runoff coefficient across the major river basins the spatial distribution of runoff coefficient rc across the continental usa is illustrated in fig 8 c similar to ai and er the river basins located in eastern conus witnessed a homogenous distribution of rc sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 comparatively with a higher magnitude chang et al 2014 varies from 0 1 to 0 54 however unlike the other eastern river basins the great lake river basin of northeastern usa exhibited high variation of rc river basins located in central usa i e missouri river basin arkansas river basin and texas gulf region showed more diverse pattern of rc across the watersheds in contrast to the ai values the spatial pattern of rc was more homogeneous across the southwestern e g lower colorado river basin and midwestern e g great basin region river basins for example lower colorado river basin showed a cv of 8 and great basin region showed a cv of 16 whereas in california river basin the rc varies from 0 07 to 0 52 with a cv of 66 similar to the result presented by chang et al 2014 we also observed that pacific northwest river basin watersheds exhibited the high values of rc among the conus watersheds where the rc was ranging from 0 04 to 0 54 possibly due to the spatial variability in precipitation mean annual precipitation mean annual pet and ndvi were the important variables which control the spatial pattern of runoff coefficient across the conus watersheds as we mentioned the range of ndvi was comparatively lesser in western united states but it showed higher correlation with rc for instance the correlation between ndvi and runoff coefficient in pacific northwest basin was 0 81 which is comparatively higher than the river basins of eastern usa therefore in the random forest modeling the ndvi may have a significant role in predicting the rc over western river basins overall the spatial analysis of ai er and rc showed distinct spatial pattern across the watersheds of conus chang et al 2014 sawicz et al 2011 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 we also noticed that basins with low hydrologic ratios typically have higher cv e g pacific northwest and california region on the other hand basins with higher hydrologic ratios depicted low cv e g south atlantic gulf region and lower mississippi region 3 5 sensitivity of drought indicators to hydrologic ratios fig 9 illustrates the spatial pattern of sensitivity of various drought characteristics to ai in the major river basins of conus the basins in grey color are not statistically significant in nature fig 9 a indicates sensitivity of drought resilience to ai value the sensitivity of northeast great lakes region and north central souris red rainy region regions showed a positive sensitivity with great lakes region and souris red rainy region exhibiting around 111 and 16 of increase in drought resilience it indicates that within the river basin an increase in ai of watersheds would result in increase of drought resilience of these watersheds we also noticed that the great lakes region has the high positive sensitivity value to the aridity index whereas the tennessee lower and upper mississippi river basins showed a decrease in drought resilience with respect to aridity index the tennessee river basin showed a decrease of 53 and lower mississippi river basin showed a decrease of 34 in the western part of usa the only region that is significantly sensitive to ai is upper colorado river basin where it showed a negative sensitivity value of 19 this indicates that in those river basins an increase in ai values in watersheds are accompanied by an increase of drought resilience also it is interesting to note that the observed magnitude of positive sensitivity is more than the observed magnitude of negative sensitivity therefore it may indicate that in the basins where humidity increases due to precipitation drought resilience also increases sherwood and fu 2014 in case of sensitivity of drought vulnerability to ai fig 9 b we can see that all the north eastern river basins exhibit a positive sensitivity except the new england region among them the great lakes region has a high sensitivity of around 50 and the mid atlantic region has a low sensitivity of around 11 california region seems to be more sensitive than all the river basins in the conus region whereas the rio grande and souris red rainy region exhibit negative sensitivity values of 28 and 16 respectively in case of drought vulnerability too the observed magnitude of positive sensitivity is more than the observed magnitude of negative sensitivity therefore the similar conclusion of basins where ai value increases prone to increased drought vulnerability may be implied in case of sensitivity of drought frequency to ai fig 9 c the northeastern river basins are considerably more sensitive than the other regions the great lakes river basin and new england river basin exhibits the high positive sensitivity whereas the river basins in southeast showed comparatively low but negative and significant sensitivities the california river basin western usa and arkansas river basin of central usa also showed a negative sensitivity of almost 10 the spatial sensitivity of drought frequency also showed that more number of river basins 13 in total are sensitive to aridity index in this case also we can see that the river basins exhibiting positive sensitivity values are more in number than the negative sensitivity values also as in the case of other drought indicators in the northeastern region the number of drought events is positively sensitive to aridity index among them the great lakes river basin has the highest positive sensitivity of more than 100 whereas the pacific northwest region has the least positive sensitivity of 12 in addition it is interesting to see that the drought frequency in the rio grande and lower colorado river basins were moderately sensitive 38 and 22 respectively to ai overall we can see that the drought indicators are more positively sensitive to ai value than negatively finally in case of sensitivity of drought exposure to ai fig 9 d all the eastern river basins except new england are sensitive among them the south atlantic and tennessee river basin exhibits the high negative sensitivity whereas the river basins in western usa showed comparatively low but positive and significant sensitivities e g pacific north west upper and lower colorado river basins as in the case of re vu and fr drought exposure ex also showed more number of positively sensitive river basins across the conus fig 10 illustrates the spatial pattern of sensitivity of various drought indicators to er of watersheds in major river basins of conus region compared to ai we can see that in general drought characteristics in more number of river basins are sensitive to er among the observed positive sensitivities great basin region showed the highest sensitivity followed by great lakes region whereas in case of negative sensitivities lower mississippi and ohio river region has high negative sensitivities and upper and lower colorado exhibits moderate sensitivities overall it can be observed that in these river basins an increase in er would lead to increase in drought resilience in case of drought vulnerability fig 10 b we can see that the ohio and lower mississippi river basins has the higher positive sensitivity followed by tennessee and great basin region whereas in case of negative sensitivities pacific northwest river basin has the higher negative magnitude followed by north atlantic river basin in addition to that the rio grande and texas gulf region has negative sensitivity values whereas in case of frequency 13 river basins found to be significantly sensitive to er however in the case of sensitivity of drought frequency to er fig 10 c eastern river basins have shown statistically significant sensitivity values among them great lakes river basin has the highest sensitivity value whereas the least sensitivity is observed in pacific northwestern river basin finally the sensitivity of er fig 10 d to drought exposure ex has relatively higher number of river basins 16 out of 18 river basins among them the north eastern river basins witness higher magnitudes of sensitivities both positive and negative in comparison to the western river basins among them the ohio river basin and upper mississippi river basin exhibit higher positive sensitivity values followed by the lower mississippi region whereas the lower atlantic and tennessee river basin exhibit higher negative sensitivity values fig 11 illustrates the spatial pattern of sensitivity of various drought indicators to rc of watersheds in major river basins of conus in case of drought resilience fig 11 a great lakes river basin is the only basin exhibiting positive sensitivity to rc whereas the lower mississippi and tennessee river basins are negatively sensitive in the western conus region the upper and lower colorado region along with the great river basin also exhibit negative sensitivity in case of vulnerability fig 11 b the arkansas river basin shows a negative sensitivity to rc whereas the lower mississippi ohio and tennessee river basins exhibit positive sensitivity followed by upper colorado and great basins but the great lakes region is shown to have less magnitude positive sensitivity in case of frequency fig 11 c overall 11 river basins have shown sensitivity to rc including arkansas and great lakes river basins exhibiting negative sensitive values whereas the north eastern river basins along with lower mississippi river basin have high positive sensitivity values in case of drought exposure fig 11 d the northeastern river basins witness positive sensitivity with new england river basin showing the higher sensitivity whereas in southern atlantic and tennessee river basin have positive sensitivities as a result in general we can say that an increase in hydrologic ratios would cause an increase in the magnitude of drought indicators however the spatial sensitivities are not as prominent as in the case of temporal sensitivities in general aridity index is calculated as a ratio of the long term average annual precipitation to the long term average annual evapotranspiration whereas drought event is characterized by abnormally dry weather conditions sufficiently long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance for a specific geographic location a drought event may extend for a season a year or several years mishra and singh 2010 schneider 1996 this indicates that aridity is permanent while drought is temporary in other words while the increase in aridity less humid may refer to the background climatology of the geographic location however it may not necessarily signify drought sherwood and fu 2014 li et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 in addition the less humid area may have less influence of aridity on water availability gudmundsson et al 2016 therefore a change in the aridity index may cause either positive or negative sensitivity over the river basins considered in this study also zarch et al 2015 suggested that for a long term record of datasets an increasing trend of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration may lead to a decrease in aridity index in the present study we quantify drought across the continental usa by using spei 3 accumulation period of 3 months the temporal scale of aridity index is considered as the long term annual average and temporal scale of drought is considered as the long term average of spei 3 this may lead the correlation between the spei drought and hydrologic ratios over the river basin to lesser values in our analysis in addition the snow cover of the watersheds are not considered in this study the snow cover can form potential long term moisture storage in a watershed in the form of snow ice arora 2002 this may influence the assumption that the hydrologic ratios ai er and rc are prominently controlled by the evapotranspiration precipitation and surface runoff especially in the western and northern watersheds this analysis is based on the natural environment therefore any discrepancy can be attributed to the neglecting human factors in the analysis it was observed that the increase in hydrologic ratios may cause an increase in the severity of drought indicators in majority of the river basins among the considered hydrologic ratios relative evaporation ratio was found out to be more sensitive in influencing the drought indicators of most of the basin drought indicators of northeast river basins especially the great lake region is more prone to sensitivity due to the spatial change in hydrologic ratios whereas the missouri river basin seems to be least sensitive drought region to all the hydrologic ratios the magnitude of drought vulnerability frequency and exposure showed a positive relation with the runoff coefficient across the majority of the river basins indicating that drought severity in watersheds of these river basins are increasing with runoff coefficient similarly in case of aridity index majority of the river basins showed positive relation with the drought indicators representing that precipitation may have more control over drought indicators than potential evapotranspiration 4 conclusion in this study we utilize random forest model to predict the spatial pattern of hydrologic ratios which includes aridity index ai relative evaporation ratio er and runoff coefficient rc for the watersheds located in continental united states the developed statistical modeling framework incorporates a set of geospatial climate soil vegetation and topographic variables for predicting these hydrologic ratios conceptually our results agree with the previous research that investigated the spatial distribution of long term natural water availability over the conus chang et al 2014 moreover the variables used for modeling the hydrologic ratios are widely available therefore the proposed statistical model can be expanded to any part of the world to investigate and improve the quantification of water availability and related water scarcity however there is room for further enhancement for instance i anthropogenic interventions e g reservoir operation irrigation water use are excluded for explaining the hydrologic ratios the addition of such anthropogenic variables can significantly improve prediction of runoff coefficient ii quantification of groundwater contribution to the hydrologic ratio might improve the model prediction and iii the proposed model may have limited potential to capture hydrologic ratios in regions with higher landscape disturbance such as agricultural land as well as a result of increase in urban sprawl abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 hamel and guswa 2015 overall the proposed random forest prediction framework can be used for analyzing the distribution and variation of hydrologic ratios within the major river basins of conus the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a the watersheds located in the pacific northwest river basin showed maximum value of aridity index however within the pacific northwest river basin the aridity index values can vary from 0 38 to 2 9 with a coefficient of variation of 72 b important variables used in rf model for quantifying the relative evaporation ratio includes mean annual precipitation mean annual pet and vegetation cover additionally the combination of minimum precipitation higher pet and less vegetation cover may attribute to low relative evaporation ratio the spatial distribution of evaporation ratio was more homogenous throughout the southwestern river basins e g lower colorado and rio grande region c the spatial pattern of runoff coefficient was homogeneous across the eastern e g mid atlantic tennessee river basins southwestern e g lower colorado river basin and mid western e g great basin region river basins moreover the influence of vegetation ndvi on runoff coefficient was clearly visible in the western river basins of conus e g pacific northwest river basin california river basin d overall the spatial analysis of hydrologic ratios showed distinct spatial pattern across the watersheds of the conus additionally basins with low hydrologic ratios typically have high cv e g pacific northwest and california region and on the other hand basins with high hydrologic ratios depicted low cv e g south atlantic gulf region and lower mississippi region e the sensitivity of drought indicators to the hydrologic ratios for the 18 major river basins was also investigated the sensitivity analysis can inform the change in drought indicators such as resilience vulnerability frequency and exposure with respect to the spatial change in hydrologic ratios it was observed that the hydrologic ratios are considerably sensitive to drought characteristics in majority of the river basins among the considered hydrologic ratios relative evaporation ratio seems to be more sensitive to influence the drought indicators of most of the basin drought indicators of northeast river basins especially the great lake region is more sensitive to the spatial change in hydrologic ratios whereas the missouri river basin seems to be least sensitive to all the hydrologic ratios the addition of anthropogenic factors wan et al 2017 2018 such as land use change water demand and reservoir operation may improve the analysis specifically for evaluating the response of drought to hydrologic ratios for instance changes in land use and land cover affect local and regional climate process and related hydrologic ratios it may lead to variation of sensitivity of drought to hydrologic ratios with in a river basin future investigation is necessary for the better understanding of the effect of climate change projection on hydrologic ratios and related sensitivity on drought indicators and consideration of groundwater and snow related variables may improve the quantification of hydrologic ratios across the watersheds of continental usa acknowledgement this study was supported by the national science

7069,sorption is an important means for pollutant migration in aquatic environments and an important mechanism of pollutant transfer and transformation thus understanding the sorption desorption of organic pollutants in an aquatic environment is vital to predicting pollutant fate in this study bisphenol a bpa was selected as the target pollutant for an investigation of sorption characteristics on three sediments in the lanzhou section of the yellow river with examination of sorption thermodynamic parameters and the effects of temperature ph and sediment particle size sorption is described well by the pseudo second order kinetic model occurring at two stages fast 0 6 h and slow 6 16 h with equilibrium reached within 16 h the results suggested that the intraparticle diffusion was dominant in the sorption process sorption thermodynamics was nonlinear fitting well with the freundlich isotherm model physical sorption is the likely mechanism combining the contributions of π π interaction and hydrophobic interaction thermodynamic parameter analysis showed that gibbs free energy enthalpy and entropy were less than zero showing that it is spontaneous exothermic and chaos decreasing among tested influence parameters ph values ionic strengths temperatures and particle sizes were found to considerably influence the sorption of bpa sorption capacity decreased as sediment particle size increased and as ph increased sorption capacity increased with increasing ca2 and decreased with increasing na the results have important implications regarding the impact of sorption desorption at different environmental factors and fate of bpa in yellow river keywords bpa sorption desorption thermodynamic parameter yellow river 1 introduction environmental endocrine disrupters eeds also called endocrine disruptors or environmental hormones are exogenous compounds that if taken in can disturb the normal endocrine function of living bodies eeds found in different environmental media have been implicated in human dysplasia metabolic disorders and cancer aris 2014 paulose et al 2015 tse et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 the environmental hormone bisphenol a bpa has received substantial attention because it can disrupt the endocrine system huang et al 2012 aris 2014 chen et al 2016a hu et al 2017 because of its environmental persistence bioaccumulation semi volatilization and high toxicity bpa has been included in a blacklist of priority pollutants by some eu countries craig et al 2003 it has been widely detected in soil water and sediments food and the human body vom saal and welshons 2014 zimmers et al 2014 lu et al 2015 chen et al 2016a b park et al 2016 chemically described as 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bpa is used in a broad range of polymer materials and in the production of hundreds of products such as eye glasses food packaging baby bottles and coating of canned foods it is also used as a fire retardant antioxidant heat stabilizer and pesticide bhatnagar and anastopoulos 2017 studies have shown that bpa can enter the environment through industrial waste water sewage discharge and the improper disposal of solid waste resulting in harm to human health via the food chain vom saal and welshons 2014 zhao et al 2014 lv et al 2017 al saleh et al 2017 the yellow river offers abundant water resources and is important for both local residents and local economic development and is closely related to human production and life it has also become a source and sink of a wide range of pollutants li et al 2017a b shi et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zou et al 2015 detected bpa concentrations from 13 6 to 64 0 ng l in water and 0 559 to 2 73 µg kg in sediment in the yellow river estuary sediments in water bodies have become a key medium of organic pollutant migration and transformation and play an important role in the fate of pollutants and bio availability park et al 2016 sorption is an important means for migration of organic pollutants and has an important influence in their transfer and transformation in aquatic environments fent et al 2003 thus understanding the sorption desorption of bpa in an aquatic environment is vital to predicting its fate ying et al 2003 studied the sorption and degradation of bpa and four other eeds in sediment and showed that bpa is less readily absorbed than other eeds fent et al 2003 studied the sorption degradation of bpa on the soil particle and showed that bpa absorbed onto solid particles degraded more slowly than bpa in water they also found that bpa absorption onto sediment slows its degradation in the aquatic environment although extensive information on the toxicity degradation and distribution of bpa in different environmental media are available there are limited reports on the sorption desorption behavior of bpa onto soil or sediments jin and zhu 2016 saheli and rowe 2016 fei et al 2017 research on sorption desorption of organic pollutants in the yellow river which discharges more sediment than any other river is of great importance for understanding the progress of new environmental pollutants through the aquatic environment and evaluating the ecological risk thus this study was conducted to determine the sorption mechanisms of bpa on natural sediments based on the sorption coefficient the sorption enthalpy and other influential factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment samples the lanzhou section of the yellow river runs from the bapan gorge dam to anningdu ferry with a total length of 219 7 km the average runoff is 315 3 109 m3 more than half that of the entire river and the average annual flow is 950 m3 s with an average sediment concentration of 1 57 kg m3 this river section is the water source for urban residents as well as industrial and agricultural production it is also a sewage discharge area natural sediment samples were collected from three sites in the lanzhou section of the yellow river marked as hk sa and sc and the latitudes and longitudes of sites are 36 16 794 n 103 43 973e 36 09 317 n 103 68 786e and 36 14 652 n 104 00 968e respectively the sediment samples were air dried and sieved through a 0 30 mm mesh the fraction of total organic carbon in the sediment was measured by ignition at 550 c for removal of carbonates and labile organic matter jiang et al 2009 the particle size distributions of the sediment samples were measured by a particle size analyzer coulter ls 13320 beckman usa the specific surface area ssa was determined for the sediments by a surface analyzer coulter sa 3100 beckman usa using the multipoint brunauer emmett teller nitrogen adsorption method the physical and chemical properties of the sediments are shown in table 1 2 2 sorption desorption experiments sorption kinetics and thermodynamics were studied using batch equilibrium based on our previous study jiang et al 2016 desorption kinetics experiments were also carried out after the equilibrium was reached according to the adsorption kinetics experiment sorption desorption kinetics were studied in a separate set of experiments at a constant temperature 25 0 5 c sediment amount each 0 500 g and initial bpa concentration 50 ml 50 mg l each sorption reactor was withdrawn at suitable time intervals 0 5 1 2 4 6 9 12 16 and 24 h batch experiments of sorption desorption kinetics were conducted using 50 ml plastic screw capped bottles simultaneously in an incubator shaker at given time intervals at the selected time points the vials were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatants were removed for bpa quantification sorption isotherm experiments were conducted under a constant agitation rate 140 rpm initial ph 3 10 three temperatures 25 35 and 45 c different ion strengths sodion ions and calcium ions at 0 120 mg l and a bpa concentration from 1 to 18 mg l three sediment samples were used to study the sorption influence in different river sections the details of the three sediment samples are shown in table 1 solid and liquid phases in all experiments were separated at 4000 rpm in a centrifuge for 20 min finally bpa concentration in the liquid phase was detected using high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1260 hplc us all experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 kinetic adsorption models kinetic data can be used to determine the presence or absence of intraparticle diffusion and whether this is the rate controlling step the experimental data were processed using three kinetic adsorption models pseudo first order lagergren 1898 pseudo second order blanchard et al 1984 and intraparticle diffusion weber and morris 1963 the pseudo first order rate equation is 1 1 q t 1 q 1 k 1 q 1 t where q1 and qt are the amounts of pollutants adsorbed under equilibrium and at time t in mg g k1 is the adsorption constant in min 1 the pseudo second order kinetic model is 2 1 q t 1 k 2 q 2 2 t q 2 where q2 is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g qt is the amount of pollutant adsorbed under equilibrium at time t in mg g and k2 is the equilibrium rate constant in g mg min the intraparticle diffusion equation is 3 q t k p t 1 2 c where c is the intercept and kp is the rate constant in mg g min1 2 2 3 2 equilibrium adsorption models equilibrium sorption isotherms are one of the most important types of data to help us to understand the sorption mechanism three isotherm equations were used in this study freundlich langmuir and dubinin and radushkevich d r langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 dubinin and radushkevich 1947 the langmuir equation for a homogenous surface is expressed as follows 4 1 q s 1 k l q m c e 1 q m where qs is the quantity of pollutants adsorbed in mg g qm is the saturated quantity of pollutants adsorbed in mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of pollutants in aqueous solution in mg l and kl is the langmuir thermodynamic equilibrium constant the freundlich isotherm model is used to describe heterogeneous surfaces and is expressed as follows 5 lg q s lg k f 1 n lg c e where kf and n are constants related to sediment properties the d r model determines whether sorption is physical or chemical its linear form is expressed as follows 6 ln q s ln q m β ε 2 where qe is the amount of diesel oil adsorbed by sediment in mg g qm is the maximum sorption capacity in mg g β is the activity coefficient related to mean free energy of sorption and ε rtln 1 1 ce is the polanyi potential the mean free energy e kj mol was calculated using β 7 e 1 2 β and provides information about whether the sorption mechanism is physical 8 kj mol or chemical 8 16 kj mol 3 results and discussion 3 1 sorption kinetics fig 1 shows the kinetics curves for bpa adsorption onto sediments with sorption increasing rapidly as adsorption time increased from 0 to 6 h and gradually from 6 h until equilibrium was reached which can occur within 16 h fig 1 a unsurprisingly the concentration of bpa in solution decreased over time to reach a stable level fig 1 b hysteresis was also observed in the desorption process with part of the adsorbed bpa strongly retained by sediment sorption and thus it was no doubt that bpa concentrations from 13 6 to 64 0 ng l in water and 0 559 to 2 73 µg kg in sediment were detected in the yellow river estuary zou et al 2015 previous studies have shown that a rapid initial sorption of organic pollutants on natural absorbents is followed by a slow approach to equilibrium suggesting that the sorption rate of a generally porous medium mainly depends on the external and void diffusion rate of particles delle site 2001 distribution and sorption of organic pollutants is usually completed quickly in particles where the van der waals force dipole induced dipole and hydrogen bonding forces are the primary intermolecular interactions the slow sorption of organic pollutants in particles is because organic pollutants slowly diffused into the particles porosity and height of cross combination of the organic matter and other solid solution phases for organic pollutants to reach all of the sorption sites organic molecules must penetrate through water membrane into the parcel layer by diffusion then by pore diffusion into the particle pores and finally by diffusion through the substrate into the sediment phase therefore the diffusion coefficient of organic pollutants is inversely proportional to the diffusion results calculated from the three models are presented in table 2 the correlation coefficients obtained for the pseudo second order model are greater than those of the other models suggesting that this sorption system follows the pseudo second order kinetic model for all time periods the kinetic results were also analyzed using the intraparticle diffusion model as a result the plot of uptake qt vs the square root of time t 1 2 should be linear if intraparticle diffusion is involved in the sorption moreover intraparticle diffusion is the rate controlling step if these lines pass through the origin chen et al 2003 otherwise if the plots do not pass through the origin some degree of boundary layer control occurs and the intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step all of which may work simultaneously özcan et al 2005 the plot of qt vs t 1 2 for the sorption of bpa by the sampled sediment was linear and the lines pass through the origin fig 2 indicating that the intraparticle diffusion is dominant in the sorption process 3 2 sorption equilibrium the thermodynamic isothermal sorption curves of bpa at 25 35 and 45 c are shown in fig 3 all of the sorption parameters are presented in table 3 the freundlich model had higher regression coefficients than the other models suggesting it was most suitable for describing the isothermal sorption of bpa on the sample sediments and indicating a heterogeneous surface sorption furthermore the maximum sorption capacity tended to decrease with increasing systemic temperature e increased from 1 01 to 2 24 kj mol when the temperature increased from 25 to 45 c indicating physical sorption weber et al 1991 summarized the possible interactions between solute and sorbent into three categories physical chemical and electrostatic the relatively weak bonding forces associated with physical sorption are often amplified in the case of hydrophobic molecules by substantial thermodynamic gradients for repulsion from the solution in which they are dissolved akçay and akçay 2004 also reported that the sorption of two phenolic pollutants could be regarded as physical sorption onto bentonite delle site 2001 reported that physical sorption includes the combined contribution of π π interaction and hydrophobic interaction with π π interaction playing a dominant role in bpa sorption on particle surfaces 3 3 sorption thermodynamic characteristics thermodynamic parameters can help us to understand the inherent energetic changes involved in the sorption process furthermore there is a crucial data that provides information about the spontaneity endothermic or exothermic reaction of sorption and provides information about the potential increase or decrease of randomness at the solid liquid interface during the sorption process bhatnagar and anastopoulos 2017 changes in thermodynamic parameters such as free energy of sorption δgθ standard enthalpy δhθ and standard entropy changes δsθ were calculated based on the variations of kf and systematic temperature jiang et al 2016 the sorption associated δgθ δhθ and δsθ were calculated as follows 8 δ g θ r t ln k and 9 ln k δ h θ rt δ s θ r where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the sorption temperature the δgθ was negative at all temperatures table 4 confirming that sorption was spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable δgθ ranges from 0 to 20 kj mol in physical sorption and from 80 to 400 kj mol in chemical sorption in this study δgθ ranged from 6 98 to 6 27 kj mol indicating mainly physical sorption the negative δhθ suggested an exothermic sorption since sorption decreased with increasing temperature a δhθ of 2 10 20 9 kj mol suggests physical sorption and that of 80 0 200 kj mol suggests chemical sorption tian et al 2016 these results clearly suggest that physical sorption was the main sorption mechanism for the studied sediments though it was enhanced by chemical sorption the negative δsθ indicated decreased randomness at the solid liquid interface during the sorption process which contributed to the decrease of bpa sorption capacity at higher temperatures 3 4 effect of sediment samples from different river sections the sorption effects of the three sediment samples in different river sections are shown in fig 4 among the three sediment samples sc exhibited the highest bpa sorption capacity and hk the lowest table 3 this may be because sc had the smallest particle sizes because of its high clay fraction according to the particle size distribution whereas hk had larger particle sizes with a high fraction of sand table 1 more importantly sc had the second highest total organic carbon and highest ssa while hk had the lowest fom and ssa furthermore lanzhou is the only city that the yellow river passes through site sc was located in downstream of yellow river in the lanzhou section and showed a high fine particles input and a high organic content from urban sewage in this section this contrasts with hk which showed more coarse sand and a lower organic fraction in the sediment that mainly originated from the loess erosion on both sides of the yellow river the maximum adsorption capacity qm of the sediment samples used in the present study was well correlated with the tc or ssa values tables 1 and 3 which is in general agreement with previous studies on the adsorption of organic pollutants by soil and sediment chiou et al 1979 karickhoff et al 1979 sun et al 2012 fei et al 2017 3 5 effect of external factors on bpa sorption onto sediments 3 5 1 temperature temperature can be an important factor affecting the sorption process and has thus attracted considerable research attention it has two major effects on the sorption process increasing the temperature is known to increase the rate of diffusion of the adsorbate molecules across the external boundary layer and in the internal pores of the adsorbent particle owing to the decrease in the viscosity of the solution in addition changing the temperature will change the equilibrium capacity of the adsorbent for a particular adsorbate delle site 2001 in the current study the sorption capacity of bpa decreased from 0 515 to 0 357 mg g when the sorption temperature increased from 25 to 45 c fig 3 indicating an exothermic process with low temperatures more favorable for the sorption of bpa onto the sediment on the one hand the solubility of bpa decreased as the temperature increased which impeded sorption and decreased the sorption capacity on the other hand in the exothermic sorption process the trend of the adsorbate molecules transferring to the adsorbent surface was less than that of the escaping tendency from adsorbent surface to the solution with the increase of system temperature which leads to a decrease in the sorption ability of bpa on sediment particles 3 5 2 particle sizes three sediment particle sizes were studied and results showed that sorption capacity varied with sediment size fig 5 as particle size increased the sorption capacity decreased since sorption is a surface phenomenon smaller particle sizes offer a comparatively larger surface area and hence higher sorption occurs at equilibrium other studies have shown that the sorption capacity of organic pollutants increases as particle size decreases and hence as particle surface area increases for the same mass suggesting that this effect may be related to surface sorption which increases as surface area or number of sites increases delle site 2001 in addition small particles contain a high content of organic matter and many studies have shown that particles with high organic matter content have greater amounts of sorbed organic pollutants isaacson and frink 1984 suggested that a substantial contribution to phenolic compound sorption was made by a specific sorbate sorbent interaction the mechanism of sorption onto sediment is likely to involve extensive formation of hydroxyl bonds between phenolic hydroxyl groups and hydroxyl bonding sites on sediment organic matter this could explain the decrease in sorption capacity of bpa as particle size increased in the current study 3 5 3 ph values the ph values may affect the sorption of organic matter onto sediments in polluted water and are also a key factor controlling or affecting the fate of organic pollutants in particles delle site 2001 bhatnagar and anastopoulos 2017 in this study sorption capacity weakened as ph increased from 3 to 10 fig 6 bpa is a mildly acidic phenolic environmental hormone which is easily ionized under alkaline conditions studies have shown that molecules of organic pollutants are more likely to be adsorbed than those in ionic form ionization of bpa increases with increasing ph the quantity of anions in the whole system becomes higher and thus the electrostatic repulsion between sediments and bpa increases and the sorption capacity of bpa on sediment decreases therefore increasing ph will increase migration of bpa from sediments to solution in the water increasing environmental risk similar observations have been reported in other studies conducted at ph 7 which showed that the sorption capacity of bpa onto different absorbents declined at these higher ph levels guo et al 2011 xu et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 3 5 4 ionic strength and types sorption of a polar or ionizable compound such as bpa and other organic pollutants on soil or sediment may be strongly influenced by ionic strength and different ions delle site 2001 park and swift 2002 in the current study the sorption capacity of bpa on sediment increased as calcium ion concentration increased however sodion had the opposite effect with bpa sorption capacity decreasing with increasing sodion concentration fig 7 this may be because bpa easily combines with soil organic matter by bridging between the phenolic hydroxyl group of bpa and divalent calcium ions however sodion is a monovalent cation which cannot be chelated with the bpa molecule by bridging with the organic matter adsorbed bpa however can be dissolved by bonding with sodion thus reducing bpa sorption on sediment bayramoglu et al 2016 found a reduction in absorbed bpa amount with the increase of ionic strength they suggest that the salt ion can destroy the hydrogen bonding between bpa molecule and the adsorbent surface thus reducing the sorption efficiency furthermore since the sediment in yellow river mainly comes from loess erosion on both sides of the yellow river with a high content of calcium carbonate the addition of calcium ions could reduce system ph thus reducing the solubility of bpa and increasing adsorption 4 conclusion both the sorption kinetics and thermodynamic behavior of bpa on sediments in the lanzhou section of the yellow river were studied and it was shown that they best conformed to the pseudo second order kinetics equation and the freundlich isothermal model these results clearly suggest that sorption was mainly physical adsorption combined contribution of π π interaction and hydrophobic interaction and intraparticle diffusion is dominant in the sorption process analysis of thermodynamic parameters indicated that sorption was spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable and the decreased randomness at the solid liquid interface during sorption process contributed to the decrease of bpa sorption capacity at higher temperatures the sorption effects of three sediment samples in different river sections showed that the sc exhibited the highest bpa sorption capacity and hk the lowest and the maximum adsorption capacity of the sediment samples in the present study can be well correlated with the tc or ssa values the sorption capacity decreased as particle size increased and sorption capacity weakened as ph increased from 3 to 10 bpa easily combines with soil organic matter by bridging between the phenolic hydroxyl group of bpa and divalent calcium ions however adsorbed bpa can be dissolved by bonding with sodion thus reducing bpa sorption on sediment additional research is needed to get further insight

7069,sorption is an important means for pollutant migration in aquatic environments and an important mechanism of pollutant transfer and transformation thus understanding the sorption desorption of organic pollutants in an aquatic environment is vital to predicting pollutant fate in this study bisphenol a bpa was selected as the target pollutant for an investigation of sorption characteristics on three sediments in the lanzhou section of the yellow river with examination of sorption thermodynamic parameters and the effects of temperature ph and sediment particle size sorption is described well by the pseudo second order kinetic model occurring at two stages fast 0 6 h and slow 6 16 h with equilibrium reached within 16 h the results suggested that the intraparticle diffusion was dominant in the sorption process sorption thermodynamics was nonlinear fitting well with the freundlich isotherm model physical sorption is the likely mechanism combining the contributions of π π interaction and hydrophobic interaction thermodynamic parameter analysis showed that gibbs free energy enthalpy and entropy were less than zero showing that it is spontaneous exothermic and chaos decreasing among tested influence parameters ph values ionic strengths temperatures and particle sizes were found to considerably influence the sorption of bpa sorption capacity decreased as sediment particle size increased and as ph increased sorption capacity increased with increasing ca2 and decreased with increasing na the results have important implications regarding the impact of sorption desorption at different environmental factors and fate of bpa in yellow river keywords bpa sorption desorption thermodynamic parameter yellow river 1 introduction environmental endocrine disrupters eeds also called endocrine disruptors or environmental hormones are exogenous compounds that if taken in can disturb the normal endocrine function of living bodies eeds found in different environmental media have been implicated in human dysplasia metabolic disorders and cancer aris 2014 paulose et al 2015 tse et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 the environmental hormone bisphenol a bpa has received substantial attention because it can disrupt the endocrine system huang et al 2012 aris 2014 chen et al 2016a hu et al 2017 because of its environmental persistence bioaccumulation semi volatilization and high toxicity bpa has been included in a blacklist of priority pollutants by some eu countries craig et al 2003 it has been widely detected in soil water and sediments food and the human body vom saal and welshons 2014 zimmers et al 2014 lu et al 2015 chen et al 2016a b park et al 2016 chemically described as 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bpa is used in a broad range of polymer materials and in the production of hundreds of products such as eye glasses food packaging baby bottles and coating of canned foods it is also used as a fire retardant antioxidant heat stabilizer and pesticide bhatnagar and anastopoulos 2017 studies have shown that bpa can enter the environment through industrial waste water sewage discharge and the improper disposal of solid waste resulting in harm to human health via the food chain vom saal and welshons 2014 zhao et al 2014 lv et al 2017 al saleh et al 2017 the yellow river offers abundant water resources and is important for both local residents and local economic development and is closely related to human production and life it has also become a source and sink of a wide range of pollutants li et al 2017a b shi et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zou et al 2015 detected bpa concentrations from 13 6 to 64 0 ng l in water and 0 559 to 2 73 µg kg in sediment in the yellow river estuary sediments in water bodies have become a key medium of organic pollutant migration and transformation and play an important role in the fate of pollutants and bio availability park et al 2016 sorption is an important means for migration of organic pollutants and has an important influence in their transfer and transformation in aquatic environments fent et al 2003 thus understanding the sorption desorption of bpa in an aquatic environment is vital to predicting its fate ying et al 2003 studied the sorption and degradation of bpa and four other eeds in sediment and showed that bpa is less readily absorbed than other eeds fent et al 2003 studied the sorption degradation of bpa on the soil particle and showed that bpa absorbed onto solid particles degraded more slowly than bpa in water they also found that bpa absorption onto sediment slows its degradation in the aquatic environment although extensive information on the toxicity degradation and distribution of bpa in different environmental media are available there are limited reports on the sorption desorption behavior of bpa onto soil or sediments jin and zhu 2016 saheli and rowe 2016 fei et al 2017 research on sorption desorption of organic pollutants in the yellow river which discharges more sediment than any other river is of great importance for understanding the progress of new environmental pollutants through the aquatic environment and evaluating the ecological risk thus this study was conducted to determine the sorption mechanisms of bpa on natural sediments based on the sorption coefficient the sorption enthalpy and other influential factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment samples the lanzhou section of the yellow river runs from the bapan gorge dam to anningdu ferry with a total length of 219 7 km the average runoff is 315 3 109 m3 more than half that of the entire river and the average annual flow is 950 m3 s with an average sediment concentration of 1 57 kg m3 this river section is the water source for urban residents as well as industrial and agricultural production it is also a sewage discharge area natural sediment samples were collected from three sites in the lanzhou section of the yellow river marked as hk sa and sc and the latitudes and longitudes of sites are 36 16 794 n 103 43 973e 36 09 317 n 103 68 786e and 36 14 652 n 104 00 968e respectively the sediment samples were air dried and sieved through a 0 30 mm mesh the fraction of total organic carbon in the sediment was measured by ignition at 550 c for removal of carbonates and labile organic matter jiang et al 2009 the particle size distributions of the sediment samples were measured by a particle size analyzer coulter ls 13320 beckman usa the specific surface area ssa was determined for the sediments by a surface analyzer coulter sa 3100 beckman usa using the multipoint brunauer emmett teller nitrogen adsorption method the physical and chemical properties of the sediments are shown in table 1 2 2 sorption desorption experiments sorption kinetics and thermodynamics were studied using batch equilibrium based on our previous study jiang et al 2016 desorption kinetics experiments were also carried out after the equilibrium was reached according to the adsorption kinetics experiment sorption desorption kinetics were studied in a separate set of experiments at a constant temperature 25 0 5 c sediment amount each 0 500 g and initial bpa concentration 50 ml 50 mg l each sorption reactor was withdrawn at suitable time intervals 0 5 1 2 4 6 9 12 16 and 24 h batch experiments of sorption desorption kinetics were conducted using 50 ml plastic screw capped bottles simultaneously in an incubator shaker at given time intervals at the selected time points the vials were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatants were removed for bpa quantification sorption isotherm experiments were conducted under a constant agitation rate 140 rpm initial ph 3 10 three temperatures 25 35 and 45 c different ion strengths sodion ions and calcium ions at 0 120 mg l and a bpa concentration from 1 to 18 mg l three sediment samples were used to study the sorption influence in different river sections the details of the three sediment samples are shown in table 1 solid and liquid phases in all experiments were separated at 4000 rpm in a centrifuge for 20 min finally bpa concentration in the liquid phase was detected using high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1260 hplc us all experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 kinetic adsorption models kinetic data can be used to determine the presence or absence of intraparticle diffusion and whether this is the rate controlling step the experimental data were processed using three kinetic adsorption models pseudo first order lagergren 1898 pseudo second order blanchard et al 1984 and intraparticle diffusion weber and morris 1963 the pseudo first order rate equation is 1 1 q t 1 q 1 k 1 q 1 t where q1 and qt are the amounts of pollutants adsorbed under equilibrium and at time t in mg g k1 is the adsorption constant in min 1 the pseudo second order kinetic model is 2 1 q t 1 k 2 q 2 2 t q 2 where q2 is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g qt is the amount of pollutant adsorbed under equilibrium at time t in mg g and k2 is the equilibrium rate constant in g mg min the intraparticle diffusion equation is 3 q t k p t 1 2 c where c is the intercept and kp is the rate constant in mg g min1 2 2 3 2 equilibrium adsorption models equilibrium sorption isotherms are one of the most important types of data to help us to understand the sorption mechanism three isotherm equations were used in this study freundlich langmuir and dubinin and radushkevich d r langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 dubinin and radushkevich 1947 the langmuir equation for a homogenous surface is expressed as follows 4 1 q s 1 k l q m c e 1 q m where qs is the quantity of pollutants adsorbed in mg g qm is the saturated quantity of pollutants adsorbed in mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of pollutants in aqueous solution in mg l and kl is the langmuir thermodynamic equilibrium constant the freundlich isotherm model is used to describe heterogeneous surfaces and is expressed as follows 5 lg q s lg k f 1 n lg c e where kf and n are constants related to sediment properties the d r model determines whether sorption is physical or chemical its linear form is expressed as follows 6 ln q s ln q m β ε 2 where qe is the amount of diesel oil adsorbed by sediment in mg g qm is the maximum sorption capacity in mg g β is the activity coefficient related to mean free energy of sorption and ε rtln 1 1 ce is the polanyi potential the mean free energy e kj mol was calculated using β 7 e 1 2 β and provides information about whether the sorption mechanism is physical 8 kj mol or chemical 8 16 kj mol 3 results and discussion 3 1 sorption kinetics fig 1 shows the kinetics curves for bpa adsorption onto sediments with sorption increasing rapidly as adsorption time increased from 0 to 6 h and gradually from 6 h until equilibrium was reached which can occur within 16 h fig 1 a unsurprisingly the concentration of bpa in solution decreased over time to reach a stable level fig 1 b hysteresis was also observed in the desorption process with part of the adsorbed bpa strongly retained by sediment sorption and thus it was no doubt that bpa concentrations from 13 6 to 64 0 ng l in water and 0 559 to 2 73 µg kg in sediment were detected in the yellow river estuary zou et al 2015 previous studies have shown that a rapid initial sorption of organic pollutants on natural absorbents is followed by a slow approach to equilibrium suggesting that the sorption rate of a generally porous medium mainly depends on the external and void diffusion rate of particles delle site 2001 distribution and sorption of organic pollutants is usually completed quickly in particles where the van der waals force dipole induced dipole and hydrogen bonding forces are the primary intermolecular interactions the slow sorption of organic pollutants in particles is because organic pollutants slowly diffused into the particles porosity and height of cross combination of the organic matter and other solid solution phases for organic pollutants to reach all of the sorption sites organic molecules must penetrate through water membrane into the parcel layer by diffusion then by pore diffusion into the particle pores and finally by diffusion through the substrate into the sediment phase therefore the diffusion coefficient of organic pollutants is inversely proportional to the diffusion results calculated from the three models are presented in table 2 the correlation coefficients obtained for the pseudo second order model are greater than those of the other models suggesting that this sorption system follows the pseudo second order kinetic model for all time periods the kinetic results were also analyzed using the intraparticle diffusion model as a result the plot of uptake qt vs the square root of time t 1 2 should be linear if intraparticle diffusion is involved in the sorption moreover intraparticle diffusion is the rate controlling step if these lines pass through the origin chen et al 2003 otherwise if the plots do not pass through the origin some degree of boundary layer control occurs and the intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step all of which may work simultaneously özcan et al 2005 the plot of qt vs t 1 2 for the sorption of bpa by the sampled sediment was linear and the lines pass through the origin fig 2 indicating that the intraparticle diffusion is dominant in the sorption process 3 2 sorption equilibrium the thermodynamic isothermal sorption curves of bpa at 25 35 and 45 c are shown in fig 3 all of the sorption parameters are presented in table 3 the freundlich model had higher regression coefficients than the other models suggesting it was most suitable for describing the isothermal sorption of bpa on the sample sediments and indicating a heterogeneous surface sorption furthermore the maximum sorption capacity tended to decrease with increasing systemic temperature e increased from 1 01 to 2 24 kj mol when the temperature increased from 25 to 45 c indicating physical sorption weber et al 1991 summarized the possible interactions between solute and sorbent into three categories physical chemical and electrostatic the relatively weak bonding forces associated with physical sorption are often amplified in the case of hydrophobic molecules by substantial thermodynamic gradients for repulsion from the solution in which they are dissolved akçay and akçay 2004 also reported that the sorption of two phenolic pollutants could be regarded as physical sorption onto bentonite delle site 2001 reported that physical sorption includes the combined contribution of π π interaction and hydrophobic interaction with π π interaction playing a dominant role in bpa sorption on particle surfaces 3 3 sorption thermodynamic characteristics thermodynamic parameters can help us to understand the inherent energetic changes involved in the sorption process furthermore there is a crucial data that provides information about the spontaneity endothermic or exothermic reaction of sorption and provides information about the potential increase or decrease of randomness at the solid liquid interface during the sorption process bhatnagar and anastopoulos 2017 changes in thermodynamic parameters such as free energy of sorption δgθ standard enthalpy δhθ and standard entropy changes δsθ were calculated based on the variations of kf and systematic temperature jiang et al 2016 the sorption associated δgθ δhθ and δsθ were calculated as follows 8 δ g θ r t ln k and 9 ln k δ h θ rt δ s θ r where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the sorption temperature the δgθ was negative at all temperatures table 4 confirming that sorption was spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable δgθ ranges from 0 to 20 kj mol in physical sorption and from 80 to 400 kj mol in chemical sorption in this study δgθ ranged from 6 98 to 6 27 kj mol indicating mainly physical sorption the negative δhθ suggested an exothermic sorption since sorption decreased with increasing temperature a δhθ of 2 10 20 9 kj mol suggests physical sorption and that of 80 0 200 kj mol suggests chemical sorption tian et al 2016 these results clearly suggest that physical sorption was the main sorption mechanism for the studied sediments though it was enhanced by chemical sorption the negative δsθ indicated decreased randomness at the solid liquid interface during the sorption process which contributed to the decrease of bpa sorption capacity at higher temperatures 3 4 effect of sediment samples from different river sections the sorption effects of the three sediment samples in different river sections are shown in fig 4 among the three sediment samples sc exhibited the highest bpa sorption capacity and hk the lowest table 3 this may be because sc had the smallest particle sizes because of its high clay fraction according to the particle size distribution whereas hk had larger particle sizes with a high fraction of sand table 1 more importantly sc had the second highest total organic carbon and highest ssa while hk had the lowest fom and ssa furthermore lanzhou is the only city that the yellow river passes through site sc was located in downstream of yellow river in the lanzhou section and showed a high fine particles input and a high organic content from urban sewage in this section this contrasts with hk which showed more coarse sand and a lower organic fraction in the sediment that mainly originated from the loess erosion on both sides of the yellow river the maximum adsorption capacity qm of the sediment samples used in the present study was well correlated with the tc or ssa values tables 1 and 3 which is in general agreement with previous studies on the adsorption of organic pollutants by soil and sediment chiou et al 1979 karickhoff et al 1979 sun et al 2012 fei et al 2017 3 5 effect of external factors on bpa sorption onto sediments 3 5 1 temperature temperature can be an important factor affecting the sorption process and has thus attracted considerable research attention it has two major effects on the sorption process increasing the temperature is known to increase the rate of diffusion of the adsorbate molecules across the external boundary layer and in the internal pores of the adsorbent particle owing to the decrease in the viscosity of the solution in addition changing the temperature will change the equilibrium capacity of the adsorbent for a particular adsorbate delle site 2001 in the current study the sorption capacity of bpa decreased from 0 515 to 0 357 mg g when the sorption temperature increased from 25 to 45 c fig 3 indicating an exothermic process with low temperatures more favorable for the sorption of bpa onto the sediment on the one hand the solubility of bpa decreased as the temperature increased which impeded sorption and decreased the sorption capacity on the other hand in the exothermic sorption process the trend of the adsorbate molecules transferring to the adsorbent surface was less than that of the escaping tendency from adsorbent surface to the solution with the increase of system temperature which leads to a decrease in the sorption ability of bpa on sediment particles 3 5 2 particle sizes three sediment particle sizes were studied and results showed that sorption capacity varied with sediment size fig 5 as particle size increased the sorption capacity decreased since sorption is a surface phenomenon smaller particle sizes offer a comparatively larger surface area and hence higher sorption occurs at equilibrium other studies have shown that the sorption capacity of organic pollutants increases as particle size decreases and hence as particle surface area increases for the same mass suggesting that this effect may be related to surface sorption which increases as surface area or number of sites increases delle site 2001 in addition small particles contain a high content of organic matter and many studies have shown that particles with high organic matter content have greater amounts of sorbed organic pollutants isaacson and frink 1984 suggested that a substantial contribution to phenolic compound sorption was made by a specific sorbate sorbent interaction the mechanism of sorption onto sediment is likely to involve extensive formation of hydroxyl bonds between phenolic hydroxyl groups and hydroxyl bonding sites on sediment organic matter this could explain the decrease in sorption capacity of bpa as particle size increased in the current study 3 5 3 ph values the ph values may affect the sorption of organic matter onto sediments in polluted water and are also a key factor controlling or affecting the fate of organic pollutants in particles delle site 2001 bhatnagar and anastopoulos 2017 in this study sorption capacity weakened as ph increased from 3 to 10 fig 6 bpa is a mildly acidic phenolic environmental hormone which is easily ionized under alkaline conditions studies have shown that molecules of organic pollutants are more likely to be adsorbed than those in ionic form ionization of bpa increases with increasing ph the quantity of anions in the whole system becomes higher and thus the electrostatic repulsion between sediments and bpa increases and the sorption capacity of bpa on sediment decreases therefore increasing ph will increase migration of bpa from sediments to solution in the water increasing environmental risk similar observations have been reported in other studies conducted at ph 7 which showed that the sorption capacity of bpa onto different absorbents declined at these higher ph levels guo et al 2011 xu et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 3 5 4 ionic strength and types sorption of a polar or ionizable compound such as bpa and other organic pollutants on soil or sediment may be strongly influenced by ionic strength and different ions delle site 2001 park and swift 2002 in the current study the sorption capacity of bpa on sediment increased as calcium ion concentration increased however sodion had the opposite effect with bpa sorption capacity decreasing with increasing sodion concentration fig 7 this may be because bpa easily combines with soil organic matter by bridging between the phenolic hydroxyl group of bpa and divalent calcium ions however sodion is a monovalent cation which cannot be chelated with the bpa molecule by bridging with the organic matter adsorbed bpa however can be dissolved by bonding with sodion thus reducing bpa sorption on sediment bayramoglu et al 2016 found a reduction in absorbed bpa amount with the increase of ionic strength they suggest that the salt ion can destroy the hydrogen bonding between bpa molecule and the adsorbent surface thus reducing the sorption efficiency furthermore since the sediment in yellow river mainly comes from loess erosion on both sides of the yellow
