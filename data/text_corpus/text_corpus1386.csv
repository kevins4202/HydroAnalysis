6930,a rigorous mathematical framework is presented for the development of a set of coupled partial differential equations to describe the consolidation of saturated soils under the simultaneous action of external static loads and gravity forces these equations generalize the biot model of poroelasticity in a systematic manner to well account for additional momentum exchange arising from the physical mechanisms involved in gravitational compaction due to changes in volumetric fraction and material density of each constituent a boundary value problem is then formulated as a representative example to quantitatively examine gravity effect on the dissipation of excess pore fluid pressure and settlement magnitude and is solved numerically in a finite difference scheme in the current study the boundary conditions have been directly calculated in numerical scheme which improves previous studies to avoid using the approximation of the trapezoidal rule a physically consistent parameter derived fundamentally from the first principle balance of momentum is proposed for the first time which provides an exact measure of the degree to which variations in final total settlement occur due to the presence of gravity effect this dimensionless parameter takes a closed form expression that refines our foregoing works and is quite general since it is applicable to both saturated and variably saturated soils our studies show that the variations are essentially controlled by soil elasticity modulus and height as well as a derived gravity factor this factor underlines the importance of the dependency between consolidation behaviors and distinct physical properties of pore fluids lastly a comparative study is carried out indicating that gravity forces yield more significant impact on unsaturated soils than saturated soils we examined leading to more relative increment in the final total settlement keywords poroelasticity consolidation gravity effect saturated soils unsaturated soils 1 introduction the last several decades have brought impressive advances in the theoretical modeling of the simultaneous transient fluid flow and skeleton deformation in natural porous formations in response to changes in pore fluid pressure or total stress because it has been an issue of increasing importance covering an enormous range of practical engineering applications from hydrogeology wang 2000 geomechanics selvadurai and suvorov 2017 soil mechanics borja et al 2012 environmental engineering roberts et al 2001 petroleum engineering beresnev and johnson 1994 to biomechanics cowin 1999 we have successfully moved away from the traditional uncoupling approach employed widely in classic subsurface hydrology to a more physically consistent coupling framework biot 1956 1962 lo et al 2005 in the former the macroscopic state variables of two immiscible constituents i e solid and fluid are dealt with in a separate independent manner whereas the latter rigorously treats them on an equal footing biot 1956 1962 wang 2000 the consequence of this sharper view in turn leads to the development of a set of coupled partial differential equations for momentum balance of solid and fluid closured by constitutive linear stress strain relationships due to the existence of a large number of dependent variables now known as the theory of poroelasticity biot 1956 1962 wang 2000 lo et al 2009 the predictive mathematical description of intricate hydromechanical coupling between the solid skeleton and the interstitial fluid was initiated in a systematic way by biot 1941 in conjunction with exploring a better understanding of consolidation behavior in a saturated porous medium a dimensionless variable termed loading efficiency was introduced therein to quantify the degree to which an external load is delivered to the interstitial fluid at the instant when the load is applied under undrained conditions biot 1941 as opposed to the conventional uncoupling approach postulating simply that it is entirely borne by the interstitial fluid terzaghi 1943 an expanding body of recent literatures has attested to the accuracy of poroelasticity theory in providing the detailed description of the intimate coupling between pore fluid pressure and solid stress undergoing dynamic cheng 2016 tuncay and corapcioglu 1997 and quasi static chandler and johnson 1981 lewis and schrefler 1998 processes involved in spite of these significant research efforts gravitational compaction resulted from variations in material density buoyancy of each phase and those in its volumetric fraction has been long neglected in the study of consolidation in fluid bearing porous media in part because constitutive relationship connecting these variations to stress or strain variables is not well established and in part because this effect creates additional source terms thus making the analytical way to obtain closed form solutions unavailable perhaps the earliest physically based theory to account for the effect of body gravity forces on consolidation in water saturated soils was proposed by gibson et al 1981 in a lagrangian coordinate frame with finite strains in an eulerian formulation mei 1985 extended the biot model equations to allow variations in mass content caused by porosity changes to provide an additional source to external mechanical load a corresponding boundary value problem was setup and then solved analytically using laplace transformation in lieu of the application of surface loading tseng et al 2008 employed the theory of poroelasticity to evaluate consolidation in a clay aquitard which is sandwiched by two aquifers besides gravity effect aquitard settlement is also induced by groundwater withdrawal from the top and bottom aquifers lo et al 2017 have recently developed a unifying approach to incorporating variations in material density and volumetric fraction of fluids and solid as dynamic variables for the quantitative investigation of the impact of gravitational body forces on consolidation in unsaturated porous media however saturated and unsaturated soils essentially behave in a very different mechanical manner for instance one of notable discrepancies is that at the full saturation interstitial water sustains almost the entire external load at the instance when it is applied to clay under an undrained condition but only 20 of the load is carried by pore water as initial water saturation is 75 lo et al 2014 indeed predictive capabilities of relevance to how gravity effect attributed to changes in material density and volumetric fraction of each phase affects the excess pore water pressure dissipation and settlement magnitude in consolidation of saturated soils still remain severely limited a comprehensive analysis thus needs to be undertaken for identifying these changes and quantifying their impact on consolidation process the present paper is intended as a contribution to address these pragmatic issues and thus organized as follows first we shall begin by developing a general theoretical framework for constructing the poroelastic representation of rigorous macroscopic coupled partial differential equations that are comprehensive enough to encompass the combined effect of external loads and body gravity forces on consolidation in an elastic porous medium containing one compressible viscous fluid equations are derived by integrating the fundamental law of mass balance to relate variations in volumetric fraction and material density of each constituent to solid deformation and fluid pressure as primary variables as an illustrative example to examine gravity effect a boundary value problem based on our model equations is then formulated which is solved numerically in a finite difference scheme with elasticity parameters and hydraulic data applicable to unconsolidated clay lastly a comparative analysis is conducted to quantitatively assess the impact of gravity forces on the dissipation of pore fluid pressure and final total settlement in both saturated and unsaturated soils 2 model equations the momentum balance equations for a deformable homogeneous porous medium permeated by two immiscible viscous compressible fluids were developed by lo et al 2002 using continuum mechanics of mixtures truesdell 1969 as specialized to the case of a porous medium permeated only by a single fluid these equations reduce to the well known biot 1962 model of poroelasticity when extended to account for momentum exchange arising from gravitational compaction due to changes in material density and volumetric fraction of each constituent these equations under the isothermal and quasi static conditions i e the second order time derivative terms being negligible take the linearized form as 1 1 r ff u f t u s t ϕ 0 p f δ ρ f ϕ 0 g ρ f 0 δ ϕ g 0 1 2 t s ϕ 0 p f δ ρ f ϕ 0 g ρ f 0 δ ϕ g δ ρ s 1 ϕ 0 g ρ s 0 δ ϕ g 0 where ρ α represents the material density of phase α the subscript α signifying the two immiscible phases solid α s and fluid α f henceforth termed water u s and u f express the displacement vectors for the solid and water phases respectively ϕ denotes the porosity p f designates the incremental gauge or excess pore water pressure t s signifies the stress applied to the solid phase in the porous medium τ t s ϕ 0 p f refers to the total stress tensor for the porous medium biot 1962 lo et al 2002 g is the gravitational acceleration r ff ϕ 2 b f is the constitutive coefficient related to viscous drag caused by velocity differences between the solid and water phases b f k s η f indicating the mobility of the water phase ks being the intrinsic permeability of the porous framework and η f being the dynamic shear viscosity of the water phase according to the theory of poroelasticity biot 1962 wang 2000 an elastic porous medium undergoes very small deformations in a reversible thermodynamic process so the value of a physical property induced in the current deformed configuration can be evaluated by the value in the reference undeformed configuration denoted by a superscript 0 taken as the initial state before the application of an external load plus the difference between the current and reference values denoted by capital delta δ e g the material density of water ρ f in the current configuration is determined by ρ f ρ f 0 δ ρ f thus in this small strain regime it is accurate to neglect the second order terms in eq 1 such as δ ρ f δ θ f i e only the first order terms e g δ ρ f θ f 0 being retained the parameter r ff is thus evaluated in a reference configuration we note in passing that borja and alarcón 1995 formulated a set of balance equations and constitutive relationships to describe the nonlinearity effect due to finite deformations on consolidation of water saturated soils using the jacobian for the mapping between the reference and current coordinates the mathematical framework was later extended by song and borja 2014 to take into account the effect under partial saturation situation since the pore space is entirely saturated by water i e θ f 0 ϕ 0 and θ s 0 1 ϕ 0 one can show δ θ s δ ϕ which has been implicitly imposed in eq 1 2 by taking divergence of both sides of eq 1 1 we have 2 r ff ε t e t ϕ 0 g δ ρ f z ρ f 0 g δ ϕ z ϕ 0 2 p f where e u s and ε u f designate the dilatations of the solid and water phases respectively z is defined as being positive upward following lo et al 2005 the linearized form of mass balance equations applied to the water and solid phases in a homogeneous medium can be respectively written as 3 1 ρ s 0 δ ϕ 1 ϕ 0 δ ρ s ρ s 0 1 ϕ 0 e 3 2 ρ f 0 δ ϕ ϕ 0 δ ρ f ρ f 0 ϕ 0 ε employing a variational principle based on a general form of the strain energy function for a macroscopic continuum biot 1956 developed the linear stress strain relations for a porous medium bearing one fluid 4 1 t s 2 g e a e q ε δ 4 2 ϕ 0 p f q e r ε where a q and r are elasticity coefficients defined by biot 1956 under the concept of the total stress of the bulk porous material biot 1962 the total stress τ t s ϕ 0 p f placed on the skeleton of a fully saturated porous medium is borne in part by the stress applied to the solid t s and in part by the force acting on the fluid ϕ 0 p f in accordance with the classic biot willis 1957 thought experiments these elasticity coefficients can be expressed in terms of porosity and four measurable parameters the bulk modulus of the fluid phase k f and that of the solid phase k s the shear modulus of the porous medium framework g and its bulk modulus k b see appendix a in view of eq 4 2 ε can be expressed in terms of e and p f 5 ε q 1 p f q 2 e where the parameters q 1 and q 2 are equal to 6 1 q 1 ϕ 0 r 1 ϕ 0 m 6 2 q 2 q r α ϕ 0 1 in eq 6 1 and 6 2 α 1 k b k s denotes the biot willis coefficient biot 1957 wang 2000 and m q ϕ 0 α ϕ 0 is the biot elasticity coefficient biot 1962 substituting eq 5 into eq 3 2 one can obtain 7 ρ f 0 δ ϕ ϕ 0 δ ρ f ρ f 0 ϕ 0 q 1 p f ρ f 0 ϕ 0 q 2 e incorporation of eqs 5 and 7 into eq 2 gives rise to 8 1 q 1 p f t q 2 1 e t ρ f 0 ϕ 0 g r ff q 1 p f z q 2 e z ϕ 0 r ff 2 p f eq 8 1 can be alternatively reorganized as 8 2 1 m p f t α e t b f ρ f 0 ϕ 0 g q 1 p f z q 2 e z b f 2 p f which generalizes eq 4 4 in biot 1941 to take account of gravity effect i e the third and fourth terms in like manner after combination of eqs 3 1 3 2 and 5 one can recast eq 1 2 as 9 τ θ s e θ f p f k 0 where k is the unit vector along the coordinate axis of z and the parameters θ s together with θ f that are of relevance to gravity forces are defined by ρ s 0 1 ϕ 0 ρ f 0 ϕ 0 q 2 g and ρ f 0 ϕ 0 q 1 g respectively changes in material density are primarily due to variations in stress since an isothermal condition is considered in the current study by virtue of eqs 10 a10 and a12 in lo et al 2014 we have 10 τ 2 g e k b 2 3 g e α p f δ where e 1 2 u s u s t represents the strain tensor for the solid phase the superscript t denoting the transpose accordingly eq 9 can be arranged as 11 g 2 u s g 1 2 υ e α p f θ s e θ f p f k 0 where υ denotes the poisson ratio eq 11 extends eq 4 1 in biot 1941 to include gravitational body forces i e the fourth and fifth terms next we take divergence at both sides of eq 11 the resulting equation is of the form 12 k b 4 3 g 2 e α 2 p f θ s e z θ f p f z 0 eqs 8 2 and 12 constitute two coupled partial differential equations that provide a mathematical framework for the analysis of variations in e and p f due to three dimensional consolidation in saturated soils subject to gravitational fields it should be also noted that the physical parameters g m k b b f α θ s and θ f in eqs 8 2 and 12 are evaluated in a reference configuration since we are dealing with an elastic porous medium undergoing very small deformations the central problem in the standard consolidation theory for saturated soils biot 1941 1956 1962 terzaghi 1943 wang 2000 3 one dimensional consolidation for uniaxial strain consolidation i e e xx e yy 0 e e zz w z all dependent variables are functions only of the vertical coordinate z

the displacement vector of the solid phase along the vertical z direction eq 13 with p f and w z being the dependent variables contains two coupled partial differential equations that govern one dimensional consolidation in saturated soils under gravity effect 4 initial and boundary conditions a complete solution of eq 13 for describing the problem of soil consolidation requires two boundary conditions along with an initial condition prescribed for p f and w z respectively let us consider an instantaneous response where the interstitial fluid can neither escape nor enter the deforming soil i e e ε undranined conditions as the surface stress p is applied at t 0 thus leading excess pore fluid pressures to develop inside the soil it follows from eqs 5 and 6 1 and 6 2 that a direct relationship connecting p f to w z can be established 14 1 p f z 0 1 q 2 q 1 w z α m w z combination of eqs 10 and 14 1 gives rise to a mathematical expression that links τ zz and w z by 14 2 τ zz z 0 p k v u w z where k v u k b 4 3 g α 2 m is the undrained vertical bulk modulus lo and sposito 2013 accordingly one may plug eq 14 into eq 9 in turn yielding 15 k v u z w z z 0 θ s α m θ f w z z 0 0 eq 15 implies that the general solution of w z z 0 has to be of the form 16 w z z 0 c 1 exp π k v u z where π θ s α m θ f at the top surface z h of the soil layer the total stress τ zz h t equals to the applied compression load p thus upon putting eq 16 into eq 14 2 one may obtain 17 p k v u c 1 exp π k v u h the coefficient c 1 can be determined by 18 c 1 p k v u exp π k v u h in view of eqs 16 and 18 the complete solution of w z z 0 can be found to be 19 w z z 0 p k v u exp π k v u h z using eq 19 to eliminate w z in eq 14 1 one can get 20 p f z 0 γ p exp π k v u h z where γ α m k v u denotes loading efficiency eq 20 is the generalization of the biot 1941 model eq 5 7 to account for gravitational body forces in reference to the boundary conditions we consider a homogeneous soil layer where the top z h and bottom z 0 surfaces are fully permeable with respect to water i e 21 p f 0 t p f h t 0 since τ zz h t p eqs 10 and 21 imply 22 p k b 4 3 g w z h t it follows from eq 22 that we have 23 w z h t p k b 4 3 g as far as the bottom surface z 0 is concerned the static equilibrium of forces requires that p be balanced by the total stress plus the gravity field caused by variations in material density and volumetric fraction of the solid and fluid phases see also eq 1 2 24 τ zz 0 t p 0 h g δ ρ s 1 ϕ 0 ρ s 0 δ ϕ ϕ 0 δ ρ f ρ f 0 δ ϕ d z with the help of eqs 3 1 7 10 and 21 eq 24 can be recast as 25 k b 4 3 g w z 0 t p 0 h θ s w z θ f p f d z the definite integral in eq 25 contains the dependent variables p f and w z that need to be determined with their corresponding boundary conditions already prescribed in eqs 21 and 23 instead of applying the trapezoidal rule to approximate the definite integral in eq 25 as we achieved in lo et al 2017 the finite difference scheme is utilized to directly discretize eq 25 in the current study 5 discretisation and numerical solutions the spatial and temporal discretisations of the numerical solution to eq 13 as well as the initial and boundary conditions in eqs 19 20 21 23 and 25 are undertaken using the finite difference schemes the second order central difference approximation and first order forward difference approximation are respectively adopted in the spatial and temporal domains which thus allow us to discretize eq 13 in the form 1 m p f k n 1 p f k n δ t α w k n 1 w k n δ t b f p f k 1 n 2 p f k n p f k 1 n δ z 2 26 1 b f ρ f 0 g q 1 p f k 1 n p f k 1 n 2 δ z b f ρ f 0 g q 2 w k 1 n w k 1 n 2 δ z k b 4 3 g w k 1 n 1 2 w k n 1 w k 1 n 1 δ z 2 α p f k 1 n 1 2 p f k n 1 p f k 1 n 1 δ z 2 26 2 θ s w k 1 n 1 w k 1 n 1 2 δ z θ f p f k 1 n 1 p f k 1 n 1 2 δ z 0 where δ t and δ z denote respectively the uniform time step and uniform grid size p f k n and w k n k 1 2 k t n 0 1 n t represent the value of p f and w w z evaluated at the grid point k with respect to the time step n correspondingly the subscripts k 1 and k k t indicate respectively the bottom and top boundaries of the soil layer so that k t h δ z 1 whereas the superscripts n 0 and n n t designate correspondingly the initial and total time steps as a consequence the initial conditions in eqs 19 and 20 can be expressed as 27 1 w k 0 p k v u exp π k v u h k 1 δ z 27 2 p 1 k 0 γ p exp π k v u h k 1 δ z the boundary conditions in eqs 21 23 and 25 can be written as 28 1 p f 1 n p f k t n 0 w 1 n p k b 4 3 g 1 k b 4 3 g θ s 1 2 w 1 n 2 k t 1 w k n

29 s t 0 h w z d z k 1 k t 1 w k n δ z k 2 k t w k n δ z 2 after application of eq 26 to each grid point at each time step under the initial and boundary conditions prescribed in eqs 27 and 28 a set of linear simultaneous algebraic equations can be then developed the solution for excess pore water pressure together with total settlement can be in turn obtained after using the gauss jordan elimination to find the inverse of the coefficient matrix of the simultaneous algebraic equations all numerical calculations are carried out in fortran it is noted that an explicit forward finite difference scheme is conditionally stable and convergent therefore a small time step needs to be implemented to keep the error in the result bounded thus a finite difference framework with a time step δ t 1 sec and a space increment δ z 0 25 m is used for numerical calculations 6 results and discussions to verify the accuracy of our numerical scheme the result evaluated using eqs 26 29 is compared to the exact solution determined based on the biot model equation of consolidation subject to the undrained initial condition i e p f z 0 γ p and the fully permeable boundary conditions i e p f 0 t p f h t 0 under the conventional premise where gravity effects are ignored see also in appendix b a water saturated soil with clay texture is selected as a representative example table 1 lists the values of applied stress together with soil elasticity and hydraulic parameters necessary for numerical calculations fig 1 illustrates the dependence of the dimensionless pore water pressure p f p on the dimensional depth z h at t 1 min 1 day and 1 month obtained from the numerical scheme and exact solution respectively the corresponding relationship between the total settlement s t and the elapsed time is graphically represented in fig 2 it is clear from figs 1 and 2 that irrespective of the dimensionless pore water pressure and total settlement the result computed from our numerical scheme is in excellent agreement with the exact solution given in eqs b6 and b9 the effect of gravitational body forces on the dimensionless pore water pressure is described in fig 3 as a function of the dimensional depth at t 1 min 1 day and 1 month as indicated in fig 3 the spatial distribution of excess pore water pressure after gravity effect is well represented is no longer symmetric a feature characteristic of the circumstance with neglect of gravity forces to evaluate the impact of gravity forces in a more quantitative way we compute the relative difference in the dimensionless pore water pressure in fig 4 this difference is defined as the variations in dimensionless pore water pressures with and without gravity forces divided by the latter one can find from fig 4 that the impact becomes more significant as the depth is greater a direct consequence due to the balance of momentum the relative difference attributed to this effect is approximately 8 at t 1 month occurring at the bottom of soil sample it can be also observed that greater pore water pressure is built due to the existence of gravity effect this can be understood since pore water needs to sustain gravity forces in addition to external static loads leading excess pressure to take more time for dissipation fig 5 presents the variations in total settlement induced by the inclusion of gravity forces it can be seen that if these forces are taken into account more total settlement is generated to gain more physical insight into individual hydromechanical behaviors in saturated and unsaturated soils responding to consolidation caused by the simultaneous presence of external constant loads and gravity forces a comparative study is carried out with respect to different initial water saturation levels at s 2 0 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 fig 6 shows the result for variations in pore water pressure dissipation as changes in initial water saturation at different dimensionless depths revealing evidently that the pore water pressure dissipation is indeed affected by the addition of gravity forces the effect is more significant in unsaturated soils than saturated soils making the curve more non symmetric in fact a physical dimensionless parameter can be defined to characterize gravity effect in more details let us revisit eq 11 in z direction 30 k b 4 3 g z w z α p f z θ s w z θ f p f 0 as t consolidation process terminates excess pore water pressure completely dissipates i e p f z t 0 which in turn leads eq 30 to reduce to 31 z w z z t θ s k b 4 3 g w z z t a general solution of eq 31 can be found to be 32 w z z t c 2 exp θ s k b 4 3 g z it follows from eqs 23 and 32 that c 2 can be determined to be 33 c 2 p k b 4 3 g exp θ s k b 4 3 g h this implies that the formal solution of w z z t takes the form 34 w z z t p k b 4 3 g exp θ s k b 4 3 g h z it is noted that eq 34 is also mathematically correct to satisfy the boundary condition at the bottom z 0 prescribed in eq 25 as t one can find that as gravity forces are neglected i e θ s 0 eq 34 takes the value of p k b 4 3 g which is consistent with the result shown in lo et al 2014 as a consequence the final total settlement in saturated soils with gravitational body forces included can be calculated by 35 s b t 0 h w z z t d z p θ s 1 exp θ s h k b 4 3 g for the same spirit one can start from eq 8 in lo et al 2017 to demonstrate that eq 35 is quite general also hold for unsaturated soils with the extension of the gravity factor θ s to be formulated in terms of the physical properties of two immiscible fluids i e ρ 1 0 θ 1 0 d 1 ρ 2 0 θ 2 0 d 4 ρ s 0 θ s 0 g lo et al 2017 see also appendix c this refines our previous result eq 30 in lo et al 2017 to avoid using the trapezoidal rule to approximate the integral therefore a dimensionless parameter γ can be then defined to physically quantify the effect of gravitational body forces on the final total settlement in saturated and unsaturated soils as 36 γ s b t s t s t 1 k b 4 3 g θ s h 1 exp θ s h k b 4 3 g which in a mathematical sense is an indicator of the relative difference in the final total settlement with the presence of the gravitational body forces to that evaluated by neglecting those forces fig 7 shows the relationship between the dimensionless parameter γ and soil sample length with respect to different initial water saturations s 2 0 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 examining fig 7 one can observe that more final total settlement is induced when gravity effect is included which increases with an increase in soil sample length but decreases with an increase in initial water saturation 7 conclusions despite that theory of poroelasticity has become an effective and accurate approach to analyzing the intricate mechanical behavior of a fluid bearing porous medium momentum exchange arising from variations in material density and volumetric fraction of all constituents caused by gravity effect has been long ignored equations 8 2 and 12 the principle results of the current study are derived in a systematic way to incorporate the contribution from these variations as additional physical terms into the biot model of poroelasticity thus providing a more general detailed description of consolidation in saturated soils a boundary value problem used as a representative example for a close examination of gravity effect on pore water pressure dissipation and total settlement is accordingly formulated eqs 13 19 21 23 and 25 and solved numerically eqs 26 29 based on a simpler one dimension representation of our model equations we also demonstrate that a generalized mathematical expression eq 35 can be directly developed from momentum balance to analytically quantify the final total settlement induced by the simultaneous action of gravity forces and external loads in both saturated and unsaturated soils this expression is completely in a closed form which improves our previous works without invoking integral approximation a gravity factor contained in this expression is crucial in reflecting the existence of distinct physical properties of pore fluids thus by defining a dimensionless parameter eq 36 we show that the relative increase in the final total settlement due to the presence of gravity effect is more significant in unsaturated soils than in saturated soils which is inversely proportional to initial water saturations at the range we examined acknowledgments this work is supported financially by the taiwan ministry of science and technology most under contract number 104 2628 e 006 017 my2 to national

6930,a rigorous mathematical framework is presented for the development of a set of coupled partial differential equations to describe the consolidation of saturated soils under the simultaneous action of external static loads and gravity forces these equations generalize the biot model of poroelasticity in a systematic manner to well account for additional momentum exchange arising from the physical mechanisms involved in gravitational compaction due to changes in volumetric fraction and material density of each constituent a boundary value problem is then formulated as a representative example to quantitatively examine gravity effect on the dissipation of excess pore fluid pressure and settlement magnitude and is solved numerically in a finite difference scheme in the current study the boundary conditions have been directly calculated in numerical scheme which improves previous studies to avoid using the approximation of the trapezoidal rule a physically consistent parameter derived fundamentally from the first principle balance of momentum is proposed for the first time which provides an exact measure of the degree to which variations in final total settlement occur due to the presence of gravity effect this dimensionless parameter takes a closed form expression that refines our foregoing works and is quite general since it is applicable to both saturated and variably saturated soils our studies show that the variations are essentially controlled by soil elasticity modulus and height as well as a derived gravity factor this factor underlines the importance of the dependency between consolidation behaviors and distinct physical properties of pore fluids lastly a comparative study is carried out indicating that gravity forces yield more significant impact on unsaturated soils than saturated soils we examined leading to more relative increment in the final total settlement keywords poroelasticity consolidation gravity effect saturated soils unsaturated soils 1 introduction the last several decades have brought impressive advances in the theoretical modeling of the simultaneous transient fluid flow and skeleton deformation in natural porous formations in response to changes in pore fluid pressure or total stress because it has been an issue of increasing importance covering an enormous range of practical engineering applications from hydrogeology wang 2000 geomechanics selvadurai and suvorov 2017 soil mechanics borja et al 2012 environmental engineering roberts et al 2001 petroleum engineering beresnev and johnson 1994 to biomechanics cowin 1999 we have successfully moved away from the traditional uncoupling approach employed widely in classic subsurface hydrology to a more physically consistent coupling framework biot 1956 1962 lo et al 2005 in the former the macroscopic state variables of two immiscible constituents i e solid and fluid are dealt with in a separate independent manner whereas the latter rigorously treats them on an equal footing biot 1956 1962 wang 2000 the consequence of this sharper view in turn leads to the development of a set of coupled partial differential equations for momentum balance of solid and fluid closured by constitutive linear stress strain relationships due to the existence of a large number of dependent variables now known as the theory of poroelasticity biot 1956 1962 wang 2000 lo et al 2009 the predictive mathematical description of intricate hydromechanical coupling between the solid skeleton and the interstitial fluid was initiated in a systematic way by biot 1941 in conjunction with exploring a better understanding of consolidation behavior in a saturated porous medium a dimensionless variable termed loading efficiency was introduced therein to quantify the degree to which an external load is delivered to the interstitial fluid at the instant when the load is applied under undrained conditions biot 1941 as opposed to the conventional uncoupling approach postulating simply that it is entirely borne by the interstitial fluid terzaghi 1943 an expanding body of recent literatures has attested to the accuracy of poroelasticity theory in providing the detailed description of the intimate coupling between pore fluid pressure and solid stress undergoing dynamic cheng 2016 tuncay and corapcioglu 1997 and quasi static chandler and johnson 1981 lewis and schrefler 1998 processes involved in spite of these significant research efforts gravitational compaction resulted from variations in material density buoyancy of each phase and those in its volumetric fraction has been long neglected in the study of consolidation in fluid bearing porous media in part because constitutive relationship connecting these variations to stress or strain variables is not well established and in part because this effect creates additional source terms thus making the analytical way to obtain closed form solutions unavailable perhaps the earliest physically based theory to account for the effect of body gravity forces on consolidation in water saturated soils was proposed by gibson et al 1981 in a lagrangian coordinate frame with finite strains in an eulerian formulation mei 1985 extended the biot model equations to allow variations in mass content caused by porosity changes to provide an additional source to external mechanical load a corresponding boundary value problem was setup and then solved analytically using laplace transformation in lieu of the application of surface loading tseng et al 2008 employed the theory of poroelasticity to evaluate consolidation in a clay aquitard which is sandwiched by two aquifers besides gravity effect aquitard settlement is also induced by groundwater withdrawal from the top and bottom aquifers lo et al 2017 have recently developed a unifying approach to incorporating variations in material density and volumetric fraction of fluids and solid as dynamic variables for the quantitative investigation of the impact of gravitational body forces on consolidation in unsaturated porous media however saturated and unsaturated soils essentially behave in a very different mechanical manner for instance one of notable discrepancies is that at the full saturation interstitial water sustains almost the entire external load at the instance when it is applied to clay under an undrained condition but only 20 of the load is carried by pore water as initial water saturation is 75 lo et al 2014 indeed predictive capabilities of relevance to how gravity effect attributed to changes in material density and volumetric fraction of each phase affects the excess pore water pressure dissipation and settlement magnitude in consolidation of saturated soils still remain severely limited a comprehensive analysis thus needs to be undertaken for identifying these changes and quantifying their impact on consolidation process the present paper is intended as a contribution to address these pragmatic issues and thus organized as follows first we shall begin by developing a general theoretical framework for constructing the poroelastic representation of rigorous macroscopic coupled partial differential equations that are comprehensive enough to encompass the combined effect of external loads and body gravity forces on consolidation in an elastic porous medium containing one compressible viscous fluid equations are derived by integrating the fundamental law of mass balance to relate variations in volumetric fraction and material density of each constituent to solid deformation and fluid pressure as primary variables as an illustrative example to examine gravity effect a boundary value problem based on our model equations is then formulated which is solved numerically in a finite difference scheme with elasticity parameters and hydraulic data applicable to unconsolidated clay lastly a comparative analysis is conducted to quantitatively assess the impact of gravity forces on the dissipation of pore fluid pressure and final total settlement in both saturated and unsaturated soils 2 model equations the momentum balance equations for a deformable homogeneous porous medium permeated by two immiscible viscous compressible fluids were developed by lo et al 2002 using continuum mechanics of mixtures truesdell 1969 as specialized to the case of a porous medium permeated only by a single fluid these equations reduce to the well known biot 1962 model of poroelasticity when extended to account for momentum exchange arising from gravitational compaction due to changes in material density and volumetric fraction of each constituent these equations under the isothermal and quasi static conditions i e the second order time derivative terms being negligible take the linearized form as 1 1 r ff u f t u s t ϕ 0 p f δ ρ f ϕ 0 g ρ f 0 δ ϕ g 0 1 2 t s ϕ 0 p f δ ρ f ϕ 0 g ρ f 0 δ ϕ g δ ρ s 1 ϕ 0 g ρ s 0 δ ϕ g 0 where ρ α represents the material density of phase α the subscript α signifying the two immiscible phases solid α s and fluid α f henceforth termed water u s and u f express the displacement vectors for the solid and water phases respectively ϕ denotes the porosity p f designates the incremental gauge or excess pore water pressure t s signifies the stress applied to the solid phase in the porous medium τ t s ϕ 0 p f refers to the total stress tensor for the porous medium biot 1962 lo et al 2002 g is the gravitational acceleration r ff ϕ 2 b f is the constitutive coefficient related to viscous drag caused by velocity differences between the solid and water phases b f k s η f indicating the mobility of the water phase ks being the intrinsic permeability of the porous framework and η f being the dynamic shear viscosity of the water phase according to the theory of poroelasticity biot 1962 wang 2000 an elastic porous medium undergoes very small deformations in a reversible thermodynamic process so the value of a physical property induced in the current deformed configuration can be evaluated by the value in the reference undeformed configuration denoted by a superscript 0 taken as the initial state before the application of an external load plus the difference between the current and reference values denoted by capital delta δ e g the material density of water ρ f in the current configuration is determined by ρ f ρ f 0 δ ρ f thus in this small strain regime it is accurate to neglect the second order terms in eq 1 such as δ ρ f δ θ f i e only the first order terms e g δ ρ f θ f 0 being retained the parameter r ff is thus evaluated in a reference configuration we note in passing that borja and alarcón 1995 formulated a set of balance equations and constitutive relationships to describe the nonlinearity effect due to finite deformations on consolidation of water saturated soils using the jacobian for the mapping between the reference and current coordinates the mathematical framework was later extended by song and borja 2014 to take into account the effect under partial saturation situation since the pore space is entirely saturated by water i e θ f 0 ϕ 0 and θ s 0 1 ϕ 0 one can show δ θ s δ ϕ which has been implicitly imposed in eq 1 2 by taking divergence of both sides of eq 1 1 we have 2 r ff ε t e t ϕ 0 g δ ρ f z ρ f 0 g δ ϕ z ϕ 0 2 p f where e u s and ε u f designate the dilatations of the solid and water phases respectively z is defined as being positive upward following lo et al 2005 the linearized form of mass balance equations applied to the water and solid phases in a homogeneous medium can be respectively written as 3 1 ρ s 0 δ ϕ 1 ϕ 0 δ ρ s ρ s 0 1 ϕ 0 e 3 2 ρ f 0 δ ϕ ϕ 0 δ ρ f ρ f 0 ϕ 0 ε employing a variational principle based on a general form of the strain energy function for a macroscopic continuum biot 1956 developed the linear stress strain relations for a porous medium bearing one fluid 4 1 t s 2 g e a e q ε δ 4 2 ϕ 0 p f q e r ε where a q and r are elasticity coefficients defined by biot 1956 under the concept of the total stress of the bulk porous material biot 1962 the total stress τ t s ϕ 0 p f placed on the skeleton of a fully saturated porous medium is borne in part by the stress applied to the solid t s and in part by the force acting on the fluid ϕ 0 p f in accordance with the classic biot willis 1957 thought experiments these elasticity coefficients can be expressed in terms of porosity and four measurable parameters the bulk modulus of the fluid phase k f and that of the solid phase k s the shear modulus of the porous medium framework g and its bulk modulus k b see appendix a in view of eq 4 2 ε can be expressed in terms of e and p f 5 ε q 1 p f q 2 e where the parameters q 1 and q 2 are equal to 6 1 q 1 ϕ 0 r 1 ϕ 0 m 6 2 q 2 q r α ϕ 0 1 in eq 6 1 and 6 2 α 1 k b k s denotes the biot willis coefficient biot 1957 wang 2000 and m q ϕ 0 α ϕ 0 is the biot elasticity coefficient biot 1962 substituting eq 5 into eq 3 2 one can obtain 7 ρ f 0 δ ϕ ϕ 0 δ ρ f ρ f 0 ϕ 0 q 1 p f ρ f 0 ϕ 0 q 2 e incorporation of eqs 5 and 7 into eq 2 gives rise to 8 1 q 1 p f t q 2 1 e t ρ f 0 ϕ 0 g r ff q 1 p f z q 2 e z ϕ 0 r ff 2 p f eq 8 1 can be alternatively reorganized as 8 2 1 m p f t α e t b f ρ f 0 ϕ 0 g q 1 p f z q 2 e z b f 2 p f which generalizes eq 4 4 in biot 1941 to take account of gravity effect i e the third and fourth terms in like manner after combination of eqs 3 1 3 2 and 5 one can recast eq 1 2 as 9 τ θ s e θ f p f k 0 where k is the unit vector along the coordinate axis of z and the parameters θ s together with θ f that are of relevance to gravity forces are defined by ρ s 0 1 ϕ 0 ρ f 0 ϕ 0 q 2 g and ρ f 0 ϕ 0 q 1 g respectively changes in material density are primarily due to variations in stress since an isothermal condition is considered in the current study by virtue of eqs 10 a10 and a12 in lo et al 2014 we have 10 τ 2 g e k b 2 3 g e α p f δ where e 1 2 u s u s t represents the strain tensor for the solid phase the superscript t denoting the transpose accordingly eq 9 can be arranged as 11 g 2 u s g 1 2 υ e α p f θ s e θ f p f k 0 where υ denotes the poisson ratio eq 11 extends eq 4 1 in biot 1941 to include gravitational body forces i e the fourth and fifth terms next we take divergence at both sides of eq 11 the resulting equation is of the form 12 k b 4 3 g 2 e α 2 p f θ s e z θ f p f z 0 eqs 8 2 and 12 constitute two coupled partial differential equations that provide a mathematical framework for the analysis of variations in e and p f due to three dimensional consolidation in saturated soils subject to gravitational fields it should be also noted that the physical parameters g m k b b f α θ s and θ f in eqs 8 2 and 12 are evaluated in a reference configuration since we are dealing with an elastic porous medium undergoing very small deformations the central problem in the standard consolidation theory for saturated soils biot 1941 1956 1962 terzaghi 1943 wang 2000 3 one dimensional consolidation for uniaxial strain consolidation i e e xx e yy 0 e e zz w z all dependent variables are functions only of the vertical coordinate z

the displacement vector of the solid phase along the vertical z direction eq 13 with p f and w z being the dependent variables contains two coupled partial differential equations that govern one dimensional consolidation in saturated soils under gravity effect 4 initial and boundary conditions a complete solution of eq 13 for describing the problem of soil consolidation requires two boundary conditions along with an initial condition prescribed for p f and w z respectively let us consider an instantaneous response where the interstitial fluid can neither escape nor enter the deforming soil i e e ε undranined conditions as the surface stress p is applied at t 0 thus leading excess pore fluid pressures to develop inside the soil it follows from eqs 5 and 6 1 and 6 2 that a direct relationship connecting p f to w z can be established 14 1 p f z 0 1 q 2 q 1 w z α m w z combination of eqs 10 and 14 1 gives rise to a mathematical expression that links τ zz and w z by 14 2 τ zz z 0 p k v u w z where k v u k b 4 3 g α 2 m is the undrained vertical bulk modulus lo and sposito 2013 accordingly one may plug eq 14 into eq 9 in turn yielding 15 k v u z w z z 0 θ s α m θ f w z z 0 0 eq 15 implies that the general solution of w z z 0 has to be of the form 16 w z z 0 c 1 exp π k v u z where π θ s α m θ f at the top surface z h of the soil layer the total stress τ zz h t equals to the applied compression load p thus upon putting eq 16 into eq 14 2 one may obtain 17 p k v u c 1 exp π k v u h the coefficient c 1 can be determined by 18 c 1 p k v u exp π k v u h in view of eqs 16 and 18 the complete solution of w z z 0 can be found to be 19 w z z 0 p k v u exp π k v u h z using eq 19 to eliminate w z in eq 14 1 one can get 20 p f z 0 γ p exp π k v u h z where γ α m k v u denotes loading efficiency eq 20 is the generalization of the biot 1941 model eq 5 7 to account for gravitational body forces in reference to the boundary conditions we consider a homogeneous soil layer where the top z h and bottom z 0 surfaces are fully permeable with respect to water i e 21 p f 0 t p f h t 0 since τ zz h t p eqs 10 and 21 imply 22 p k b 4 3 g w z h t it follows from eq 22 that we have 23 w z h t p k b 4 3 g as far as the bottom surface z 0 is concerned the static equilibrium of forces requires that p be balanced by the total stress plus the gravity field caused by variations in material density and volumetric fraction of the solid and fluid phases see also eq 1 2 24 τ zz 0 t p 0 h g δ ρ s 1 ϕ 0 ρ s 0 δ ϕ ϕ 0 δ ρ f ρ f 0 δ ϕ d z with the help of eqs 3 1 7 10 and 21 eq 24 can be recast as 25 k b 4 3 g w z 0 t p 0 h θ s w z θ f p f d z the definite integral in eq 25 contains the dependent variables p f and w z that need to be determined with their corresponding boundary conditions already prescribed in eqs 21 and 23 instead of applying the trapezoidal rule to approximate the definite integral in eq 25 as we achieved in lo et al 2017 the finite difference scheme is utilized to directly discretize eq 25 in the current study 5 discretisation and numerical solutions the spatial and temporal discretisations of the numerical solution to eq 13 as well as the initial and boundary conditions in eqs 19 20 21 23 and 25 are undertaken using the finite difference schemes the second order central difference approximation and first order forward difference approximation are respectively adopted in the spatial and temporal domains which thus allow us to discretize eq 13 in the form 1 m p f k n 1 p f k n δ t α w k n 1 w k n δ t b f p f k 1 n 2 p f k n p f k 1 n δ z 2

z evaluated at the grid point k with respect to the time step n correspondingly the subscripts k 1 and k k t indicate respectively the bottom and top boundaries of the soil layer so that k t h δ z 1 whereas the superscripts n 0 and n n t designate correspondingly the initial and total time steps as a consequence the initial conditions in eqs 19 and 20 can be expressed as 27 1 w k 0 p k v u exp π

29 s t 0 h w z d z k 1 k t 1 w k n δ z k 2 k t w k n δ z 2 after application of eq 26 to each grid point at each time step under the initial and boundary conditions prescribed in eqs 27 and 28 a set of linear simultaneous algebraic equations can be then developed the solution for excess pore water pressure together with total settlement can be in turn obtained after using the gauss jordan elimination to find the inverse of the coefficient matrix of the simultaneous algebraic equations all numerical calculations are carried out in fortran it is noted that an explicit forward finite difference scheme is conditionally stable and convergent therefore a small time step needs to be implemented to keep the error in the result bounded thus a finite difference framework with a time step δ t 1 sec and a space increment δ z 0 25 m is used for numerical calculations 6 results and discussions to verify the accuracy of our numerical scheme the result evaluated using eqs 26 29 is compared to the exact solution determined based on the biot model equation of consolidation subject to the undrained initial condition i e p f z 0 γ p and the fully permeable boundary conditions i e p f 0 t p f h t 0 under the conventional premise where gravity effects are ignored see also in appendix b a water saturated soil with clay texture is selected as a representative example table 1 lists the values of applied stress together with soil elasticity and hydraulic parameters necessary for numerical calculations fig 1 illustrates the dependence of the dimensionless pore water pressure p f p on the dimensional depth z h at t 1 min 1 day and 1 month obtained from the numerical scheme and exact solution respectively the corresponding relationship between the total settlement s t and the elapsed time is graphically represented in fig 2 it is clear from figs 1 and 2 that irrespective of the dimensionless pore water pressure and total settlement the result computed from our numerical scheme is in excellent agreement with the exact solution given in eqs b6 and b9 the effect of gravitational body forces on the dimensionless pore water pressure is described in fig 3 as a function of the dimensional depth at t 1 min 1 day and 1 month as indicated in fig 3 the spatial distribution of excess pore water pressure after gravity effect is well represented is no longer symmetric a feature characteristic of the circumstance with neglect of gravity forces to evaluate the impact of gravity forces in a more quantitative way we compute the relative difference in the dimensionless pore water pressure in fig 4 this difference is defined as the variations in dimensionless pore water pressures with and without gravity forces divided by the latter one can find from fig 4 that the impact becomes more significant as the depth is greater a direct consequence due to the balance of momentum the relative difference attributed to this effect is approximately 8 at t 1 month occurring at the bottom of soil sample it can be also observed that greater pore water pressure is built due to the existence of gravity effect this can be understood since pore water needs to sustain gravity forces in addition to external static loads leading excess pressure to take more time for dissipation fig 5 presents the variations in total settlement induced by the inclusion of gravity forces it can be seen that if these forces are taken into account more total settlement is generated to gain more physical insight into individual hydromechanical behaviors in saturated and unsaturated soils responding to consolidation caused by the simultaneous presence of external constant loads and gravity forces a comparative study is carried out with respect to different initial water saturation levels at s 2 0 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 fig 6 shows the result for variations in pore water pressure dissipation as changes in initial water saturation at different dimensionless depths revealing evidently that the pore water pressure dissipation is indeed affected by the addition of gravity forces the effect is more significant in unsaturated soils than saturated soils making the curve more non symmetric in fact a physical dimensionless parameter can be defined to characterize gravity effect in more details let us revisit eq 11 in z direction 30 k b 4 3 g z w z α p f z θ s w z θ f p f 0 as t consolidation process terminates excess pore water pressure completely dissipates i e p f z t 0 which in turn leads eq 30 to reduce to 31 z w z z t θ s k b 4 3 g w z z t a general solution of eq 31 can be found to be 32 w z z t c 2 exp θ s k b 4 3 g z it follows from eqs 23 and 32 that c 2 can be determined to be 33 c 2 p k b 4 3 g exp θ s k b 4 3 g h this implies that the formal solution of w z z t takes the form 34 w z z t p k b 4 3 g exp θ s k b 4 3 g h z it is noted that eq 34 is also mathematically correct to satisfy the boundary condition at the bottom z 0 prescribed in eq 25 as t one can find that as gravity forces are neglected i e θ s 0 eq 34 takes the value of p k b 4 3 g which is consistent with the result shown in lo et al 2014 as a consequence the final total settlement in saturated soils with gravitational body forces included can be calculated by 35 s b t 0 h w z z t d z p θ s 1 exp θ s h k b 4 3 g for the same spirit one can start from eq 8 in lo et al 2017 to demonstrate that eq 35 is quite general also hold for unsaturated soils with the extension of the gravity factor θ s to be formulated in terms of the physical properties of two immiscible fluids i e ρ 1 0 θ 1 0 d 1 ρ 2 0 θ 2 0 d 4 ρ s 0 θ s 0 g lo et al 2017 see also appendix c this refines our previous result eq 30 in lo et al 2017 to avoid using the trapezoidal rule to approximate the integral therefore a dimensionless parameter γ can be then defined to physically quantify the effect of gravitational body forces on the final total settlement in saturated and unsaturated soils as 36 γ s b t s t s t 1 k b 4 3 g θ s h 1 exp θ s h k b 4 3 g which in a mathematical sense is an indicator of the relative difference in the final total settlement with the presence of the gravitational body forces to that evaluated by neglecting those forces fig 7 shows the relationship between the dimensionless parameter γ and soil sample length with respect to different initial water saturations s 2 0 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 examining fig 7 one can observe that more final total settlement is induced when gravity effect is included which increases with an increase in soil sample length but decreases with an increase in initial water saturation 7 conclusions despite that theory of poroelasticity has become an effective and accurate approach to analyzing the intricate mechanical behavior of a fluid bearing porous medium momentum exchange arising from variations in material density and volumetric fraction of all constituents caused by gravity effect has been long ignored equations 8 2 and 12 the principle results of the current study are derived in a systematic way to incorporate the contribution from these variations as additional physical terms into the biot model of poroelasticity thus providing a more general detailed description of consolidation in saturated soils a boundary value problem used as a representative example for a close examination of gravity effect on pore water pressure dissipation and total settlement is accordingly formulated eqs 13 19 21 23 and 25 and solved numerically eqs 26 29 based on a simpler one dimension representation of our model equations we also demonstrate that a generalized mathematical expression eq 35 can be directly developed from momentum balance to analytically quantify the final total settlement induced by the simultaneous action of gravity forces and external loads in both saturated and unsaturated soils this expression is completely in a closed form which improves our previous works without invoking integral approximation a gravity factor contained in this expression is crucial in reflecting the existence of distinct physical properties of pore fluids thus by defining a dimensionless parameter eq 36 we show that the relative increase in the final total settlement due to the presence of gravity effect is more significant in unsaturated soils than in saturated soils which is inversely proportional to initial water saturations at the range we examined acknowledgments this work is supported financially by the taiwan ministry of science and technology most under contract number 104 2628 e 006 017 my2 to national

6931,knowledge on the water uptake depths of vegetation is crucial for understanding water transport processes of the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum and relevant for many applications e g the estimation of groundwater recharge irrigation planning and the parameterization of eco hydrological models the identification and quantification of water uptake from deep soil layers and groundwater remain challenging this study uses a combined framework based on natural abundances of stable water isotopes and isotopic labeling experiments with deuterium oxide 2h2o to study root water uptake and identify uptake from deep soil in a semi arid environment between 2013 and 2016 more than 1000 soil isotope depth profiles plant xylem and transpiration and water precipitation and groundwater samples for the analysis of isotope ratios were collected two experiments using isotopic labeling were carried out in order to assess root water uptake depths herein we i present series of deep soil water isotope depth profiles interpret water transport dynamics and ecohydrological feedbacks ii examine the suitability of natural isotope depth profiles for identifying deep root water uptake iii apply the bayesian mixing model mixsiar to quantify deep root water uptake and iv constrain water uptake depths using isotopic labeling experiments and derive an active root water uptake distribution our results show that the form of isotope depth profiles of soil in water limited environments follows characteristic shapes for the end of the rainy and dry seasons respectively isotope ratios in the upper 4 m of the soil are heavily dependent on the character of the respective rainy season under certain conditions e g droughts or weak rainy seasons the isotope depth profile displays an enrichment in heavy isotopes up to 4 m depth such pronounced anomalies provide an opportunity for studies on source water partitioning in the present experiment the studied individuals of acacia erioloba were found to obtain 37 24 52 of their water from deep soil 4 m and groundwater at the end of the dry season of 2015 all other investigated trees individuals of b plurijuga s luebertii t sericea and c collinum mainly utilize water originating from 1 m to 2 5 m depth under average rainy season conditions the similarity of isotope ratios of potential plant water sources hinders a conclusive identification of water uptake depths deep natural isotope depth profiles in dry environments can under certain conditions be used to identify and quantify access of vegetation to deep water resources isotopic labeling enables to determine active root distributions for the lateral root zone combined frameworks contribute to a better understanding of deep water uptake a differentiated consideration of water uptake from the lateral root zone and deep potentially groundwater tapping roots is required in order to fully investigate ecohydrological feedbacks and for a proper parameterization of

the ongoing debate on the exact magnitude and uncertainty coenders gerrits et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 schlaepfer et al 2014 water being transported through the stem and transpired by vegetation ultimately is a mixture of all water reservoirs a particular plant has access to and is actively using via its roots i e water originating from precipitation different soil layers and if accessible groundwater under certain conditions plants might even prefer water originating from reservoirs that are hydraulically more difficult to access for them dawson and ehleringer 1991 mcdonnell 2014 hence quantifying the magnitude of each contributor remains challenging and is subject of current research efforts barbeta and peñuelas 2017 berry and evaristo 2017 evaristo et al 2015 2017 zhang et al 2017 qualitative and quantitative approaches for the investigation of water uptake originating from deep soil layers and or groundwater require increased scientific efforts maeght et al 2013 pierret et al 2016 deep roots exist in different forms of which tap sinker and descending lateral roots are the most common canadell et al 1996 their main ecological functions are to provide stability for the plant and supply them with water and nutrients for some species e g phreatophytes survival can completely depend on the capability of roots to access the water table canadell et al 1996 stone and kalisz 1991 especially when the supply from shallow soil water and precipitation are insufficient the water uptake function of deep roots is crucial e g in dry and rocky environments in such cases even if the fraction of roots reaching the water table is small the efficiency of tap roots can be hundreds of times larger than roots in drier soil and large amounts of water can be transported canadell et al 1996 reicosky et al 1964 deep roots also play a role in physical and chemical weathering can influence the biogeochemistry of carbon and have an impact on the soil fauna and microbial communities maeght et al 2013 deep roots are not only able to take up water but are also capable to redistribute water between different soil layers hydraulic lift hl or hydraulic redistribution hr is the nocturnal transport of water from moist to dry regions of the soil profile and has been studied since decades burgess 2011 burgess et al 1998 2000 dawson 1993 ludwig et al 2003 richards and caldwell 1987 the morphology of root systems affects the plant s ability to take up nutrients if there is availability of essential nutrients at depth but not at the surface e g trace elements such as strontium potassium or iodine plants might prefer the deeper source even if water availability is lower this mechanism can also work the other way around similar to transporting of water the before mentioned mechanism of hydraulic redistribution can also be used by the plant to redistribute nutrients da silva et al 2011 lambers et al 2006 but refer to maeght et al 2013 for more examples the methodological aspect of identifying deep water uptake through plants roots requires further attention maeght et al 2013 methods based on water isotopes have been found particularly suitable to study water uptake of plants refer to and pierret et al 2016 for an overview of methods for studying deep roots 1 1 natural abundances of water isotopes for quantifying deep soil groundwater uptake under well defined conditions techniques based on stable water isotopes can be used to identify the contribution of each water source e g soil and groundwater to a mixture the water transported through the plant by applying isotopic mixing models for a recent review on mixing models refer to rothfuss and javaux 2016 prerequisites for this are that the isotopic composition of all potential sources is captured and the isotopic compositions of these sources differ from each other i e isotopic ratios from groundwater are different from soil water isotopes and the isotopic ratios of the soil water profile are not constant many studies applying these principles have been carried out in the past e g cook and o grady 2006 dawson and ehleringer 1991 dawson and pate 1996 grossiord et al 2016 rings et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 chimner and cooper 2004 for instance used stable isotopes to examine the water sources of native shrubs in the desert environment of san luis valley colorado usa the authors found that different desert shrubs can tap groundwater deeper than 2 m depth even though their isotopic analysis is based on an incomplete soil profile in addition their deep soil and groundwater isotopic compositions are almost identical which makes an interpretation only based on water isotopes non conclusive the latter aspect is crucial limiting the applicability of natural abundances and or mixing models for inferring deep water uptake because the before mentioned prerequisites are not fulfilled i e the isotopic signatures of the potential water sources for plants do not differ substantially thus using natural abundances and mixing models for inferring deep water uptake in such cases will lead to ambiguous results this is particularly true for thick unsaturated zones of many water limited environments as the characteristic profile of soil water isotopes at depth approaches a constant value due to mixing and diffusion barnes and allison 1984 clark and fritz 1997 cook et al 1994 in their investigation of water uptake in an amazonian tropical forest moreira et al 2000 and sternberg et al 2002 further state that if the isotopic composition of water in the soil profile is redundant i e different depths show the same isotopic composition natural stable isotope ratios cannot be used with confidence zhang et al 2017 used tritium in order to overcome this issue the authors used profiles of a thick unsaturated zone site in china where the tritium bomb peak from the mid 1960 s was well preserved applying a mixing model they found that 40 30 of the water used by fuji apple trees malus pumila mil originates from depths between 4 m and 9 m the average age of water used by these trees was found to be 29 years old though innovative and highly useful for understanding ecohydrological dynamics in thick unsaturated zones this method is not generally applicable because tritium analysis requires a large amount of water for it to be analyzed which is often not feasible from soil samples secondly the tritium bomb peak is long gone in many places refer to koeniger et al 2016 for a recent compilation of studies 1 2 isotopic labeling in addition to investigate active water uptake depths e g beyer et al 2016 kulmatiski et al 2010 priyadarshini et al 2016 labeling methods allow to allocate unknown roots to a particular tree or for deriving active root distributions as any tracer will only be taken up by living roots mazzacavallo and kulmatiski 2015 piayda et al 2017 many investigations used labeling techniques to study water uptake and rooting depths e g beyer et al 2016 burgess et al 2000 haase et al 1996 kulmatiski et al 2010 milchunas et al 1992 priyadarshini et al 2016 for identifying groundwater use by plants however labeling techniques are not the method of choice because of the large amounts of tracer required in summary investigating the occurrence of deep roots and their impact on the hydrological cycle both qualitatively and quantitatively remains challenging beyer et al 2016 lubczynski 2011 maeght et al 2013 pierret et al 2016 verweij et al 2011 especially minimum and non invasive approaches for studying deep roots and suitable methods for deriving root distributions are rare despite the fact that water uptake through deep roots can be an important component of the hydrological cycle compare evaristo et al 2017 none of the presented methods in isolation has the capability to provide a holistic description of the ecohydrological implications isotope based approaches using natural abundances do not allow for determining an active root distribution but offer the potential to infer groundwater uptake if the water sources are isotopically distinct labeling methods though being a direct approach to infer deep uptake yes no answer and deriving active root distributions e g mazzacavallo and kulmatiski 2015 piayda et al 2017 are not suitable for inferring groundwater uptake a combination of depth controlled labeling and a thorough ecohydrological analysis using natural abundances of stable isotopes might provide a more comprehensive description of soil vegetationatmosphere interactions the intention of this paper is to examine how drought induced variations in the soil water isotope depth profile and labeling experiments using 2h2o as applied tracer can be effectively combined in order to understand root water uptake depths in water limited environments in particular our main goals are are to i present a series of soil water isotope depth profiles over a period of three years at a semi arid site interpret these in terms of root water uptake depths and improve the understanding of water transport processes in thick unsaturated zones ii identify deep soil groundwater uptake of the local vegetation acacia erioloba baikiea plurijuga combretum collinum salacia luebertii and terminalia sericea using natural abundances of stable water isotopes in thick unsaturated zones by leveraging on drought induced anomalies of the soil water isotope depth profiles and iii utilize isotopic labeling experiments to constrain the water uptake depths and derive an active root water uptake distribution we provide a comprehensive combination of methods to improve the understanding of ecohydrological dynamics a three year dataset of deep 4 m isotope depth profiles allowis for a systematic analysis of water transport processes in water limited environments drought induced shifts of the soil water isotope depth profile observed in northern central namibia are further used to infer deep water uptake such pronounced shifts to the authors knowledge have not been documented previously and represent an opportunity for studies on water source partitioning and the application of any sort of mixing models 2 study area the cuvelai etosha basin ceb is a transboundary endorheic surface watershed shared almost equally by angola and namibia with a total size of 173 000 km2 the cuvelai etosha region is home to a large number of people both on the namibian and angolan sides mainly because of the presence of shallow groundwater and relatively fertile soils in many areas lindenmaier et al 2014 the basin has a vivid hydrogeological history as both the deltas of the cunene and okavango rivers were once situated within the ceb lindenmaier et al 2014 miller et al 2010 in recent history a deep aquifer containing fresh water was discovered in the northeastern part of the basin lindenmaier et al 2014 at present all of the surface water is either draining towards the etosha pan a salt pan located in the southern part of the ceb or remains in surface depressions locally called iishana that are forming a vast partly inter connected channel like system north west of the etosha pan mendelsohn et al 2013 no perennial river exists and the basin receives all of its water concentrated over the rainy season from november to april mean annual precipitation varies between 200 and 600 mm y 1 along a distinct rainfall gradient from the south west to the north east of the basin fig 1 in the years 2014 and 2015 a major drought due to exceptionally low rainfall occurred throughout southern africa causing many surface water reservoirs to dry out and water consumption to be limited in many places temperature average throughout the basin is 22 c with maximum values reaching up to 40 c in summer mendelsohn et al 2013 in winter temperatures can drop below zero at night potential evaporation ratesreach up to 3000 mm y 1 and exceed yearly rainfall by a factor of five between 2013 and 2016

xylem samples labeling experiments four extensive sampling campaigns were carried out between 2013 and 2016 fig 2 rain collectors gröning et al 2012 for isotope analysis of precipitation were installed at several sites in the ceb and in windhoek respectively for the analysis of groundwater water stable isotopes and hydrochemistry extensive well and borehole sampling campaigns were carried out hamutoko et al 2017 at each campaign at least one natural soil depth profile with a vertical resolution of 10 cm was taken using a hand auger at the site of interest the samples were stored in crimp sealed headspace vials iva analysentechnik meerbusch germany to avoid evaporation additional soil samples were collected for soil hydraulic analyses see beyer et al 2016 in june 2014 immediately after the rainy season and october 2015 at the end of the dry season sampling of the most abundant plant species namely acacia erioloba camelthorn baikiea plurijuga zambezi teak combretum collinum red bushwillow terminalia sericea silver cluster leaf and salacia luebertii wild mango took place during both campaigns all sampled individuals had leaves i e they were transpiring water a hollow stem auger haglöf västernorrland sweden was used to collected xylem samples of numerous individuals of each species and stored in crimp sealed headspace vials iva analysentechnik meerbusch germany all xylem samples were taken at chest height and only suberized stems were collected dawson and ehleringer 1993 after establishing a background isotope inventory see laboratory methods a labeling experiment using a 35 vol 2h2o solution was carried out to examine root water uptake depths a thorough description of the experimental design can be found in beyer et al 2016 hence only a summary is provided here multiple quadratic plots with an area 1 m2 were established at the study site with each of the plots surrounded by at least one mature individual of the most abundant plant species see above we attempted to establish the plots in a way that none of the trees was farther than 5 m from the tracer injection area a specific labeling depth between 0 5 m and 4 m was assigned randomly to each plot and four auger drilled holes to this depth established using a hand auger the 2h2o 35 vol solution was inserted into common water balloons with a volume of approximately 50 ml each five of such balloons were attached to a string inserted to the auger hole and destroyed at the bottom this enabled a depth specific labeling of each plot the total volume of injected tracer was 250 ml per auger hole i e approximately 1 l per plot four holes per plot in the following seven days we assumed xylem flux rates of 1 5 m d 1 refer to fravolini et al 2005 meinzer et al 2006 tracer uptake of all surrounded individuals was monitored twofold increment borer samples xylem of the surrounding vegetation were taken once a day in the late morning and transpired water using the bag method was collected twice per day calder et al 1986 1992 lambs and saenger 2011 it should be noted that the latter way of sampling involves fractionation and therefore can only be used for the identification of tracer uptake yes no answer if the deuterium concentration of any sample was at least four standard deviations sd higher compared to the regression line through the background samples tracer was assumed to be present refer to beyer et al 2016 kulmatiski et al 2010 the initial experiment described in beyer et al 2016 was conducted in june 2014 and the results are published therein a repetition of this experiment with a focus on the deeper unsaturated zone 2 4 m respectively was carried out at the end of the dry season 2015 after an exceptionally weak rainy season with only 313 mm of rain 2014 15 fig 2 throughout the experiment control samples were collected from additional individuals of all species under investigation at non labeled locations 3 1 2 laboratory methods three replicate samples of soil approximately 10 g for each soil depth and plant material were prepared in exetainer vials and the water cryogenically extracted using the methods proposed by koeniger et al 2011 minor modifications were introduced instead of a water bath a custom made aluminum block was used for heating this allows for higher and more stable extraction temperatures see current discussions on tightly bound water e g gaj et al 2017 in the present case a temperature of 180 c was used both for soil and xylem samples to ensure complete extraction the extracted soil water samples were analyzed for isotope ratios using a picarro l2120 i cavity ringdown crd water vapor analyzer after vaporization for plant samples transpired leaf water and extracted xylem a thermo fisher scientific delta v advantage infrared mass spectrometer irms coupled with a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer tc ea was used see current discussions on organic contamination e g martín gómez et al 2015 schultz et al 2011 west et al 2011 2010 we express isotope values as values in per mill following recommendations for notation given by coplen 2011 as shown below for 2h 1 10 3 δ 2 h r sample r standard 1 with rsample being the ratio 2h 1h of the less abundant to the more abundant isotope in the sample and rstandard the ratio 2h 1h of a standard respectively the analytical long term precision for a quality standard non labeled sample is better than 0 2 for 18o and 0 8 for 2h for the crd measurements and better than 0 5 for 18o and 2 for 2h for tc ea irms measurements respectively for highly elevated concentrations of 2h the standard deviation can be up to five times higher the samples were corrected for drift and memory using the procedure described in van geldern and barth 2012 the deuterium excess d is a measure of fractionation or isotopic enrichment of individual samples and can was calculated using the relationship proposed by dansgaard 1964 2 d δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o the lower d the more a particular sample was subjected to evaporation the deuterium excess d therefore is an important measure for the degree of fractionation a sample was exposed to it can also be used as a quality check for the cryogenic vacuum extraction i e an unreasonably high value of d indicates incomplete extraction 3 2 bayesian mixing model the software package mixsiar stock and semmens 2013 was used for the analysis of source water contributions to the plant isotopic composition mixsiar is a flexible framework to create mixing models based on the bayesian theory erhardt and bedrick 2013 moore and semmens 2008 parnell et al 2013 bayesian techniques use markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods to determine proportions and probability distributions of sources in our case potential water sources to a mixture the consumer i e the isotopic composition of the sampled plant the purpose of the model was to examine deep soil and groundwater uptake and to derive the water uptake proportions of the investigated plant species not individual plants as we want to generate a mean characterization of the study site hence the analysis was performed on a species level the isotopic ratios of three soil depth profiles all taken on the same day up to 4 m depth were averaged for each depth and acted as source data the isotopic composition of groundwater was also used as potential source for all sources the input included mean and standard deviation for both 18o and 2h to account for uncertainty sources were then grouped based on soil depth and statistical similarity of isotopic ratios this resulted in the following discretization 1 soil surface 0 2 m maximum enrichment 2 soil 0 2 0 5 m 3 soil 0 6 1 m 4 soil 1 4 m and 5 deep unsaturated zone groundwater the consumer data was composed of the background isotope inventory of vegetation established immediately before the labeling experiment as no rainfall occurred during the experiment the isotopic ratios of vegetation can be expected to remain constant in total 101 consumer samples were used 29 of a erioloba 32 of b plurijuga 26 of c collinum 7 of s luebertii and 7 of t sericea in table 1 the source and consumer data for the established model are summarized we ran the model with three chains 1 000 000 iterations and a burn in no of discarded first iterations of 500 000 gelman rubin and geweke tests implemented into the mixsiar package in r stock and semmens 2013 were used to evaluate if the mcmc converged on the posterior distributions for all variables we used a generalist prior α 1 assuming water uptake from all potential sources is equally likely the result of a bayesian mixing model are probability distributions of source contributions to a mixture that are accounting for uncertainty of the sources in order to illustrate statistical measures i e median and bayesian credibility intervals together with the probability distribution calculated by the model violin plots were created using the r package vioplot https cran r project org web packages vioplot index html only the isotopic data from the experiment in november 2015 are used for the investigation of water uptake depths using the bayesian mixing model for the following reasons refer to discussion for further elaborations i the pronounced shift of soil water isotopes for the profile taken in november 2015 allows a differentiation of sources i e the constant isotope value of soil water at depth 1 m for this profile and groundwater are clearly distinctive ii the upper soil is not carrying an isotope ratio similar to the one of groundwater compare the two profiles from after the rainy season i e 2014 6 and 2016 6 and iii isotopic ranges from rainfall deep soil and groundwater for all other profiles similar or very close to each other and lead to ambiguous results compare rothfuss and javaux 2016 recent research suggests that analyzing xylem water with isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy iris might lead to erroneous results e g west et al 2011 2010 even though the post processing software chemcorrecttm picarro inc santa clara ca usa which is used to identify whether organic contamination was an issue indicated no contamination of the samples the xylem samples measured with iris i e those from the experiment in june 2014 were not considered to infer uptake depths from natural abundances of water stable isotopes 3 3 root water uptake distribution for the lateral root zone using the results of the labeling experiments uptake in the lateral root zone can be further constrained mazzacavallo and kulmatiski 2015 proposed a method of approximating an active root distribution based on their labeling experiments using 2h2o as tracer 3 d z s n c n 1 j s n c with dz active root proportion at depth z sn mean d excess of experimental samples from treatment level n e g labeling at 0 5 m c mean d excess of control samples in the denominator the values i e sn c are summed across all labeling depths with j representing the deepest application depth i e 4 m the approach is basically comparing d excess of the background plant samples with the d excess after labeling and thus constitutes a soft criterion of tracer uptake data from both labeling experiments total of 389 samples was used in order to derive a mean active root water uptake distribution for the study site 4 results 4 1 drought induced shift of soil water stable isotopes in fig 3 the soil water isotope and water content profiles from the four campaigns are presented fig 3 reveals significant differences between the end of the rainy and dry seasons respectively but also between the two isotope profiles taken at the end of the dry season 2013 11 and 2015 11 the two profiles taken after the rainy season 2014 06 and 2016 06 respectively have a similar shape and can be summarized as follows i strong isotopic enrichment near the soil surface representing the effect of evaporation ii isotopic depletion due to infiltrated end of rainy season rainfall in the upper two meters and iii a constant isotopic composition because of mixing and diffusion in the deeper unsaturated zone the end of dry season profiles 2013 11 and 2015 11 respectively have a similar shape but one that is different from the profiles taken after the rainy season the soil is isotopically highly enriched at the surface as a result of evaporation and early season rainfall subsequently soil water stable isotope values are depleted with a maximum at approximately 1 7 m depth compared to the after rainy season profiles the magnitude of this depletion is significantly lower at greater depths 2 m the after dry season profiles approach a constant isotopic composition mixing and diffusion the most remarkable fact is that the after dry season profile taken in 2015 displays an isotopic shift of approximately 20 25 in 2h and 2 3 in 18o not shown herein at depths greater two meters compared to all other depth profiles the observed water contents clearly reveal generally higher moisture in depth profiles taken after the rainy season than after the dry season the d excess suggests the after dry season profiles were exposed to increased evaporation compared to the after rainy season ones whereas the former shows a negative d excess up to depths of approximately two meters the latter approach zero at approximately 0 7 m soil depth for all profiles deuterium excess is the lowest i e highest impact of evaporation near the soil surface and approaches a constant value of around zero i e negligible to no fractionation due to evaporation at greater depths for the subsequent analysis of water uptake depths using mixsiar only the profile from november 2015 was used because only this one allows for a clear isotopic distinction of water sources available for the local vegetation refer to methods 4 2 root water uptake depths determined from drought affected soil water isotope profiles 4 2 1 dual isotope analysis in fig 4 mean values and ranges of 2h and 18o for the five investigated plant species shallow and deep soil water and groundwater for the sampling campaign conducted in november 2015 are presented detailed information on the investigated trees i e height stem diameter and mean isotope values are provided in appendix 1 fig 4 reveals distinct differences in the isotopic compositions of plant water the results can be summarized as follows i both shallow and deep soil water are isotopically enriched when analyzing all soil samples the data of which fig 4 is composed of both deep and shallow soil samples fall on an evaporation line with a slope of approximately two at the end of the dry season 2015 in comparison the slopes of shallow and deep soil from profiles taken shortly after the rainy season were two and seven respectively refer to beyer et al 2016 for the dry season profile taken in november 2013 slopes for shallow and deep soil are four and five respectively in other words deep soil immediately after the rainy season is not enriched by evaporation it is slightly enriched after the dry season of 2013 and highly enriched after the dry season 2015 ii xylem values for all investigated species plot along an evaporation line indicating either uptake of enriched water slope of five when considering all xylem samples or fractionation along the stem the mean isotopic composition of four out of five species b plurijuga c collinum s luebertii and t sericea respectively under consideration ranges in between deep and shallow soil water only one species namely a erioloba carries an isotopic signature plotting in between deep soil water and shallow groundwater further a high intra species variation of isotope values is evident from fig 4 this can be attributed to the fact that different individuals with different ages and development stage of the root system were selected for this study 4 2 2 mixing model mixsiar the advantage of the profile taken in november 2015 compared to all others is that the potential sources of water taken up by the plants and transpired by them differ substantially this is one main requirement for robust results when using isotopic mixing models we leveraged on this fact and used all data from this extended sampling campaign in order to conduct an analysis of source contributions to the mean plant isotopic compositions using mixsiar the results of this analysis are presented in fig 5 the global analysis of source water contributions to the xylem composition of different plant species suggests that most water is taken up from soil water between 1 and 4 m depth median of 0 47 at the end of the dry season water originating from the all other depths are minor contributors medians soil surface 0 04 0 2 0 5 m 0 15 0 6 1 0 m 0 09 and deep soil and groundwater 0 10 there is a high uncertainty associated with the global analysis as indicated by the shape of the violin as well as the box and grey whiskers which can simply be explained by the fact that all individuals are lumped into one bucket fig 5a performing an analysis for each species yields a more differentiated picture fig 5b f the investigated individuals of the tree species b plurijuga and c collinum and the shrub s luebertii fig 5 b c and f are supplied almost completely by water originating from 1 to 4 m depth median source contributions of 0 95 0 87 and 0 80 respectively the uncertainty in the water uptake proportions is lower compared to the global analysis the violin plot of a erioloba fig 5d shows significantly different uptake depths compared to all other species analyzed the median source compositions suggest a contribution of 0 50 for water from 1 to 4 m depth but also 0 37 for deep groundwater the shape of the violin reveals that the investigated individuals might originate from two groups which might be explained by different tree ages or heights we refer to the discussion section for a thorough analysis the fifth species under investigation t sericea obtains its water from soil depths between 0 2 m and 4 m median source contributions soil surface 0 01 0 2 0 5 m 0 24 0 6 1 0 m 0 23 1 4 m 0 44 and deep soil and groundwater 0 02 table 2 summarized the results of the mixing model 4 3 constraining uptake depths labeling experiments the results of the initial experiment beyer et al 2016 can be summarized as follows i frequent uptake of the injected 2h2o by all investigated trees and shrubs up to a labeling depth of 2 m ii no uptake of the tracer by trees when injecting 2h2o deeper than 2 m and iii two positive samples from the shrub species s luebertii at one of the plots labeled in 4 m depth which however was not interpreted as conclusive evidence the results of this repetition experiment are summarized in table 3 in fig 6 the dual isotope plots for the initial experiment from 2014 fig 6a and the repetition experiment from 2015 fig 6b are shown out of 227 samples taken up to seven days after the labeling with 2h2o nine showed a clear tracer signal similar to the initial experiment beyer et al 2016 more positive samples were found when collecting the samples via transpiration bags compared to xylem samples eight vs one positive samples respectively three positive samples originated from the plot labeled at 2 m depth one from t sericea transp bag one from s luebertii transp bag and one from b plurijuga xylem three tracer containing samples were found at the 3 m plot namely b africana and a erioloba both transp bags four positive samples originating from s luebertii all transp bags were found during the last three days of the experiment at the plot labeled in 4 m depth 4 3 1 root water uptake distribution for the lateral root zone the resulting mean i e averaged over all investigated species active root water uptake distribution for elundu forest site based on the labeling experiments is presented in fig 7 the mean active root distribution shows that most of the water uptake occurs in the upper two meters the largest water uptake originates from 1 m soil depth underneath this depth there are almost no active roots present other than the slight increase at 4 m due to the few positive samples encountered at this depth 5 discussion 5 1 drought induced differences of soil water stable isotopes the soil water stable isotope profiles taken at different times over a three year period fig 3 provide valuable insights into unsaturated zone water transport dynamics and water uptake clearly outstanding is the fact that three of the analyzed profiles 2013 11 2014 6 and 2016 6 respectively approach a constant isotopic ratio of 25 to 35 for δ2h in contrast the after dry season profile taken in nov 2015 approaches 12 for δ2h at depth measurement and handling errors were thoroughly checked in three ways i three independent profiles were taken at the study site ii three replicates were prepared extracted and measured in the laboratory for each depth and iii complete extraction was verified via gravimetric and d excess control all profiles show the pronounced isotopic shift at depth the interpretation we offer for the isotopic shift discovered in the depth profiles of nov 2015 is described in the following see fig 3 with 313 mm measured on site the anteceding rainy season received significantly less rainfall than the average mean for the region is 530 mm y 1 consequently no or very little deep infiltration occurred groundwater recharge for this season was estimated 0 mm refer to beyer et al 2015 thus the observed pattern could mean that either the deeper soil layers did not receive isotopically depleted rainfall which is typically the case during a normal rainy season refer to fig 3 or some deep infiltration of enriched rainfall occurred explaining the parallel shift shown in fig 3 for further explanation on the effect of different rainfall and cloud types refer to aggarwal 2016 clark and fritz 1997 dansgaard 1964 both interpretations would explain the observed isotopic shift the little rainfall occurring during this rainy season was enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the rainfall from all succeeding rainy season fig 3 from the authors perspective diffusion and mixing caused the observed isotopic parallel shift of the depth profile taken in nov 2015 red lines in fig 3 we explain this as a result of what can be called breathing of the soil an effect of diurnal and seasonal changes of soil temperatures recorded matric potential expressed in pf and temperature time series and diurnal cycles from the dry season 2015 are provided in appendix 2 we further refer to hendrickx et al 2005 scanlon et al 2003 walvoord and scanlon 2004 if no rainfall occurs water vapor movement is dependent on temperature differences i e from warm to cold during the day isotopically enriched water vapor would thus move downwards during the night this system turns around as the soil surface and upper soil layers cool down and deeper soil are warmer though the enrichment effect might be small for one day it accumulates over a complete dry season the d excess profile presented in fig 4 supports this finding negative d excess until 2 5 m depth the situation documented here is therefore an extreme one induced by drought one can leverage on this fact in order to analyze root water uptake depths because the isotope depth profile for soil water allows for a clear distinction in the source water composition refer to the succeeding section of water available for the vegetation another aspect is that both after rainy season profiles and both after dry season profiles have a similar shape the shape of the two system states wet and dry however is completely different both after rainy season profiles have most depleted δ values at 0 7 m depth which is much likely the isotopic signature of recent rainfall in contrast the most depleted δ values in both end of dry season profiles are found at a depth of approx 1 7 m around this depth also the d excess approaches zero whereas the drying out of the soil can be explained by root water uptake the isotopic fractionation certainly cannot rather the water vapor dynamics see explanation above are likely to have caused this refer to the seasonal variation of soil temperature up to 2 5 m appendix 2 thus for the situation during the dry season not the surface near zero flux plain might be crucial for evaluating water vapor transport but rather the position of the highest depletion i e the soil layer located between 1 5 m and 2 m underneath this depth temperature driven water vapor transport effects might vanish finally the four analyzed profiles reveal another finding even though all isotope depth profiles approach a constant ratio at depth this value is not similar to the isotopic signature of groundwater fig 4 neither for the rainy season profiles nor for the dry season profiles the likely explanation is that the presented depth profiles represent the mean weighted average of rain events infiltrating deeper i e out of the soil layers that are effect by immediate evaporation in the associated rainy season a detailed explanation of the process is provided in blavoux et al 2013 it needs to be verified further at which depth the soil water isotope ratios and groundwater approach each other however it appears based on our data that it is not within the first four meters of the unsaturated zone a practical implication of this would be that even for the after rainy season profiles a distinction between groundwater and deep soil water might be possible however the difference between the two is much smaller than for the drought affected profile which would result in a greater uncertainty further fig 3 reveals that isotope signatures similar to the deep soil are found in the upper soil due to recent rain events which means that still two similar sources are present 5 2 root water uptake depths determined from drought affected soil water isotope profiles given the explanation above i e sources precipitation shallow soil water and deep soil water for plant water are isotopically similar a differentiation of plant water sources with mixing models for the after rainy season profiles is basically inapplicable in order to obtain robust results isotopically distinct source waters are required rothfuss and javaux 2016 the end of dry season profile taken after the drought in 2014 15 allowed for this our explicit goal with the mixing model was to derive a mean image of the water uptake zones for different species on site thus the mixing model was not run for each tree and depth individually rather potential water sources were lumped into the groups shallow soil deep soil and groundwater for the visualization of the results from mixsiar we chose violin plots because they illustrate the complete probability distribution of the different model realizations the advantage is that in this way different groups within each species might be identified to demonstrate that provide two examples i the mixing model results for a erioloba are subject to large uncertainty fig 5d and table 2 if only looking at the median and bayesian credibility intervals the shape of the violin however suggests that two groups exist one with a high and one with a lower source contribution of deep groundwater perhaps the latter group uses additionally soil water originating from 1 to 4 m and 0 2 to 0 5 m depth respectively acacia species have been long known for their capability of developing deep penetrating tap roots canadell et al 1996 dawson 1993 lubczynski 2009 ludwig et al 2003 seymour and milton 2003 they are also known for an extensive surface near lateral root network leistner 1967 wang et al 2007 combining this our interpretation is that the group with the high proportion of groundwater is the older individuals of a erioloba i e those that were able to reach groundwater via their tap root they no longer rely exclusively on their lateral root system to satisfy their transpirative demand the other group is most likely younger individuals which are still developing their tap root and additionally rely on the extensive lateral root system the results from a erioloba might provide indicators for the root architecture and their capability to take up water from very dry soils an extended shallow lateral root system and a large tap root in order to survive droughts dawson and pate 1996 found such a dimorphic root system in australian phraeatophytic plants enabling them to cope with droughts based on the mixing model t sericea might also have an extended shallow lateral root system as this species shows the highest contribution of shallow soil water however this species seems to not have access to deeper water sources compare hipondoka and versfeld 2006 ii the statistics for b plurijuga show a lower uncertainty which is revealed in the violin plot fig 5b and table 2 90 of the probability distribution i e the range covered by the grey whiskers for the investigated population of b plurijuga suggests a source contribution of deep unsaturated zone water ranging from 0 60 to 1 00 in contrast only 5 of the model realizations indicate the potential of deep soil water and or groundwater uptake therefore the confidence that the investigated individuals of b plurijuga are almost completely supplied by 1 4 m soil water is high statistically all sampled individuals of b plurijuga behave similar and the same is true for the analysis of c collinum and s luebertii where comparable results were obtained the results of the mixing model provide an overall image of the root water uptake zones of the dominant species on site this in turn enabled to gain valuable insights into species specific strategies to cope with drought stress it is impossible however to infer rooting depth or maximum root water uptake depth respectively with the results from the mixing model alone this is for the following reason generally the constant isotopic composition in the deep soil water see fig 3 is assumed to persist until or until close proximity to the groundwater due to the fact that the sampling depth was limited to 4 m it is not known at which depth the isotopic signal of soil water approaches the groundwater signal hence it is not precisely known from which depths the fraction of 0 47 of 1 4 m source contribution indicated by the mixing model is originating it might also originate from deeper soil layers further it cannot clearly by distinguished between groundwater use and water uptake deeper than 4 m for the same reason furthermore the uncertainty of the results from the mixing model is high and we acknowledge this explicitly nevertheless the presented evidence allows to state with confidence that i certain but not all individuals of a erioloba have access to deep 4 m groundwater at the studied site ii in semi arid environments the end of the dry season is more suitable for identifying water uptake depths using natural abundances of water stable isotopes because there is no precipitation soil water is enriched and hence isotopic differences can be large and iii drought induced shifts of soil water isotope depth profiles provide the opportunity to identify deep water uptake using natural abundances of stable water isotopes 5 3 labeling experiments to constrain uptake depth estimates the results of the two labeling experiments imply the following i several plant species on site are capable of accessing water deeper than two meters depth ii uptake deeper than two meters depth is rather an exception 8 out of 203 samples contained tracer and iii s luebertii is the one species where tracer uptake up to four meters depth was registered the outcomes of the repeated tracer experiment fortify our initial finding beyer et al 2016 that the main lateral root zone at the study site ends in between 2 and 2 5 m this is clearly indicated by the results of the labeling experiments refer to table 3 we validated this via traditional excavation water content monitoring immediate dry out of the upper 2 m after infiltration refer to beyer et al 2016 and interviews with local farmers we further analyzed depth profiles for soil organic carbon soc and found the highest proportions at the soil surface old leaves and in between 0 3 and 1 5 m soil depth data not shown herein though soc was generally very low this is not an incontrovertible validation but it increases the confidence that main root activity occurs in this zone of the soil as it matches with the tracer derived active root distribution fig 7 our combined interpretations from utilizing natural abundances and labeling experiments can be summarized as follows 1 if water is available water uptake mainly occurs in the upper two meters 2 the root distribution approximated by the labeling experiments is suitable for describing the lateral root zone however occasionally local and plant specific deep water uptake needs to be accounted for 3 water uptake at the end of the dry season mainly occurs from the deeper unsaturated zone when combining the mixing model results main uptake between 1 and 4 m with the labeling results end of main lateral root zone between 2 and 2 5 m this water must mainly originate from soil depths of 1 2 5 m 4 individuals of a erioloba as indicated by the mixing model and s luebertii as indicated by the tracer experiments are capable of accessing deeper soil water and or groundwater however this information should not be included into the mean root distribution as this is a local species specific phenomenon on the other hand any model for simulating thick unsaturated zone water transport not accounting for this will overestimate deep drainage and groundwater recharge in order to incorporate this meaningful into hydrological models different root distributions should be modeled i e one with and one without the deep roots and some sort of upscaling needs to be applied perhaps based on vegetation counts using one root distribution only accounting for the deep uptake by a erioloba for instance by extending the root distribution derived from the labeling experiments until the groundwater would produce meaningless results especially when modeling compensated water uptake the complete transpirative demand not only the one of a erioloba on site would be satisfied by taking water from deeper layers affecting drainage rates and groundwater recharge this issue can only be solved by models capable of incorporating multiple root distributions e g one for the lateral root zone and one for deep roots 5 the fact that the sampled a erioloba trees did not take up tracer but indicated deep water uptake suggests the presence of tap roots acacia species have long been associated with the development of deep roots canadell et al 1996 jennings 1974 lubczynski 2009 and hydraulic lift dawson 1993 ludwig et al 2003 2004 admittedly the presented combination of methods is no complete chain of evidence for describing root water uptake at this thick unsaturated zone site the ultimate magnitude and seasonal variation in deep water uptake as well as potential water vapor uptake by certain plants other adaptations like sinker roots and hydraulic redistribution remain to be studied further occasional uptake from deeper zones up to 4 m was registered table 3 as no isotopic label was placed deeper than 4 m it is likely that s luebertii might have roots reaching deeper than this when excavating individuals of this species strong deep roots were discovered in the purely tracer derived active root distribution shown in fig 7 the potential of deeper uptake is incorporated slightly increased root proportion at 4 m depth but we explicitly state that this distribution is incomplete mainly because of the positive samples at 4 m depth for s luebertii what is also not incorporated in the root distribution derived by labeling is the component deep uptake 4 m by a erioloba which is reflected in the results of the mixing model a variety of methods is needed in order to understand deep unsaturated zone water uptake by plants and for source partition i different system states drought induced anomalies provide opportunities for source partitioning using natural isotopic abundances e g for identifying deep water use by the local vegetation applying bayesian mixing models for situations when the potential water sources i e shallow soil deep soil and groundwater differ substantially allows for a better understanding of the unsaturated zone and its access by plants roots ii labeling experiments allow for a direct approach of deriving active root distributions that can be used to improve the parameterization of models for simulating unsaturated zone water transport however the maximum vertical extent of such experiments is limited by leveraging on drought induced effects on soil water isotope depth profiles and labeling experiments our understanding of ecohydrological implications of plants for water transport in thick unsaturated zones can be improved we further reason that it is crucial to differentiate between the lateral root zone and a deep tap root component in semi arid environments with thick unsaturated zones in order to incorporate this into eco hydrological models multiple root distributions need to be established lubczynski 2011 2009 provide an excellent example of how to incorporate groundwater transpiration into modeling approaches future research efforts should be directed to further develop and parameterize such models quantify the magnitude of water uptake through groundwater tapping roots and investigate ecohydrological feedbacks such as hydraulic redistribution and the role of nutrient availability on water uptake the methods proposed herein can help to address and design experiments aiming on answering these questions acknowledgements this work was partly funded by the

6931,knowledge on the water uptake depths of vegetation is crucial for understanding water transport processes of the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum and relevant for many applications e g the estimation of groundwater recharge irrigation planning and the parameterization of eco hydrological models the identification and quantification of water uptake from deep soil layers and groundwater remain challenging this study uses a combined framework based on natural abundances of stable water isotopes and isotopic labeling experiments with deuterium oxide 2h2o to study root water uptake and identify uptake from deep soil in a semi arid environment between 2013 and 2016 more than 1000 soil isotope depth profiles plant xylem and transpiration and water precipitation and groundwater samples for the analysis of isotope ratios were collected two experiments using isotopic labeling were carried out in order to assess root water uptake depths herein we i present series of deep soil water isotope depth profiles interpret water transport dynamics and ecohydrological feedbacks ii examine the suitability of natural isotope depth profiles for identifying deep root water uptake iii apply the bayesian mixing model mixsiar to quantify deep root water uptake and iv constrain water uptake depths using isotopic labeling experiments and derive an active root water uptake distribution our results show that the form of isotope depth profiles of soil in water limited environments follows characteristic shapes for the end of the rainy and dry seasons respectively isotope ratios in the upper 4 m of the soil are heavily dependent on the character of the respective rainy season under certain conditions e g droughts or weak rainy seasons the isotope depth profile displays an enrichment in heavy isotopes up to 4 m depth such pronounced anomalies provide an opportunity for studies on source water partitioning in the present experiment the studied individuals of acacia erioloba were found to obtain 37 24 52 of their water from deep soil 4 m and groundwater at the end of the dry season of 2015 all other investigated trees individuals of b plurijuga s luebertii t sericea and c collinum mainly utilize water originating from 1 m to 2 5 m depth under average rainy season conditions the similarity of isotope ratios of potential plant water sources hinders a conclusive identification of water uptake depths deep natural isotope depth profiles in dry environments can under certain conditions be used to identify and quantify access of vegetation to deep water resources isotopic labeling enables to determine active root distributions for the lateral root zone combined frameworks contribute to a better understanding of deep water uptake a differentiated consideration of water uptake from the lateral root zone and deep potentially groundwater tapping roots is required in order to fully investigate ecohydrological feedbacks and for a proper parameterization of models keywords stable water isotopes mixing model isotopic labeling rooting depth deuterium 1 introduction transpiration through plants leaves is the largest of all terrestrial water fluxes despite the ongoing debate on the exact magnitude and uncertainty coenders gerrits et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 schlaepfer et al 2014 water being transported through the stem and transpired by vegetation ultimately is a mixture of all water reservoirs a particular plant has access to and is actively using via its roots i e water originating from precipitation different soil layers and if accessible groundwater under certain conditions plants might even prefer water originating from reservoirs that are hydraulically more difficult to access for them dawson and ehleringer 1991 mcdonnell 2014 hence quantifying the magnitude of each contributor remains challenging and is subject of current research efforts barbeta and peñuelas 2017 berry and evaristo 2017 evaristo et al 2015 2017 zhang et al 2017 qualitative and quantitative approaches for the investigation of water uptake originating from deep soil layers and or groundwater require increased scientific efforts maeght et al 2013 pierret et al 2016 deep roots exist in different forms of which tap sinker and descending lateral roots are the most common canadell et al 1996 their main ecological functions are to provide stability for the plant and supply them with water and nutrients for some species e g phreatophytes survival can completely depend on the capability of roots to access the water table canadell et al 1996 stone and kalisz 1991 especially when the supply from shallow soil water and precipitation are insufficient the water uptake function of deep roots is crucial e g in dry and rocky environments in such cases even if the fraction of roots reaching the water table is small the efficiency of tap roots can be hundreds of times larger than roots in drier soil and large amounts of water can be transported canadell et al 1996 reicosky et al 1964 deep roots also play a role in physical and chemical weathering can influence the biogeochemistry of carbon and have an impact on the soil fauna and microbial communities maeght et al 2013 deep roots are not only able to take up water but are also capable to redistribute water between different soil layers hydraulic lift hl or hydraulic redistribution hr is the nocturnal transport of water from moist to dry regions of the soil profile and has been studied since decades burgess 2011 burgess et al 1998 2000 dawson 1993 ludwig et al 2003 richards and caldwell 1987 the morphology of root systems affects the plant s ability to take up nutrients if there is availability of essential nutrients at depth but not at the surface e g trace elements such as strontium potassium or iodine plants might prefer the deeper source even if water availability is lower this mechanism can also work the other way around similar to transporting of water the before mentioned mechanism of hydraulic redistribution can also be used by the plant to redistribute nutrients da silva et al 2011 lambers et al 2006 but refer to maeght et al 2013 for more examples the methodological aspect of identifying deep water uptake through plants roots requires further attention maeght et al 2013 methods based on water isotopes have been found particularly suitable to study water uptake of plants refer to and pierret et al 2016 for an overview of methods for studying deep roots 1 1 natural abundances of water isotopes for quantifying deep soil groundwater uptake under well defined conditions techniques based on stable water isotopes can be used to identify the contribution of each water source e g soil and groundwater to a mixture the water transported through the plant by applying isotopic mixing models for a recent review on mixing models refer to rothfuss and javaux 2016 prerequisites for this are that the isotopic composition of all potential sources is captured and the isotopic compositions of these sources differ from each other i e isotopic ratios from groundwater are different from soil water isotopes and the isotopic ratios of the soil water profile are not constant many studies applying these principles have been carried out in the past e g cook and o grady 2006 dawson and ehleringer 1991 dawson and pate 1996 grossiord et al 2016 rings et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 chimner and cooper 2004 for instance used stable isotopes to examine the water sources of native shrubs in the desert environment of san luis valley colorado usa the authors found that different desert shrubs can tap groundwater deeper than 2 m depth even though their isotopic analysis is based on an incomplete soil profile in addition their deep soil and groundwater isotopic compositions are almost identical which makes an interpretation only based on water isotopes non conclusive the latter aspect is crucial limiting the applicability of natural abundances and or mixing models for inferring deep water uptake because the before mentioned prerequisites are not fulfilled i e the isotopic signatures of the potential water sources for plants do not differ substantially thus using natural abundances and mixing models for inferring deep water uptake in such cases will lead to ambiguous results this is particularly true for thick unsaturated zones of many water limited environments as the characteristic profile of soil water isotopes at depth approaches a constant value due to mixing and diffusion barnes and allison 1984 clark and fritz 1997 cook et al 1994 in their investigation of water uptake in an amazonian tropical forest moreira et al 2000 and sternberg et al 2002 further state that if the isotopic composition of water in the soil profile is redundant i e different depths show the same isotopic composition natural stable isotope ratios cannot be used with confidence zhang et al 2017 used tritium in order to overcome this issue the authors used profiles of a thick unsaturated zone site in china where the tritium bomb peak from the mid 1960 s was well preserved applying a mixing model they found that 40 30 of the water used by fuji apple trees malus pumila mil originates from depths between 4 m and 9 m the average age of water used by these trees was found to be 29 years old though innovative and highly useful for understanding ecohydrological dynamics in thick unsaturated zones this method is not generally applicable because tritium analysis requires a large amount of water for it to be analyzed which is often not feasible from soil samples secondly the tritium bomb peak is long gone in many places refer to koeniger et al 2016 for a recent compilation of studies 1 2 isotopic labeling in addition to investigate active water uptake depths e g beyer et al 2016 kulmatiski et al 2010 priyadarshini et al 2016 labeling methods allow to allocate unknown roots to a particular tree or for deriving active root distributions as any tracer will only be taken up by living roots mazzacavallo and kulmatiski 2015 piayda et al 2017 many investigations used labeling techniques to study water uptake and rooting depths e g beyer et al 2016 burgess et al 2000 haase et al 1996 kulmatiski et al 2010 milchunas et al 1992 priyadarshini et al 2016 for identifying groundwater use by plants however labeling techniques are not the method of choice because of the large amounts of tracer required in summary investigating the occurrence of deep roots and their impact on the hydrological cycle both qualitatively and quantitatively remains challenging beyer et al 2016 lubczynski 2011 maeght et al 2013 pierret et al 2016 verweij et al 2011 especially minimum and non invasive approaches for studying deep roots and suitable methods for deriving root distributions are rare despite the fact that water uptake through deep roots can be an important component of the hydrological cycle compare evaristo et al 2017 none of the presented methods in isolation has the capability to provide a holistic description of the ecohydrological implications isotope based approaches using natural abundances do not allow for determining an active root distribution but offer the potential to infer groundwater uptake if the water sources are isotopically distinct labeling methods though being a direct approach to infer deep uptake yes no answer and deriving active root distributions e g mazzacavallo and kulmatiski 2015 piayda et al 2017 are not suitable for inferring groundwater uptake a combination of depth controlled labeling and a thorough ecohydrological analysis using natural abundances of stable isotopes might provide a more comprehensive description of soil vegetationatmosphere interactions the intention of this paper is to examine how drought induced variations in the soil water isotope depth profile and labeling experiments using 2h2o as applied tracer can be effectively combined in order to understand root water uptake depths in water limited environments in particular our main goals are are to i present a series of soil water isotope depth profiles over a period of three years at a semi arid site interpret these in terms of root water uptake depths and improve the understanding of water transport processes in thick unsaturated zones ii identify deep soil groundwater uptake of the local vegetation acacia erioloba baikiea plurijuga combretum collinum salacia luebertii and terminalia sericea using natural abundances of stable water isotopes in thick unsaturated zones by leveraging on drought induced anomalies of the soil water isotope depth profiles and iii utilize isotopic labeling experiments to constrain the water uptake depths and derive an active root water uptake distribution we provide a comprehensive combination of methods to improve the understanding of ecohydrological dynamics a three year dataset of deep 4 m isotope depth profiles allowis for a systematic analysis of water transport processes in water limited environments drought induced shifts of the soil water isotope depth profile observed in northern central namibia are further used to infer deep water uptake such pronounced shifts to the authors knowledge have not been documented previously and represent an opportunity for studies on water source partitioning and the application of any sort of mixing models 2 study area the cuvelai etosha basin ceb is a transboundary endorheic surface watershed shared almost equally by angola and namibia with a total size of 173 000 km2 the cuvelai etosha region is home to a large number of people both on the namibian and angolan sides mainly because of the presence of shallow groundwater and relatively fertile soils in many areas lindenmaier et al 2014 the basin has a vivid hydrogeological history as both the deltas of the cunene and okavango rivers were once situated within the ceb lindenmaier et al 2014 miller et al 2010 in recent history a deep aquifer containing fresh water was discovered in the northeastern part of the basin lindenmaier et al 2014 at present all of the surface water is either draining towards the etosha pan a salt pan located in the southern part of the ceb or remains in surface depressions locally called iishana that are forming a vast partly inter connected channel like system north west of the etosha pan mendelsohn et al

distinct rainfall gradient from the south west to the north east of the basin fig 1 in the years 2014 and 2015 a major drought due to exceptionally low rainfall occurred throughout southern africa

luebertii grasses are only present in the rainy season and generally have a low density due to livestock grazing 3 materials and methods 3 1 field and laboratory methods 3 1 1 natural soil profiles xylem samples labeling experiments four extensive sampling campaigns were carried out between 2013 and 2016 fig 2 rain collectors gröning et al 2012 for isotope analysis of precipitation were installed at several sites in the ceb and in windhoek respectively for the analysis of groundwater water stable isotopes and hydrochemistry extensive well and borehole sampling campaigns were carried out hamutoko et al 2017 at each campaign at least one natural soil depth profile with a vertical resolution of 10 cm was taken using a hand auger at the site of interest the samples were stored in crimp sealed headspace vials iva analysentechnik meerbusch germany to avoid evaporation additional soil samples were collected for soil hydraulic analyses see beyer et al 2016 in june 2014 immediately after the rainy season and october 2015 at the end of the dry season sampling of the most abundant plant species namely acacia erioloba camelthorn baikiea plurijuga zambezi teak combretum collinum red bushwillow terminalia sericea silver cluster leaf and salacia luebertii wild mango took place during both campaigns all sampled individuals had leaves i e they were transpiring water a hollow stem auger haglöf västernorrland sweden was used to collected xylem samples of numerous individuals of each species and stored in crimp sealed headspace vials iva analysentechnik meerbusch germany all xylem samples were taken at chest height and only suberized stems were collected dawson and ehleringer 1993 after establishing a background isotope inventory see laboratory methods a labeling experiment using a 35 vol 2h2o solution was carried out to examine root water uptake depths a thorough description of the experimental design can be found in beyer et al 2016 hence only a summary is provided here multiple quadratic plots with an area 1 m2 were established at the study site with each of the plots surrounded by at least one mature individual of the most abundant plant species see above we attempted to establish the plots in a way that none of the trees was farther than 5 m from the tracer injection area a specific labeling depth between 0 5 m and 4 m was assigned randomly to each plot and four auger drilled holes to this depth established using a hand auger the 2h2o 35 vol solution was inserted into common water balloons with a volume of approximately 50 ml each five of such balloons were attached to a string inserted to the auger hole and destroyed at the bottom this enabled a depth specific labeling of each plot the total volume of injected tracer was 250 ml per auger hole i e approximately 1 l per plot four holes per plot in the following seven days we assumed xylem flux rates of 1 5 m d 1 refer to fravolini et al 2005 meinzer et al 2006 tracer uptake of all surrounded individuals was monitored twofold increment borer samples xylem of the surrounding vegetation were taken once a day in the late morning and transpired water using the bag method was collected twice per day calder et al 1986 1992 lambs and saenger 2011 it should be noted that the latter way of sampling involves fractionation and therefore can only be used for the identification of tracer uptake yes no answer if the deuterium concentration of any sample was at least four standard deviations sd higher compared to the regression line through the background samples tracer was assumed to be present refer to beyer et al 2016 kulmatiski et al 2010 the initial experiment described in beyer et al 2016 was conducted in june 2014 and the results are published therein a repetition of this experiment with a focus on the deeper unsaturated zone 2 4 m respectively was carried out at the end of the dry season 2015 after an exceptionally weak rainy season with only 313 mm of rain 2014 15 fig 2 throughout the experiment control samples were collected from additional individuals of all species under investigation at non labeled locations 3 1 2 laboratory methods three replicate samples of soil approximately 10 g for each soil depth and plant material were prepared in exetainer vials and the water cryogenically extracted using the methods proposed by koeniger et al 2011 minor modifications were introduced instead of a water bath a custom made aluminum block was used for heating this allows for higher and more stable extraction temperatures see current discussions on tightly bound water e g gaj et al 2017 in the present case a temperature of 180 c was used both for soil and xylem samples to ensure complete extraction the extracted soil water samples were analyzed for isotope ratios using a picarro l2120 i cavity ringdown crd water vapor analyzer after vaporization for plant samples transpired leaf water and extracted xylem a thermo fisher scientific delta v advantage infrared mass spectrometer irms coupled with a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer tc ea was used see current discussions on organic contamination e g martín gómez et al 2015 schultz et al 2011 west et al 2011 2010 we express isotope values as values in per mill following recommendations for notation given by coplen 2011 as shown below for 2h 1 10 3 δ 2 h r sample r standard 1 with rsample being the ratio 2h 1h of the less abundant to the more abundant isotope in the sample and rstandard the ratio 2h 1h of a standard respectively the analytical long term precision for a quality standard non labeled sample is better than 0 2 for 18o and 0 8 for 2h for the crd measurements and better than 0 5 for 18o and 2 for 2h for tc ea irms measurements respectively for highly elevated concentrations of 2h the standard deviation can be up to five times higher the samples were corrected for drift and memory using the procedure described in van geldern and barth 2012 the deuterium excess d is a measure of fractionation or isotopic enrichment of individual samples and can was calculated using the relationship proposed by dansgaard 1964 2 d δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o the lower d the more a particular sample was subjected to evaporation the deuterium excess d therefore is an important measure for the degree of fractionation a sample was exposed to it can also be used as a quality check for the cryogenic vacuum extraction i e an unreasonably high value of d indicates incomplete extraction 3 2 bayesian mixing model the software package mixsiar stock and semmens 2013 was used for the analysis of source water contributions to the plant isotopic composition mixsiar is a flexible framework to create mixing models based on the bayesian theory erhardt and bedrick 2013 moore and semmens 2008 parnell et al 2013 bayesian techniques use markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods to determine proportions and probability distributions of sources in our case potential water sources to a mixture the consumer i e the isotopic composition of the sampled plant the purpose of the model was to examine deep soil and groundwater uptake and to derive the water uptake proportions of the investigated plant species not individual plants as we want to generate a mean characterization of the study site hence the analysis was performed on a species level the isotopic ratios of three soil depth profiles all taken on the same day up to 4 m depth were averaged for each depth and acted as source data the isotopic composition of groundwater was also used as potential source for all sources the input included mean and standard deviation for both 18o and 2h to account for uncertainty sources were then grouped based on soil depth and statistical similarity of isotopic ratios this resulted in the following discretization 1 soil surface 0 2 m maximum enrichment 2 soil 0 2 0 5 m 3 soil 0 6 1 m 4 soil 1 4 m and 5 deep unsaturated zone groundwater the consumer data was composed of the background isotope inventory of vegetation established immediately before the labeling experiment as no rainfall occurred during the experiment the isotopic ratios of vegetation can be expected to remain constant in total 101 consumer samples were used 29 of a erioloba 32 of b plurijuga 26 of c collinum 7 of s luebertii and 7 of t sericea in table 1 the source and consumer data for the established model are summarized we ran the model with three chains 1 000 000 iterations and a burn in no of discarded first iterations of 500 000 gelman rubin and geweke tests implemented into the mixsiar package in r stock and semmens 2013 were used to evaluate if the mcmc converged on the posterior distributions for all variables we used a generalist prior α 1 assuming water uptake from all potential sources is equally likely the result of a bayesian mixing model are probability distributions of source contributions to a mixture that are accounting for uncertainty of the sources in order to illustrate statistical measures i e median and bayesian credibility intervals together with the probability distribution calculated by the model violin plots were created using the r package vioplot https cran r project org web packages vioplot index html only the isotopic data from the experiment in november 2015 are used for the investigation of water uptake depths using the bayesian mixing model for the following reasons refer to discussion for further elaborations i the pronounced shift of soil water isotopes for the profile taken in november 2015 allows a differentiation of sources i e the constant isotope value of soil water at depth 1 m for this profile and groundwater are clearly distinctive ii the upper soil is not carrying an isotope ratio similar to the one of groundwater compare the two profiles from after the rainy season i e 2014 6 and 2016 6 and iii isotopic ranges from rainfall deep soil and groundwater for all other profiles similar or very close to each other and lead to ambiguous results compare rothfuss and javaux 2016 recent research suggests that analyzing xylem water with isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy iris might lead to erroneous results e g west et al 2011 2010 even though the post processing software chemcorrecttm picarro inc santa clara ca usa which is used to identify whether organic contamination was an issue indicated no contamination of the samples the xylem samples measured with iris i e those from the experiment in june 2014 were not considered to infer uptake depths from natural abundances of water stable isotopes 3 3 root water uptake distribution for the lateral root zone using the results of the labeling experiments uptake in the lateral root zone can be further constrained mazzacavallo and kulmatiski 2015 proposed a method of approximating an active root distribution based on their labeling experiments using 2h2o as tracer 3 d z s n c n 1 j s n c with dz active root proportion at depth z sn mean d excess of experimental samples from treatment level n e g labeling at 0 5 m c mean d excess of control samples in the denominator the values i e sn c are summed across all labeling depths with j representing the deepest application depth i e 4 m the approach is basically comparing d excess of the background plant samples with the d excess after labeling and thus constitutes a soft criterion of tracer uptake data from both labeling experiments total of 389 samples was used in order to derive a mean active root water uptake distribution for the study site 4 results 4 1 drought induced shift of soil water stable isotopes in fig 3 the soil water isotope and water content profiles from the four campaigns are presented fig 3 reveals significant differences between the end of the rainy and dry seasons respectively but also between the two isotope profiles taken at the end of the dry season 2013 11 and 2015 11 the two profiles taken after the rainy season 2014 06 and 2016 06 respectively have a similar shape and can be summarized as follows i strong isotopic enrichment near the soil surface representing the effect of evaporation ii isotopic depletion due to infiltrated end of rainy season rainfall in the upper two meters and iii a constant isotopic composition because of mixing and diffusion in the deeper unsaturated zone the end of dry season profiles 2013 11 and 2015 11 respectively have a similar shape but one that is different from the profiles taken after the rainy season the soil is isotopically highly enriched at the surface as a result of evaporation and early season rainfall subsequently soil water stable isotope values are depleted with a maximum at approximately 1 7 m depth compared to the after rainy season profiles the magnitude of this depletion is significantly lower at greater depths 2 m the after dry season profiles approach a constant isotopic composition mixing and diffusion the most remarkable fact is that the after dry season profile taken in 2015 displays an isotopic shift of approximately 20 25 in 2h and 2 3 in 18o not shown herein at depths greater two meters compared to all other depth profiles the observed water contents clearly reveal generally higher moisture in depth profiles taken after the rainy season than after the dry season the d excess suggests the after dry season profiles were exposed to increased evaporation compared to the after rainy season ones whereas the former shows a negative d excess up to depths of approximately two meters the latter approach zero at approximately 0 7 m soil depth for all profiles deuterium excess is the lowest i e highest impact of evaporation near the soil surface and approaches a constant value of around zero i e negligible to no fractionation due to evaporation at greater depths for the subsequent analysis of water uptake depths using mixsiar only the profile from november 2015 was used because only this one allows for a clear isotopic distinction of water sources available for the local vegetation refer to methods 4 2 root water uptake depths determined from drought affected soil water isotope profiles 4 2 1 dual isotope analysis in fig 4 mean values and ranges of 2h and 18o for the five investigated plant species shallow and deep soil water and groundwater for the sampling campaign conducted in november 2015 are presented detailed information on the investigated trees i e height stem diameter and mean isotope values are provided in appendix 1 fig 4 reveals distinct differences in the isotopic compositions of plant water the results can be summarized as follows i both shallow and deep soil water are isotopically enriched when analyzing all soil samples the data of which fig 4 is composed of both deep and shallow soil samples fall on an evaporation line with a slope of approximately two at the end of the dry season 2015 in comparison the slopes of shallow and deep soil from profiles taken shortly after the rainy season were two and seven respectively refer to beyer et al 2016 for the dry season profile taken in november 2013 slopes for shallow and deep soil are four and five respectively in other words deep soil immediately after the rainy season is not enriched by evaporation it is slightly enriched after the dry season of 2013 and highly enriched after the dry season 2015 ii xylem values for all investigated species plot along an evaporation line indicating either uptake of enriched water slope of five when considering all xylem samples or fractionation along the stem the mean isotopic composition of four out of five species b plurijuga c collinum s luebertii and t sericea respectively under consideration ranges in between deep and shallow soil water only one species namely a erioloba carries an isotopic signature plotting in between deep soil water and shallow groundwater further a high intra species variation of isotope values is evident from fig 4 this can be attributed to the fact that different individuals with different ages and development stage of the root system were selected for this study 4 2 2 mixing model mixsiar the advantage of the profile taken in november 2015 compared to all others is that the potential sources of water taken up by the plants and transpired by them differ substantially this is one main requirement for robust results when using isotopic mixing models we leveraged on this fact and used all data from this extended sampling campaign in order to conduct an analysis of source contributions to the mean plant isotopic compositions using mixsiar the results of this analysis are presented in fig 5 the global analysis of source water contributions to the xylem composition of different plant species suggests that most water is taken up from soil water between 1 and 4 m depth median of 0 47 at the end of the dry season water originating from the all other depths are minor contributors medians soil surface 0 04 0 2 0 5 m 0 15 0 6 1 0 m 0 09 and deep soil and groundwater 0 10 there is a high uncertainty associated with the global analysis as indicated by the shape of the violin as well as the box and grey whiskers which can simply be explained by the fact that all individuals are lumped into one bucket fig 5a performing an analysis for each species yields a more differentiated picture fig 5b f the investigated individuals of the tree species b plurijuga and c collinum and the shrub s luebertii fig 5 b c and f are supplied almost completely by water originating from 1 to 4 m depth median source contributions of 0 95 0 87 and 0 80 respectively the uncertainty in the water uptake proportions is lower compared to the global analysis the violin plot of a erioloba fig 5d shows significantly different uptake depths compared to all other species analyzed the median source compositions suggest a contribution of 0 50 for water from 1 to 4 m depth but also 0 37 for deep groundwater the shape of the violin reveals that the investigated individuals might originate from two groups which might be explained by different tree ages or heights we refer to the discussion section for a thorough analysis the fifth species under investigation t sericea obtains its water from soil depths between 0 2 m and 4 m median source contributions soil surface 0 01 0 2 0 5 m 0 24 0 6 1 0 m 0 23 1 4 m 0 44 and deep soil and groundwater 0 02 table 2 summarized the results of the mixing model 4 3 constraining uptake depths labeling experiments the results of the initial experiment beyer et al 2016 can be summarized as follows i frequent uptake of the injected 2h2o by all investigated trees and shrubs up to a labeling depth of 2 m ii no uptake of the tracer by trees when injecting 2h2o deeper than 2 m and iii two positive samples from the shrub species s luebertii at one of the plots labeled in 4 m depth which however was not interpreted as conclusive evidence the results of this repetition experiment are summarized in table 3 in fig 6 the dual isotope plots for the initial experiment from 2014 fig 6a and the repetition experiment from 2015 fig 6b are shown out of 227 samples taken up to seven days after the labeling with 2h2o nine showed a clear tracer signal similar to the initial experiment beyer et al 2016 more positive samples were found when collecting the samples via transpiration bags compared to xylem samples eight vs one positive samples respectively three positive samples originated from the plot labeled at 2 m depth one from t sericea transp bag one from s luebertii transp bag and one from b plurijuga xylem three tracer containing samples were found at the 3 m plot namely b africana and a erioloba both transp bags four positive samples originating from s luebertii all transp bags were found during the last three days of the experiment at the plot labeled in 4 m depth 4 3 1 root water uptake distribution for the lateral root zone the resulting mean i e averaged over all investigated species active root water uptake distribution for elundu forest site based on the labeling experiments is presented in fig 7 the mean active root distribution shows that most of the water uptake occurs in the upper two meters the largest water uptake originates from 1 m soil depth underneath this depth there are almost no active roots present other than the slight increase at 4 m due to the few positive samples encountered at this depth 5 discussion 5 1 drought induced differences of soil water stable isotopes the soil water stable isotope profiles taken at different times over a three year period fig 3 provide valuable insights into unsaturated zone water transport dynamics and water uptake clearly outstanding is the fact that three of the analyzed profiles 2013 11 2014 6 and 2016 6 respectively approach a constant isotopic ratio of 25 to 35 for δ2h in contrast the after dry season profile taken in nov 2015 approaches 12 for δ2h at depth measurement and handling errors were thoroughly checked in three ways i three independent profiles were taken at the study site ii three replicates were prepared extracted and measured in the laboratory for each depth and iii complete extraction was verified via gravimetric and d excess control all profiles show the pronounced isotopic shift at depth the interpretation we offer for the isotopic shift discovered in the depth profiles of nov 2015 is described in the following see fig 3 with 313 mm measured on site the anteceding rainy season received significantly less rainfall than the average mean for the region is 530 mm y 1 consequently no or very little deep infiltration occurred groundwater recharge for this season was estimated 0 mm refer to beyer et al 2015 thus the observed pattern could mean that either the deeper soil layers did not receive isotopically depleted rainfall which is typically the case during a normal rainy season refer to fig 3 or some deep infiltration of enriched rainfall occurred explaining the parallel shift shown in fig 3 for further explanation on the effect of different rainfall and cloud types refer to aggarwal 2016 clark and fritz 1997 dansgaard 1964 both interpretations would explain the observed isotopic shift the little rainfall occurring during this rainy season was enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the rainfall from all succeeding rainy season fig 3 from the authors perspective diffusion and mixing caused the observed isotopic parallel shift of the depth profile taken in nov 2015 red lines in fig 3 we explain this as a result of what can be called breathing of the soil an effect of diurnal and seasonal changes of soil temperatures recorded matric potential expressed in pf and temperature time series and diurnal cycles from the dry season 2015 are provided in appendix 2 we further refer to hendrickx et al 2005 scanlon et al 2003 walvoord and scanlon 2004 if no rainfall occurs water vapor movement is dependent on temperature differences i e from warm to cold during the day isotopically enriched water vapor would thus move downwards during the night this system turns around as the soil surface and upper soil layers cool down and deeper soil are warmer though the enrichment effect might be small for one day it accumulates over a complete dry season the d excess profile presented in fig 4 supports this finding negative d excess until 2 5 m depth the situation documented here is therefore an extreme one induced by drought one can leverage on this fact in order to analyze root water uptake depths because the isotope depth profile for soil water allows for a clear distinction in the source water composition refer to the succeeding section of water available for the vegetation another aspect is that both after rainy season profiles and both after dry season profiles have a similar shape the shape of the two system states wet and dry however is completely different both after rainy season profiles have most depleted δ values at 0 7 m depth which is much likely the isotopic signature of recent rainfall in contrast the most depleted δ values in both end of dry season profiles are found at a depth of approx 1 7 m around this depth also the d excess approaches zero whereas the drying out of the soil can be explained by root water uptake the isotopic fractionation certainly cannot rather the water vapor dynamics see explanation above are likely to have caused this refer to the seasonal variation of soil temperature up to 2 5 m appendix 2 thus for the situation during the dry season not the surface near zero flux plain might be crucial for evaluating water vapor transport but rather the position of the highest depletion i e the soil layer located between 1 5 m and 2 m underneath this depth temperature driven water vapor transport effects might vanish finally the four analyzed profiles reveal another finding even though all isotope depth profiles approach a constant ratio at depth this value is not similar to the isotopic signature of groundwater fig 4 neither for the rainy season profiles nor for the dry season profiles the likely explanation is that the presented depth profiles represent the mean weighted average of rain events infiltrating deeper i e out of the soil layers that are effect by immediate evaporation in the associated rainy season a detailed explanation of the process is provided in blavoux et al 2013 it needs to be verified further at which depth the soil water isotope ratios and groundwater approach each other however it appears based on our data that it is not within the first four meters of the unsaturated zone a practical implication of this would be that even for the after rainy season profiles a distinction between groundwater and deep soil water might be possible however the difference between the two is much smaller than for the drought affected profile which would result in a greater uncertainty further fig 3 reveals that isotope signatures similar to the deep soil are found in the upper soil due to recent rain events which means that still two similar sources are present 5 2 root water uptake depths determined from drought affected soil water isotope profiles given the explanation above i e sources precipitation shallow soil water and deep soil water for plant water are isotopically similar a differentiation of plant water sources with mixing models for the after rainy season profiles is basically inapplicable in order to obtain robust results isotopically distinct source waters are required rothfuss and javaux 2016 the end of dry season profile taken after the drought in 2014 15 allowed for this our explicit goal with the mixing model was to derive a mean image of the water uptake zones for different species on site thus the mixing model was not run for each tree and depth individually rather potential water sources were lumped into the groups shallow soil deep soil and groundwater for the visualization of the results from mixsiar we chose violin plots because they illustrate the complete probability distribution of the different model realizations the advantage is that in this way different groups within each species might be identified to demonstrate that provide two examples i the mixing model results for a erioloba are subject to large uncertainty fig 5d and table 2 if only looking at the median and bayesian credibility intervals the shape of the violin however suggests that two groups exist one with a high and one with a lower source contribution of deep groundwater perhaps the latter group uses additionally soil water originating from 1 to 4 m and 0 2 to 0 5 m depth respectively acacia species have been long known for their capability of developing deep penetrating tap roots canadell et al 1996 dawson 1993 lubczynski 2009 ludwig et al 2003 seymour and milton 2003 they are also known for an extensive surface near lateral root network leistner 1967 wang et al 2007 combining this our interpretation is that the group with the high proportion of groundwater is the older individuals of a erioloba i e those that were able to reach groundwater via their tap root they no longer rely exclusively on their lateral root system to satisfy their transpirative demand the other group is most likely younger individuals which are still developing their tap root and additionally rely on the extensive lateral root system the results from a erioloba might provide indicators for the root architecture and their capability to take up water from very dry soils an extended shallow lateral root system and a large tap root in order to survive droughts dawson and pate 1996 found such a dimorphic root system in australian phraeatophytic plants enabling them to cope with droughts based on the mixing model t sericea might also have an extended shallow lateral root system as this species shows the highest contribution of shallow soil water however this species seems to not have access to deeper water sources compare hipondoka and versfeld 2006 ii the statistics for b plurijuga show a lower uncertainty which is revealed in the violin plot fig 5b and table 2 90 of the probability distribution i e the range covered by the grey whiskers for the investigated population of b plurijuga suggests a source contribution of deep unsaturated zone water ranging from 0 60 to 1 00 in contrast only 5 of the model realizations indicate the potential of deep soil water and or groundwater uptake therefore the confidence that the investigated individuals of b plurijuga are almost completely supplied by 1 4 m soil water is high statistically all sampled individuals of b plurijuga behave similar and the same is true for the analysis of c collinum and s luebertii where comparable results were obtained the results of the mixing model provide an overall image of the root water uptake zones of the dominant species on site this in turn enabled to gain valuable insights into species specific strategies to cope with drought stress it is impossible however to infer rooting depth or maximum root water uptake depth respectively with the results from the mixing model alone this is for the following reason generally the constant isotopic composition in the deep soil water see fig 3 is assumed to persist until or until close proximity to the groundwater due to the fact that the sampling depth was limited to 4 m it is not known at which depth the isotopic signal of soil water approaches the groundwater signal hence it is not precisely known from which depths the fraction of 0 47 of 1 4 m source contribution indicated by the mixing model is originating it might also originate from deeper soil layers further it cannot clearly by distinguished between groundwater use and water uptake deeper than 4 m for the same reason furthermore the uncertainty of the results from the mixing model is high and we acknowledge this explicitly nevertheless the presented evidence allows to state with confidence that i certain but not all individuals of a erioloba have access to deep 4 m groundwater at the studied site ii in semi arid environments the end of the dry season is more suitable for identifying water uptake depths using natural abundances of water stable isotopes because there is no precipitation soil water is enriched and hence isotopic differences can be large and iii drought induced shifts of soil water isotope depth profiles provide the opportunity to identify deep water uptake using natural abundances of stable water isotopes 5 3 labeling experiments to constrain uptake depth estimates the results of the two labeling experiments imply the following i several plant species on site are capable of accessing water deeper than two meters depth ii uptake deeper than two meters depth is rather an exception 8 out of 203 samples contained tracer and iii s luebertii is the one species where tracer uptake up to four meters depth was registered the outcomes of the repeated tracer experiment fortify our initial finding beyer et al 2016 that the main lateral root zone at the study site ends in between 2 and 2 5 m this is clearly indicated by the results of the labeling experiments refer to table 3 we validated this via traditional excavation water content monitoring immediate dry out of the upper 2 m after infiltration refer to beyer et al 2016 and interviews with local farmers we further analyzed depth profiles for soil organic carbon soc and found the highest proportions at the soil surface old leaves and in between 0 3 and 1 5 m soil depth data not shown herein though soc was generally very low this is not an incontrovertible validation but it increases the confidence that main root activity occurs in this zone of the soil as it matches with the tracer derived active root distribution fig 7 our combined interpretations from utilizing natural abundances and labeling experiments can be summarized as follows 1 if water is available water uptake mainly occurs in the upper two meters 2 the root distribution approximated by the labeling experiments is suitable for describing the lateral root zone however occasionally local and plant specific deep water uptake needs to be accounted for 3 water uptake at the end of the dry season mainly occurs from the deeper unsaturated zone when combining the mixing model results main uptake between 1 and 4 m with the labeling results end of main lateral root zone between 2 and 2 5 m this water must mainly originate from soil depths of 1 2 5 m 4 individuals of a erioloba as indicated by the mixing model and s luebertii as indicated by the tracer experiments are capable of accessing deeper soil water and or groundwater however this information should not be included into the mean root distribution as this is a local species specific phenomenon on the other hand any model for simulating thick unsaturated zone water transport not accounting for this will overestimate deep drainage and groundwater recharge in order to incorporate this meaningful into hydrological models different root distributions should be modeled i e one with and one without the deep roots and some sort of upscaling needs to be applied perhaps based on vegetation counts using one root distribution only accounting for the deep uptake by a erioloba for instance by extending the root distribution derived from the labeling experiments until the groundwater would produce meaningless results especially when modeling compensated water uptake the complete transpirative demand not only the one of a erioloba on site would be satisfied by taking water from deeper layers affecting drainage rates and groundwater recharge this issue can only be solved by models capable of incorporating multiple root distributions e g one for the lateral root zone and one for deep roots 5 the fact that the sampled a erioloba trees did not take up tracer but indicated deep water uptake suggests the presence of tap roots acacia species have long been associated with the development of deep roots canadell et al 1996 jennings 1974 lubczynski 2009 and hydraulic lift dawson 1993 ludwig et al 2003 2004 admittedly the presented combination of methods is no complete chain of evidence for describing root water uptake at this thick unsaturated zone site the ultimate magnitude and seasonal variation in deep water uptake as well as potential water vapor uptake by certain plants other adaptations like sinker roots and hydraulic redistribution remain to be studied further occasional uptake from deeper zones up to 4 m was registered table 3 as no isotopic label was placed deeper than 4 m it is likely that s luebertii might have roots reaching deeper than this when excavating individuals of this species strong deep roots were discovered in the purely tracer derived active root distribution shown in fig 7 the potential of deeper uptake is incorporated slightly increased root proportion at 4 m depth but we explicitly state that this distribution is incomplete mainly because of the positive samples at 4 m depth for s luebertii what is also not incorporated in the root distribution derived by labeling is the component deep uptake 4 m by a erioloba which is reflected in the results of the mixing model a variety of methods is needed in order to understand deep unsaturated zone water uptake by plants and for source partition i different system states drought induced anomalies provide opportunities for source partitioning using natural isotopic abundances e g for identifying deep water use by the local vegetation applying bayesian mixing models for situations when the potential water sources i e shallow soil deep soil and groundwater differ substantially allows for a better understanding of the unsaturated zone and its access by plants roots ii labeling experiments allow for a direct approach of deriving active root distributions that can be used to improve the parameterization of models for simulating unsaturated zone water transport however the maximum vertical extent of such experiments is limited by leveraging on drought induced effects on soil water isotope depth profiles and labeling experiments our understanding of ecohydrological implications of plants for water transport in thick unsaturated zones can be improved we further reason that it is crucial to differentiate between the lateral root zone and a deep tap root component in semi arid environments with thick unsaturated zones in order to incorporate this into eco hydrological models multiple root distributions need to be established lubczynski 2011 2009 provide an excellent example of how to incorporate groundwater transpiration into modeling approaches future research efforts should be directed to further develop and parameterize such models quantify the magnitude of water uptake through groundwater tapping roots and investigate ecohydrological feedbacks such as hydraulic redistribution and the role of

keywords multilayered karst aquifer hydrochemistry hydrodynamic hydrogeology 1 introduction karst aquifers are one of the most important water supply sources worldwide approximately 25 of the world s population consumes water obtained from karst aquifers ford and willians 2007 these complex systems have a high degree of heterogeneity that distinguish them from other aquifers white 1988 bakalowicz 1995 2005 ford and willians 2007 worthington and ford 2009 analysis of karst systems is usually led using several methods based on classical chemistry isotopic chemistry hydrodynamic responses or some lithology characteristics of carbonates the joint use of hydrodynamic and hydrochemical techniques within the framework of a multidisciplinary approach provides a reliable characterization of the hydrogeological functioning of karst aquifers lastennet and mudry 1997 grasso et al 2003 perrin et al 2003 birk et al 2004 bicalho et al 2012 brkic et al 2018 filippini et al 2018 hydrochemical and hydrodynamic responses observed at the outlet of karst systems depend upon the flow conditions that prevail in the aquifer previous studies lastennet 1994 lastennet and mudry 1997 raeisi and karami 1997 emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003a batiot et al 2003b emblanch et al 2003 doctor et al 2006 mudarra and andreo 2011 nicolini et al 2016 have focused on the joint use of natural hydrochemical tracers such as dissolved organic carbon d o c nitrates no3 or magnesium mg to improve the knowledge about the functioning of these karst systems most of karst studies tried to apply their methods on springs fed by a single karst aquifer the geological history of the edge of sedimentary basins can lead to the formation of multilayered aquifers through the progressive burial of geological layers this burial involves the passage of unconfined aquifers to confined aquifers of some layers the succession of periods of regression transgression implies several karstification phases this involves complex relationships between unconfined and confined multilayered aquifers in some cases a karst spring can act as the outlet for both of these multilayered aquifers this implies complex hydrodynamic and hydrochemical responses at the spring and an increased difficulty in accurate delineation of limits of the karst system the recharge of these multilayered karst aquifers is a major issue for the edge of sedimentary basins few studies focus their attention on karst springs fed by several aquifers we can note insights from the work of bicalho et al 2012 or mahler and bourgeais 2013 recent studies have proposed several polyphased karstification concepts in relation to both epigene and hypogene karstification klimchouk 2007 2012 palmer 2011 audra et al 2015 husson et al 2016 the site of toulon springs is a good example of a complex karst system drained by two multilayered karst aquifers from jurassic and cretaceous aquifers located on the northern edge of the aquitaine sedimentary basin 66 000 km2 polyphased karstification concepts are directly linked to the geological history of the aquitaine basin pelissié 1982 platel 1987 cubaynes et al 1989 rey et al 1988 pélissié and astruc 1996 toulon springs have been supplying water to the metropolitan area of périgueux dordogne county france since the 19th century previous works von stempel 1972 lastennet et al 2004 lorette et al 2016 have led to the first studies but have left questions about the functioning and groundwater origins of toulon springs toulon springs provide the opportunity to understand the functioning of a multi reservoir karst aquifer using simple acquisition of hydrodynamic responses and natural hydrochemical tracers geochemical monitoring of several karst springs allows for toulon springs to be placed into a local hydrogeological situation and to identify the different aquifers participating in the feeding of toulon springs particular attention is given to the origins of magnesium and to the relationship between magnesium concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration in both confined and unconfined karst aquifers emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003a mahler and bourgeais 2013 previously discuss these parameters because of the close connection with the surface and short travel times groundwater in many karst aquifers is oxic perrin et al 2007 mahler et al 2011 musgrove et al 2011 in some cases the dissolved oxygen concentration can decrease associated with increased magnesium concentration this information is linked to residence time of water into the aquifer or to a mix of water with several aquifers it will be discussed in this work the main goal of this paper is to use a multidisciplinary approach to determine the groundwater flow mechanism of a single spring fed by a multilayered karst aquifer the first objective is to assess the water quantity available into the toulon karst system using natural hydrodynamic responses the second one is to assess the water quality using natural hydrochemical responses the third one is to combine these tools to evaluate the functioning of a typical example of a complex karst system drained by two multilayered karst aquifers located on the northern edge of a sedimentary basin proposing a conceptual model of functioning 2 general characteristics of the study area 2 1 local geology and hydrogeology toulon springs are major regional springs and are located in périgueux south western france at the northern edge of the aquitaine sedimentary basin it is a vauclusian type spring located on a major faulted anticlinal structure oriented n145 lastennet et al 2004 toulon springs are the main perennial outlet of the karst system that can reach almost 1 000 l s 1 during rainfall events with a mean annual daily discharge of 450 l s 1 the geological situation of the toulon karst system consists of upper cretaceous and upper jurassic carbonate rocks fig 1 with a thickness of 200 250 m for cretaceous rocks and 300 350 m for jurassic rocks kimmeridgian oxfordian bathonian bajocian von stempel 1972 at the top cretaceous rocks consist of limestone while jurassic rocks consist of dolomitic limestone and dolomites the geological structure of the toulon karst system is characterized by the existence of folds and fractures in a mainly nw se direction fig 1 karst landforms are well developed at the surface of the carbonate outcrops mainly in cretaceous limestone as noticed by the existence of dolines and swallow holes the regional hydrogeological situation consists of two main multilayered karst aquifers fig 1 fractured and karstified cretaceous limestone constitutes the first main aquifer it is composed of a turonian aquifer coniacian aquifer and santonian aquifer fig 1 below jurassic dolomitic limestone constitutes the second main aquifer of the study area it is composed of a kimmeridgian aquifer oxfordian aquifer bathonian aquifer and bajocian aquifer fig 1 the marls of the cenomanian are considered to be the impermeable limit of these two main aquifers spatial thickness variations 4 20 m and facies variations marls sands over the study area induce an additional difficulty in the understanding of the relationships between the two main aquifers although both of these aquifers are supposedly hydrogeologically isolated deep water rising occurs from the jurassic into the cretaceous through the faulted anticline structure of périgueux this deep water rising is illustrated by the presence of many warm springs between 20 and 21 c including copo spring club olympique de perigueux ouest fig 1 located in the isle river valley the isle river represents the regional base level of the toulon karst system the hydrogeological catchment of toulon springs has an area of approximately 100 km2 fig 1 a large part of the hydrogeological catchment is relatively permeable due to the presence of limestone of the santonian and the coniacian most of the recharge is diffuse through outcrops located by the north of toulon springs fig 1 localized infiltration occurs through sinkholes along the basin several tracer tests have been conducted over the past 30 years leading to the delineation of the catchment area of toulon springs fig 1 this area crosses the beauronne river to the west of the basin the beauronne river has sinkholes situated in the main bed that may possibly participate in the recharge of the aquifer however during low water periods the beauronne river does not flow 2 2 climate the climate of périgueux is temperate with an average annual temperature of 13 c an average summer temperature between 20 c and 21 c and an average winter temperature between 5 c and 6 c the study area has three rainfall stations and one meteorological station fig 1 in order to cover the whole hydrogeological basin of toulon springs although the average annual precipitation varies between 800 and 1000 mm evapotranspiration from vegetation and soil leads to a computed effective rainfall ranging from 200 to 350 mm per year calculated from the penman monteith equation evapotranspiration reaches a peak in july october when rainfall is generally insufficient to produce any significant discharge except during strong storms illustrating by toulon springs the main objective of this work is to understand the hydrogeological functioning of a complex karst system fed by multilayered karst aquifer on the northern edge of a sedimentary basin 3 material and methods the main experimental strategy aims to evaluate the hydrogeological functioning of a toulon springs then it intends to assess dynamics of the flow during high water periods and low water periods both from a hydrodynamic and hydrochemical point of view finally water samples and in situ measurements performed on the study area aim to identify different water types flowing into both jurassic and cretaceous karst aquifers 3 1 water sampling and data continuous monitoring at toulon springs water samples were collected semi monthly from february 2014 to october 2015 and weekly from october 2015 to october 2017 with daily sampling during groundwater flood events a total of 187 samples were collected from toulon springs in the field a multiparameter wtw 3430 was used to measure temperature t ph ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen o2 to a precision of 0 1 c 0 05 1 µs cm 1 and 0 1 mg l 1 respectively alkalinity was measured within 12 h by acid titration at the laboratory i2m gce bordeaux high resolution monitoring is perform at toulon springs since 2015 the electrical conductivity ec turbidity dissolved organic carbon doc nitrate no3 water temperature t and dissolved oxygen o2 are recorded every 10 min with an accuracy of 1 µs cm 1 0 02 ntu 0 02 mg l 1 0 05 mg l 1 0 1 c 0 05 mg l 1 respectively finally discharge is measured every 15 min at toulon springs since 2007 with an accuracy of 0 5 additional water samples and in situ measurements are performed during high water periods and low water periods from i godet spring an epikarstic spring from santonian karst aquifer ii clavelie spring representative of the saturated zone of the cretaceous multilayered karst aquifer and iii copo spring representative of water from deep origin water samples were collected semi monthly from both godet spring and clavelie spring water samples were collected every month from copo spring a total of 127 samples were collected 50 from godet spring 58 from clavelie spring and 19 from copo spring all springs are located within a maximul distance of a few km from toulon springs fig 1 ion concentrations ca2 mg2 na k cl no3 and so4 2 were determined by chromatography using a dionex ics 1500 for the cations and using a dionex ics 1100 equipped measurement accuracy 2 dissolved organic carbon concentrations were determined using a shimadzu toc 5000a toc analyzer measurement accuracy 8 silica sio2 concentrations were determined using the strickland and parsons 1972 method measurement accuracy 15 fluid mineral equilibrium e g saturation index with respect to calcite sic calcite and co2 partial pressure pco2 was calculated with phreeqc software version 3 3 parkhurst and appelo 1999 3 2 data processing and interpretation a multidisciplinary approach is performed to determine the hydrogeological functioning of the toulon karst system this methodology combines both hydrodynamic and hydrochemical approaches coupled with statistical approach 3 2 1 recession analysis an analysis of the recession curve is usually conducted to determine the storage capacity of the system mangin 1975 bonacci 1993 padilla et al 1994 amit et al 2002 mudarra and andreo 2011 eris and wittenberg 2015 fu et al 2016 based on the maillet equation 1905 mangin 1975 concluded that an exponential equation was suitable for modeling the baseflow eq 1 1 q t q r0 e α t where qr0 is the initial baseflow rate and α is the baseflow recession coefficient although maillet 1905 developed eq 1 from catchments with aquifers consisting of granulated media it has been very widely used for karst media i e non homogeneous and anisotropic media with fissures numerous authors have used eq 1 to describe the discharge hydrograph of a karst aquifer and to identify its transportation and storage characteristics drogue 1972 atkinson 1997 karanjac and altug 1980 bonacci 1993 bonacci and jelin 1988 korkmaz 1990 soulios 1991 according to mangin 1975 bonacci 1993 amit et al 2002 fu et al 2016 baseflow recession coefficients are mostly between 10 1 day 1 and 10 3 day 1 however el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 studied some karst springs with baseflow recession coefficients of 10 4 day 1 in karst systems in the middle east lebanon in france touvre springs charente also exhibited a coefficient of 10 4 day 1 rouiller 1987 recession coefficients describe the discharge of the saturated zone usually a low recession coefficient implies a large saturated zone with high storage capacity however it could also imply baseflow support by external items from the considered karst system it could be swallow holes situated in rivers touvre springs chartreux spring or supply by another aquifer integrating the recession analysis over time provides the dynamic volume eq 2 that is water available through the drainage from the saturated zone tallaksen 1995 amit et al 2002 farlin and maloszewski 2013 2 v d y n q r 0 where vdyn is the dynamic volume 3 2 2 time series analysis univariate auto correlation function acf and bivariate cross correlation function ccf analyses are widely used in time series analysis these analyses could characterize the temporal structure of the hydrologic signal under linear stationary hypotheses mangin 1984 padilla and pulido bosch 1995 larocque et al 1998 labat et al 2000 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 the acf examines how a value depends on the preceding values over a period of time the graphical representation of this function is called correlogram the slope of the correlogram characterizes the response of the system to an event the larger the slope is the more the karst system has a typical karstic functioning in contrast the lower the slope is the less the karst system has inertial hydrodynamic responses usually the length of the influence of an event is given by the memory effect which is according to mangin 1984 the lag time when the acf reaches the value of 0 2 ccf is used to determine the relationship between two variables x and y usually these two variables have an input output relationship as for rainfall discharge this analysis gives the impulse response caused by an input signal considered as random some authors have used ccf to determine the relationship between other variables as for rainfall electrical conductivity turbidity and water temperature larocque et al 1998 bouchaou et al 2002 amraoui et al 2003 genthon et al 2005 massei et al 2006 the ccf is represented by a cross correlogram which has a positive part and a negative part a peak in the positive part means that there is a causal relationship between the input and output time series a peak in the negative part means that the output signal is anti correlated with the input signal the maximum amplitude and the lag value of the ccf provide information about delay which indicates the time of the pressure pulse transfer into the aquifer shorter delay times mean faster aquifer transfer when rainfall is considered as input and discharge as output correlogram memory effect and delay time can be use to describe the karstification degree and the response of the aquifer covington et al 2009 lo russo et al 2014 mayaud et al 2014 fu et al 2016 3 2 3 classification of karst systems the baseflow recession coefficient and the associated dynamic volume generally lead to the addition of a karst system into the classification of karst systems proposed by mangin 1975 and modified by el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 mangin 1975 considers two indices i k the regulation power defining the extent of the saturated zone of the karst system and ii i the infiltration delay characterizing the infiltration conditions the k parameter is the ratio between the maximum dynamic volume observed during a long term time series and the average annual transit volume the i parameter corresponds to the value of the homographic function y eq 3 at t 2 3 y 1 η t 1 ε t ith the η infiltration velocity in day 1 and ε the flow heterogeneity in day 1 mangin 1975 and el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 defined five domains within the space defined by i and k domains have been defined after calculations were performed on well known karst systems 3 2 4 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca shows the relations and correlations between variables it is based on sample variations of variables variations is represented in a factorial plane composed by two factor axes pca is performed with standardized data i e data subtracted from their average and divided by their standard deviations coordinates of variables in this plane range from 1 to 1 on the x axis and on the y axis the more a variable is projected near the correlation circle the more it is emphasized in the pca when two or more variables are located in the same area of this factor plane they are positively correlated conversely when two or more are located on opposite sides of the factor plane they are negatively correlated principal component analysis is used to identify clusters of samples that are inclined towards specific variables pca is usually used to describe waters of karst systems fournier et al 2007 mudarra and andreo 2011 mudarra et al 2011 dassi 2011 bicalho et al 2012 minvielle et al 2015 4 results 4 1 hydrograph analysis from 2007 to 2017 hydrodynamic data rainfall and discharge were recorded fig 2 discharge data were obtained at the outlet of the karst system rainfall data were obtained at rainfall stations located on the basin fig 1 toulon springs have a mean annual daily discharge of 450 l s 1 with a minimum discharge of approximately 230 l s 1 16 10 2011 and a maximum discharge of approximately 940 l s 1 16 02 2014 seven recession curves from 2007 to 2016 were considered the fitting procedure described previously was applied to the hydrographs of toulon springs fig 2 to find the initial discharge baseflow qr0 the duration of the recession ti the baseflow recession coefficient α and the associated dynamic volume vdyn table 1 the average baseflow recession coefficient and the average dynamic volume for 7 cycles are 7 10 4 day 1 and 50 2 million m3 respectively climate situations differ from one year to the next a wet year implies a greater baseflow discharge than during a dry year despite these dissimilarities calculated recession coefficients are always of the same order of magnitude 10 4 day 1 the α coefficient is the baseflow coefficient from the aquifer when rainfall does not supply discharge at the outlet of the karst system it is similar to the discharge of the saturated zone this is an intrinsic characteristic of the aquifer the hydrological year 2014 2015 which was dry with an annual precipitation of 612 2 mm is a good example to study the toulon springs recession fig 3 after a wet winter which generated three flood events the summer was dry and did not generate any flood event the 2015 recession was the longest recession recorded in ten years the recession period covered from 30 06 2015 to 01 01 2016 during this period the baseflow recession coefficient was assessed to be 4 40 10 4 day 1 which is close to the average this parameter is considered a low value for a karst spring and imply a poor drainage efficiency of the saturated zone on the catchment area of toulon springs a baseflow support from the beauronne river can be suspected however as the river is dry during the baseflow regime at toulon springs this support may be negligible dynamic volumes calculated from the baseflow recession coefficients are between 29 8 million m3 and 77 4 million m3 this result is high compared to the hydrogeological basin of the toulon karst system approximately 100 km2 for comparison fontaine de vaucluse karst system in france has a calculated dynamic volume of 101 million m3 for a hydrogeological basin of 1115 km2 mangin 1975 these results provide information about the high storage capacity of the toulon karst system and imply a large water quantity is available in the saturated zone of the karst aquifer the complex geological situation could imply connections between several aquifers leading to a steady discharge during low water periods 4 2 auto and cross correlation functions auto correlation functions acfs and cross correlation functions ccfs were performed on daily discharge measured at toulon springs between july 2005 and october 2016 the acf illustrates a memory effect of 77 days fig 4 a and confirms the poor drainage efficiency of toulon springs which are emptied over a long period of time similar results are found in bigger karst systems for comparison fontaine des chartreux karst system in france 250 km2 and fontaine de vaucluse karst system 1115 km2 have memory effects of 71 days and 75 days respectively according to moussu 2011 however smaller karst systems have a similar memory effect for example el torcal karst system in spain 28 km2 has a memory effect of 70 days padilla and pulido bosch 1995 the ccf between rainfall and discharge fig 4b provides additional information on the functioning of the toulon karst system in this work all data available rainfall and discharge since january 2007 are used since rainfall can be considered as random the results show an average impulse response of 5 days of lag time after a rainfall event with an intensity value of 0 22 fig 4b usually the higher this value is the more the karst system has the ability to transfer rainfall to the contrary a low value illustrates the ability of the system to filter rainfall the result for the bivariate analysis for toulon springs is in agreement with those found by a previous study where the lag time is between hours bailly comte et al 2008 covington et al 2009 mayaud et al 2014 and days padilla and pulido bosch 1995 larocque et al 1998 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 the ccf shows that a quickflow component is present average response of 5 days after a rainfall event however a large part of the input signal is filtered through the karst system ccf of 0 22 the low slope from 25 to 70 days may confirm the predominance of the baseflow component at the outlet of the karst system this value 70 days is a measure of the length of the impulse response of the system according to the recession analysis it means that the ccf shows predominantly the hydrologic response of the system being influenced by fast infiltration before 5 days 4 3 chemograph analysis from february 2014 to october 2017 hydrodynamic and hydrochemical data were obtained in different water conditions recharge recession depletion table 2 summarizes the main hydrochemical data of toulon springs godet spring clavelie spring and copo spring fig 1 fig 5 illustrates the temporal evolution of discharge and hydrochemical parameters from toulon springs analysis of hydrochemical parameters from toulon springs distinguish two main water types i typical low water period hydrochemical signature with good water quality and ii high water period hydrochemical signature with indices of surface contamination which illustrate quick responses of the karst system water from low water periods usually measured from summer to autumn is described by warmer water 14 40 c compared to regional springs 12 5 c as described by peyraube et al 2012 peyraube et al 2013 houillon et al 2017 and with mg concentration 12 00 mg l 1 and o2 concentration 4 00 mg l 1 electrical conductivity ec and hco3 concentration are stable 590 µs cm 1 and 350 mg l 1 associated with low discharge at the outlet of the karst system water quality is better turbidity is below the french standard for potability 0 20 ntu no3 concentration and d o c concentration are also lower than during high water periods 10 mg l 1 and 0 20 mg l 1 during the low water periods water is in equilibrium with calcite sic 0 00 and has pco2 values lower than during high water periods 2 50 despite these similarities observed every year the climate situation forces different natural responses at toulon springs water from high water periods is usually measured during the winter and spring during this period high rainfall intensity implies quick hydrochemical variations at toulon springs associated with aquifer recharge high water periods during 2015 2016 and 2017 are contrasted winters in 2015 and 2017 winters experienced little rain and discharge responses were low with only a few floods of low magnitude in contrast after a low water period of six months the 2016 winter was very rainy 582 mm from january to june a rainy situation exhibits the occurrence of several long flood events of high magnitude hydrochemical natural responses are quite similar from one hydrological cycle to another natural tracers evolve associated with discharge 1 pressure transfer propagating into the karst system enables an increase of turbidity values and a mobilization of more mineralized waters stored in the saturated zone this arrival of water is characterized by an increase in electrical conductivity 605 µs cm 1 2 then mass transfer implies a decrease in water mineralization illustrated by a decrease in electrical conductivity 520 µs cm 1 and a decrease in hco3 concentrations 290 00 mg l 1 and mg concentrations 3 00 mg l 1 the decrease in water temperature 12 80 c and increase in o2 concentration 7 5 mg l 1 and d o c concentration 2 50 g l 1 characterize a quick infiltration from surficial waters during recharge events water flowing at toulon springs is under saturated with respect to calcite 0 25 and has the greatest pco2 concentration 3 8 4 4 principal component analysis a principal component analysis pca was conducted using data from toulon springs coupled to other waters types observed in the study area i waters from copo spring representative of water from the jurassic ii waters from clavelie spring representative of the cretaceous saturated zone and iii waters from godet spring representative of cretaceous superficial aquifers water the pca is based on 298 samples 171 from toulon springs 19 from copo spring 58 from clavelie spring and 50 from godet spring collected from february 2014 to october 2017 and 12 variables t ph o2 ec ca mg hco3 no3 doc sio2 sic and pco2 the first factor plane f1 f2 explains 75 52 of the total variance the results of the pca are presented through the variable space fig 6 the first axis f1 is explained by t ph sic and mg in its positive part and ca sio2 pco2 and o2 in its negative part water origins can be qualified with the f1 axis jurassic waters in its positive part and cretaceous waters in its negative part toward the positive part waters tend to have an increasing proportion of deep waters from the jurassic aquifer the second axis f2 is explained by ec and hco3 in its positive part and o2 and d o c in its negative part it represents cretaceous saturated zone waters in its positive part and infiltration waters in its negative part waters from godet spring are scattered between two poles fig 6 i new recharge water during high water periods and ii cretaceous saturated zone waters during low water periods godet spring can be seen as a good example of a karst spring fed by a single aquifer waters from clavelie spring are mainly located in the positive part of the f2 axis and can be qualified as cretaceous saturated zone waters however during winter flood events samples can move towards the negative part of the f2 axis and can be associated with a majority of new recharge water fig 6 waters from copo spring are only located in the positive part of the f1 axis and constitute the jurassic waters pole fig 6 these waters show few hydrochemical variations it is mainly characterized by warm waters 20 40 c with high magnesium concentration 22 3 mg l 1 and low dissolved oxygen concentration 1 60 mg l 1 waters from toulon springs are expanded along the 3 main poles represented in this pca fig 6 1 during high water periods new recharge water explains the majority of waters flowing to toulon springs 2 at the beginning of the recession waters evolve towards the positive part of the f2 axis the proportion of infiltration waters decreases and the proportion of cretaceous saturated zone waters increases associated with the decrease in discharge 3 finally during low water periods waters flowing at toulon springs evolve towards the positive part of the f1 axis leading to a mixture of cretaceous saturated zone waters with jurassic waters 5 discussion 5 1 classification of karst systems calculated parameters i and k situate toulon springs into the classification of karst systems according to fig 7 toulon springs are located in domain 5 added by el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 before this study the touvre karst system was the only french karst system which was also located in domain 5 despite their proximity in the classification touvre springs and toulon springs do not exhibit the same functioning touvre springs are fed by swallow holes 50 located in a river implying steady baseflow discharge during low water periods larocque 1997 consequently the calculated dynamic volume at touvre springs does not represent the stock of water available to the saturated zone of the aquifer in contrast the calculated dynamic volume at toulon springs represents the water available to the saturated zone of the aquifer during low water periods this stock supports the discharge at the outlet of the karst system implying a steady discharge el torcal karst system cannot be part of this classification because the i parameter cannot be estimated 5 2 new recharge water and vulnerability of the toulon karst system from a contamination point of view nitrate is a relevant parameter nitrate responses in karst systems can have various scenarios i mobilized nitrate concentrations pronk et al 2009 ii diluted nitrate concentrations mahler et al 2008 iii a combination of mobilized and diluted nitrate concentrations during a single flood event rowden et al 2001 iv mobilized and diluted nitrate concentrations during multiple events stueber and criss 2005 predominance of mobilization or dilution of nitrate concentration during storm events depends highly on the availability of nitrate accumulates in soil and the unsaturated zone rainfall events have an influence on the intensity and time lag of nitrate concentration changes huebsch et al 2014 in the toulon karst system diffuse no3 contamination from the surface exhibits no3 concentrations in the saturated zone between 11 mg l 1 and 12 mg l 1 these same concentrations are found at toulon springs when the system is not influenced by rainfall during recharge events the first flood event leads to an increase of no3 concentrations 16 58 mg l 1 on 06 02 2015 and 19 3 mg l 1 on 18 01 2016 associated with an increase in d o c concentrations the increase in concentrations results in the mobilization of no3 storage in soil and the unsaturated zone of the aquifer during low water periods then associated with the next flood events no3 concentrations were under the value of 12 mg l 1 10 31 mg l 1 on 16 04 2014 and 10 51 mg l 1 on 23 04 2016 indicating that the main stock of no3 storage in the soil and the unsaturated zone of the aquifer was moved to the outlet of the karst system during the previous flood event the decrease in no3 concentrations is still associated with an increase in d o c concentration 3 22 mg l 1 on 16 04 2014 and 2 26 mg l 1 on 23 04 2016 indicating that dilution water has the same of origin 5 3 magnesium dissolved oxygen relationships high magnesium concentrations observed during low water periods are uncommon for a water resource associated with the turonian aquifer in dordogne recently regional studies peyraube et al 2012 houillon 2016 show low magnesium concentrations in upper cretaceous aquifers less than 5 mg l 1 as a result of the absence of dolomite the question of the origin of magnesium concentrations is one of the main objectives associated with the hydrogeological functioning of the toulon karst system high values of magnesium concentration are only observed in confined jurassic aquifers more than 20 mg l 1 as a result of the presence of magnesium calcite local complex hydrogeological situations associated with possible relationships between upper jurassic and upper cretaceous aquifers make it difficult to understand the origin of magnesium in toulon springs dissolved oxygen is a relevant parameter for the toulon karst system usually in karst aquifers good connection with the atmosphere implies oxic waters at the outlet of the karst system perrin et al 2007 mahler et al 2011 musgrove et al 2011 deep water mobilization could be responsible for low o2 concentrations observed at toulon springs during low water periods this phenomenon has already been demonstrated at barton springs estafanía et al 2011 mahler and bourgeais 2013 the comparison of o2 concentration and magnesium concentration fig 8 from springs presented in this current work shows that o2 alone is not a relevant parameter to the mobilization of waters from the jurassic confined aquifer clavelie spring representative of an upper cretaceous saturated zone has similar o2 concentrations as toulon springs table 2 however magnesium concentrations are lower 5 88 on 08 12 2015 during high water periods clavelie and toulon waters are very close on this diagram confirming the similar origin of their waters as noticed in the pca fig 6 during low water periods the o2 vs mg diagram fig 8 identifies two straight lines i the first one increasing from high water of toulon springs to copo spring waters indicating the mixture with a jurassic confined aquifer and ii the second one increasing toward the low waters of clavelie spring illustrating the residence time of the water in the aquifer and the magnesium calcite dissolution 5 4 toulon springs conceptual functioning the complex hydrogeological situation of the toulon karst system includes two multilayered karst aquifers i a fractured and karstified multilayered cretaceous aquifer turonian coniacian and santonian ii a jurassic dolomitic limestone multilayered karst aquifer kimmeridgian oxfordian bathonian and bajocian the approach used in this work aims to evaluate the relationships between these aquifers the first step is to identify the inertial behavior of toulon springs during low water periods associated with a high dynamic volume recession analysis acf these characteristics are not usual for a french karst system illustrating the importance of this karst system from a drinking water point of view a part of this work was to evaluate the quick flow component during a recharge event ccf hydrodynamic tools were used to conduct the evaluation of dual behavior between high water periods and low water periods the second step was to exhibit the natural hydrochemical characteristics of water two main water types were identified i a first one during low water periods associated with a deep origin with good water quality fig 9 b and ii a second one during high water periods associated with quick infiltration from surficial waters during recharge events fig 9a the comparison of different water types observed in the study area pca leads to the identification of the main components that fed toulon springs fig 9 i confined jurassic karst aquifer and ii unconfined cretaceous karst aquifer the contribution rates between these two end members are different according to the hydrological conditions during low water periods jurassic aquifer contribution is more important than during high water periods in contrast during high water periods the upper cretaceous aquifer mainly participates to the flow of toulon springs the complex geological situation of the edge of the sedimentary basin involves difficulties in the recharge evaluation of deep aquifers over the study area jurassic confined karst aquifer and cretaceous karst aquifer are supposedly separated by cenomanian marls fig 1 upstream of toulon springs the recharge of the jurassic aquifer can operate in confined or unconfined parts in unconfined parts recharge is possible if i cenomanian becomes sandy and ii the jurassic hydraulic head is below the cretaceous one due to the lack of data about lithological facies variations or piezometric level the hypothesis of recharge cannot be proven yet 6 conclusion the first objective was to assess the water quantity available into the toulon karst system using natural hydrodynamic responses the second one was to assess the water quality using natural hydrochemical responses the third one was to combine these tools to evaluate the functioning of a typical example of a complex karst system drained by two multilayered karst aquifers located on the northern edge of a sedimentary basin proposing a conceptual model of functioning observations coupled to knowledge of the complex hydrogeological situation suggest that toulon springs flow is fed by a mixing of two aquifers i the jurassic confined karst aquifer oxfordian kimmeridgian bathonian and bajocian which is responsible for low water period support and related to dolomitic hydrochemical characteristics and ii the upper cretaceous unconfined aquifer turonian coniacian and santonian which is responsible for quick hydrodynamic and hydrochemical variations observed at toulon springs we suggest discussions about the common use of magnesium concentrations and dissolved oxygen concentrations to differentiate i the mixture between two aquifers as a result of the presence of magnesium calcite and ii an increase in the residence time of the water as a result of the absence of dolomite the o2 vs mg diagram is an innovative tool to use in complex hydrogeological situations with complex relationships between aquifers dolomitic and limestone aquifers this methodology based on both hydrodynamic and hydrochemical natural responses is an efficient tool to characterize the functioning of a complex multilayered karst system located on the edge of a sedimentary basin the main advantage is the easy way of implementing the method leading to an easy method of comparison between karst systems acknowledgements this work was supported by the

keywords multilayered karst aquifer hydrochemistry hydrodynamic hydrogeology 1 introduction karst aquifers are one of the most important water supply sources worldwide approximately 25 of the world s population consumes water obtained from karst aquifers ford and willians 2007 these complex systems have a high degree of heterogeneity that distinguish them from other aquifers white 1988 bakalowicz 1995 2005 ford and willians 2007 worthington and ford 2009 analysis of karst systems is usually led using several methods based on classical chemistry isotopic chemistry hydrodynamic responses or some lithology characteristics of carbonates the joint use of hydrodynamic and hydrochemical techniques within the framework of a multidisciplinary approach provides a reliable characterization of the hydrogeological functioning of karst aquifers lastennet and mudry 1997 grasso et al 2003 perrin et al 2003 birk et al 2004 bicalho et al 2012 brkic et al 2018 filippini et al 2018 hydrochemical and hydrodynamic responses observed at the outlet of karst systems depend upon the flow conditions that prevail in the aquifer previous studies lastennet 1994 lastennet and mudry 1997 raeisi and karami 1997 emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003a batiot et al 2003b emblanch et al 2003 doctor et al 2006 mudarra and andreo 2011 nicolini et al 2016 have focused on the joint use of natural hydrochemical tracers such as dissolved organic carbon d o c nitrates no3 or magnesium mg to improve the knowledge about the functioning of these karst systems most of karst studies tried to apply their methods on springs fed by a single karst aquifer the geological history of the edge of sedimentary basins can lead to the formation of multilayered aquifers through the progressive burial of geological layers this burial involves the passage of unconfined aquifers to confined aquifers of some layers the succession of periods of regression transgression implies several karstification phases this involves complex relationships between unconfined and confined multilayered aquifers in some cases a karst spring can act as the outlet for both of these multilayered aquifers this implies complex hydrodynamic and hydrochemical responses at the spring and an increased difficulty in accurate delineation of limits of the karst system the recharge of these multilayered karst aquifers is a major issue for the edge of sedimentary basins few studies focus their attention on karst springs fed by several aquifers we can note insights from the work of bicalho et al 2012 or mahler and bourgeais 2013 recent studies have proposed several polyphased karstification concepts in relation to both epigene and hypogene karstification klimchouk 2007 2012 palmer 2011 audra et al 2015 husson et al 2016 the site of toulon springs is a good example of a complex karst system drained by two multilayered karst aquifers from jurassic and cretaceous aquifers located on the northern edge of the aquitaine sedimentary basin 66 000 km2 polyphased karstification concepts are directly linked to the geological history of the aquitaine basin pelissié 1982 platel 1987 cubaynes et al 1989 rey et al 1988 pélissié and astruc 1996 toulon springs have been supplying water to the metropolitan area of périgueux dordogne county france since the 19th century previous works von stempel 1972 lastennet et al 2004 lorette et al 2016 have led to the first studies but have left questions about the functioning and groundwater origins of toulon springs toulon springs provide the opportunity to understand the functioning of a multi reservoir karst aquifer using simple acquisition of hydrodynamic responses and natural hydrochemical tracers geochemical monitoring of several karst springs allows for toulon springs to be placed into a local hydrogeological situation and to identify the different aquifers participating in the feeding of toulon springs particular attention is given to the origins of magnesium and to the relationship between magnesium concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration in both confined and unconfined karst aquifers emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003a mahler and bourgeais 2013 previously discuss these parameters because of the close connection with the surface and short travel times groundwater in many karst aquifers is oxic perrin et al 2007 mahler et al 2011 musgrove et al 2011 in some cases the dissolved oxygen concentration can decrease associated with increased magnesium concentration this information is linked to residence time of water into the aquifer or to a mix of water with several aquifers it will be discussed in this work the main goal of this paper is to use a multidisciplinary approach to determine the groundwater flow mechanism of a single spring fed by a multilayered karst aquifer the first objective is to assess the water quantity available into the toulon karst system using natural hydrodynamic responses the second one is to assess the water quality using natural hydrochemical responses the third one is to combine these tools to evaluate the functioning of a typical example of a complex karst system drained by two multilayered karst aquifers located on the northern edge of a sedimentary basin proposing a conceptual model of functioning 2 general characteristics of the study area 2 1 local geology and hydrogeology toulon springs are major regional springs and are located in périgueux south western france at the northern edge of the aquitaine sedimentary basin it is a vauclusian type spring located on a major faulted anticlinal structure oriented n145 lastennet et al 2004 toulon springs are the main perennial outlet of the karst system that can reach almost 1 000 l s 1 during rainfall events with a mean annual daily discharge of 450 l s 1 the geological situation of the toulon karst system consists of upper cretaceous and upper jurassic carbonate rocks fig 1 with a thickness of 200 250 m for cretaceous rocks and 300 350 m for jurassic rocks kimmeridgian oxfordian bathonian bajocian von stempel 1972 at the top cretaceous rocks consist of limestone while jurassic rocks consist of dolomitic limestone and dolomites the geological structure of the toulon karst system is characterized by the existence of folds and fractures in a mainly nw se direction fig 1 karst landforms are well developed at the surface of the carbonate outcrops mainly in cretaceous limestone as noticed by the existence of dolines and swallow holes the regional hydrogeological situation consists of two main multilayered karst aquifers fig 1 fractured and karstified cretaceous limestone constitutes the first main aquifer it is composed of a turonian aquifer coniacian aquifer and santonian aquifer fig 1 below jurassic dolomitic limestone constitutes the second main aquifer of the study area it is composed of a kimmeridgian aquifer oxfordian aquifer bathonian aquifer and bajocian aquifer fig 1 the marls of the cenomanian are considered to be the impermeable limit of these two main aquifers spatial thickness variations 4 20 m and facies variations marls sands over the study area induce an additional difficulty in the understanding of the relationships between the two main aquifers although both of these aquifers are supposedly hydrogeologically isolated deep water rising occurs from the jurassic into the cretaceous through the faulted anticline structure of périgueux this deep water rising is illustrated by the presence of many warm springs between 20 and 21 c including copo spring club olympique de perigueux ouest fig 1 located in the isle river valley the isle river represents the regional base level of the toulon karst system the hydrogeological catchment of toulon springs has an area of approximately 100 km2 fig 1 a large part of the hydrogeological catchment is relatively permeable due to the presence of limestone of the santonian and the coniacian most of the recharge is diffuse through outcrops located by the north of toulon springs fig 1 localized infiltration occurs through sinkholes along the basin several tracer tests have been conducted over the past 30 years leading to the delineation of the catchment area of toulon springs fig 1 this area crosses the beauronne river to the west of the basin the beauronne river has sinkholes situated in the main bed that may possibly participate in the recharge of the aquifer however during low water periods the beauronne river does not flow 2 2 climate the climate of périgueux is temperate with an average annual temperature of 13 c an average summer temperature between 20 c and 21 c and an average winter temperature between 5 c and 6 c the study area has three rainfall stations and one meteorological station fig 1 in order to cover the whole hydrogeological basin of toulon springs although the average annual precipitation varies between 800 and 1000 mm evapotranspiration from vegetation and soil leads to a computed effective rainfall ranging from 200 to 350 mm per year calculated from the penman monteith equation evapotranspiration reaches a peak in july october when rainfall is generally insufficient to produce any significant discharge except during strong storms illustrating by toulon springs the main objective of this work is to understand the hydrogeological functioning of a complex karst system fed by multilayered karst aquifer on the northern edge of a sedimentary basin 3 material and methods the main experimental strategy aims to evaluate the hydrogeological functioning of a toulon springs then it intends to assess dynamics of the flow during high water periods and low water periods both from a hydrodynamic and hydrochemical point of view finally water samples and in situ measurements performed on the study area aim to identify different water types flowing into both jurassic and cretaceous karst aquifers 3 1 water sampling and data continuous monitoring at toulon springs water samples were collected semi monthly from february 2014 to october 2015 and weekly from october 2015 to october 2017 with daily sampling during groundwater flood events a total of 187 samples were collected from toulon springs in the field a multiparameter wtw 3430 was used to measure temperature t ph ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen o2 to a precision of 0 1 c 0 05 1 µs cm 1 and 0 1 mg l 1 respectively alkalinity was measured within 12 h by acid titration at the laboratory i2m gce bordeaux high resolution monitoring is perform at toulon springs since 2015 the electrical conductivity ec turbidity dissolved organic carbon doc nitrate no3 water temperature t and dissolved oxygen o2 are recorded every 10 min with an accuracy of 1 µs cm 1 0 02 ntu 0 02 mg l 1 0 05 mg l 1 0 1 c 0 05 mg l 1 respectively finally discharge is measured every 15 min at toulon springs since 2007 with an accuracy of 0 5 additional water samples and in situ measurements are performed during high water periods and low water periods from i godet spring an epikarstic spring from santonian karst aquifer ii clavelie spring representative of the saturated zone of the cretaceous multilayered karst aquifer and iii copo spring representative of water from deep origin water samples were collected semi monthly from both godet spring and clavelie spring water samples were collected every month from copo spring a total of 127 samples were collected 50 from godet spring 58 from clavelie spring and 19 from copo spring all springs are located within a maximul distance of a few km from toulon springs fig 1 ion concentrations ca2 mg2 na k cl no3 and so4 2 were determined by chromatography using a dionex ics 1500 for the cations and using a dionex ics 1100 equipped measurement accuracy 2 dissolved organic carbon concentrations were determined using a shimadzu toc 5000a toc analyzer measurement accuracy 8 silica sio2 concentrations were determined using the strickland and parsons 1972 method measurement accuracy 15 fluid mineral equilibrium e g saturation index with respect to calcite sic calcite and co2 partial pressure pco2 was calculated with phreeqc software version 3 3 parkhurst and appelo 1999 3 2 data processing and interpretation a multidisciplinary approach is performed to determine the hydrogeological functioning of the toulon karst system this methodology combines both hydrodynamic and hydrochemical approaches coupled with statistical approach 3 2 1 recession analysis an analysis of the recession curve is usually conducted to determine the storage capacity of the system mangin 1975 bonacci 1993 padilla et al 1994 amit et al 2002 mudarra and andreo 2011 eris and wittenberg 2015 fu et al 2016 based on the maillet equation 1905 mangin 1975 concluded that an exponential equation was suitable for modeling the baseflow eq 1 1 q t q r0 e α t where qr0 is the initial baseflow rate and α is the baseflow recession coefficient although maillet 1905 developed eq 1 from catchments with aquifers consisting of granulated media it has been very widely used for karst media i e non homogeneous and anisotropic media with fissures numerous authors have used eq 1 to describe the discharge hydrograph of a karst aquifer and to identify its transportation and storage characteristics drogue 1972 atkinson 1997 karanjac and altug 1980 bonacci 1993 bonacci and jelin 1988 korkmaz 1990 soulios 1991 according to mangin 1975 bonacci 1993 amit et al 2002 fu et al 2016 baseflow recession coefficients are mostly between 10 1 day 1 and 10 3 day 1 however el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 studied some karst springs with baseflow recession coefficients of 10 4 day 1 in karst systems in the middle east lebanon in france touvre springs charente also exhibited a coefficient of 10 4 day 1 rouiller 1987 recession coefficients describe the discharge of the saturated zone usually a low recession coefficient implies a large saturated zone with high storage capacity however it could also imply baseflow support by external items from the considered karst system it could be swallow holes situated in rivers touvre springs chartreux spring or supply by another aquifer integrating the recession analysis over time provides the dynamic volume eq 2 that is water available through the drainage from the saturated zone tallaksen 1995 amit et al 2002 farlin and maloszewski 2013 2 v d y n q r 0 where vdyn is the dynamic volume 3 2 2 time series analysis univariate auto correlation function acf and bivariate cross correlation function ccf analyses are widely used in time series analysis these analyses could characterize the temporal structure of the hydrologic signal under linear stationary hypotheses mangin 1984 padilla and pulido bosch 1995 larocque et al 1998 labat et al 2000 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 the acf examines how a value depends on the preceding values over a period of time the graphical representation of this function is called correlogram the slope of the correlogram characterizes the response of the system to an event the larger the slope is the more the karst system has a typical karstic functioning in contrast the lower the slope is the less the karst system has inertial hydrodynamic responses usually the length of the influence of an event is given by the memory effect which is according to mangin 1984 the lag time when the acf reaches the value of 0 2 ccf is used to determine the relationship between two variables x and y usually these two variables have an input output relationship as for rainfall discharge this analysis gives the impulse response caused by an input signal considered as random some authors have used ccf to determine the relationship between other variables as for rainfall electrical conductivity turbidity and water temperature larocque et al 1998 bouchaou et al 2002 amraoui et al 2003 genthon et al 2005 massei et al 2006 the ccf is represented by a cross correlogram which has a positive part and a negative part a peak in the positive part means that there is a causal relationship between the input and output time series a peak in the negative part means that the output signal is anti correlated with the input signal the maximum amplitude and the lag value of the ccf provide information about delay which indicates the time of the pressure pulse transfer into the aquifer shorter delay times mean faster aquifer transfer when rainfall is considered as input and discharge as output correlogram memory effect and delay time can be use to describe the karstification degree and the response of the aquifer covington et al 2009 lo russo et al 2014 mayaud et al 2014 fu et al 2016 3 2 3 classification of karst systems the baseflow recession coefficient and the associated dynamic volume generally lead to the addition of a karst system into the classification of karst systems proposed by mangin 1975 and modified by el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 mangin 1975 considers two indices i k the regulation power defining the extent of the saturated zone of the karst system and ii i the infiltration delay characterizing the infiltration conditions the k parameter is the ratio between the maximum dynamic volume observed during a long term time series and the average annual transit volume the i parameter corresponds to the value of the homographic function y eq 3 at t 2 3 y 1 η t 1 ε t ith the η infiltration velocity in day 1 and ε the flow heterogeneity in day 1 mangin 1975 and el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 defined five domains within the space defined by i and k domains have been defined after calculations were performed on well known karst systems 3 2 4 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca shows the relations and correlations between variables it is based on sample variations of variables variations is represented in a factorial plane composed by two factor axes pca is performed with standardized data i e data subtracted from their average and divided by their standard deviations coordinates of variables in this plane range from 1 to 1 on the x axis and on the y axis the more a variable is projected near the correlation circle the more it is emphasized in the pca when two or more variables are located in the same area of this factor plane they are positively correlated conversely when two or more are located on opposite sides of the factor plane they are negatively correlated principal component analysis is used to identify clusters of samples that are inclined towards specific variables pca is usually used to describe waters of karst systems fournier et al 2007 mudarra and andreo 2011 mudarra et al 2011 dassi 2011 bicalho et al 2012 minvielle et al 2015 4 results 4 1 hydrograph analysis from 2007 to 2017 hydrodynamic data rainfall and discharge were recorded fig 2 discharge data were obtained at the outlet of the karst system rainfall data were obtained at rainfall stations located on the basin fig 1 toulon springs have a mean annual daily discharge of 450 l s 1 with a minimum discharge of approximately 230 l s 1 16 10 2011 and a maximum discharge of approximately 940 l s 1 16 02 2014 seven recession curves from 2007 to 2016 were considered the fitting procedure described previously was applied to the hydrographs of toulon springs fig 2 to find the initial discharge baseflow qr0 the duration of the recession ti the baseflow recession coefficient α and the associated dynamic volume vdyn table 1 the average baseflow recession coefficient and the average dynamic volume for 7 cycles are 7 10 4 day 1 and 50 2 million m3 respectively climate situations differ from one year to the next a wet year implies a greater baseflow discharge than during a dry year despite these dissimilarities calculated recession coefficients are always of the same order of magnitude 10 4 day 1 the α coefficient is the baseflow coefficient from the aquifer when rainfall does not supply discharge at the outlet of the karst system it is similar to the discharge of the saturated zone this is an intrinsic characteristic of the aquifer the hydrological year 2014 2015 which was dry with an annual precipitation of 612 2 mm is a good example to study the toulon springs recession fig 3 after a wet winter which generated three flood events the summer was dry and did not generate any flood event the 2015 recession was the longest recession recorded in ten years the recession period covered from 30 06 2015 to 01 01 2016 during this period the baseflow recession coefficient was assessed to be 4 40 10 4 day 1 which is close to the average this parameter is considered a low value for a karst spring and imply a poor drainage efficiency of the saturated zone on the catchment area of toulon springs a baseflow support from the beauronne river can be suspected however as the river is dry during the baseflow regime at toulon springs this support may be negligible dynamic volumes calculated from the baseflow recession coefficients are between 29 8 million m3 and 77 4 million m3 this result is high compared to the hydrogeological basin of the toulon karst system approximately 100 km2 for comparison fontaine de vaucluse karst system in france has a calculated dynamic volume of 101 million m3 for a hydrogeological basin of 1115 km2 mangin 1975 these results provide information about the high storage capacity of the toulon karst system and imply a large water quantity is available in the saturated zone of the karst aquifer the complex geological situation could imply connections between several aquifers leading to a steady discharge during low water periods 4 2 auto and cross correlation functions auto correlation functions acfs and cross correlation functions ccfs were performed on daily discharge measured at toulon springs between july 2005 and october 2016 the acf illustrates a memory effect of 77 days fig 4 a and confirms the poor drainage efficiency of toulon springs which are emptied over a long period of time similar results are found in bigger karst systems for comparison fontaine des chartreux karst system in france 250 km2 and fontaine de vaucluse karst system 1115 km2 have memory effects of 71 days and 75 days respectively according to moussu 2011 however smaller karst systems have a similar memory effect for example el torcal karst system in spain 28 km2 has a memory effect of 70 days padilla and pulido bosch 1995 the ccf between rainfall and discharge fig 4b provides additional information on the functioning of the toulon karst system in this work all data available rainfall and discharge since january 2007 are used since rainfall can be considered as random the results show an average impulse response of 5 days of lag time after a rainfall event with an intensity value of 0 22 fig 4b usually the higher this value is the more the karst system has the ability to transfer rainfall to the contrary a low value illustrates the ability of the system to filter rainfall the result for the bivariate analysis for toulon springs is in agreement with those found by a previous study where the lag time is between hours bailly comte et al 2008 covington et al 2009 mayaud et al 2014 and days padilla and pulido bosch 1995 larocque et al 1998 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 the ccf shows that a quickflow component is present average response of 5 days after a rainfall event however a large part of the input signal is filtered through the karst system ccf of 0 22 the low slope from 25 to 70 days may confirm the predominance of the baseflow component at the outlet of the karst system this value 70 days is a measure of the length of the impulse response of the system according to the recession analysis it means that the ccf shows predominantly the hydrologic response of the system being influenced by fast infiltration before 5 days 4 3 chemograph analysis from february 2014 to october 2017 hydrodynamic and hydrochemical data were obtained in different water conditions recharge recession depletion table 2 summarizes the main hydrochemical data of toulon springs godet spring clavelie spring and copo spring fig 1 fig 5 illustrates the temporal evolution of discharge and hydrochemical parameters from toulon springs analysis of hydrochemical parameters from toulon springs distinguish two main water types i typical low water period hydrochemical signature with good water quality and ii high water period hydrochemical signature with indices of surface contamination which illustrate quick responses of the karst system water from low water periods usually measured from summer to autumn is described by warmer water 14 40 c compared to regional springs 12 5 c as described by peyraube et al 2012 peyraube et al 2013 houillon et al 2017 and with mg concentration 12 00 mg l 1 and o2 concentration 4 00 mg l 1 electrical conductivity ec and hco3 concentration are stable 590 µs cm 1 and 350 mg l 1 associated with low discharge at the outlet of the karst system water quality is better turbidity is below the french standard for potability 0 20 ntu no3 concentration and d o c concentration are also lower than during high water periods 10 mg l 1 and 0 20 mg l 1 during the low water periods water is in equilibrium with calcite sic 0 00 and has pco2 values lower than during high water periods 2 50 despite these similarities observed every year the climate situation forces different natural responses at toulon springs water from high water periods is usually measured during the winter and spring during this period high rainfall intensity implies quick hydrochemical variations at toulon springs associated with aquifer recharge high water periods during 2015 2016 and 2017 are contrasted winters in 2015 and 2017 winters experienced little rain and discharge responses were low with only a few floods of low magnitude in contrast after a low water period of six months the 2016 winter was very rainy 582 mm from january to june a rainy situation exhibits the occurrence of several long flood events of high magnitude hydrochemical natural responses are quite similar from one hydrological cycle to another natural tracers evolve associated with discharge 1 pressure transfer propagating into the karst system enables an increase of turbidity values and a mobilization of more mineralized waters stored in the saturated zone this arrival of water is characterized by an increase in electrical conductivity 605 µs cm 1 2 then mass transfer implies a decrease in water mineralization illustrated by a decrease in electrical conductivity 520 µs cm 1 and a decrease in hco3 concentrations 290 00 mg l 1 and mg concentrations 3 00 mg l 1 the decrease in water temperature 12 80 c and increase in o2 concentration 7 5 mg l 1 and d o c concentration 2 50 g l 1 characterize a quick infiltration from surficial waters during recharge events water flowing at toulon springs is under saturated with respect to calcite 0 25 and has the greatest pco2 concentration 3 8 4 4 principal component analysis a principal component analysis pca was conducted using data from toulon springs coupled to other waters types observed in the study area i waters from copo spring representative of water from the jurassic ii waters from clavelie spring representative of the cretaceous saturated zone and iii waters from godet spring representative of cretaceous superficial aquifers water the pca is based on 298 samples 171 from toulon springs 19 from copo spring 58 from clavelie spring and 50

results of the pca are presented through the variable space fig 6 the first axis f1 is explained by t ph sic and mg in its positive part and ca sio2 pco2 and o2 in its negative part water origins can be qualified with the f1 axis jurassic waters in its positive part and cretaceous waters in its negative part toward the positive part waters tend to have an increasing proportion of deep waters from the jurassic aquifer the second axis f2 is explained by ec and hco3 in its positive part and o2 and d o c in its negative part it represents cretaceous saturated zone waters in its positive part and infiltration waters in its negative part waters from godet spring are scattered between two poles fig 6 i new recharge water during high water periods and ii cretaceous saturated zone waters during low water periods godet spring can be seen as a good example of a karst spring fed by a single aquifer waters from clavelie spring are mainly located in the positive part of the f2 axis and can be qualified as cretaceous saturated zone waters however during winter flood events samples can move towards the negative part of the f2 axis and can be associated with a majority of new recharge water fig 6 waters from copo spring are only located in the positive part of the f1 axis and constitute the jurassic waters pole fig 6 these waters show few hydrochemical variations it is mainly characterized by warm waters 20 40 c with high magnesium concentration 22 3 mg l 1 and low dissolved oxygen concentration 1 60 mg l 1 waters from toulon springs are expanded along the 3 main poles represented in this pca fig 6 1 during high water periods new recharge water explains the majority of waters flowing to toulon springs 2 at the beginning of the recession waters evolve towards the positive part of the f2 axis the proportion of infiltration waters decreases and the proportion of cretaceous saturated zone waters increases associated with the decrease in discharge 3 finally during low water periods waters flowing at toulon springs evolve towards the positive part of the f1 axis leading to a mixture of cretaceous saturated zone waters with jurassic waters 5 discussion 5 1 classification of karst systems calculated parameters i and k situate toulon springs into the classification of karst systems according to fig 7 toulon springs are located in domain 5 added by el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 before this study the touvre karst system was the only french karst system which was also located in domain 5 despite their proximity in the classification touvre springs and toulon springs do not exhibit the same functioning touvre springs are fed by swallow holes 50 located in a river implying steady baseflow discharge during low water periods larocque 1997 consequently the calculated dynamic volume at touvre springs does not represent the stock of water available to the saturated zone of the aquifer in contrast the calculated dynamic volume at toulon springs represents the water available to the saturated zone of the aquifer during low water periods this stock supports the discharge at the outlet of the karst system implying a steady discharge el torcal karst system cannot be part of this classification because the i parameter cannot be estimated 5 2 new recharge water and vulnerability of the toulon karst system from a contamination point of view nitrate is a relevant parameter nitrate responses in karst systems can have various scenarios i mobilized nitrate concentrations pronk et al 2009 ii diluted nitrate concentrations mahler et al 2008 iii a combination of mobilized and diluted nitrate concentrations during a single flood event rowden et al 2001 iv mobilized and diluted nitrate concentrations during multiple events stueber and criss 2005 predominance of mobilization or dilution of nitrate concentration during storm events depends highly on the availability of nitrate accumulates in soil and the unsaturated zone rainfall events have an influence on the intensity and time lag of nitrate concentration changes huebsch et al 2014 in the toulon karst system diffuse no3 contamination from the surface exhibits no3 concentrations in the saturated zone between 11 mg l 1 and 12 mg l 1 these same concentrations are found at toulon springs when the system is not influenced by rainfall during recharge events the first flood event leads to an increase of no3 concentrations 16 58 mg l 1 on 06 02 2015 and 19 3 mg l 1 on 18 01 2016 associated with an increase in d o c concentrations the increase in concentrations results in the mobilization of no3 storage in soil and the unsaturated zone of the aquifer during low water periods then associated with the next flood events no3 concentrations were under the value of 12 mg l 1 10 31 mg l 1 on 16 04 2014 and 10 51 mg l 1 on 23 04 2016 indicating that the main stock of no3 storage in the soil and the unsaturated zone of the aquifer was moved to the outlet of the karst system during the previous flood event the decrease in no3 concentrations is still associated with an increase in d o c concentration 3 22 mg l 1 on 16 04 2014 and 2 26 mg l 1 on 23 04 2016 indicating that dilution water has the same of origin 5 3 magnesium dissolved oxygen relationships high magnesium concentrations observed during low water periods are uncommon for a water resource associated with the turonian aquifer in dordogne recently regional studies peyraube et al 2012 houillon 2016 show low magnesium concentrations in upper cretaceous aquifers less than 5 mg l 1 as a result of the absence of dolomite the question of the origin of magnesium concentrations is one of the main objectives associated with the hydrogeological functioning of the toulon karst system high values of magnesium concentration are only observed in confined jurassic aquifers more than 20 mg l 1 as a result of the presence of magnesium calcite local complex hydrogeological situations associated with possible relationships between upper jurassic and upper cretaceous aquifers make it difficult to understand the origin of magnesium in toulon springs dissolved oxygen is a relevant parameter for the toulon karst system usually in karst aquifers good connection with the atmosphere implies oxic waters at the outlet of the karst system perrin et al 2007 mahler et al 2011 musgrove et al 2011 deep water mobilization could be responsible for low o2 concentrations observed at toulon springs during low water periods this phenomenon has already been demonstrated at barton springs estafanía et al 2011 mahler and bourgeais 2013 the comparison of o2 concentration and magnesium concentration fig 8 from springs presented in this current work shows that o2 alone is not a relevant parameter to the mobilization of waters from the jurassic confined aquifer clavelie spring representative of an upper cretaceous saturated zone has similar o2 concentrations as toulon springs table 2 however magnesium concentrations are lower 5 88 on 08 12 2015 during high water periods clavelie and toulon waters are very close on this diagram confirming the similar origin of their waters as noticed in the pca fig 6 during low water periods the o2 vs mg diagram fig 8 identifies two straight lines i the first one increasing from high water of toulon springs to copo spring waters indicating the mixture with a jurassic confined aquifer and ii the second one increasing toward the low waters of clavelie spring illustrating the residence time of the water in the aquifer and the magnesium calcite dissolution 5 4 toulon springs conceptual functioning the complex hydrogeological situation of the toulon karst system includes two multilayered karst aquifers i a fractured and karstified multilayered cretaceous aquifer turonian coniacian and santonian ii a jurassic dolomitic limestone multilayered karst aquifer kimmeridgian oxfordian bathonian and bajocian the approach used in this work aims to evaluate the relationships between these aquifers the first step is to identify the inertial behavior of toulon springs during low water periods associated with a high dynamic volume recession analysis acf these characteristics are not usual for a french karst system illustrating the importance of this karst system from a drinking water point of view a part of this work was to evaluate the quick flow component during a recharge event ccf hydrodynamic tools were used to conduct the evaluation of dual behavior between high water periods and low water periods the second step was to exhibit the natural hydrochemical characteristics of water two main water types were identified i a first one during low water periods associated with a deep origin with good water quality fig 9 b and ii a second one during high water periods associated with quick infiltration from surficial waters during recharge events fig 9a the comparison of different water types observed in the study area pca leads to the identification of the main components that fed toulon springs fig 9 i confined jurassic karst aquifer and ii unconfined cretaceous karst aquifer the contribution rates between these two end members are different according to the hydrological conditions during low water periods jurassic aquifer contribution is more important than during high water periods in contrast during high water periods the upper cretaceous aquifer mainly participates to the flow of toulon springs the complex geological situation of the edge of the sedimentary basin involves difficulties in the recharge evaluation of deep aquifers over the study area jurassic confined karst aquifer and cretaceous karst aquifer are supposedly separated by cenomanian marls fig 1 upstream of toulon springs the recharge of the jurassic aquifer can operate in confined or unconfined parts in unconfined parts recharge is possible if i cenomanian becomes sandy and ii the jurassic hydraulic head is below the cretaceous one due to the lack of data about lithological facies variations or piezometric level the hypothesis of recharge cannot be proven yet 6 conclusion the first objective was to assess the water quantity available into the toulon karst system using natural hydrodynamic responses the second one was to assess the water quality using natural hydrochemical responses the third one was to combine these tools to evaluate the functioning of a typical example of a complex karst system drained by two multilayered karst aquifers located on the northern edge of a sedimentary basin proposing a conceptual model of functioning observations coupled to knowledge of the complex hydrogeological situation suggest that toulon springs flow is fed by a mixing of two aquifers i the jurassic confined karst aquifer oxfordian kimmeridgian bathonian and bajocian which is responsible for low water period support and related to dolomitic hydrochemical characteristics and ii the upper cretaceous unconfined aquifer turonian coniacian and santonian which is responsible for quick hydrodynamic and hydrochemical variations observed at toulon springs we suggest discussions about the common use of magnesium concentrations and dissolved oxygen concentrations to differentiate i the mixture between two aquifers as a result of the presence of magnesium calcite and ii an increase in the residence time of the water as a result of the absence of dolomite the o2 vs mg diagram is an innovative tool to use in complex hydrogeological situations with complex relationships between aquifers dolomitic and limestone aquifers this methodology based on both hydrodynamic and hydrochemical natural responses is an efficient tool to characterize the functioning of a complex multilayered karst system located on the edge of a sedimentary basin the main advantage is the easy way of implementing the method leading to an easy method of comparison between karst systems acknowledgements this work was supported by the

6933,in order to obtain an improved soil moisture sm dataset at large scale an advanced sm merging methodology based on error correction methods was constructed to merge the model based and in situ observed sm data the sm datasets in a 0 40 cm soil layer were derived from 10 km 10 km variable infiltration capacity vic model and 797 in situ stations respectively the merging methodology was conducted grid by grid and mainly included two parts bias correction and random error correction firstly the bias correction was performed for the vic simulations by applying the cumulative distribution function cdf matching approach combined with the kriging technique secondly the random error of the vic simulations was corrected using an optimal interpolation oi technique based on a spatio temporal correlation function which was proposed and constructed in this study through validations against in situ observations the merged sm was evaluated and the merging errors in each step were analyzed and discussed the results showed that the merged sm product was improved compared to the original sm data both temporally and spatially the sm merging methodology is effective and reliable in combining the accurate but sparse in situ observations and the continuous vic simulations in addition the spatial mismatch impact on the representativeness of in situ stations was limited and the merging errors were mainly produced in the cdf estimation process the random error information in the spatial dimension exhibited a bigger impact on the random error correction comparing to that in the temporal dimension this study provided strong encouragement for the efficient use of in situ sm observations and provided valuable methods for combining multi sources sm datasets keywords vic model sm merging error correction cdf matching kriging technique oi technique 1 introduction soil moisture sm is recognized as a key variable in hydro meteorological applications since it controls the hydrological cycle and land atmosphere interactions such as evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 sm can be measured accurately through in situ stations however the measured data is inadequate in both spatial coverage and temporal frequency compared with the in situ observations the continuous sm data sources over large areas provided by satellite remote sensing are widely used in related researches e g lievens et al 2015 dorigo et al 2015 colliander et al 2017 in particular the microwave remote sensing sm products have great potential in sm monitoring compared to the optical remote sensing sm product which is significantly affected by weather and vegetation cover parrens et al 2012 examples of relevant microwave based sm products are the advanced scatterometer ascat wagner et al 2007 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e mccabe et al 2005 the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr 2007 and the soil moisture active passive smap cai et al 2017 product unfortunately the satellite sensors can only provide sm data for the surface soil layer 0 2 5 cm escorihuela et al 2010 while the sm values of deeper soil layers are considered to exert influence in hydro meteorological applications such as rainfall runoff prediction drought monitoring and water resource management seneviratne et al 2010 choi et al 2013 moreover the accuracy of satellite based sm product is closely related to surface roughness soil type and vegetation coverage which may increase the observational uncertainties gruhier et al 2010 another different strategy to obtain the sm data is by the application of hydrological models based on an understanding of physical processes and long term meteorological observations the sm simulations can efficiently reflect the spatio temporal variations of sm which are observed by the in situ stations and satellites du et al 2016 however the sm simulations suffer from significant errors that are greatly influenced by the particular model structure uncertainties of model parameters and the meteorological forcings dumedah and coulibaly 2013 massari et al 2015 in general sm data derived from above methods are not perfect and each method possesses characteristic uncertainties one common solution to obtain an improved sm dataset is to assimilate observations into hydrological models over the last couple of decades data assimilation methods such as extended or ensemble kalman filters draper et al 2012 de rosnay et al 2013 were widely used for sm data assimilation liu et al 2012b lahoz and de lannoy 2014 many of these applications assimilate in situ observed e g han et al 2012 gruber et al 2018 or satellite based e g sahoo et al 2013 lievens et al 2015 sm data into hydrological models to obtain a continuous and more accurate sm dataset nevertheless prior knowledge of modeling and observational uncertainties are required in data assimilation yilmaz et al 2012 yang et al 2016 and ad hoc error statistics are frequently used for describing the errors in assimilated observations model parameters model structure and model forcings as a result the relative weights between the model and the observations are theoretically subjective which may compromise the representativeness of each data source and even further reduce the simulation accuracy crow and van loon 2006 maggioni et al 2013 in addition the assimilated sm data is still a modeled product and it is unclear whether the assimilations retain the spatio temporal characteristics detected by the observations liu et al 2011 an improved sm product can be also expected if different sm data sources are merged for example liu et al 2011 2012c firstly integrated passive amsr e and active ascat microwave satellite sm estimates for a combined sm product based on a modeled sm product after that the sm product was extended and improved within the climate change initiative cci program of european space agency esa by combining more satellite based sm products dorigo et al 2015 enenkel et al 2016 the latest cci product esa cci sm v04 2 http www esa soilmoisture cci org dataregistration covers a period from january 1978 to december 2016 which has a great potential for climate trend assessments however the cci product is still subject to the observational depth and surface conditions and discontinuities existed in its time series owing to the different observation systems a more objective merging method was constructed by yilmaz et al 2012 who merged the model remote sensing based sm products using a triple collocation tc method in a least squares framework nevertheless the uncertainties estimated from the tc method for each data source are constant in time and the corrective information is not temporally propagated forward crow and berg 2010 dorigo et al 2010 moreover the merged or assimilated sm data obtained through the methods above are still biased owing to the fact that the basic dataset such as model or satellite based sm are systematically different from the actual sm observations generally the errors of sm data can be divided into bias and random errors lahoz and de lannoy 2014 while biased sm data may not be a significant issue for some applications such as some drought monitoring e g wu et al 2011 choi et al 2013 and the climate change research e g dorigo and de jeu 2016 an accurate documentation of absolute magnitudes is critical for most applications especially in agricultural production estimation and sm based model calibration lahoz and de lannoy 2014 in order to obtain an improved sm product both in absolute magnitude and dynamic change in this study the relatively accurate but sparse in situ sm data is selected as the observational source instead of biased satellite based sm data and the model based sm data over a large area is selected as the continuous sm data source we focused on developing an error correction method for merging in situ observed and model based sm data similar methods were typically used in the merging of meteorological variables in which the optimal interpolation oi technique derber and rosati 1989 is supposed to be the most popular and effective method wang and xie 2007 xie and xiong 2011 pan et al 2012 the oi technique is well established in meteorological data assimilation to work out the optimal values only within a certain range which is theoretically suitable for the sm merging however comparatively little investigation has been done on sm merging based on the oi technique since the error characteristics of sm are quite different from that of meteorological data even for the oi based sm analysis system of european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which is based on the assimilation of temperature and relative humidity instead of sm observations scipal et al 2008 the application of sm merging via the oi technique mainly faces two difficulties the bias correction and the random error statistics xie and xiong 2011 bias correction is a significant pre requisite for the oi technique which requires the presence of unbiased data sources in meteorological applications e g xie and xiong 2011 pan et al 2012 the bias of satellite based or other data sources were often corrected by matching their probability density function pdf with that of the observations using the pdf matching approach xie and xiong 2011 however the pdf of meteorological observations are collected from surrounding stations within a large range which is unsuitable for sm observations since their in situ station coverage is limited and sm values are highly variable moreover sm bias correction over large scale in previous studies e g schneider et al 2014 kolassa et al 2017 based on spatially continuous products such as model and satellite based products it is difficult to correct the bias of simulations using the in situ observations derived from limited amount of stations with limited observational times for the random error statistics sm is not only spatially correlated with meteorological variables soil properties and vegetation but also temporally affected by the antecedent sm information maggioni et al 2013 penna et al 2013 this is quite different from the meteorological variables it is a challenge for considering the two dimensional sm errors in the oi technique the observational sm time series is almost normally distributed and can be parameterized using two moments the mean value and the standard deviation brocca et al 2010a the two moments are quite stable over a large scale and can be estimated over space using the kriging technique webster and oliver 2001 on this basis the model based sm data can be corrected in each grid using the cumulative distribution function cdf matching approach reichle and koster 2004 schneider et al 2014 which is similar to the pdf matching but more commonly used in land surface applications moreover the random error of model based sm values are auto correlated both spatially and temporally thus a spatio temporal correlation function was proposed for the oi technique accordingly in this study we adapted to these challenges by constructing a two step sm merging methodology based on the cdf matching approach and the oi technique the two sm merging sources were derived from 797 in situ stations and a daily variable infiltration capacity vic model with a resolution of 10 km 10 km respectively during the study period from january 2008 to december 2016 finally an accurate sm product over a large scale was produced and evaluated through various validation experiments we have mainly achieved two innovations in the sm merging methodology 1 the vic simulations are corrected over large scale using the in situ observations derived from a limited amount of stations with limited observational times 2 both the spatial and the temporal error characteristics are quantified in the oi technique 2 data and methodology a two step sm merging methodology was constructed in this study to conduct the merging methodology the huang huai hai river basin 3hrb fig 1 was selected as the study area since it is a key area of agricultural production with the densest population in china lu et al 2012 2 1 data and processing 2 1 1 the in situ observed sm dataset the observational sm dataset from january 2008 to december 2016 was collected from 797 in situ stations fig 1 which was provided by the chinese ministry of water resources information center cmwric the in situ stations were reasonably located in and around the 3hrb with reliable observations under strict standards the gravimetric observations in unfrozen soil layer at depth of 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm were artificially measured using the oven drying method with a general observational frequency of three times per month 1st 11th 21st at 00 00 utc the gravimetric sm of 0 40 cm layer at each station used for sm merging is obtained by weighting the observations according to the depths this sm dataset was continually updated with 171 observational values on average for each station and there were 678 stations 515 stations within the 3hrb containing more than 50 observational values among the 797 stations it is noted that only the sm series derived from the 678 stations were used for the time series analysis in order to better capture the temporal distribution of the observations in addition to better understand the merging effects three typical stations including jiehepu miaowan and loude fig 1 which are located in the hai huai and huang river basin respectively were selected to validate the sm time series before and after merging 2 1 2 the model based sm dataset the model based sm dataset was provided by the daily variable infiltration capacity vic land surface macroscale hydrological model liang et al 1994 1996 with a spatial resolution of 10 km 10 km the vic model was built with a simulation period from january 2008 to december 2016 over all 31 provinces in mainland china 93977 grids in total but only the sm data in the 3hrb 6611 grids in total was extracted for sm merging the vic model has been driven by the observed forcing data which was interpolated on 10 km 10 km grids using the inverse distance weighted idw method the forcing data contains maximum and minimum air temperatures and precipitation which were collected from 756 basic meteorological stations from the national meteorological information center nmic of the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn and more than 10 000 rainfall stations since january 2012 from the cmwric the model parameters were determined for each region the geographical vegetation and soil parameters are constant once the model is built the hydrological parameters are calibrated using measured streamflow data parameters determination and other details can be found in our previous studies wu et al 2007 2011 mao et al 2017 in the vic model three soil layers are used for volumetric sm simulation with a surface layer fixed at 10 cm depth the depths of the second and third layer are adjustable and determined by the model calibration in order to remain consistent with the in situ observations the vic sm simulations were converted to the 0 40 cm layer by depth weights meanwhile the volumetric simulations were converted to gravimetric sm values using soil bulk density data from the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations http www fao org soils portal moreover the vic sm simulations will be validated and discussed along with the merged sm values in the results 2 1 3 grid station matching the grid station matching approach was adopted to match the in situ observations point scale and vic simulations grid scale sm values are affected by heterogeneous factors such as soil properties vegetation and topography penna et al 2009 which should be considered in the grid station matching approach however it is difficult to weigh all of these factors and to collect factor data with a resolution higher than 10 km 10 km in this study a simple matching approach was employed in the grid station matching by considering the land cover types derived from the 1 km 1 km moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis land cover characterization data ran et al 2010 the proportions of the land cover type in each vic grid are adopted as the matching weight for each station involved in the vic grid the observed sm values are gridded as follows 1 s m s i 1 m s i c i i 1 m c i where s m s is the gridded observed sm value s i is the sm value derived from the ith m in total station within the target vic grid and c i is the land cover type percentage of the modis grid that s i located in the grid station matching method was applied in all the vic grids from january 2008 to december 2016 then a newly gridded observed sm data was used for the oi technique for the evaluation of the merged sm product 2 2 sm merging methodology 2 2 1 overall methodology the sm merging methodology is comprised of two steps the cdf matching step and the oi step fig 2 which are used for bias correction and random error correction respectively even though errors existed in the in situ observations mainly caused by the spatial mismatch these errors are not considered in the in situ observations the reasons are that the errors caused by the spatial mismatch representative errors are difficult to account for in each grid and the evaluation of the merged sm and merging methodology will be affected by the representative errors the spatial mismatch impact on the representativeness of in situ stations will be analyzed and discussed separately in section 4 3 in the cdf matching step the normal distribution nd fitting approach was applied to obtain the cdf of the observational sm time series cdf obs through two moments the mean value m and the standard deviation σ section 2 3 1 meanwhile the spatial variation of the two moments were analyzed and two variograms were built for the two moments section 2 3 2 then the two moments were estimated over a space using the kriging technique and the spatial distribution of the cdf obs was obtained based on the two krigged moments section 2 3 3 on these bases the vic sm was adjusted against the observed sm using the cdf matching approach section 2 2 2 by matching the vic value at each cumulative probability to that of cdf obs in the oi step the cdf corrected simulations along with the gridded observed sm were collected for random error statistics and a spatio temporal error correlation function was constructed for quantifying the random error statistics section 2 3 4 finally the merged sm was obtained using the oi technique section 2 2 3 based on the error function 2 2 2 the cdf matching approach a significant pre requisite for the oi technique is the simulations are temporally unbiased for this purpose the cdf matching approach was carried out to correct the bias of the vic simulations by rescaling the simulated value at each cumulative probability towards the corresponding observational value the cdf matching approach does not change the relative dynamics of the original sm data but imposes a value range and has been widely used for bias correction e g schneider et al 2014 kolassa et al 2017 and data consistency adjustment e g liu et al 2011 yuan et al 2015a enenkel et al 2016 the cdf matching approach is carried out for each vic grid individually first the cumulative probability cd f i t vic of the vic simulation value s m i t vic in grid i at time step t is obtained according to 2 cd f i t vic n i vic s m i vic sm i t vic n i vic s m i vic 1 where n i vic is the number of elements in the vic sm series s m i vic second s m i t vic is corrected using the cdf obs in grid i as follows 3 cd f i t vic s m i t cdf c d f i obs sm where s m i t cdf is the cdf corrected sm value and cd f i obs sm is derived from the cdf obs in grid i the cdf matching procedure in this study is simpler than the piecewise cdf matching applied in previous studies e g reichle and koster 2004 liu et al 2011 enenkel et al 2016 given that the cdf obs is parameterized the observed sm value at any cumulative probability can be directly calculated for the cdf matching the acquisition of the cdf obs is detailed in section 2 3 1 2 2 3 the oi technique the oi technique is a major part of the sm merging methodology which was used for merging the cdf corrected and in situ observed sm data xie and xiong 2011 the spatio temporal random errors are considered in the oi technique the merged sm is obtained through modifying the cdf corrected sm value based on the oi technique the observations at and near the target within distance a 0 and time decorrelation length t 0 are considered in the oi step 4 s m i t meg s m i t cdf j 1 n d 0 m w ij t t d s m j t d obs s m j t d cdf where s m i t meg is the merged sm in the target grid i at time step t w ij t t d is the weighting coefficient in grid j at time step t d n is the numbers of surrounding in situ observations and m pleasecheck is the maximum lag day d for these observations respectively assuming that the observations are error free and the cdf corrected sm is unbiased the weight w ij t t d in eq 4 can be defined by minimizing the random error variance and obtained by solving the following equation group which is modified from xie and xiong 2011 5 j 1 n d 0 m μ jk t d t g w ij t t d μ ij t t d k 0 1 2 n g 0 1 2 m where μ jk t d t g is the random error correlation between grid j at time step t d and grid k at time step t g for lag day d and g respectively μ jk t d t g and μ ij t t d can be estimated from the spatial temporal error correlation function which was constructed in section 2 3 4 2 3 merging parameters determination 2 3 1 the acquisition of the cdf obs the cdf of sm series is often constructed using the piecewise linear regression equations based on a set of cumulative probabilities and corresponding sm values e g liu et al 2011 enenkel et al 2016 however piecewise cdf matching is not suitable for the observed sm series with limited members therefore the cdf fitting approach was implemented for the acquisition of the cdf obs frequently a normal distribution is assumed for the observed sm series wu et al 2011 the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis are frequently used to test the normality of hydrological series including temperature precipitation and runoff hu et al 2011 nevertheless this method is too complicated and strict for the observed sm series in this study hence a simple nd test method was employed to evaluate the normality of the observed sm series the series with a nd fitting error less than a certain threshold can be considered as following a quasi normal distribution the nd fitting error is defined as the mean absolute relative error mare mean absolute error normalized by the mean of the observations fang et al 2011 between the observed sm series and the corresponding nd fitted sm series using the least square method the fitting error threshold was set as 0 15 of mare and the observational series derived from the 678 in situ stations which contained more than 50 observational values were tested by the nd test method as shown in fig 3 the observed series derived from 90 3 612 stations are quasi normally distributed therefore the cdf obs was collected from the 612 stations and can be defined as 6 cd f j obs sm sm 1 2 π σ j exp sm m j 2 2 σ 2 d sm where cd f j obs is the cdf obs for the jth station m j and σ j are the mean value and the standard deviation respectively 2 3 2 spatial variation of the cdf obs the cdf obs is a cumulative normal distribution function which can be parameterized using two moments the first order moment mean value and the second order moment variance replaced by the standard deviation in this study in order to conduct the cdf matching for all vic sm series in the 3hrb the two moments were estimated over the 3hrb to obtain the spatial pattern of the cdf obs before this the spatial variation characteristics of the two moments were analyzed using a variogram the variogram represented as semi variance is a central concept in geostatistics which is defined as webster and oliver 2001 lakhankar et al 2010 7 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z j z j h 2 where γ h is the semi variance for an interval distance class h n h is the total number of sample couples for separation interval h z j and z j h are the moments of the cdf obs at spatial location j and j h respectively the main parameters of a variogram consist of nugget c 0 sill c c 0 and de correlation length pleasecheck the experimental variogram model can be obtained through the least square fitting according to the semi variance data lakhankar et al 2010 the time averaged variograms were generated for the two moments of the cdf obs that derived from the 612 in situ stations during the study period fig 4 the semi variance of the two moments increased gradually with the distance which are best fitted with the variogram models the linear model for the mean value fig 4a and the exponential model for the standard deviation fig 4b respectively the relationship between the variograms and the distances also demonstrate that the two moments are quite regular and stable over space which forms the basis of the spatial estimation of the two moments 2 3 3 spatial estimation of the cdf obs afterwards the ordinary kriging technique webster and oliver 2001 was implemented to estimate the spatial patterns of the two moments of the cdf obs the krigged moment z i at ith vic grid is formed from a linear combination of surrounding moments which is calculated as 8 z i k 1 n λ k z k where n is the number of surrounding moments within radius r 0 consistent with r 0 of fig 4a and set as 100 km λ k is the weight assigned to each moment z k at a spatial location k which were obtained under the conditions that the estimation errors were unbiased and with a minimum variance accordingly the kriging equations in terms of the variogram model constructed in fig 4 are expressed as 9 k 1 n γ h kj λ k μ γ h ij j 0 1 2 n k 1 n λ k 1 where γ h kj is the semi variance which reflects the spatial variability with an interval h kj between location k and j and μ is the lagrange constant in addition some scholars e g pandey and pandey 2010 yang et al 2010 mentioned that the spatial variability of sm values was considerably reduced after applying the kriging technique thus the yamamoto method detailed in yamamoto 2005 and yang et al 2010 was carried out in this study to solve the smoothing effect of the kriging technique then the two moments were estimated over space using the kriging technique and the yamamoto method and the spatial distribution of the cdf obs can be obtained based on the two krigged moments through eq 6 in this case eq 3 can be replaced with 10 s m i t cdf a r c c d f i obs p i t where arccd f i obs is the inverse function of cd f i obs at the ith vic grid 2 3 4 random error statistics random error statistics is the key of the application of the oi technique the random errors of vic simulations were obtained through subtracting the gridded observed sm from the cdf corrected sm the correlation coefficients were used to quantify the structure of random errors in the 3hrb during the study period the temporal correlation coefficients at different distance intervals fig 5 a and the spatial correlation coefficients at different lags fig 5b were separately calculated for the random errors as shown in fig 5 the random error correlation decreases with the increase of distance intervals and lags which were fitted with two negative exponential functions based on the two exponential functions in fig 5 assuming that the exponential shape is also suitable for the spatio temporal error and a spatio temporal correlation function ρ h d was proposed and constructed by multiplication of two individual spatial and temporal error functions as follows 11 ρ h d 1 h 0 d 0 ρ h d c 1 c 2 e x p h a 0 d t 0 h 0 d 0 ρ h d c 1 e x p h a 0 h 0 d 0 ρ h d c 2 e x p d t 0 h 0 d 0 c 1 0 56 c 2 0 65 a 0 180 k m t 0 60 d a y s where c 1 and c 2 are the spatial and temporal empirical coefficients respectively which reflect the random error variation characteristics of sm a 0 and t 0 are the influence radius and effective days respectively which are the two dimensional limits of ρ h d at a distance of 180 km a 0 or time of 60 days t 0 the correlations become insignificant as 0 2 and 0 24 respectively accordingly μ jk t d t g in eq 5 can be estimated using ρ h d moreover the oi radius a 0 is set as 100 km which is consistent with the kriging radius r 0 and the lag range t 0 is set as 60 days for eq 4 the spatio temporal statistical characteristics are mainly influenced by the auto correlated sm data the spatial autocorrelation was often exhibited in the variograms of sm which were often fitted with an exponential model e g lakhankar et al 2010 pandey and pandey 2010 this is similar to the spatial correlation part of ρ h d fig 5a the temporal autocorrelation of sm was also illustrated by ford et al 2014 which demonstrated a strong correlation in the first few days but significantly decreased after a few days moreover due to the rainfall effects the temporal correlation part of ρ h d was similar to that of rainfall which was also fitted with a negative exponential function in previous studies e g xie and xiong 2011 pan et al 2012 as a whole the statistical characteristics of the random error of the cdf corrected sm can be reasonably well reflected in ρ h d 3 results 3 1 sm time series evaluation the time series of sm estimates along with the in situ observations during the study period at the three typical stations fig 1 are shown in fig 6 since two error correction parts are used in the merging methodology the bias cm3 cm3 and the mean relative error mre mean error normalized by the mean of the observations are used for bias evaluation the correlation coefficient r and the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse the rmse between the bias corrected sm estimates and observations cm3 cm3 sun et al 2017 are used for random error evaluation and the mare is used for overall evaluation these metrics are listed in table 1 the temporal patterns of vic simulations are similar to those of the observational series however significant bias and different temporal variation ranges are observed for the simulations compared to the observed series after cdf matching the bias of simulations is reduced considerably and the temporal variation range shows a larger correspondence with the in situ observations compared to the uncorrected vic simulations the merged sm is obtained using the oi technique based on the cdf corrected simulations as expected the merged sm matches the observations well both in absolute magnitude and dynamic change with a higher r lower ubrmse and mare and near zero bias and mre compared to both the uncorrected vic and cdf corrected simulations in addition the basin averaged metrics of the sm series in the 3hrb are presented in table 2 the vic simulations show satisfactory performance with an average r of 0 57 and an average ubrmse of 3 25 cm3 cm3 in the 3hrb indicating that the dynamic change of the observations is well captured by the simulations especially in the huai river basin the basin averaged bias and mre of the vic simulations show a small dry bias in the huang river basin and a small wet bias in the hai and huai river basin compared to the observations however significant errors are found in the simulations of the single grid cell with an average mare of 0 26 in the 3hrb considerable improvement is found in the metrics statistics after applying the merging methodology which is similar to the evaluation at the typical stations in conclusion the merged sm series shows a larger correspondence with the in situ observed series compared to the vic simulations these evaluations also underscore the importance and impact of the cdf matching which reduces the systematic differences between the simulated and observed series 3 2 sm spatial patterns evaluation fig 7 presents an example of the daily sm merging analysis in the 3hrb for september 11 2016 great variation is exhibited in the spatial patterns of the in situ observations fig 7a which vary from 5 to 40 g g the variation range and the spatial trends of the observations are captured by the vic simulations fig 7b however obvious bias is found in the regional simulations such as the wet bias in the hai river basin and the dry bias in the southwestern huai river basin the cdf matching step effectively reduces these bias fig 7c and the simulations are more consistent with the in situ observations in most areas of the 3hrb after the bias correction as expected the oi step further enhances the correspondence of the cdf corrected simulations with the observations fig 7d in particular for the simulations in the smaller areas fig 8 a shows the corresponding scatter plots of the daily sm estimates against the in situ observations the simulations show a significant wet bias over the 3hrb this bias is very systematic when the sm values are low the cdf matching step improves the consistency between the simulations and the observations especially for the drier sm values similarly great agreement between the simulations and the observations is achieved after applying the oi step with an increased r 2 of 0 97 furthermore the probabilities of the relative error are calculated for the daily sm estimates which are presented in fig 8b while the relative error distribution of the vic simulations mainly ranges from 0 6 to 0 6 with a general wet bias the merged sm have a more concentrated relative error distribution range from 0 2 to 0 2 based on the generally unbiased cdf corrected sm values overall the daily sm merging evaluation illustrated that the merging methodology effectively improved the vic simulations both in absolute magnitude and spatial patterns 3 3 distributions of averaged sm the spatial distribution of the time averaged sm and temporal distribution of annual basin averaged sm in the 3hrb during the study period are analyzed in this section as shown in fig 9 a the spatial variation of the time averaged observations is much smoother than that exhibited in fig 7a which gradually increases from north to south over the 3hrb the vic simulations present a good correspondence with the observations at a regional scale except few regions such as the dry bias in the western huai river basin and the wet bias in the northern hai river basin fig 9b the cdf matching step solves these biases well and the cdf corrected sm remains at a good consistency with the observations in most areas of the 3hrb fig 9c minor enhancements are found in the merged sm in some small areas fig 9d compared to the cdf corrected sm values which is consistent with the merging purpose that the cdf matching corrects the bias and the oi technique enhances the simulation of the dynamics the time averaged vic simulations reach a properly high r 2 of 0 46 against the in situ observations with a relative error distribution mainly ranging between 0 4 and 0 4 not shown similar to fig 8 both the cdf corrected and merged sm demonstrate an obvious enhancement in the correspondence with the observations and a minor improvement is observed for the merged sm compared to the cdf corrected sm the inter annual variability of the basin averaged sm estimates and in situ observations are presented in fig 10 the inter annual variability of the vic simulations are similar to that of the observations in the hai and huai river basin fig 10a c however inconsistencies appeared between the simulations observations and even the precipitation in the huang river basin fig 10b these inconsistencies could be affected by the strong uneven spatio temporal distribution of precipitation in the huang river basin yuan et al 2015b the surface variation and the limited representativeness of the in situ stations since the similar dynamic responses of simulations of the annual precipitation and better spatial coverage are shown in the hai and huai river basin moreover other factors caused by human interference such as the water infrastructure development disturb or alter the natural sm process because human activities were not taken into account in the vic model lu et al 2012 in addition to some extent the sm observations are probably affected by the proximity of some gauges to rivers or lakes which is not considered for the sm simulations in the current vic model in the sm merging assessment the merged sm shows a better consistency with observations compared to the uncorrected simulations with a temporal variation pattern and range between observations and simulations similar to the spatially averaged patterns the cdf matching step has contributed most of the correction effects to the bias reduction of simulations compared to the oi step 3 4 evaluation for non observed grids the merging effects of the observed grids with in situ station inside have been evaluated in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the cross validation method is applied to make an objective assessment for the non observed grids without in situ station inside considering that the in situ observations are insufficient both spatially and temporally the leave one out cross validation method shao 1993 is used in this study in the cross validation the in situ observations within the considered grid are removed prior to the sm merging including the cdf matching step and the oi step hence only the surrounding observations within 100 km are involved in the merging calculation for each grid therefore the in situ observations can be used for the objective evaluation of the merging methodology the cross validated cdf corrected and merged sm in the 3hrb are obtained and analyzed using the in situ observations the time series pattern metrics for the sm estimates against the in situ observations in the 3hrb during the study period are shown in fig 11 the spatial correlation coefficients of the merged sm are generally improved fig 11a with a mean coefficient from 0 34 to 0 56 compared with the vic simulations the wet bias of the simulation is significantly reduced from 0 11 to 0 01 on average after applying the merging methodology fig 11b the results demonstrate that the merging methodology effectively improved the sm estimates both in the absolute magnitude and spatial patterns the mre of vic simulations is reduced from 0 11 to 0 03 on average by applying the cdf matching step fig 11b which implies that the cdf matching approach is capable of removing the bias of the sm series over the 3hrb in addition the mean spatial correlation coefficients of the cdf corrected sm generally exceed that of the simulations which illustrates that the cdf matching approach can also improve the spatial patterns of the vic simulations fig 11a this improvement is attributable to the bias correction effects of the cdf matching for each grid which is consistent with the results in fig 7 4 discussion the discussion focusses on the error components of the cdf matching step section 4 1 the merging contribution of the random error in the oi step section 4 2 and the station representativeness effected by the spatial mismatch between the point and grid estimates section 4 3 4 1 errors in the cdf matching step two error components are included in the cdf matching step the first component is the cdf fitting error section 2 3 1 it is caused by the nd fitting in the calculation of the cdf obs since the nd function is the generalized form of the observational sm series with unavoidable representative errors during the nd fitting the cdf fitting error is quantified by the mare in fig 3 with a range of 0 0 15 for the selected observational series it is noted that even though the cdf matching is influenced by the fitting errors we could not simply treat these errors as merging uncertainties given that reference data with a long observational series is required for applying the cdf matching lee and im 2015 an ineffective result might have occurred after conducting the cdf matching with an insufficient data series massari et al 2015 the second error component is produced in the spatial estimation of the cdf obs section 2 3 3 the cdf obs for each merging grid is obtained based on the two moments which were estimated using the kriging technique therefore the kriging estimate errors further affect the cdf matching the error probability distribution of the cross validated krigged moments derived from section 3 4 are shown in fig 12 with a range of 0 4 to 0 4 for the mean value fig 12a and 0 6 to 0 6 for the standard deviation fig 12b respectively the kriging estimate errors are mainly ranging between 0 2 and 0 2 which demonstrates that it is practical for the spatial estimation of the two moments it should be noted that the error distributions of the two moments are slightly negatively biased fig 12 this is mainly caused by the negatively skewed spatial patterns of sm data liu et al 2012a and the effects of cross validation moreover even though the yamamoto method can effectively solve the smoothing effect of the kriging technique yamamoto 2005 yang et al 2010 it slightly affects the kriging estimate in the error distribution fig 12 this is reasonable since the yamamoto method is focused on spatial variability correction instead of local accuracy improvement yamamoto 2005 in addition the final effects of the fitting error and kriging estimation error on the cdf matching are analyzed based on the cross validated moments the relative errors of the cdf corrected sm are mainly ranging between 0 2 and 0 2 which indicates that the cdf matching has reliable accuracy in most areas of the 3hrb it should be pointed out that the cross validation method sacrifices the availability of data for an objective test the actual cdf corrected results will remain at a higher accuracy with an increase in data sources 4 2 the contribution of the oi step two dimensional random errors are considered in the oi technique however some differences exist between the merging contributions of the spatial and temporal random errors we have evaluated the results with the consideration of both errors in section 3 2 to better understand the oi impacts the spatial and temporal oi contributions are discussed separately in the 3hrb for september 11 2016 the leave one out cross validation method is used to evaluate the two dimensional contributions based on the cdf corrected sm data for distance evaluation the cross validation step is the same as introduced in section 3 4 the sm observational series in the target grid are removed before the oi step for lags evaluation the sm observations at september 11 2016 are removed and only antecedent sm observations 60 days from july 13 2016 to september 10 2016 are used for the oi step therefore the in situ observations can be used for validating the two dimensional contributions fig 13 compares the cdf corrected sm and cross validated merged sm for distance and lags respectively the two dimensional contributions are significant for improving the correspondence with the in situ observations compared to the vic simulations with r 2 increasing from 0 49 to 0 58 and 0 69 with mare decreasing from 0 16 to 0 12 and 0 10 for distance and lags respectively specifically the cross validation for distance retains the temporal random errors with minimum lags and meanwhile the cross validation for lags keeps the spatial random errors with a minimum distance the spatial removed validation result shows a generally lower effect compared to the temporal removed validation result the different increments of r 2 are related to the different spatio temporal empirical coefficients in eq 11 which demonstrate that the random error information in the spatial dimension has a greater impact on the random error correction comparing to that in the temporal dimension 4 3 spatial mismatch impacts strong variability is shown or exhibited in the sm values owing to the effects of heterogeneous surface conditions and atmospheric forcings penna et al 2009 which causes a spatial mismatch between the grid based estimates and the point based observations as the spatial variability of the sm series moments increase with the distance radius exhibited in fig 4 the spatial mismatch impacts might be linked to the spatial scales this can be analyzed with a relatively accurate estimates of the space averaged sm over different scales in fact sm spatial patterns frequently exhibited a strong temporal stability such that the sm monitored in a few stations could provide reliable space averaged sm information brocca et al 2010b we have proved this point by analyzing the representativeness of the sm stations for the daily and time averaged observations and the time series respectively firstly the relationship between the regional the 3hrb representativeness and different number of stations are analyzed fig 14 a the stations are randomly selected with different number of stations ranging from 1 to 797 100 000 times for each number of stations we found that only 5 stations can well represent the space averaged sm calculated using all stations in and around the 3hrb with mare lower than 0 05 and r higher than 0 6 on average it is remarkable that the spatial representativeness of the sm observations is quite stable within a very limited range for each day during the entire study period which is generally similar to that of the time averaged observations this demonstrates that spatial representativeness is less affected by the sm spatial variability with an increase of the number of stations even though the time averaged sm is much smoother than the daily observations over space on this basis secondly the relationship between the local representativeness for one station and different radii are analyzed fig 14b the minimum radius is set as 30 km and there are more than ten stations within each radius the mare increases with the radius which can be fitted with the power functions the result demonstrates that a station can better represent the surrounding area at a smaller spatial scale the spatial mismatch impacts on the station representativeness are limited with mare probably as 0 1 and 0 05 on average for daily and time averaged observations respectively moreover the mare of the time averaged sm is generally smaller than that of the daily observations which illustrate that the representativeness of each station is typically reduced with the increase of the spatial variability in addition the sm series from a single station remain at a relative high r even when the radius exceeds 200 km which further demonstrate that the impacts of the spatial mismatch on the sm dynamic change are very limited 5 conclusions and future works the objective of this study was to merge the accurate observations and continuous model simulations to obtain an improved sm product therefore an advanced sm merging methodology based on error correction methods was constructed for merging two sm sources with the application of the sm merging methodology the 0 40 cm sm data derived from a 10 km 10 km vic model and 797 in situ stations were merged in the 3hrb from january 2008 to december 2016 the sm merging process mainly included two steps the cdf matching step and the oi step for bias correction and spatio temporal correlation random error correction respectively in the cdf matching step the nd fitting approach combined with the kriging technique were carried out to obtain the spatial distribution of the cdf obs which was used to adjust the vic simulations against the observations in the oi step the cdf corrected simulations were further combined with the observations using the oi technique while considering two dimensional random errors based on a spatio temporal error correlation function through cross validations against in situ observations the merged sm was evaluated and the merging errors in each step were analyzed and discussed the results demonstrated that the cdf matching approach was capable of removing the bias of the model based sm series the oi technique was effective for correcting the dynamics of the model based sm series and both methods were effective at improving the spatial patterns of the model sm simulations after the two step correction the merged sm presented a significant improvement in the consistency with the in situ observations compared to the simulations both in absolute magnitude and dynamic change for time series and spatial patterns moreover the analysis demonstrated that the merging errors were mainly produced in the cdf fitting and cdf obs estimation processes within a limited range the contribution of the random error information in the spatial dimension was generally bigger than that in the temporal dimension in addition the spatial mismatch impact on the representativeness of in situ stations was limited and its estimation can help to better merge or assimilate different sm data sources in future research this study provides strong encouragement for the efficient use of the in situ observations in the sm merging and assimilation the sm merging methodology can be also used for the assimilation of satellite based product such as the smos and the smap products since most of them can be described as a normal distribution liu et al 2012a the merged sm product can be further used as a reference dataset for model calibration such as the application of the joint state parameter assimilation method yang et al 2007 which is helpful to improve the model and possible to provide a more improved sm product moreover the merged sm product can be also validated using other data sources such as the grace product tapley et al 2004 which is frequently used for the validation of model simulations besides the attempts and comparisons of other sm merging methods are needed in future research for improving the merged product for example the application of generalized linear models

6933,in order to obtain an improved soil moisture sm dataset at large scale an advanced sm merging methodology based on error correction methods was constructed to merge the model based and in situ observed sm data the sm datasets in a 0 40 cm soil layer were derived from 10 km 10 km variable infiltration capacity vic model and 797 in situ stations respectively the merging methodology was conducted grid by grid and mainly included two parts bias correction and random error correction firstly the bias correction was performed for the vic simulations by applying the cumulative distribution function cdf matching approach combined with the kriging technique secondly the random error of the vic simulations was corrected using an optimal interpolation oi technique based on a spatio temporal correlation function which was proposed and constructed in this study through validations against in situ observations the merged sm was evaluated and the merging errors in each step were analyzed and discussed the results showed that the merged sm product was improved compared to the original sm data both temporally and spatially the sm merging methodology is effective and reliable in combining the accurate but sparse in situ observations and the continuous vic simulations in addition the spatial mismatch impact on the representativeness of in situ stations was limited and the merging errors were mainly produced in the cdf estimation process the random error information in the spatial dimension exhibited a bigger impact on the random error correction comparing to that in the temporal dimension this study provided strong encouragement for the efficient use of in situ sm observations and provided valuable methods for combining multi sources sm datasets keywords vic model sm merging error correction cdf matching kriging technique oi technique 1 introduction soil moisture sm is recognized as a key variable in hydro meteorological applications since it controls the hydrological cycle and land atmosphere interactions such as evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 sm can be measured accurately through in situ stations however the measured data is inadequate in both spatial coverage and temporal frequency compared with the in situ observations the continuous sm data sources over large areas provided by satellite remote sensing are widely used in related researches e g lievens et al 2015 dorigo et al 2015 colliander et al 2017 in particular the microwave remote sensing sm products have great potential in sm monitoring compared to the optical remote sensing sm product which is significantly affected by weather and vegetation cover parrens et al 2012 examples of relevant microwave based sm products are the advanced scatterometer ascat wagner et al 2007 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e mccabe et al 2005 the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr 2007 and the soil moisture active passive smap cai et al 2017 product unfortunately the satellite sensors can only provide sm data for the surface soil layer 0 2 5 cm escorihuela et al 2010 while the sm values of deeper soil layers are considered to exert influence in hydro meteorological applications such as rainfall runoff prediction drought monitoring and water resource management seneviratne et al 2010 choi et al 2013 moreover the accuracy of satellite based sm product is closely related to surface roughness soil type and vegetation coverage which may increase the observational uncertainties gruhier et al 2010 another different strategy to obtain the sm data is by the application of hydrological models based on an understanding of physical processes and long term meteorological observations the sm simulations can efficiently reflect the spatio temporal variations of sm which are observed by the in situ stations and satellites du et al 2016 however the sm simulations suffer from significant errors that are greatly influenced by the particular model structure uncertainties of model parameters and the meteorological forcings dumedah and coulibaly 2013 massari et al 2015 in general sm data derived from above methods are not perfect and each method possesses characteristic uncertainties one common solution to obtain an improved sm dataset is to assimilate observations into hydrological models over the last couple of decades data assimilation methods such as extended or ensemble kalman filters draper et al 2012 de rosnay et al 2013 were widely used for sm data assimilation liu et al 2012b lahoz and de lannoy 2014 many of these applications assimilate in situ observed e g han et al 2012 gruber et al 2018 or satellite based e g sahoo et al 2013 lievens et al 2015 sm data into hydrological models to obtain a continuous and more accurate sm dataset nevertheless prior knowledge of modeling and observational uncertainties are required in data assimilation yilmaz et al 2012 yang et al 2016 and ad hoc error statistics are frequently used for describing the errors in assimilated observations model parameters model structure and model forcings as a result the relative weights between the model and the observations are theoretically subjective which may compromise the representativeness of each data source and even further reduce the simulation accuracy crow and van loon 2006 maggioni et al 2013 in addition the assimilated sm data is still a modeled product and it is unclear whether the assimilations retain the spatio temporal characteristics detected by the observations liu et al 2011 an improved sm product can be also expected if different sm data sources are merged for example liu et al 2011 2012c firstly integrated passive amsr e and active ascat microwave satellite sm estimates for a combined sm product based on a modeled sm product after that the sm product was extended and improved within the climate change initiative cci program of european space agency esa by combining more satellite based sm products dorigo et al 2015 enenkel et al 2016 the latest cci product esa cci sm v04 2 http www esa soilmoisture cci org dataregistration covers a period from january 1978 to december 2016 which has a great potential for climate trend assessments however the cci product is still subject to the observational depth and surface conditions and discontinuities existed in its time series owing to the different observation systems a more objective merging method was constructed by yilmaz et al 2012 who merged the model remote sensing based sm products using a triple collocation tc method in a least squares framework nevertheless the uncertainties estimated from the tc method for each data source are constant in time and the corrective information is not temporally propagated forward crow and berg 2010 dorigo et al 2010 moreover the merged or assimilated sm data obtained through the methods above are still biased owing to the fact that the basic dataset such as model or satellite based sm are systematically different from the actual sm observations generally the errors of sm data can be divided into bias and random errors lahoz and de lannoy 2014 while biased sm data may not be a significant issue for some applications such as some drought monitoring e g wu et al 2011 choi et al 2013 and the climate change research e g dorigo and de jeu 2016 an accurate documentation of absolute magnitudes is critical for most applications especially in agricultural production estimation and sm based model calibration lahoz and de lannoy 2014 in order to obtain an improved sm product both in absolute magnitude and dynamic change in this study the relatively accurate but sparse in situ sm data is selected as the observational source instead of biased satellite based sm data and the model based sm data over a large area is selected as the continuous sm data source we focused on developing an error correction method for merging in situ observed and model based sm data similar methods were typically used in the merging of meteorological variables in which the optimal interpolation oi technique derber and rosati 1989 is supposed to be the most popular and effective method wang and xie 2007 xie and xiong 2011 pan et al 2012 the oi technique is well established in meteorological data assimilation to work out the optimal values only within a certain range which is theoretically suitable for the sm merging however comparatively little investigation has been done on sm merging based on the oi technique since the error characteristics of sm are quite different from that of meteorological data even for the oi based sm analysis system of european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which is based on the assimilation of temperature and relative humidity instead of sm observations scipal et al 2008 the application of sm merging via the oi technique mainly faces two difficulties the bias correction and the random error statistics xie and xiong 2011 bias correction is a significant pre requisite for the oi technique which requires the presence of unbiased data sources in meteorological applications e g xie and xiong 2011 pan et al 2012 the bias of satellite based or other data sources were often corrected by matching their probability density function pdf with that of the observations using the pdf matching approach xie and xiong 2011 however the pdf of meteorological observations are collected from surrounding stations within a large range which is unsuitable for sm observations since their in situ station coverage is limited and sm values are highly variable moreover sm bias correction over large scale in previous studies e g schneider et al 2014 kolassa et al 2017 based on spatially continuous products such as model and satellite based products it is difficult to correct the bias of simulations using the in situ observations derived from limited amount of stations with limited observational times for the random error statistics sm is not only spatially correlated with meteorological variables soil properties and vegetation but also temporally affected by the antecedent sm information maggioni et al 2013 penna et al 2013 this is quite different from the meteorological variables it is a challenge for considering the two dimensional sm errors in the oi technique the observational sm time series is almost normally distributed and can be parameterized using two moments the mean value and the standard deviation brocca et al 2010a the two moments are quite stable over a large scale and can be estimated over space using the kriging technique webster and oliver 2001 on this basis the model based sm data can be corrected in each grid using the cumulative distribution function cdf matching approach reichle and koster 2004 schneider et al 2014 which is similar to the pdf matching but more commonly used in land surface applications moreover the random error of model based sm values are auto correlated both spatially and temporally thus a spatio temporal correlation function was proposed for the oi technique accordingly in this study we adapted to these challenges by constructing a two step sm merging methodology based on the cdf matching approach and the oi technique the two sm merging sources were derived from 797 in situ stations and a daily variable infiltration capacity vic model with a resolution of 10 km 10 km respectively during the study period from january 2008 to december 2016 finally an accurate sm product over a large scale was produced and evaluated through various validation experiments we have mainly achieved two innovations in the sm merging methodology 1 the vic simulations are corrected over large scale using the in situ observations derived from a limited amount of stations with limited observational times 2 both the spatial and the temporal error characteristics are quantified in the oi technique 2 data and methodology a two step sm merging methodology was constructed in this study to conduct the merging methodology the huang huai hai river basin 3hrb fig 1 was selected as the study area since it is a key area of agricultural production with the densest population in china lu et al 2012 2 1 data and processing 2 1 1 the in situ observed sm dataset the observational sm dataset from january 2008 to december 2016 was collected from 797 in situ stations fig 1 which was provided by the chinese ministry of water resources information center cmwric the in situ stations were reasonably located in and around the 3hrb with reliable observations under strict standards the gravimetric observations in unfrozen soil layer at depth of 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm were artificially measured using the oven drying method with a general observational frequency of three times per month 1st 11th 21st at 00 00 utc the gravimetric sm of 0 40 cm layer at each station used for sm merging is obtained by weighting the observations according to the depths this sm dataset was continually updated with 171 observational values on average for each station and there were 678 stations 515 stations within the 3hrb containing more than 50 observational values among the 797 stations it is noted that only the sm series derived from the 678 stations were used for the time series analysis in order to better capture the temporal distribution of the observations in addition to better understand the merging effects three typical stations including jiehepu miaowan and loude fig 1 which are located in the hai huai and huang river basin respectively were selected to validate the sm time series before and after merging 2 1 2 the model based sm dataset the model based sm dataset was provided by the daily variable infiltration capacity vic land surface macroscale hydrological model liang et al 1994 1996 with a spatial resolution of 10 km 10 km the vic model was built with a simulation period from january 2008 to december 2016 over all 31 provinces in mainland china 93977 grids in total but only the sm data in the 3hrb 6611 grids in total was extracted for sm merging the vic model has been driven by the observed forcing data which was interpolated on 10 km 10 km grids using the inverse distance weighted idw method the forcing data contains maximum and minimum air temperatures and precipitation which were collected from 756 basic meteorological stations from the national meteorological information center nmic of the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn and more than 10 000 rainfall stations since january 2012 from the cmwric the model parameters were determined for each region the geographical vegetation and soil parameters are constant once the model is built the hydrological parameters are calibrated using measured streamflow data parameters determination and other details can be found in our previous studies wu et al 2007 2011 mao et al 2017 in the vic model three soil layers are used for volumetric sm simulation with a surface layer fixed at 10 cm depth the depths of the second and third layer are adjustable and determined by the model calibration in order to remain consistent with the in situ observations the vic sm simulations were converted to the 0 40 cm layer by depth weights meanwhile the volumetric simulations were converted to gravimetric sm values using soil bulk density data from the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations http www fao org soils portal moreover the vic sm simulations will be validated and discussed along with the merged sm values in the results 2 1 3 grid station matching the grid station matching approach was adopted to match the in situ observations point scale and vic simulations grid scale sm values are affected by heterogeneous factors such as soil properties vegetation and topography penna et al 2009 which should be considered in the grid station matching approach however it is difficult to weigh all of these factors and to collect factor data with a resolution higher than 10 km 10 km in this study a simple matching approach was employed in the grid station matching by considering the land cover types derived from the 1 km 1 km moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis land cover characterization data ran et al 2010 the proportions of the land cover type in each vic grid are adopted as the matching weight for each station involved in the vic grid the observed sm values are gridded as follows 1 s m s i 1 m s i c i i 1 m c i where s m s is the gridded observed sm value s i is the sm value derived from the ith m in total station within the target vic grid and c i is the land cover type percentage of the modis grid that s i located in the grid station matching method was applied in all the vic grids from january 2008 to december 2016 then a newly gridded observed sm data was used for the oi technique for the evaluation of the merged sm product 2 2 sm merging methodology 2 2 1 overall methodology the sm merging methodology is comprised of two steps the cdf matching step and the oi step fig 2 which are used for bias correction and random error correction respectively even though errors existed in the in situ observations mainly caused by the spatial mismatch these errors are not considered in the in situ observations the reasons are that the errors caused by the spatial mismatch representative errors are difficult to account for in each grid and the evaluation of the merged sm and merging methodology will be affected by the representative errors the spatial mismatch impact on the representativeness of in situ stations will be analyzed and discussed separately in section 4 3 in the cdf matching step the normal distribution nd fitting approach was applied to obtain the cdf of the observational sm time series cdf obs through two moments the mean value m and the standard deviation σ section 2 3 1 meanwhile the spatial variation of the two moments were analyzed and two variograms were built for the two moments section 2 3 2 then the two moments were estimated over a space using the kriging technique and the spatial distribution of the cdf obs was obtained based on the two krigged moments section 2 3 3 on these bases the vic sm was adjusted against the observed sm using the cdf matching approach section 2 2 2 by matching the vic value at each cumulative probability to that of cdf obs in the oi step the cdf corrected simulations along with the gridded observed sm were collected for random error statistics and a spatio temporal error correlation function was constructed for quantifying the random error statistics section 2 3 4 finally the merged sm was obtained using the oi technique section 2 2 3 based on the error function 2 2 2 the cdf matching approach a significant pre requisite for the oi technique is the simulations are temporally unbiased for this purpose the cdf matching approach was carried out to correct the bias of the vic simulations by rescaling the simulated value at each cumulative probability towards the corresponding observational value the cdf matching approach does not change the relative dynamics of the original sm data but imposes a value range and has been widely used for bias correction e g schneider et al 2014 kolassa et al 2017 and data consistency adjustment e g liu et al 2011 yuan et al 2015a enenkel et al 2016 the cdf matching approach is carried out for each vic grid individually first the cumulative probability cd f i t vic of the vic simulation value s m i t vic in grid i at time step t is obtained according to 2 cd f i t vic n i vic s m i vic sm i t vic n i vic s m i vic 1 where n i vic is the number of elements in the vic sm series s m i vic second s m i t vic is corrected using the cdf obs in grid i as follows 3 cd f i t vic s m i t cdf c d f i obs sm where s m i t cdf is the cdf corrected sm value and cd f i obs sm is derived from the cdf obs in grid i the cdf matching procedure in this study is simpler than the piecewise cdf matching applied in previous studies e g reichle and koster 2004 liu et al 2011 enenkel et al 2016 given that the cdf obs is parameterized the observed sm value at any cumulative probability can be directly calculated for the cdf matching the acquisition of the cdf obs is detailed in section 2 3 1 2 2 3 the oi technique the oi technique is a major part of the sm merging methodology which was used for merging the cdf corrected and in situ observed sm data xie and xiong 2011 the spatio temporal random errors are considered in the oi technique the merged sm is obtained through modifying the cdf corrected sm value based on the oi technique the observations at and near the target within distance a 0 and time decorrelation length t 0 are considered in the oi step 4 s m i t meg s m i t cdf j 1 n d 0 m w ij t t d s m j t d obs s m j t d cdf where s m i t meg is the merged sm in the target grid i at time step t w ij t t d is the weighting coefficient in grid j at time step t d n is the numbers of surrounding in situ observations and m pleasecheck is the maximum lag day d for these observations respectively assuming that the observations are error free and the cdf corrected sm is unbiased the weight w ij t t d in eq 4 can be defined by minimizing the random error variance and obtained by solving the following equation group which is modified from xie and xiong 2011 5 j 1 n d 0 m μ jk t d t g w ij t t d μ ij t t d k 0 1 2 n g 0 1 2 m where μ jk t d t g is the random error correlation between grid j at time step t d and grid k at time step t g for lag day d and g respectively μ jk t d t g and μ ij t t d can be estimated from the spatial temporal error correlation function which was constructed in section 2 3 4 2 3 merging parameters determination 2 3 1 the acquisition of the cdf obs the cdf of sm series is often constructed using the piecewise linear regression equations based on a set of cumulative probabilities and corresponding sm values e g liu et al 2011 enenkel et al 2016 however piecewise cdf matching is not suitable for the observed sm series with limited members therefore the cdf fitting approach was implemented for the acquisition of the cdf obs frequently a normal distribution is assumed for the observed sm series wu et al 2011 the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis are frequently used to test the normality of hydrological series including temperature precipitation and runoff hu et al 2011 nevertheless this method is too complicated and strict for the observed sm series in this study hence a simple nd test method was employed to evaluate the normality of the observed sm series the series with a nd fitting error less than a certain threshold can be considered as following a quasi normal distribution the nd fitting error is defined as the mean absolute relative error mare mean absolute error normalized by the mean of the observations fang et al 2011 between the observed sm series and the corresponding nd fitted sm series using the least square method the fitting error threshold was set as 0 15 of mare and the observational series derived from the 678 in situ stations which contained more than 50 observational values were tested by the nd test method as shown in fig 3 the observed series derived from 90 3 612 stations are quasi normally distributed therefore the cdf obs was collected from the 612 stations and can be defined as 6 cd f j obs sm sm 1 2 π σ j exp sm m j 2 2 σ 2 d sm where cd f j obs is the cdf obs for the jth station m j and σ j are the mean value and the standard deviation respectively 2 3 2 spatial variation of the cdf obs the cdf obs is a cumulative normal distribution function which can be parameterized using two moments the first order moment mean value and the second order moment variance replaced by the standard deviation in this study in order to conduct the cdf matching for all vic sm series in the 3hrb the two moments were estimated over the 3hrb to obtain the spatial pattern of the cdf obs before this the spatial variation characteristics of the two moments were analyzed using a variogram the variogram represented as semi variance is a central concept in geostatistics which is defined as webster and oliver 2001 lakhankar et al 2010 7 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z j z j h 2 where γ h is the semi variance for an interval distance class h n h is the total number of sample couples for separation interval h z j and z j h are the moments of the cdf obs at spatial location j and j h respectively the main parameters of a variogram consist of nugget c 0 sill c c 0 and de correlation length pleasecheck the experimental variogram model can be obtained through the least square fitting according to the semi variance data lakhankar et al 2010 the time averaged variograms were generated for the two moments of the cdf obs that derived from the 612 in situ stations during the study period fig 4 the semi variance of the two moments increased gradually with the distance which are best fitted with the variogram models the linear model for the mean value fig 4a and the exponential model for the standard deviation fig 4b respectively the relationship between the variograms and the distances also demonstrate that the two moments are quite regular and stable over space which forms the basis of the spatial estimation of the two moments 2 3 3 spatial estimation of the cdf obs afterwards the ordinary kriging technique webster and oliver 2001 was implemented to estimate the spatial patterns of the two moments of the cdf obs the krigged moment z i at ith vic grid is formed from a linear combination of surrounding moments which is calculated as 8 z i k 1 n λ k z k where n is the number of surrounding moments within radius r 0 consistent with r 0 of fig 4a and set as 100 km λ k is the weight assigned to each moment z k at a spatial location k which were obtained under the conditions that the estimation errors were unbiased and with a minimum variance accordingly the kriging equations in terms of the variogram model constructed in fig 4 are expressed as 9 k 1 n γ h kj λ k μ γ h ij j 0 1 2 n k 1 n λ k 1 where γ h kj is the semi variance which reflects the spatial variability with an interval h kj between location k and j and μ is the lagrange constant in addition some scholars e g pandey and pandey 2010 yang et al 2010 mentioned that the spatial variability of sm values was considerably reduced after applying the kriging technique thus the yamamoto method detailed in yamamoto 2005 and yang et al 2010 was carried out in this study to solve the smoothing effect of the kriging technique then the two moments were estimated over space using the kriging technique and the yamamoto method and the spatial distribution of the cdf obs can be obtained based on the two krigged moments through eq 6 in this case eq 3 can be replaced with 10 s m i t cdf a r c c d f i obs p i t where arccd f i obs is the inverse function of cd f i obs at the ith vic grid 2 3 4 random error statistics random error statistics is the key of the application of the oi technique the random errors of vic simulations were obtained through subtracting the gridded observed sm from the cdf corrected sm the correlation coefficients were used to quantify the structure of random errors in the 3hrb during the study period the temporal correlation coefficients at different distance intervals fig 5 a and the spatial correlation coefficients at different lags fig 5b were separately calculated for the random errors as shown in fig 5 the random error correlation decreases with the increase of distance intervals and lags which were fitted with two negative exponential functions based on the two exponential functions in fig 5 assuming that the exponential shape is also suitable for the spatio temporal error and a spatio temporal correlation function ρ h d was proposed and constructed by multiplication of two individual spatial and temporal error functions as follows 11 ρ h d 1 h 0 d 0 ρ h d c 1 c 2 e x p h a 0 d t 0 h 0 d 0 ρ h d c 1 e x p h a 0 h 0 d 0 ρ h d c 2 e x p d t 0 h 0 d 0 c 1 0 56 c 2 0 65 a 0 180 k m t 0 60 d a y s where c 1 and c 2 are the spatial and temporal empirical coefficients respectively which reflect the random error variation characteristics of sm a 0 and t 0 are the influence radius and effective days respectively which are the two dimensional limits of ρ h d at a distance of 180 km a 0 or time of 60 days t 0 the correlations become insignificant as 0 2 and 0 24 respectively accordingly μ jk t d t g in eq 5 can be estimated using ρ h d moreover the oi radius a 0 is set as 100 km which is consistent with the kriging radius r 0 and the lag range t 0 is set as 60 days for eq 4 the spatio temporal statistical characteristics are mainly influenced by the auto correlated sm data the spatial autocorrelation was often exhibited in the variograms of sm which were often fitted with an exponential model e g lakhankar et al 2010 pandey and pandey 2010 this is similar to the spatial correlation part of ρ h d fig 5a the temporal autocorrelation of sm was also illustrated by ford et al 2014 which demonstrated a strong correlation in the first few days but significantly decreased after a few days moreover due to the rainfall effects the temporal correlation part of ρ h d was similar to that of rainfall which was also fitted with a negative exponential function in previous studies e g xie and xiong 2011 pan et al 2012 as a whole the statistical characteristics of the random error of the cdf corrected sm can be reasonably well reflected in ρ h d 3 results 3 1 sm time series evaluation the time series of sm estimates along with the in situ observations during the study period at the three typical stations fig 1 are shown in fig 6 since two error correction parts are used in the merging methodology the bias cm3 cm3 and the mean relative error mre mean error normalized by the mean of the observations are used for bias evaluation the correlation coefficient r and the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse the rmse between the bias corrected sm estimates and observations cm3 cm3 sun et al 2017 are used for random error evaluation and the mare is used for overall evaluation these metrics are listed in table 1 the temporal patterns of vic simulations are similar to those of the observational series however significant bias and different temporal variation ranges are observed for the simulations compared to the observed series after cdf matching the bias of simulations is reduced considerably and the temporal variation range shows a larger correspondence with the in situ observations compared to the uncorrected vic simulations the merged sm is obtained using the oi technique based on the cdf corrected simulations as expected the merged sm matches the observations well both in absolute magnitude and dynamic change with a higher r lower ubrmse and mare and near zero bias and mre compared to both the uncorrected vic and cdf corrected simulations in addition the basin averaged metrics of the sm series in the 3hrb are presented in table 2 the vic simulations show satisfactory performance with an average r of 0 57 and an average ubrmse of 3 25 cm3 cm3 in the 3hrb indicating that the dynamic change of the observations is well captured by the simulations especially in the huai river basin the basin averaged bias and mre of the vic simulations show a small dry bias in the huang river basin and a small wet bias in the hai and huai river basin compared to the observations however significant errors are found in the simulations of the single grid cell with an average mare of 0 26 in the 3hrb considerable improvement is found in the metrics statistics after applying the merging methodology which is similar to the evaluation at the typical stations in conclusion the merged sm series shows a larger correspondence with the in situ observed series compared to the vic simulations these evaluations also underscore the importance and impact of the cdf matching which reduces the systematic differences between the simulated and observed series 3 2 sm spatial patterns evaluation fig 7 presents an example of the daily sm merging analysis in the 3hrb for september 11 2016 great variation is exhibited in the spatial patterns of the in situ observations fig 7a which vary from 5 to 40 g g the variation range and the spatial trends of the observations are captured by the vic simulations fig 7b however obvious bias is found in the regional simulations such as the wet bias in the hai river basin and the dry bias in the southwestern huai river basin the cdf matching step effectively reduces these bias fig 7c and the simulations are more consistent with the in situ observations in most areas of the 3hrb after the bias correction as expected the oi step further enhances the correspondence of the cdf corrected simulations with the observations fig 7d in particular for the simulations in the smaller areas fig 8 a shows the corresponding scatter plots of the daily sm estimates against the in situ observations the simulations show a significant wet bias over the 3hrb this bias is very systematic when the sm values are low the cdf matching step improves the consistency between the simulations and the observations especially for the drier sm values similarly great agreement between the simulations and the observations is achieved after applying the oi step with an increased r 2 of 0 97 furthermore the probabilities of the relative error are calculated for the daily sm estimates which are presented in fig 8b while the relative error distribution of the vic simulations mainly ranges from 0 6 to 0 6 with a general wet bias the merged sm have a more concentrated relative error distribution range from 0 2 to 0 2 based on the generally unbiased cdf corrected sm values overall the daily sm merging evaluation illustrated that the merging methodology effectively improved the vic simulations both in absolute magnitude and spatial patterns 3 3 distributions of averaged sm the spatial distribution of the time averaged sm and temporal distribution of annual basin averaged sm in the 3hrb during the study period are analyzed in this section as shown in fig 9 a the spatial variation of the time averaged observations is much smoother than that exhibited in fig 7a which gradually increases from north to south over the 3hrb the vic simulations present a good correspondence with the observations at a regional scale except few regions such as the dry bias in the western huai river basin and the wet bias in the northern hai river basin fig 9b the cdf matching step solves these biases well and the cdf corrected sm remains at a good consistency with the observations in most areas of the 3hrb fig 9c minor enhancements are found in the merged sm in some small areas fig 9d compared to the cdf corrected sm values which is consistent with the merging purpose that the cdf matching corrects the bias and the oi technique enhances the simulation of the dynamics the time averaged vic simulations reach a properly high r 2 of 0 46 against the in situ observations with a relative error distribution mainly ranging between 0 4 and 0 4 not shown similar to fig 8 both the cdf corrected and merged sm demonstrate an obvious enhancement in the correspondence with the observations and a minor improvement is observed for the merged sm compared to the cdf corrected sm the inter annual variability of the basin averaged sm estimates and in situ observations are presented in fig 10 the inter annual variability of the vic simulations are similar to that of the observations in the hai and huai river basin fig 10a c however inconsistencies appeared between the simulations observations and even the precipitation in the huang river basin fig 10b these inconsistencies could be affected by the strong uneven spatio temporal distribution of precipitation in the huang river basin yuan et al 2015b the surface variation and the limited representativeness of the in situ stations since the similar dynamic responses of simulations of the annual precipitation and better spatial coverage are shown in the hai and huai river basin moreover other factors caused by human interference such as the water infrastructure development disturb or alter the natural sm process because human activities were not taken into account in the vic model lu et al 2012 in addition to some extent the sm observations are probably affected by the proximity of some gauges to rivers or lakes which is not considered for the sm simulations in the current vic model in the sm merging assessment the merged sm shows a better consistency with observations compared to the uncorrected simulations with a temporal variation pattern and range between observations and simulations similar to the spatially averaged patterns the cdf matching step has contributed most of the correction effects to the bias reduction of simulations compared to the oi step 3 4 evaluation for non observed grids the merging effects of the observed grids with in situ station inside have been evaluated in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the cross validation method is applied to make an objective assessment for the non observed grids without in situ station inside considering that the in situ observations are insufficient both spatially and temporally the leave one out cross validation method shao 1993 is used in this study in the cross validation the in situ observations within the considered grid are removed prior to the sm merging including the cdf matching step and the oi step hence only the surrounding observations within 100 km are involved in the merging calculation for each grid therefore the in situ observations can be used for the objective evaluation of the merging methodology the cross validated cdf corrected and merged sm in the 3hrb are obtained and analyzed using the in situ observations the time series pattern metrics for the sm estimates against the in situ observations in the 3hrb during the study period are shown in fig 11 the spatial correlation coefficients of the merged sm are generally improved fig 11a with a mean coefficient from 0 34 to 0 56 compared with the vic simulations the wet bias of the simulation is significantly reduced from 0 11 to 0 01 on average after applying the merging methodology fig 11b the results demonstrate that the merging methodology effectively improved the sm estimates both in the absolute magnitude and spatial patterns the mre of vic simulations is reduced from 0 11 to 0 03 on average by applying the cdf matching step fig 11b which implies that the cdf matching approach is capable of removing the bias of the sm series over the 3hrb in addition the mean spatial correlation coefficients of the cdf corrected sm generally exceed that of the simulations which illustrates that the cdf matching approach can also improve the spatial patterns of the vic simulations fig 11a this improvement is attributable to the bias correction effects of the cdf matching for each grid which is consistent with the results in fig 7 4 discussion the discussion focusses on the error components of the cdf matching step section 4 1 the merging contribution of the random error in the oi step section 4 2 and the station representativeness effected by the spatial mismatch between the point and grid estimates section 4 3 4 1 errors in the cdf matching step two error components are included in the cdf matching step the first component is the cdf fitting error section 2 3 1 it is caused by the nd fitting in the calculation of the cdf obs since the nd function is the generalized form of the observational sm series with unavoidable representative errors during the nd fitting the cdf fitting error is quantified by the mare in fig 3 with a range of 0 0 15 for the selected observational series it is noted that even though the cdf matching is influenced by the fitting errors we could not simply treat these errors as merging uncertainties given that reference data with a long observational series is required for applying the cdf matching lee and im 2015 an ineffective result might have occurred after conducting the cdf matching with an insufficient data series massari et al 2015 the second error component is produced in the spatial estimation of the cdf obs section 2 3 3 the cdf obs for each merging grid is obtained based on the two moments which were estimated using the kriging technique therefore the kriging estimate errors further affect the cdf matching the error probability distribution of the cross validated krigged moments derived from section 3 4 are shown in fig 12 with a range of 0 4 to 0 4 for the mean value fig 12a and 0 6 to 0 6 for the standard deviation fig 12b respectively the kriging estimate errors are mainly ranging between 0 2 and 0 2 which demonstrates that it is practical for the spatial estimation of the two moments it should be noted that the error distributions of the two moments are slightly negatively biased fig 12 this is mainly caused by the negatively skewed spatial patterns of sm data liu et al 2012a and the effects of cross validation moreover even though the yamamoto method can effectively solve the smoothing effect of the kriging technique yamamoto 2005 yang et al 2010 it slightly affects the kriging estimate in the error distribution fig 12 this is reasonable since the yamamoto method is focused on spatial variability correction instead of local accuracy improvement yamamoto 2005 in addition the final effects of the fitting error and kriging estimation error on the cdf matching are analyzed based on the cross validated moments the relative errors of the cdf corrected sm are mainly ranging between 0 2 and 0 2 which indicates that the cdf matching has reliable accuracy in most areas of the 3hrb it should be pointed out that the cross validation method sacrifices the availability of data for an objective test the actual cdf corrected results will remain at a higher accuracy with an increase in data sources 4 2 the contribution of the oi step two dimensional random errors are considered in the oi technique however some differences exist between the merging contributions of the spatial and temporal random errors we have evaluated the results with the consideration of both errors in section 3 2 to better understand the oi impacts the spatial and temporal oi contributions are discussed separately in the 3hrb for september 11 2016 the leave one out cross validation method is used to evaluate the two dimensional contributions based on the cdf corrected sm data for distance evaluation the cross validation step is the same as introduced in section 3 4 the sm observational series in the target grid are removed before the oi step for lags evaluation the sm observations at september 11 2016 are removed and only antecedent sm observations 60 days from july 13 2016 to september 10 2016 are used for the oi step therefore the in situ observations can be used for validating the two dimensional contributions fig 13 compares the cdf corrected sm and cross validated merged sm for distance and lags respectively the two dimensional contributions are significant for improving the correspondence with the in situ observations compared to the vic simulations with r 2 increasing from 0 49 to 0 58 and 0 69 with mare decreasing from 0 16 to 0 12 and 0 10 for distance and lags respectively specifically the cross validation for distance retains the temporal random errors with minimum lags and meanwhile the cross validation for lags keeps the spatial random errors with a minimum distance the spatial removed validation result shows a generally lower effect compared to the temporal removed validation result the different increments of r 2 are related to the different spatio temporal empirical coefficients in eq 11 which demonstrate that the random error information in the spatial dimension has a greater impact on the random error correction comparing to that in the temporal dimension 4 3 spatial mismatch impacts strong variability is shown or exhibited in the sm values owing to the effects of heterogeneous surface conditions and atmospheric forcings penna et al 2009 which causes a spatial mismatch between the grid based estimates and the point based observations as the spatial variability of the sm series moments increase with the distance radius exhibited in fig 4 the spatial mismatch impacts might be linked to the spatial scales this can be analyzed with a relatively accurate estimates of the space averaged sm over different scales in fact sm spatial patterns frequently exhibited a strong temporal stability such that the sm monitored in a few stations could provide reliable space averaged sm information brocca et al 2010b we have proved this point by analyzing the representativeness of the sm stations for the daily and time averaged observations and the time series respectively firstly the relationship between the regional the 3hrb representativeness and different number of stations are analyzed fig 14 a the stations are randomly selected with different number of stations ranging from 1 to 797 100 000 times for each number of stations we found that only 5 stations can well represent the space averaged sm calculated using all stations in and around the 3hrb with mare lower than 0 05 and r higher than 0 6 on average it is remarkable that the spatial representativeness of the sm observations is quite stable within a very limited range for each day during the entire study period which is generally similar to that of the time averaged observations this demonstrates that spatial representativeness is less affected by the sm spatial variability with an increase of the number of stations even though the time averaged sm is much smoother than the daily observations over space on this basis secondly the relationship between the local representativeness for one station and different radii are analyzed fig 14b the minimum radius is set as 30 km and there are more than ten stations within each radius the mare increases with the radius which can be fitted with the power functions the result demonstrates that a station can better represent the surrounding area at a smaller spatial scale the spatial mismatch impacts on the station representativeness are limited with mare probably as 0 1 and 0 05 on average for daily and time averaged observations respectively moreover the mare of the time averaged sm is generally smaller than that of the daily observations which illustrate that the representativeness of each station is typically reduced with the increase of the spatial variability in addition the sm series from a single station remain at a relative high r even when the radius exceeds 200 km which further demonstrate that the impacts of the spatial mismatch on the sm dynamic change are very limited 5 conclusions and future works the objective of this study was to merge the accurate observations and continuous model simulations to obtain an improved sm product therefore an advanced sm merging methodology based on error correction methods was constructed for merging two sm sources with the application of the sm merging methodology the 0 40 cm sm data derived from a 10 km 10 km vic model and 797 in situ stations were merged in the 3hrb from january 2008 to december 2016 the sm merging process mainly included two steps the cdf matching step and the oi step for bias correction and spatio temporal correlation random error correction respectively in the cdf matching step the nd fitting approach combined with the kriging technique were carried out to obtain the spatial distribution of the cdf obs which was used to adjust the vic simulations against the observations in the oi step the cdf corrected simulations were further combined with the observations using the oi technique while considering two dimensional random errors based on a spatio temporal error correlation function through cross validations against in situ observations the merged sm was evaluated and the merging errors in each step were analyzed and discussed the results demonstrated that the cdf matching approach was capable of removing the bias of the model based sm series the oi technique was effective for correcting the dynamics of the model based sm series and both methods were effective at improving the spatial patterns of the model sm simulations after the two step correction the merged sm presented a significant improvement in the consistency with the in situ observations compared to the simulations both in absolute magnitude and dynamic change for time series and spatial patterns moreover the analysis demonstrated that the merging errors were mainly produced in the cdf fitting and cdf obs estimation processes within a limited range the contribution of the random error information in the spatial dimension was generally bigger than that in the temporal dimension in addition the spatial mismatch impact on the representativeness of in situ stations was limited and its estimation can help to better merge or assimilate different sm data sources in future research this study provides strong encouragement for the efficient use of the in situ observations in the sm merging and assimilation the sm merging methodology can be also used for the assimilation of satellite based product such as the smos and the smap products since most of them can be described as a normal distribution liu et al 2012a the merged sm product can be further used as a reference dataset for model calibration such as the application of the joint state parameter assimilation method yang et al 2007 which is helpful to improve the model and possible to provide a more improved sm product moreover the merged sm product can be also validated using other data sources such as the grace product tapley et al 2004 which is frequently used for the validation of model

6934,despite of the fast development of speleothem records oxygen isotope δ18o the main paleoclimatic proxy remains complicated in climatic interpretation continuous cave monitoring is essential for understanding the response of stalagmite oxygen isotope to east asian summer monsoon moisture transportation we introduce a 7 years 2010 2016 study on oxygen isotope of atmospheric precipitation cave drips and modern speleothems at jiguan cave central china located chinese north south divide where is sensitive to asian monsoon the monitoring covered a whole enso el niño southern oscillation cycle from el niño in 2010 to la niña in 2011 and recovered another el niño in 2015 the precipitation δ18o shows obvious seasonality negative in summer and positive in winter but air temperature and rainfall amount are not primary controlling factors the interannual δ18o of precipitation corresponds with enso variability which means δ18o value is positive during el niño event and vice versa we used hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model to simulate the moisture transportation for rainy season in el niño and la niña years and found the pacific contributed over 50 moisture in el niño years and the indian ocean was the predominant oceanic source in la niña year there is no seasonality in drips δ18o value while the response to enso variability is evident on interannual scale the stable negative δ18o of drips compared with precipitation indicate there is a threshold for infiltration suggesting cave drips are recharged by summer heavy precipitation with light δ18o value but it s the mixture of latest and former rainy precipitation that recharge drips in drought which has been verified by simple infiltration model we found the modern speleothems were precipitated under nonequilibrium fractionation during drought years nevertheless they can record the el niño related δ18o positive anomaly overall the modern speleothems can receive the precipitation δ18o signal transferred by drips and our study offers significance for verification of asian summer monsoon driving force and interpretation of stalagmite δ18o keywords oxygen isotope precipitation karst drip water modern speleothems el niño southern oscillation jiguan cave central china 1 introduction stalagmite the vital archive for paleoclimate reconstruction has developed fast recently due to its series of advantages such as precise dating widely distribution continuous precipitation copious proxies and little external disturbance e g banner et al 2007 cai et al 2008 2010 cheng et al 2009 2016 shopov et al 2004 tan et al 2015 wang et al 2001 2017 yuan et al 2004 zhu et al 2017 nevertheless as the most important proxy the interpretation of δ18o remains in argument previous studies attributed its controlling factors to rainfall amount or air temperature for example fleitmann et al 2004 found there was significant anticorrelation between stalagmite δ18o and bands thickness which reflected the precipitation variation bar matthews et al 2003 revealed the most negative in stalagmite δ18o from north and central israel was synchronic with the heaviest rainfall in east mediterranean the air temperature was introduced to explain the stalagmite δ18o variation in ireland and austria e g mangini et al 2005 mcdermott et al 1999 and supported by the contemporary increasing growth rate in general the stalagmite δ18o is usually regarded as the east asian monsoon signal in china e g cai et al 2010 cheng et al 2009 dayem et al 2010 hu et al 2008 maher 2008 yuan et al 2004 wang et al 2001 suggested it was controlled by the ratio between summer and winter precipitation and hu et al 2008 emphasized the rainfall amount effect some researches however preferred the change of moisture source rather than amount effect during holocene in china e g maher 2008 maher and thompson 2012 such conclusion is partly supported by clemens et al 2010 and dayem et al 2010 who suggested the change of moisture source and upstream rainout process should be taken into consideration cave monitoring is an effective method to accurately understand the speleothem δ18o significance and such study has been implemented as early as 1980s yonge et al 1985 treble et al 2005 disclosed the evident anticorrelation between precipitation δ18o and rainfall amount at moondyne cave sw australia likely indicating the inaccurate interpretation of stalagmite δ18o as regulated by temperature given the evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year the seasonality of precipitation δ18o was attributed to the seasonal change in moisture source at gunung mulu and gunung buda national park cobb et al 2007 furthermore because of homogenization in the bedrock cave drips generally exhibit more smooth δ18o pattern than precipitation suggesting mixture before infiltrating into cave eg bar matthews et al 2003 genty et al 2014 mischel et al 2015 moerman et al 2014 vaks et al 2003 hence the stable drips δ18o are commonly regarded as the mean annual amount weighted precipitation δ18o for local region eg williams and fowler 2002 yonge et al 1985 but due to evaporation happened in epikarst or rapid infiltration drips δ18o can still reflect apparent variation eg bar matthews et al 1996 cruz et al 2005 denniston et al 1999 van rampelbergh et al 2013 cave monitoring has been widely carried out in south china the good correlation between δ18o of precipitation and drips and meteorological parameters air temperature and rainfall amount suggests speleothem δ18o records monsoon variation li et al 2000 li et al 2011 found the drips δ18o in furong cave showed stable value with no evident rate change which was attributed to the mixture of atmospheric precipitation the positive correlation between drip δ18o and drip rate was observed at liangfeng cave luo et al 2014 and the homogenization effect can be demonstrated by the decreasing δ18o amplitude of precipitation soil water and drips luo et al 2013 duan et al 2016 compiled 8 long term monitoring caves in china and found anti temperature effect was observed in 7 caves and the amount effect was feeble the precipitation δ18o cannot be simply contributed to temperature or amount effect because of various moisture sources as discussed above current interpretation of speleothem δ18o basically focuses on amount effect eg bar matthews et al 2003 fleitmann et al 2004 hu et al 2008 temperature effect eg feng et al 2014 mangini et al 2005 monsoon intensity eg cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2005 yuan et al 2004 and moisture source change eg cobb et al 2007 dayem et al 2010 maher 2008 maher and thompson 2012 actually the parallel speleothem δ18o variation in chinese monsoon region on different time scales liu et al 2015 potentially suggests controlled by same circulation pattern dayem et al 2010 found the spatial distance of contemporary speleothems with parallel δ18o variation was far than 500 km which was the critical distance for areas share similar meteorological condition to explain this phenomenon tan 2014 2016 proposed circulation effect which suggested west pacific subtropical high wpsh shifted more westwards during el niño events thus drove more proximal pacific moisture to east asia and the shorter rayleigh distillation distance made the ultimate precipitation with positive δ18o during la niña events however wpsh moved more eastwards and moisture from distal indian ocean relatively increased the longer distance depleted more 18o therefore resulted in more negative precipitation δ18o some monitoring and modeling studies have found the positive correlation between precipitation δ18o and enso el niño southern oscillation on interannual scale e g cai and tian 2016 ishizaki et al 2012 vuille et al 2005 yang et al 2016 to testify the circulation effect we choose jiguan cave located southeast of chinese loess plateau frontier where belongs to chinese north south divide and intersection of humid and semi arid zone compared with high latitude mainly influenced by temperature and the predominant amount effect in low latitude the special location of jiguan cave might be sensitive to different moisture sources moreover this study started from 2010 to 2016 covering a whole enso cycle el niño in 2010 2015 la niña in 2011 through analyzing the δ18o of precipitation cave drips and modern speleothems we offer significance for interpretation of speleothem and to verify the driving force for asian summer monsoon 2 materials and method 2 1 geographical setting and sample collection jiguan cave 33 46 n 111 34 e is located at north slope of funiu mountain fig 1 4 km southwest of luanchuan county henan province central china the cave entrance altitude is 900 m asl the length is 5600 m and one third has been developed for tourism the average cave temperature is 16 4 c and relative humidity keeps higher than 90 during monitoring period mean annual temperature and rainfall amount recorded by an adjacent meteorological station are 12 1 c and 840 6 mm 1957 2014 respectively more than 50 of annual precipitation occurs in rainy season july september some rainfall lasted more than one day and some storm only lasted 20 min the host rock mainly consists of cambrian limestone cai et al 2008 with thickness 30 to 40 m vegetation above the cave is dominated by conifers oaks and bushes from 2010 to 2016 we almost collected every precipitation event a precipitation event is defined by both the meteorological station and our precipitation collector sometimes when the meteorological station reports rainfall but there is no water in our collector it is not taken as an event and vice versa the meteorological station reports rainfall amount everyday from 20 00 to 20 00 which is considered as an event and named using the date those rainfall events were named after the first day of raining if they lasted more than one day in such case we replaced new container at 20 00 to avoid enhanced evaporation the multiple containers during such a long rainfall event were mixed and sealed using polyethylene vial and stored in fridge approximately 4 c before measurement snow was sealed by same method after melt the fast drip site lyxs li yu xi shui consecutive drip with average rate 22 ml min and slow drip site tgbd tian gong bing deng average rate 11 ml min hiatus in drought years were collected in situ every 2 months by the way we also sampled 2 pools yzt yu zhu tan and ycg yao chi gong and an underground river dth dong tian he for parallel comparison modern speleothems were sampled by placing substrates under these 2 drips and substrate was also replaced every 2 months totally we collected 284 precipitation 182 cave water and 42 modern speleothem samples 2 2 isotope analysis the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of water samples were measured by water isotopes analyzer iwa 35d ep of los gatos research lgr company the standard reference is lgr3a 4a 5a from los gatos research company as an analysis routine lgr iwa analyzed each sample 6 times because residue of previous sample likely influences next sample memory effect the first two measurements were not taken as valid data the 1σ precision standard deviation based on sample measurement is 0 2 for δ18o and 0 6 for δd the δ18o and δ18c of modern speleothems were measured using finnigan delta v plus gas isotope mass spectrometer combined with kiel iv automated carbonate device and specific details refer to li et al 2011 each sample was analyzed 8 times the long term 1σ precision standard deviation based on sample measurement is 0 1 for δ18o and 0 06 for δ18c isotopic values are reported in delta notation relative to vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water for water and to vpdb vienna pee dee belemnite for modern speleothems 2 3 climate data and back trajectory model the air temperature and precipitation amount were supplied by local meteorological station located in the east county 8 4 km away from jiguan cave nino 3 4 sst anomaly data is downloaded from noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration climate prediction center18 we used hysplit model stein et al 2015 and reanalysis daily data with 2 5 resolution to simulate and cluster air mass trajectories to affirm moisture source for every precipitation event in rainy season july september during el niño and la niña years trajectories were performed four times every day at utc 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 and simulating height was set at 850 hpa and moved backward for 240 h 10 days we choose 850 hpa because the moisture content in 850 hpa has been widely used as the main moisture transportation level in both indian and east asian monsoon regions moreover 850 hpa contains more moisture than other levels in central north china eg basha and ratnam 2013 liang et al 2013 ma and gao 2006 shen et al 2010 all the statistic parameters involved in this manuscript were processed by spss19 3 result 3 1 precipitation isotope the variations of δ18o and δd in precipitation are from 15 66 to 8 08 average at 5 45 3 66 and from 118 29 to 45 81 average at 35 01 29 24 respectively table 1 this isotopic variation is covered by previous chinese precipitation isotopes report liu et al 2014 the significant seasonality positive in winter and negative in summer fig 2 b has been introduced elsewhere in china eg duan et al 2016 luo et al 2013 luo et al 2014 wang and linho 2002 wang et al 2015 xie et al 2011 some researchers contributed it to seasonal moisture source variation eg araguas araguas et al 1998 duan et al 2016 feng et al 2017 hoffmann and heimann 1997 thomas et al 2016 for example the monsoonal rainfall in summer generates lighter isotopes and inland or westerly moisture in winter common in eastern and central china leads to heavier isotopes 3 2 oxygen isotopes of cave water and modern speleothem as showed in fig 3 the δ18o of cave water fluctuated evidently from 10 20 to 6 43 for drips 9 70 to 3 73 for pools and 9 24 to 6 69 for underground there is no seasonal variation in drips fast drip lyxs and slow drip tgbd rapidly reduced by 3 55 from 2009 to 2010 and kept stable variation 0 88 in the following 4 years then fast increased 2 23 the parallel pattern and approximate values suggest same recharge source the deepest underground river dth δ18o showed similar pattern with more gentle variability the changes of δ18o in 2 pools are complex ycg the pool located nearby lyxs showed deviating trend in comparison to lyxs despite it was recharged by lyxs and yzt showed significant seasonality negative in summer and positive in winter since 2012 the modern speleothems δ18o values ranged from 10 00 to 5 02 averaged at 8 02 1 37 for lyxs and from 10 09 to 6 91 averaged at 8 69 1 03 for tgbd it seemed modern speleothems δ18o were seasonal in 2010 and 2011 negative in summer and positive in winter which was similar to precipitation thereafter lyxs showed stable negative value 9 50 0 34 and the synchronous drips exhibited comparable stability 9 93 0 33 hiatus more than 1 year appeared since 2013 because of serious drought and carbonate recovered in nov 2014 since drought was released by increasing rainfall and drips were oversaturated for precipitation sun et al 2017 the δ18o value was more positive than that of stable period by 2 which responded to the synchronous enrichment in precipitation and drips δ18o 4 discussion 4 1 controls on δ18o of precipitation temperature effect e g dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1992 and amount effect e g dansgaard 1964 jones and banner 2003 are denied because of poor correlation between monthly precipitation amount weighted δ18o and meteorological data shown in table 2 given the fact that there is a good correlation between air temperature and rainfall amount r2 0 319 p 0 001 n 79 and this phenomenon has been reported by other cave monitoring in chinese monsoon region eg ban et al 2008 duan et al 2012 li et al 2011 luo and wang 2008 ruan and hu 2010 which means their relationships with precipitation δ18o would be disturbed by each other we also calculated pcc partial correlation coefficient to eliminate potential disturbance e g dayem et al 2010 johnson and ingram 2004 the pcc values are 0 109 p 0 342 n 79 for δ18o and amount and 0 091 p 0 43 n 79 for δ18o and temperature the low correlation coefficients and pcc suggest temperature and precipitation amount are not predominant controlling factors for precipitation δ18o the good linear relationship between δ18o and δd in precipitation was defined by craig 1961 as gmwl global meteoric water line δd 8 δ18o 10 and the study of meteoric water line is useful to understand climatic change and moisture source shift price et al 2008 gourcy et al 2005 offered an updated gmwl δd 8 07 0 02 δ18o 9 9 0 1 by compiling all gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation stations data from 1961 to 2000 the chinese local meteoric water line lmwl was determined by zheng et al 1983 δd 7 9 δ18o 8 2 wei and lin 1994 demonstrated that lmwl could vary on interannual scale among chinese monsoon regions because of change in moisture source we calculated the lmwls every year at luanchuan county shown in table 3 it is clear that the slope and intercept of lmwl in 2010 are evidently larger than that of gmwl the slope and intercept of 2011 and 2013 are close to gmwl and slope and intercept of 2012 2014 2015 and 2016 are obviously smaller than that of gmwl we recalculated the lmwl based on all 284 precipitation events in 7 years since single year was unrepresentative and result was δd 7 63 0 14 δ18o 6 55 0 94 most similar to 2012 merlivat and jouzel 1979 suggested lmwl was determined by air temperature rainfall amount and moisture source while 2011 and 2013 with most similar lmwl show the most temperature difference in the monitoring and annual rainfall amount in 2011 is more than twice of 2013 moreover the slope and intercept of 2015 is obviously smaller than that of 2011 despite of their approximate annual temperature and rainfall amount all of abovementioned analysis infer temperature and rainfall amount are not controlling factors for relationship of δ18o and δd in precipitation the monthly and annual weighted average precipitation δ18o were calculated based on each precipitation event table 4 null represents we did not collect precipitation sample or rainfall amount data from meteorological station was not available there is obvious inter annual variation in δ18o from 7 62 in 2010 to 8 50 in 2011 after 2011 precipitation δ18o gradually enriched and reached its most positive value at 5 78 in 2015 this pattern is similar to enso variability el niño in 2010 2015 and la niña in 2011 furthermore the enso also imprinted on the rainfall amount previous studies reported the great possibility of more precipitation in east asia during el niño decaying phase eg ju and slingo 1995 zheng and zhu 2015 and this hypothesis is verified by the stupendous precipitation in jul 2010 400 mm twice in comparison to history record the el niño event in 2015 is the most powerful in this century correspondingly the amount weighted δ18o is the most positive in monitoring approximately equal to average δ18o in wuhan moreover amount weighted δ18o in 2011 la niña event is most negative and even lighter than precipitation δ18o of xi an and zhengzhou iaea wmo 2001 given the positive correlation between amount weighted precipitation δ18o and nino 3 4 sst anomaly r 0 715 p 0 1 n 7 enso variability is potentially an important reason for interannual variation of precipitation δ18o circulation effect speculates wpsh would shift more westwards during el niño events and drive more proximal pacific moisture experienced less 18o depletion to east asia thus leading to more positive precipitation δ18o tan 2014 to verify this assumption we used hysplit model and monthly reanalysis data 2 5 resolution offered by noaa to simulate moisture trajectories for every precipitation event during rainy season july to september in 2010 2015 el niño year and 2011 la niña year we divided the moisture source into three parts indian ocean the pacific and others composed of china south sea inland westerly and arctic sources we suggested the vapor traced back to arabian sea and bay of bengal was treated as indian ocean origin china south sea was surrounded by philippines vietnam malaysia and china mainland the pacific source is defined as the vapor originated near east chinese and japanese coastlines the other three sources accounting for little significance maily reflect vapor from local or westerly transportation and polar intrusion as shown in fig 4 and table 5 the pacific predominately contributed 63 and 55 of moisture amount weighted proportion in 2010 and 2015 respectively the indian ocean became the main marine moisture source in 2011 accounting for 38 while the pacific contributed to 11 the cluster results of top 2 heaviest precipitation in 3 rainy seasons and integrated moisture flux verify circulation effect fig 4 we also calculated the correlation of total 39 precipitation events and different moisture sources the correlation coefficients are 0 351 p 0 05 n 39 and 0 451 p 0 01 n 39 for pacific and indian ocean respectively table 5 in fact the monthly precipitation distribution in 2015 exhibited anomalies the majority of precipitation occurred in advance from march to june we simulated the strongest precipitation on 31st march 50 mm d and found most moisture originated from inland or transported by westerly fig 4h pre monsoon precipitation is enriched in 18o yu et al 2014 it might be this temporal anomalous precipitation combined with el niño effect result the most positive oxygen isotope in 2015 although there are many reports have emphasized the effects of upstream process and convection intensity in vapor source on the interannual variation of precipitation oxygen isotope eg cai and tian 2016 cai et al 2017 lee and fung 2008 liu et al 2014 moore et al 2014 the above discussion indicates precipitation δ18o is regulated by enso variability and the increasing proportion of moisture in pacific is coming at the expense of indian ocean 4 2 relation of precipitation and drips the inheritance of drips to precipitation after infiltration would be disturbed by specific cave system fairchild and baker 2012 the similar range and trend indicate lyxs and tgbd share same recharge source there is no evident seasonal trend and cv coefficient of variation of lyxs is only 16 01 of precipitation such narrow amplitude has been reported by previous works eg caballero et al 1996 genty et al 2014 li et al 2011 luo and wang 2008 williams and fowler 2002 yonge et al 1985 and attributed to mixing process in overlying conduits and fissures generally drips would be a reliable indicator for outside precipitation if there is no evident non equilibrium fractionation during infiltration the couple of δ18o and δd would plot near the lmwl e g caballero et al 1996 cruz et al 2005 and there is potential evaporation if drips plot below lmwl pape et al 2010 the upper location of drips compared with lmwl infer no or less evaporation furthermore clark and fritz 1997 and lacelle et al 2004 attributed such pattern to the fact condensed water mixed into drips or drips basically reflected the precipitation originated from humid marine moisture rozanski et al 1992 in the monitoring most drips are plotted above or near lmwl fig 5 indicating negligible evaporation and drips are mainly recharged by precipitation the multiyear δ18o are 9 14 0 97 8 54 1 56 and 5 57 3 69 for lyxs tgbd and precipitation respectively the relative negative values in drips are contradictory to the enrichment caused by evaporation or reaction between bedrock and water stored in fissures and conduits given the stability of drips δ18o variation 0 88 from 2011 to 2014 we suggest there is a threshold eg bar matthews et al 1996 fairchild and baker 2012 genty et al 2014 jones and banner 2003 pape et al 2010 tooth and fairchild 2003 of precipitation need to be exceeded to form effective replenishment which means precipitation would be lost by evaporation transpiration or runoff in the epikarst if precipitation is small genty et al 2014 although the amount effect is suitable because heavy precipitation usually experienced serious depletion in 18o it s not reasonable to utilize this hypothesis to explain our result due to the poor relation between amount and precipitation δ18o in our study area the seasonal recharge might be why drips δ18o are lighter than precipitation since heavy monsoon rainfall depleted in 18o occurred during july to september accounts for 50 in the year therefore rainy precipitation is the predominant recharge source the plausible evidence is the drips from 2011 to 2014 plot above lmwl shaded in fig 5 indicating humid marine origin rozanski et al 1992 and the possibility of condensed water eg clark and fritz 1997 lacelle et al 2004 is excluded due to fast dripping rate which means the condensed water effect is of little importance we chose the stable period 2011 2014 to verify our hypothesis because growing drought in this period was most likely to make rainy season the major recharge source the method supplied by moerman et al 2014 was employed to calculate the amount weighted precipitation δ18o in rainy seasons corresponding drips δ18o were set from current to next pre rainy season weighted by dripping rate the rainy precipitation δ18o in 2010 was also calculated as we speculated it was the main replenishment for drips from rainy season in 2010 to pre rainy season in 2011 results showed δ18o value of drips from rainy season in 2010 to pre rainy season in 2013 agreed well with the former latest rainy precipitation while drips exhibited 0 6 to 1 lighter than rainy precipitation in 2013 and 2014 table 6 we suggest this deviation is caused by the serious drought means the rainy precipitation is significantly less than usual and partly lost by evaporation in the soil therefore the drips δ18o reflect the combination of corresponding rainy precipitation and previous water in the overlying aquifer we speculated the previous water is mixture of rainy precipitation from 2011 to 2012 or 2012 and utilized a simple bivariate model δ 18 o d δ 18 o o f δ 18 o l 1 f where δ18od is the isotopic composition of drip δ18oo is the isotopic composition of previous water in aquifer δ18ol is the isotopic composition of latest rainy precipitation and f is the proportion of previous water in the mixture to quantify different sources the previous mixed precipitation from 2011 to 2012 and 2012 in aquifer are 9 79 and 9 88 respectively hence the rainy precipitation in 2013 contributed to only 3 10 the same method was implemented to verify rainy precipitation in 2014 and its following responding drips we found the contribution of 2014 to drips increased to 40 which was corresponded to the rainfall recovery in the rainy season in 2014 except for the stability during 2011 2014 drips in 2010 and 2015 showed most positive δ18o value and largest amplitude fig 3 corresponding to the active pacific and negative indian ocean based on above discussion the drips in jiguan cave mainly reflect the latest rainy precipitation or previous 1 2 years in ordinary and drought year respectively and the enso related variation of precipitation δ18o can be recorded in drips on interannual scale the trend of dth is similar to that of lyxs the fast decrease 2 22 from 2010 to 2011 relative stable period during 2011 2014 and gradually soared up since 2015 but the descent accomplished 8 months later than drips and the amplitude was less than drips which might be related to its deepest location means longer mixture process the δ18o trend of ycg is complex gentle decrease with fluctuation during 2010 2011 and gradual increase since 2014 seems similar to the drips and precipitation while the unexpected increase from 2012 to 2014 punctuated this pattern we suggest such deviation is the mirror of extreme drought during 2012 2014 scenic staffs introduced some drips hiatus and the downside of dth level moreover the relative humidity in 2013 decreased to 90 allow for its usual value was 95 given the long residence time exposed to air the anomaly is basically cause by evaporation during drought supported by the lower location compared with lmwl fig 5 another pool yzt showed distinct seasonal δ18o cycle negative in summer and positive in winter since 2012 it is connected to entrance by manmade tunnel 20 m and the temperature pattern is same as outside therefore temperature effect is not the reason for oxygen isotope variation and it s not plausible to attribute seasonality to suddenly increase in conduits connectivity because of stable tectonic feature song et al 2009 we suggest ventilation is the main cause since air exchange results condensed water in summer and evaporation in winter de freitas and schmekal 2003 this alternation explains seasonal oxygen isotopic cycle 4 3 significance for modern speleothem it s crucial to verify whether speleothem was formed under equilibrium fractionation before paleoclimatic reconstruction eg hendy 1971 o neil et al 1969 we chose kim and o neil 1997 δ 18 o c δ 18 o w 1000 ln α calcite drip 18 03 10 3 t 1 32 42 hereinafter referred to as ko function and tremaine et al 2011 δ 18 o c δ 18 o w 1000 ln α calcite drip 16 01 10 3 t 1 24 6 hereinafter referred to as t function where δ18oc is the isotopic composition of modern speleothem vpdb δ18ow is the isotopic composition of drip vsmow and t is kelvin temperature to verify our results fig 6 it should be noted 2 months lag between drips and modern speleothems for example we suggest carbonate collected from june is corresponded to drips in april there are little differences for simulated oxygen isotopic composition between 2 equations 1 heavier for t function the mean δ18o value of lyxs 8 22 1 38 is similar to t function 8 26 1 13 and mean δ18o value of tgbd 8 99 1 00 is close to ko function 9 02 1 66 the difference of measured and simulated data is basically same with mcdermott et al 2011 however the dramatic fluctuation in 2011 2014 fig 2d probably denote non equilibrium fractionation the intense positive deviation of δ18o in dec 2012 and jun 2013 4 fig 6 responds to the serious drought in 2012 and 2013 reflected by positive anomaly in ycg δ18o value implying effect of evaporation there is an significant correlation between δ18o and δ13c in lyxs r 0 556 p 0 01 n 27 indicating nonequilibrium fractionation cai et al 2010 and the correlation coefficient weakens to 0 497 95 significance level when we remove these anomalous positive data in drought years the coefficient of tgbd is only 0 248 p 0 1 n 15 which is corresponded to mickler et al 2004 conclusion that kinetic fractionation is easier to occur for drips with higher rate it s clear that δ18o value of modern speleothem is controlled not only by drip but also by the specific cave condition such as dripping rate temperature and relative humidity although the effect of drought results positive deviation the oxygen isotopic composition of modern speleothem showed synchronous response to enso variation positive in el niño and negative in la niña such phenomenon suggests that enso driven precipitation δ18o variation can be transferred to modern speleothem by drip however stalagmite should be prudently used for paleoclimate recovery when without cave monitoring research 5 conclusion the results of 7 continuous years monitoring for precipitation cave drips and modern speleothems are as follows 1 the range of precipitation δ18o is 15 66 to 8 08 and there is obvious seasonal variation negative in summer and positive in winter statistic test suggests rainfall amount and air temperature are not basic controlling factors for precipitation δ18o value the interannual pattern responds to enso variability heavier in el niño and lighter in la niña the simulation of hysplit model based on rainfall event in rainy season of enso years shows moisture from pacific contributes more than 50 and indian ocean becomes the predominate marine source in el niño and la niña respectively which preliminarily verify circulation effect 2 δ18o of drips show narrow variation in comparison to precipitation and no seasonality because of homogenization in upper aquifer the stable and light δ18o value of drips in drought indicated that drips were recharged mainly by rainy season july september precipitation with relatively negative δ18o value because small rainfall might be lost by transpiration and evaporation in the overlying soil such hypothesis is verified by simple infiltration model but it s the mixture of latest and previous rainy precipitation that replenish drips in drought 3 we have carried out equilibrium fractionation test and modern speleothems exhibit some nonequilibrium fractionation happened especially during extreme drought period 4 more positive than simulated value nevertheless the enso driven interannual pattern of precipitation δ18o has been transferred to speleothems through drips overall it is of significance to emphasize the cave monitoring to further understand δ18o process from precipitation to modern speleothem before climatic reconstruction acknowledgements we thank prof

6934,despite of the fast development of speleothem records oxygen isotope δ18o the main paleoclimatic proxy remains complicated in climatic interpretation continuous cave monitoring is essential for understanding the response of stalagmite oxygen isotope to east asian summer monsoon moisture transportation we introduce a 7 years 2010 2016 study on oxygen isotope of atmospheric precipitation cave drips and modern speleothems at jiguan cave central china located chinese north south divide where is sensitive to asian monsoon the monitoring covered a whole enso el niño southern oscillation cycle from el niño in 2010 to la niña in 2011 and recovered another el niño in 2015 the precipitation δ18o shows obvious seasonality negative in summer and positive in winter but air temperature and rainfall amount are not primary controlling factors the interannual δ18o of precipitation corresponds with enso variability which means δ18o value is positive during el niño event and vice versa we used hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model to simulate the moisture transportation for rainy season in el niño and la niña years and found the pacific contributed over 50 moisture in el niño years and the indian ocean was the predominant oceanic source in la niña year there is no seasonality in drips δ18o value while the response to enso variability is evident on interannual scale the stable negative δ18o of drips compared with precipitation indicate there is a threshold for infiltration suggesting cave drips are recharged by summer heavy precipitation with light δ18o value but it s the mixture of latest and former rainy precipitation that recharge drips in drought which has been verified by simple infiltration model we found the modern speleothems were precipitated under nonequilibrium fractionation during drought years nevertheless they can record the el niño related δ18o positive anomaly overall the modern speleothems can receive the precipitation δ18o signal transferred by drips and our study offers significance for verification of asian summer monsoon driving force and interpretation of stalagmite δ18o keywords oxygen isotope precipitation karst drip water modern speleothems el niño southern oscillation jiguan cave central china 1 introduction stalagmite the vital archive for paleoclimate reconstruction has developed fast recently due to its series of advantages such as precise dating widely distribution continuous precipitation copious proxies and little external disturbance e g banner et al 2007 cai et al 2008 2010 cheng et al 2009 2016 shopov et al 2004 tan et al 2015 wang et al 2001 2017 yuan et al 2004 zhu et al 2017 nevertheless as the most important proxy the interpretation of δ18o remains in argument previous studies attributed its controlling factors to rainfall amount or air temperature for example fleitmann et al 2004 found there was significant anticorrelation between stalagmite δ18o and bands thickness which reflected the precipitation variation bar matthews et al 2003 revealed the most negative in stalagmite δ18o from north and central israel was synchronic with the heaviest rainfall in east mediterranean the air temperature was introduced to explain the stalagmite δ18o variation in ireland and austria e g mangini et al 2005 mcdermott et al 1999 and supported by the contemporary increasing growth rate in general the stalagmite δ18o is usually regarded as the east asian monsoon signal in china e g cai et al 2010 cheng et al 2009 dayem et al 2010 hu et al 2008 maher 2008 yuan et al 2004 wang et al 2001 suggested it was controlled by the ratio between summer and winter precipitation and hu et al 2008 emphasized the rainfall amount effect some researches however preferred the change of moisture source rather than amount effect during holocene in china e g maher 2008 maher and thompson 2012 such conclusion is partly supported by clemens et al 2010 and dayem et al 2010 who suggested the change of moisture source and upstream rainout process should be taken into consideration cave monitoring is an effective method to accurately understand the speleothem δ18o significance and such study has been implemented as early as 1980s yonge et al 1985 treble et al 2005 disclosed the evident anticorrelation between precipitation δ18o and rainfall amount at moondyne cave sw australia likely indicating the inaccurate interpretation of stalagmite δ18o as regulated by temperature given the evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year the seasonality of precipitation δ18o was attributed to the seasonal change in moisture source at gunung mulu and gunung buda national park cobb et al 2007 furthermore because of homogenization in the bedrock cave drips generally exhibit more smooth δ18o pattern than precipitation suggesting mixture before infiltrating into cave eg bar matthews et al 2003 genty et al 2014 mischel et al 2015 moerman et al 2014 vaks et al 2003 hence the stable drips δ18o are commonly regarded as the mean annual amount weighted precipitation δ18o for local region eg williams and fowler 2002 yonge et al 1985 but due to evaporation happened in epikarst or rapid infiltration drips δ18o can still reflect apparent variation eg bar matthews et al 1996 cruz et al 2005 denniston et al 1999 van rampelbergh et al 2013 cave monitoring has been widely carried out in south china the good correlation between δ18o of precipitation and drips and meteorological parameters air temperature and rainfall amount suggests speleothem δ18o records monsoon variation li et al 2000 li et al 2011 found the drips δ18o in furong cave showed stable value with no evident rate change which was attributed to the mixture of atmospheric precipitation the positive correlation between drip δ18o and drip rate was observed at liangfeng cave luo et al 2014 and the homogenization effect can be demonstrated by the decreasing δ18o amplitude of precipitation soil water and drips luo et al 2013 duan et al 2016 compiled 8 long term monitoring caves in china and found anti temperature effect was observed in 7 caves and the amount effect was feeble the precipitation δ18o cannot be simply contributed to temperature or amount effect because of various moisture sources as discussed above current interpretation of speleothem δ18o basically focuses on amount effect eg bar matthews et al 2003 fleitmann et al 2004 hu et al 2008 temperature effect eg feng et al 2014 mangini et al 2005 monsoon intensity eg cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2005 yuan et al 2004 and moisture source change eg cobb et al 2007 dayem et al 2010 maher 2008 maher and thompson 2012 actually the parallel speleothem δ18o variation in chinese monsoon region on different time scales liu et al 2015 potentially suggests controlled by same circulation pattern dayem et al 2010 found the spatial distance of contemporary speleothems with parallel δ18o variation was far than 500 km which was the critical distance for areas share similar meteorological condition to explain this phenomenon tan 2014 2016 proposed circulation effect which suggested west pacific subtropical high wpsh shifted more westwards during el niño events thus drove more proximal pacific moisture to east asia and the shorter rayleigh distillation distance made the ultimate precipitation with positive δ18o during la niña events however wpsh moved more eastwards and moisture from distal indian ocean relatively increased the longer distance depleted more 18o therefore resulted in more negative precipitation δ18o some monitoring and modeling studies have found the positive correlation between precipitation δ18o and enso el niño southern oscillation on interannual scale e g cai and tian 2016 ishizaki et al 2012 vuille et al 2005 yang et al 2016 to testify the circulation effect we choose jiguan cave located southeast of chinese loess plateau frontier where belongs to chinese north south divide and intersection of humid and semi arid zone compared with high latitude mainly influenced by temperature and the predominant amount effect in low latitude the special location of jiguan cave might be sensitive to different moisture sources moreover this study started from 2010 to 2016 covering a whole enso cycle el niño in 2010 2015 la niña in 2011 through analyzing the δ18o of precipitation cave drips and modern speleothems we offer significance for interpretation of speleothem and to verify the driving force for asian summer monsoon 2 materials and method 2 1 geographical setting and sample collection jiguan cave 33 46 n 111 34 e is located at north slope of funiu mountain fig 1 4 km southwest of luanchuan county henan province central china the cave entrance altitude is 900 m asl the length is 5600 m and one third has been developed for tourism the average cave temperature is 16 4 c and relative humidity keeps higher than 90 during monitoring period mean annual temperature and rainfall amount recorded by an adjacent meteorological station are 12 1 c and 840 6 mm 1957 2014 respectively more than 50 of annual precipitation occurs in rainy season july september some rainfall lasted more than one day and some storm only lasted 20 min the host rock mainly consists of cambrian limestone cai et al 2008 with thickness 30 to 40 m vegetation above the cave is dominated by conifers oaks and bushes from 2010 to 2016 we almost collected every precipitation event a precipitation event is defined by both the meteorological station and our precipitation collector sometimes when the meteorological station reports rainfall but there is no water in our collector it is not taken as an event and vice versa the meteorological station reports rainfall amount everyday from 20 00 to 20 00 which is considered as an event and named using the date those rainfall events were named after the first day of raining if they lasted more than one day in such case we replaced new container at 20 00 to avoid enhanced evaporation the multiple containers during such a long rainfall event were mixed and sealed using polyethylene vial and stored in fridge approximately 4 c before measurement snow was sealed by same method after melt the fast drip site lyxs li yu xi shui consecutive drip with average rate 22 ml min and slow drip site tgbd tian gong bing deng average rate 11 ml min hiatus in drought years were collected in situ every 2 months by the way we also sampled 2 pools yzt yu zhu tan and ycg yao chi gong and an underground river dth dong tian he for parallel comparison modern speleothems were sampled by placing substrates under these 2 drips and substrate was also replaced every 2 months totally we collected 284 precipitation 182 cave water and 42 modern speleothem samples 2 2 isotope analysis the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of water samples were measured by water isotopes analyzer iwa 35d ep of los gatos research lgr company the standard reference is lgr3a 4a 5a from los gatos research company as an analysis routine lgr iwa analyzed each sample 6 times because residue of previous sample likely influences next sample memory effect the first two measurements were not taken as valid data the 1σ precision standard deviation based on sample measurement is 0 2 for δ18o and 0 6 for δd the δ18o and δ18c of modern speleothems were measured using finnigan delta v plus gas isotope mass spectrometer combined with kiel iv automated carbonate device and specific details refer to li et al 2011 each sample was analyzed 8 times the long term 1σ precision standard deviation based on sample measurement is 0 1 for δ18o and 0 06 for δ18c isotopic values are reported in delta notation relative to vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water for water and to vpdb vienna pee dee belemnite for modern speleothems 2 3 climate data and back trajectory model the air temperature and precipitation amount were supplied by local meteorological station located in the east county 8 4 km away from jiguan cave nino 3 4 sst anomaly data is downloaded from noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration climate prediction center18 we used hysplit model stein et al 2015 and reanalysis daily data with 2 5 resolution to simulate and cluster air mass trajectories to affirm moisture source for every precipitation event in rainy season july september during el niño and la niña years trajectories were performed four times every day at utc 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 and simulating height was set at 850 hpa and moved backward for 240 h 10 days we choose 850 hpa because the moisture content in 850 hpa has been widely used as the main moisture transportation level in both indian and east asian monsoon regions moreover 850 hpa contains more moisture than other levels in central north china eg basha and ratnam 2013 liang et al 2013 ma and gao 2006 shen et al 2010 all the statistic parameters involved in this manuscript were processed by spss19 3 result 3 1 precipitation isotope the variations of δ18o and δd in precipitation are from 15 66 to 8 08 average at 5 45 3 66 and from 118 29 to 45 81 average at 35 01 29 24 respectively table 1 this isotopic variation is covered by previous chinese precipitation isotopes report liu et al 2014 the significant seasonality positive in winter and negative in summer fig 2 b has been introduced elsewhere in china eg duan et al 2016 luo et al 2013 luo et al 2014 wang and linho 2002 wang et al 2015 xie et al 2011 some researchers contributed it to seasonal moisture source variation eg araguas araguas et al 1998 duan et al 2016 feng et al 2017 hoffmann and heimann 1997 thomas et al 2016 for example the monsoonal rainfall in summer generates lighter isotopes and inland or westerly moisture in winter common in eastern and central china leads to heavier isotopes 3 2 oxygen isotopes of cave water and modern speleothem as showed in fig 3 the δ18o of cave water fluctuated evidently from 10 20 to 6 43 for drips 9 70 to 3 73 for pools and 9 24 to 6 69 for underground there is no seasonal variation in drips fast drip lyxs and slow drip tgbd rapidly reduced by 3 55 from 2009 to 2010 and kept stable variation 0 88 in the following 4 years then fast increased 2 23 the parallel pattern and approximate values suggest same recharge source the deepest underground river dth δ18o showed similar pattern with more gentle variability the changes of δ18o in 2 pools are complex ycg the pool located nearby lyxs showed deviating trend in comparison to lyxs despite it was recharged by lyxs and yzt showed significant seasonality negative in summer and positive in winter since 2012 the modern speleothems δ18o values ranged from 10 00 to 5 02 averaged at 8 02 1 37 for lyxs and from 10 09 to 6 91 averaged at 8 69 1 03 for tgbd it seemed modern speleothems δ18o were seasonal in 2010 and 2011 negative in summer and positive in winter which was similar to precipitation thereafter lyxs showed stable negative value 9 50 0 34 and the synchronous drips exhibited comparable stability 9 93 0 33 hiatus more than 1 year appeared since 2013 because of serious drought and carbonate recovered in nov 2014 since drought was released by increasing rainfall and drips were oversaturated for precipitation sun et al 2017 the δ18o value was more positive than that of stable period by 2 which responded to the synchronous enrichment in precipitation and drips δ18o 4 discussion 4 1 controls on δ18o of precipitation temperature effect e g dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1992 and amount effect e g dansgaard 1964 jones and banner 2003 are denied because of poor correlation between monthly precipitation amount weighted δ18o and meteorological data shown in table 2 given the fact that there is a good correlation between air temperature and rainfall amount r2 0 319 p 0 001 n 79 and this phenomenon has been reported by other cave monitoring in chinese monsoon region eg ban et al 2008 duan et al 2012 li et al 2011 luo and wang 2008 ruan and hu 2010 which means their relationships with precipitation δ18o would be disturbed by each other we also calculated pcc partial correlation coefficient to eliminate potential disturbance e g dayem et al 2010 johnson and ingram 2004 the pcc values are 0 109 p 0 342 n 79 for δ18o and amount and 0 091 p 0 43 n 79 for δ18o and temperature the low correlation coefficients and pcc suggest temperature and precipitation amount are not predominant controlling factors for precipitation δ18o the good linear relationship between δ18o and δd in precipitation was defined by craig 1961 as gmwl global meteoric water line δd 8 δ18o 10 and the study of meteoric water line is useful to understand climatic change and moisture source shift price et al 2008 gourcy et al 2005 offered an updated gmwl δd 8 07 0 02 δ18o 9 9 0 1 by compiling all gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation stations data from 1961 to 2000 the chinese local meteoric water line lmwl was determined by zheng et al 1983 δd 7 9 δ18o 8 2 wei and lin 1994 demonstrated that lmwl could vary on interannual scale among chinese monsoon regions because of change in moisture source we calculated the lmwls every year at luanchuan county shown in table 3 it is clear that the slope and intercept of lmwl in 2010 are evidently larger than that of gmwl the slope and intercept of 2011 and 2013 are close to gmwl and slope and intercept of 2012 2014 2015 and 2016 are obviously smaller than that of gmwl we recalculated the lmwl based on all 284 precipitation events in 7 years since single year was unrepresentative and result was δd 7 63 0 14 δ18o 6 55 0 94 most similar to 2012 merlivat and jouzel 1979 suggested lmwl was determined by air temperature rainfall amount and moisture source while 2011 and 2013 with most similar lmwl show the most temperature difference in the monitoring and annual rainfall amount in 2011 is more than twice of 2013 moreover the slope and intercept of 2015 is obviously smaller than that of 2011 despite of their approximate annual temperature and rainfall amount all of abovementioned analysis infer temperature and rainfall amount are not controlling factors for relationship of δ18o and δd in precipitation the monthly and annual weighted average precipitation δ18o were calculated based on each precipitation event table 4 null represents we did not collect precipitation sample or rainfall amount data from meteorological station was not available there is obvious inter annual variation in δ18o from 7 62 in 2010 to 8 50 in 2011 after 2011 precipitation δ18o gradually enriched and reached its most positive value at 5 78 in 2015 this pattern is similar to enso variability el niño in 2010 2015 and la niña in 2011 furthermore the enso also imprinted on the rainfall amount previous studies reported the great possibility of more precipitation in east asia during el niño decaying phase eg ju and slingo 1995 zheng and zhu 2015 and this hypothesis is verified by the stupendous precipitation in jul 2010 400 mm twice in comparison to history record the el niño event in 2015 is the most powerful in this century correspondingly the amount weighted δ18o is the most positive in monitoring approximately equal to average δ18o in wuhan moreover amount weighted δ18o in 2011 la niña event is most negative and even lighter than precipitation δ18o of xi an and zhengzhou iaea wmo 2001 given the positive correlation between amount weighted precipitation δ18o and nino 3 4 sst anomaly r 0 715 p 0 1 n 7 enso variability is potentially an important reason for interannual variation of precipitation δ18o circulation effect speculates wpsh would shift more westwards during el niño events and drive more proximal pacific moisture experienced less 18o depletion to east asia thus leading to more positive precipitation δ18o tan 2014 to verify this assumption we used hysplit model and monthly reanalysis data 2 5 resolution offered by noaa to simulate moisture trajectories for every precipitation event during rainy season july to september in 2010 2015 el niño year and 2011 la niña year we divided the moisture source into three parts indian ocean the pacific and others composed of china south sea inland westerly and arctic sources we suggested the vapor traced back to arabian sea and bay of bengal was treated as indian ocean origin china south sea was surrounded by philippines vietnam malaysia and china mainland the pacific source is defined as the vapor originated near east chinese and japanese coastlines the other three sources accounting for little significance maily reflect vapor from local or westerly transportation and polar intrusion as shown in fig 4 and table 5 the pacific predominately contributed 63 and 55 of moisture amount weighted proportion in 2010 and 2015 respectively the indian ocean became the main marine moisture source in 2011 accounting for 38 while the pacific contributed to 11 the cluster results of top 2 heaviest precipitation in 3 rainy seasons and integrated moisture flux verify circulation effect fig 4 we also calculated the correlation of total 39 precipitation events and different moisture sources the correlation coefficients are 0 351 p 0 05 n 39 and 0 451 p 0 01 n 39 for pacific and indian ocean respectively table 5 in fact the monthly precipitation distribution in 2015 exhibited anomalies the majority of precipitation occurred in advance from march to june we simulated the strongest precipitation on 31st march 50 mm d and found most moisture originated from inland or transported by westerly fig 4h pre monsoon precipitation is enriched in 18o yu et al 2014 it might be this temporal anomalous precipitation combined with el niño effect result the most positive oxygen isotope in 2015 although there are many reports have emphasized the effects of upstream process and convection intensity in vapor source on the interannual variation of precipitation oxygen isotope eg cai and tian 2016 cai et al 2017 lee and fung 2008 liu et al 2014 moore et al 2014 the above discussion indicates precipitation δ18o is regulated by enso variability and the increasing proportion of moisture in pacific is coming at the expense of indian ocean 4 2 relation of precipitation and drips the inheritance of drips to precipitation after infiltration would be disturbed by specific cave system fairchild and baker 2012 the similar range and trend indicate lyxs and tgbd share same recharge source there is no evident seasonal trend and cv coefficient of variation of lyxs is only 16 01 of precipitation such narrow amplitude has been reported by previous works eg caballero et al 1996 genty et al 2014 li et al 2011 luo and wang 2008 williams and fowler 2002 yonge et al 1985 and attributed to mixing process in overlying conduits and fissures generally drips would be a reliable indicator for outside precipitation if there is no evident non equilibrium fractionation during infiltration the couple of δ18o and δd would plot near the lmwl e g caballero et al 1996 cruz et al 2005 and there is potential evaporation if drips plot below lmwl pape et al 2010 the upper location of drips compared with lmwl infer no or less evaporation furthermore clark and fritz 1997 and lacelle et al 2004 attributed such pattern to the fact condensed water mixed into drips or drips basically reflected the precipitation originated from humid marine moisture rozanski et al 1992 in the monitoring most drips are plotted above or near lmwl fig 5 indicating negligible evaporation and drips are mainly recharged by precipitation the multiyear δ18o are 9 14 0 97 8 54 1 56 and 5 57 3 69 for lyxs tgbd and precipitation respectively the relative negative values in drips are contradictory to the enrichment caused by evaporation or reaction between bedrock and water stored in fissures and conduits given the stability of drips δ18o variation 0 88 from 2011 to 2014 we suggest there is a threshold eg bar matthews et al 1996 fairchild and baker 2012 genty et al 2014 jones and banner 2003 pape et al 2010 tooth and fairchild 2003 of precipitation need to be exceeded to form effective replenishment which means precipitation would be lost by evaporation transpiration or runoff in the epikarst if precipitation is small genty et al 2014 although the amount effect is suitable because heavy precipitation usually experienced serious depletion in 18o it s not reasonable to utilize this hypothesis to explain our result due to the poor relation between amount and precipitation δ18o in our study area the seasonal recharge might be why drips δ18o are lighter than precipitation since heavy monsoon rainfall depleted in 18o occurred during july to september accounts for 50 in the year therefore rainy precipitation is the predominant recharge source the plausible evidence is the drips from 2011 to 2014 plot above lmwl shaded in fig 5 indicating humid marine origin rozanski et al 1992 and the possibility of condensed water eg clark and fritz 1997 lacelle et al 2004 is excluded due to fast dripping rate which means the condensed water effect is of little importance we chose the stable period 2011 2014 to verify our hypothesis because growing drought in this period was most likely to make rainy season the major recharge source the method supplied by moerman et al 2014 was employed to calculate the amount weighted precipitation δ18o in rainy seasons corresponding drips δ18o were set from current to next pre rainy season weighted by dripping rate the rainy precipitation δ18o in 2010 was also calculated as we speculated it was the main replenishment for drips from rainy season in 2010 to pre rainy season in 2011 results showed δ18o value of drips from rainy season in 2010 to pre rainy season in 2013 agreed well with the former latest rainy precipitation while drips exhibited 0 6 to 1 lighter than rainy precipitation in 2013 and 2014 table 6 we suggest this deviation is caused by the serious drought means the rainy precipitation is significantly less than usual and partly lost by evaporation in the soil therefore the drips δ18o reflect the combination of corresponding rainy precipitation and previous water in the overlying aquifer we speculated the previous water is mixture of rainy precipitation from 2011 to 2012 or 2012 and utilized a simple bivariate model δ 18 o d δ 18 o o f δ 18 o l 1 f where δ18od is the isotopic composition of drip δ18oo is the isotopic composition of previous water in aquifer δ18ol is the isotopic composition of latest rainy precipitation and f is the proportion of previous water in the mixture to quantify different sources the previous mixed precipitation from 2011 to 2012 and 2012 in aquifer are 9 79 and 9 88 respectively hence the rainy precipitation in 2013 contributed to only 3 10 the same method was implemented to verify rainy precipitation in 2014 and its following responding drips we found the contribution of 2014 to drips increased to 40 which was corresponded to the rainfall recovery in the rainy season in 2014 except for the stability during 2011 2014 drips in 2010 and 2015 showed most positive δ18o value and largest amplitude fig 3 corresponding to the active pacific and negative indian ocean based on above discussion the drips in jiguan cave mainly reflect the latest rainy precipitation or previous 1 2 years in ordinary and drought year respectively and the enso related variation of precipitation δ18o can be recorded in drips on interannual scale the trend of dth is similar to that of lyxs the fast decrease 2 22 from 2010 to 2011 relative stable period during 2011 2014 and gradually soared up since 2015 but the descent accomplished 8 months later than drips and the amplitude was less than drips which might be related to its deepest location means longer mixture process the δ18o trend of ycg is complex gentle decrease with fluctuation during 2010 2011 and gradual increase since 2014 seems similar to the drips and precipitation while the unexpected increase from 2012 to 2014 punctuated this pattern we suggest such deviation is the mirror of extreme drought during 2012 2014 scenic staffs introduced some drips hiatus and the downside of dth level moreover the relative humidity in 2013 decreased to 90 allow for its usual value was 95 given the long residence time exposed to air the anomaly is basically cause by evaporation during drought supported by the lower location compared with lmwl fig 5 another pool yzt showed distinct seasonal δ18o cycle negative in summer and positive in winter since 2012 it is connected to entrance by manmade tunnel 20 m and the temperature pattern is same as outside therefore temperature effect is not the reason for oxygen isotope variation and it s not plausible to attribute seasonality to suddenly increase in conduits connectivity because of stable tectonic feature song et al 2009 we suggest ventilation is the main cause since air exchange results condensed water in summer and evaporation in winter de freitas and schmekal 2003 this alternation explains seasonal oxygen isotopic cycle 4 3 significance for modern speleothem it s crucial to verify whether speleothem was formed under equilibrium fractionation before paleoclimatic reconstruction eg hendy 1971 o neil et al 1969 we chose kim and o neil 1997 δ 18 o c δ 18 o w 1000 ln α calcite drip 18 03 10 3 t 1 32 42 hereinafter referred to as ko function and tremaine et al 2011 δ 18 o c δ 18 o w 1000 ln α calcite drip 16 01 10 3 t 1 24 6 hereinafter referred to as t function where δ18oc is the isotopic composition of modern speleothem vpdb δ18ow is the isotopic composition of drip vsmow and t is kelvin temperature to verify our results fig 6 it should be noted 2 months lag between drips and modern speleothems for example we suggest carbonate collected from june is corresponded to drips in april there are little differences for simulated oxygen isotopic composition between 2 equations 1 heavier for t function the mean δ18o value of lyxs 8 22 1 38 is similar to t function 8 26 1 13 and mean δ18o value of tgbd 8 99 1 00 is close to ko function 9 02 1 66 the difference of measured and simulated data is basically same with mcdermott et al 2011 however the dramatic fluctuation in 2011 2014 fig 2d probably denote non equilibrium fractionation the intense positive deviation of δ18o in dec 2012 and jun 2013 4 fig 6 responds to the serious drought in 2012 and 2013 reflected by positive anomaly in ycg δ18o value implying effect of evaporation there is an significant correlation between δ18o and δ13c in lyxs r 0 556 p 0 01 n 27 indicating nonequilibrium fractionation cai et al 2010 and the correlation coefficient weakens to 0 497 95 significance level when we remove these anomalous positive data in drought years the coefficient of tgbd is only 0 248 p 0 1 n 15 which is corresponded to mickler et al 2004 conclusion that kinetic fractionation is easier to occur for drips with higher rate it s clear that δ18o value of modern speleothem is controlled not only by drip but also by the specific cave condition such as dripping rate temperature and relative humidity although the effect of drought results positive deviation the oxygen isotopic composition of modern speleothem showed synchronous response to enso variation positive in el niño and negative in la niña such phenomenon suggests that enso driven precipitation δ18o variation can be transferred to modern speleothem by drip however stalagmite should be prudently used for paleoclimate recovery when without cave monitoring research 5 conclusion the results of 7 continuous years monitoring for precipitation cave drips and modern speleothems are as follows 1 the range of precipitation δ18o is 15 66 to 8 08 and there is obvious seasonal variation negative in summer and positive in winter statistic test suggests rainfall amount and air temperature are not basic controlling factors for precipitation δ18o value the interannual pattern responds to enso variability heavier in el niño and lighter in la niña the simulation of hysplit model based on rainfall event in rainy season of enso years shows moisture from pacific contributes more than 50 and indian ocean becomes the predominate marine source in el niño and la niña respectively which preliminarily verify circulation effect 2 δ18o of drips show narrow variation in comparison to precipitation and no seasonality because of homogenization in upper aquifer the stable and light δ18o value of drips in drought indicated that drips were recharged mainly by rainy season july september precipitation with relatively negative δ18o value because small rainfall might be lost by transpiration and evaporation in the overlying soil such hypothesis is verified by simple infiltration model but it s the mixture of latest and previous rainy precipitation that replenish drips in drought 3 we have carried out equilibrium fractionation test and modern speleothems exhibit some nonequilibrium fractionation happened especially during extreme drought period 4 more positive than simulated value nevertheless the enso driven interannual pattern of precipitation δ18o has been transferred to speleothems through drips overall it is of significance to emphasize the cave monitoring to further understand δ18o process from precipitation to modern speleothem before climatic reconstruction acknowledgements we thank prof
