17975,this study focused on surface waters from three small creeks within the seine river watershed which are characterized by different land uses namely forested agricultural and urban silver nanoparticles ag nps in these waters were detected and quantified by single particle icpms during one year of monthly sampling their temporal and spatial variations were investigated ag nps in the three types of surface water were found to range from 1 5 107 to 2 3 109 particles l 1 and from 0 4 to 28 3 ng l 1 at number and mass concentrations respectively these values are in consistent with the very few previous studies in addition the role of factors driving process and potential sources are discussed with correlations between ag nps concentrations and biogeochemical parameters like dissolved organic carbon concentration and divalent cations concentrations for the forested watershed nom controls the stability number and mass of the ag nps as recently observed in the field in lake water in germany in the case of the agricultural and urban watersheds major cations such as ca would control the number and mass of ag nps dilution processes are rejected as conductivity and cl ions do not show significant correlations with ag nps or other major geochemical parameters the specific exportation rates of ag nps for artificial agricultural and forested areas were calculated based on the monthly data for the full year and are equal to 5 5 3 0 0 5 0 3 and 0 2 0 2 gy 1km 2 respectively these data suggest a constant release of ag nps from consumer products into freshwaters in artificial areas for instance from textiles washing machines domestic tap water filters outdoor paints these first data of ag nps fluxes in surface waters of france enlarge the very limited database of field measurements moreover for the first time the influence of time land use and aquatic geochemistry parameters on ag nps in real natural water samples is reported it is also helpful to further understand the fate and the process of ag nps in natural waters as well as to the ecotoxicity studies in real world environment keywords silver nanoparticles surface water single particle icpms land use fate concentration 1 introduction the first report of silver colloids goes back to 130 years ago in 1889 lea 1889 for decades nanosilver was mostly used under different names collargol argyrol and protargol in therapeutic treatments nowack et al 2011 more recently the introduction and rapid development of nanotechnology opened up wider applications of silver nanoparticles including textiles cosmetics food packaging medical devices catalysts electronics biosensors moreover silver nanoparticles are reported by vance 2015 as the most frequently used nanomaterial and found in 435 consumer products 24 of total items in a more general way these silver nanoparticles may find their way into natural waters during their life cycle even though wastewater treatment plants wwtps are effective to remove silver nanoparticles nano sized silver silver sulfides were found in the effluent of wwtps wang et al 2018 for europe input rate via wwtp residues to soils is estimated 0 37 tons y 1 and 4 7 tons y 1 to large rivers wang et al 2018 in addition to anthropogenic sources silver nanoparticles could be also naturally formed from the silver ions in the water or in soils as recently reported by huang et al 2019 for soils and wimmer et al 2018 for fresh waters johnston et al 2010 have estimated for france an input of 11 tons y 1 of anthropogenic bulk silver from waste management to surface environments official registration in france recently reported 10 kg in 2017 r nano https www r nano fr that is a very small amount so we would not expect so see too much engineered nano ag in waters however using the data of wang et al 2018 for europe and downscaling it to france using europe and france populations as the scaling factor we can also estimate that 27 kg ag nano y 1 and 425 kg ag nano y 1 will be delivered to soils and waters respectively this extensive spreading of nano sized silver and the lack of information regarding their long term effect inevitably cause emerging concerns about their potential risks to aquatic ecosystems and or humans despite a long history of use more and more studies showed their adverse impacts on aquatic and terrestrial organisms mammalian cells and potentially on human health bian et al 2019 dobrzyńska and kruszewski 2014 gaillet and rouanet 2015 johnston et al 2010 musee 2010 modeled their possible toxicity to the aquatic ecosystems of the city of johannesburg with a risk quotient defined as the ratio of the estimated environmental exposure to the predicted no effect concentration mostly 1 the detection and quantification of nanosized silver from different sources ranging from engineered and incidental to natural ones in the environment and named from here and after ag nps is however quite limited because of their expected low concentrations and the biogeochemical complexity of aquatic ecosystems to circumvent this limitation material flow analysis models have been developed to predict environmental concentrations since 2007 boxall et al 2007 the modeled concentrations of ag nps in surface waters vary significantly from 0 008 to 619 ng l 1 depending on modeling parameters and studied sites dumont et al 2015 good et al 2016 gottschalk et al 2015 mueller and nowack 2008 musee 2010 o brien and cummins 2010 silva et al 2011 sun et al 2016 however these predictions are currently not validated due to the lack of field measurements in aquatic environments which also limits the further advancement of modeling in other domains such as their fate and toxicology in complex ecosystems there is thus an urgent need for frequent and robust measurements of ag nps concentrations on fluxes in continental surface waters a first issue is that to date only a limited number of studies are available on the quantification of ag nps in freshwaters some of them confirmed the presence of colloidal wen et al 1997 and more recently nano silver in wastewater effluent and river water mitrano et al 2012 peters et al 2018 yang et al 2016 however most studies either focus on one sampling site or several sites along the same river for which a single sampling is performed moreover those studies do not try to relate changes in concentration or size of ag nps to bulk geochemical parameters i e ph dissolved organic carbon concentration ionic strength redox of the aquatic ecosystems as for any other type of natural colloids benedetti et al 2003b ilina et al 2016 it is also expected that the ag nps flux will vary along the river and with the hydrological and climatic variations during the year this knowledge is critical to build better material flow analysis models that can take into account such variations if they exist and give outputs that can be compared to real field data like the one collected in this work the second issue is the identification in the field of the mechanisms and sources that could account for the variations of measured concentrations and fluxes of ag nps among different type of waters indeed most of the processes reported in literature are determined from laboratory experiments shevlin et al 2018 or small scale column experiments to understand the fate of ag nps in soils solutions and their migration towards continental waters yang et al 2014 this vast literature reports that organic matter om ph ionic strength redox conditions and the concentration of charged cations i e ca2 al3 are critical parameters that will control the number and size of ag nps in such designed experiments only recently wimmer et al 2018 showed that in field in lake water om promoted the formation of agnps these factors were also shown to be important for the fate of trace metals and contaminants in a watershed under a high anthropogenic pressure like the seine river bonnot et al 2016 the direct evidence from field data of the role played by such drivers is still missing it is therefore important to explore how they will be effectively related to changes in concentration size and flux of ag nps in river watersheds the third issue generally addressed in material flow analysis models but not in today published field studies is the impact of the land use within a watershed for instance for the whole seine river watershed an increase in trace metal concentrations from pristine headwaters to heavily impacted urban waters was reported chen et al 2014 grosbois et al 2006 horowitz et al 1999 with a significant impact of paris conurbation due to wastewater treatment plants and combined sewer overflow inputs estèbe et al 1997 estebe et al 1998 garban b ollivon d carru am 1996 in addition a recent field monitoring of ag nps was conducted on meuse and ijssel watersheds which are characterized by different land uses peters et al 2018 based on the measured concentrations of ag nps from this study a first order estimation of the ag nps normalized export rates can be calculated using an annual average discharge rate and watershed area source wikipedia 2018 we calculated the export rates normalized per km2 or per capita and they are equal to 0 3 g km 2y 1 1 mg ag nps capita 1y 1 and 2 0 g km 2y 1 6 mg ag nps capita 1y 1 for the meuse and ijssel rivers respectively using only the 10 kg of nano engineered year declared in the r nano database gives a rate of release equal to 0 15 mg ag nps y capita for france potential explanations for such differences in two rivers are their different processes governing the fate of the nps along the rivers course their differences in soils nature and in compositions and may be the most importantly their differences in land use for instance the meuse basin is comprised by croplands 39 forests 29 pastures 18 and built up areas 12 by the end of the 20th century lambert et al 2017 while rural areas characterize the ijssel watershed with intensive agricultural dominating with croplands covering 70 of the basin verwijmeren and wiering 2007 putting aside the obvious effect of the land use for the contaminants and ag nps sources mobilization one can wonder to what extent are the normalized fluxes of ag nps governed by the land use or if these fluxes are only regulated by the above mentioned biogeochemical drivers the answers to these questions will help to better constrain the hypothesis made in material flow analysis models they will also provide an accurate range of ag nps environmental concentrations in combination with realistic biogeochemical parameter values to be tested in future studies on ag nps toxicity toward aquatic fauna to address those issues the best approach is to sample waters from low to heavily human impacted territories and to precisely assess the seasonal dynamics of ag nps under such different land uses the present study relies on concentration analysis for the dissolved 1 kda and nano particulate silver in three characteristic sub basins i e forested agricultural and urban selected in a previous study on the identification of trace element geochemical background values in the seine river watershed bonnot et al 2016 small size sub watersheds 120 km2 were chosen as the water samples will be prone to rapid modifications of their biogeochemical parameters as a function of hydro climatic and land use changes in order to identify their role on the ag nps concentration and fate and to inter compare export rates specific to these three land uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and protocol the three sampling sites are located on the west of paris their lithology and land uses composed of artificial surfaces agricultural areas and natural areas are given in fig 1 detailed information on the watersheds area distribution of land uses and discharge rates as measured during this study are given in table s1 a snapshot of the water geochemistry was obtained by grab sampling of the three creek waters taken each month or each two months from october 2016 to december 2017 for ag nps detection using 1 l polyethylene containers before field sampling the containers were previously washed with 1 n hcl for 2 days then rinsed three times with mq water in the laboratory on each sampling site one 1 l bottle was placed horizontally at the surface about 10 cm of creek until filled by water and it was done within 5 10 s depending of the flow rate for the urban watershed the water was collected from a bridge with a bucket and the 1 l bottle filed directly with the bucket in less than 5 s to evaluate the sampling effect three additional samplings were performed for each sampling site during three field missions sampling replicates were individually analyzed to evaluate the contribution of sampling to the overall uncertainty the sampling effect was evaluated by performing anova test for water sampling replicates and was not significant the ph dissolved oxygen and conductivity were measured in the field using multi 3410 multiparameter meter the sensors and electrodes were calibrated before field measurements in the lab and the calibration verified in the field prior to measurements various sub aliquots were filtered in the field through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate for analysis of the dissolved anions non acidified and cations acidified triplicate sub samples were acidified with 65 hno3 for trace elements and rare earth elements analysis glass vials previously washed with acid rinsed and pyrolyzed at 500 c were used to store samples for the analysis of dissolved organic carbon doc obtained from another aliquot filtered through 0 7 μm glass microfiber filters and acidified with 85 h3po4 all containers and materials used for sampling were rinsed three times with river waters in the field before collection unacidified unfiltered sub samples were immediately analyzed back to laboratory for alkalinity determination and all the others above mentioned samples were stocked at 4 c prior to analysis the alkalinity was measured by titration with 10 2 mol l 1 hcl titrando 809 metrohm the doc was analyzed with a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimazu the anions were quantified with ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 thermo scientific the cations were analyzed with an icp aes icap 6200 series thermo scientific so called dissolved i e 0 22 μm and 1 kda trace element concentrations were determined with a hr icp ms element ii thermo scientific and the raw data were treated with ufreasi software tharaud et al 2015 immediately after field sampling in the laboratory an aliquot 500 ml of the bulk 1 l sample taken for ag nps analysis was ultra filtered through 1 kda regenerated cellulose in order to remove all the particles present in waters to get access to the fraction of free ag ions and ag bound to organic matter or associated to nanoparticles smaller than a few nanometers 1 3 nm guo and santschi 2007 this ultra filtrate was further used as the matrix to prepare all standards and solutions for sp icpms analysis it aims at conserving the same environment of ag nps in waters and avoiding matrix effect during measurement 2 1 1 digestion of bulk water additionally in 2019 the total silver was quantified after acid digestion in 9 samples which came from the urban watershed a sub sample of 10 ml was taken for total silver analysis in triplicates and mineralized with a mixture of 3 concentrated acids 3 ml hcl 1 ml hno3 and 0 5 ml hf in a pfa closed vessel and heated for 24 h at 105 c after the digestion the mixture was evaporated at 85 c to dryness the residue was then dissolved in 10 ml of 2 hno3 blanks were run at the same time in triplicates and pfa vessels were cleaned with a concentrated hno3 at 120 c before use and rinsed 3 times with mq water 2 2 single particles icpms sp icpms measurements of ag nps 2 2 1 instrumental parameter and standard preparation a high resolution icpms thermo scientific element ii was used for ag nps measurements in this study it was joined with a quartz cyclonic spray chamber and a pfa microflow nebulizer the peristaltic pump rate was set at 12 rpm generating a sample uptake flow of 0 2 ml min 1 certified reference material au nanoparticles of 60 nm rm8013 nist was used to determine sample loss during sample uptake ca transport efficiency the au np stock suspension was diluted 2 5 105 times in the ultra filtered matrix to achieve a proper particle concentration for sp icpms measurements and avoid nps coincidence at milli second dwell time dissolved calibration curves au 50 5000 ng l 1 ag 50 1000 ng l 1 were prepared in the ultra filtered matrix to determine the element sensitivity in the same matrix as the water samples and thus prevent matrix effect the analysis of ag nps in river waters was carried out with 1 ms dwell time and 1 ms settling time tharaud et al 2017 10 000 data points were acquired and the isotope 107ag and 197au were measured in low resolution mode and each measurement was performed in triplicate which allows to calculate means and standard deviations the dilution of the natural water samples was unnecessary considering the expected low concentrations in natural waters all suspensions and solutions were freshly prepared with the minimum delay between sampling and analysis 2 2 2 data processing according to the literature the transport efficiency te is needed to determine the concentration and size of ag nps in river waters and can be obtained by three methods based on 1 waste collection 2 particle size and 3 particle frequency pace et al 2011 here the second method is selected since the reference material used in this study is better certified for the particle size than the particle concentration taking into account the matrix effect te was determined independently for each type of river water the calculation method and the formula of te are detailed in the supplementary materials before data processing can be performed nps must be correctly distinguished from the dissolved background different methods exist to determine the threshold between dissolved and particulate fractions such as average plus 3σ pace et al 2012 iterative algorithms with 3σ tuoriniemi and hassellöv 2012 or simply by using the first minimum as the boundary between dissolved fraction and nps montaño et al 2014 however for the size range expected for ag nps peters et al 2018 those approaches could lead to a large number of false negatives during nps counting i e underestimation of the representative number of nps events instead we used in this study another approach to prevent such artifacts the subtraction method it is analogous to the deconvolution method cornelis and hassellöv 2014 but uses the ultra filtered natural waters as the blank because the ultra filtrate was supposed to best represent the realistic dissolved background in case of natural water samples basically the histogram of frequency vs intensity of the ultra filtrate through 1 kda is subtracted from that of the raw water sample using the same bin width same range of intensity for each bin of both histograms the resulting histogram is then used to calculate the concentration and size of ag nps calculations of particle number concentration from the signal frequency and of particle size from the signal intensity are well described in literature here we used the procedure developed by pace and co workers pace et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 ag nps concentrations in three waters first of all ag nps are detected in all waters sampled throughout the year the concentrations range their average and their size and the results of previous studies are summarized in table 1 the presence of ag nps can be directly observed by comparing the signal of raw water and the matrix blank with all particles removed i e filtrate through 1 kda fig s1 ag nps number concentrations range from 1 5 107 to 2 3 109 particles l 1 with an average of 9 1 108 particles l 1 their mass concentrations are in the range of 0 4 28 3 ng l 1 with an average of 7 9 ng l 1 compared with the scare database of ag nps in surface waters table 1 the particle number concentrations found here are in a larger range and the average is 100 times higher than that of dutch rivers peters et al 2018 it mostly results from the different data processing approach applied the subtraction method in our study allows to better constrain the false negatives where the small ag nps are counted as the dissolved background regarding the mass concentration our results cover the concentration range of the recent study in surface waters of netherland they are in agreement with previous measurements of colloidal ag in texas rivers moreover from the modeling view ag nps are expected in surface waters between 0 04 and 619 ng l 1 table 1 our measured concentrations are within this global range but a bit higher than most estimations for europe 0 002 2 3 ng l 1 dumont and williams 2015 however the existence of naturally occurring ag nps is not included in the concentration estimation by modeling resulting in an underestimation in that case also for now the challenges raised by all modeling studies in natural rivers come from the complex transformations undergone by silver nanoparticles on one hand and their interactions with environmental components on the other hand thus the field data obtained here will constitute a strong constraint to better refine the possible control factors in surface waters among the three waters in this study the largest ag nps amount is found in the urban site with an average concentration of 1 2 109 particle l 1 and of 12 3 ng l 1 table 1 ag nps mass concentrations in agricultural and forested waters are very close considering the significant variations measured over the year however the forested water has a higher particle number concentration than the agricultural water this is mainly ascribed to their different size populations of ag nps table 1 the size might be related to the water geochemistry affecting processes of ag nps in this environment which is to be discussed in more details in following sections monthly sampling was performed on each catchment to investigate temporal variations of the ag nps concentration over the year the particle number concentrations are presented in fig 2 it shows that the flux in the urban site is quite constant throughout the whole year but the two other sites have larger temporal variations since average annual water flows are 22 9 l s and 51 27 l s for the forested and agricultural creeks respectively the larger variations in water flow rates reported for the agricultural and the forested sites account therefore for the temporal variability showed in fig 2 indeed forested and agricultural sites as small watersheds react very quickly to the climatic and hydrological effects whereas the urban watershed of greater size has diverse contributions mixture of artificial agricultural and natural areas and its concentration variation can thus be slighter over time additionally an increase of ag nps from winter to spring is observed for forested and agricultural waters the dissolved silver 1 kda is also quantified by sp icpms in order to investigate the speciation of silver in three natural waters the signal intensity in counts per second of ultra filtered samples is converted into ng l 1 using the dissolved ag sensitivity calibration curve fig 3 shows the concentrations of dissolved and nano ag in three waters it should be noted that values under the limit of quantification 2 5 ng l 1 are not discussed here for most forested watershed water samples more nano silver is measured than dissolved this is in agreement with results of delay et al 2011 showing that nom significantly influences the particle size distribution the stability and the surface properties of ag nps in the aqueous phase preventing it further dissolution and that in presence nom ag nps suspensions are also stable at variable ionic strength which will facilitate their transport in addition it was recently shown that natural organic matter content i e 10 mgl 1 nom in lake water encourage the natural silver based nanoparticle formation wimmer et al 2018 however in agricultural and urban waters the distribution changes from one sampling period to another no conclusion has been made for these two sites in which the transformation of silver is more complex and may be controlled by multiple parameters and processes size and coating of ag nps ph doc is dissolved oxygen light irradiation biofilm desmau et al 2018 shevlin et al 2018 the total silver quantified in 2019 after acid digestion of the 9 remaining samples from the urban watershed are given in table s4 the total amount of ag is higher than the addition of nanosized and dissolved fractions in almost all urban waters except the sample of 2016 11 30 this is most probably related to the ageing water samples since those samples were stored in the refrigerator with no prior acidification for two or three years part of the silver may have been lost to the container wall besides when eliminating sample of 2016 11 30 the average of percentage of measured ag nano dissolved is equal to 70 it means that a part of ag is incorporated in larger particles or aggregates not detected by sp icpms 3 2 field mechanisms and the sources accounting for the variations of measured concentrations correlation between elements and ag nps concentrations i e number or mass can be interpreted within a mass balance approach or as the identification of driving parameter or process for small watersheds benedetti et al 2003a all related data in the following discussion ph doc conductivity is and elements concentrations in the dissolved fraction are detailed in supplementary material tables s2 and s3 the correlation between two variants is considered statistically significant when r 2 0 6 and p value 0 01 there is a positive correlation between doc concentrations and ag nps concentrations in forested water fig 4 and s2 this strong correlation reflects the control of the natural organic matter nom on the number and the mass of ag nps the more nom the more ag nps are detected in forested water samples this trend is explained by two combined effects stabilization and reduction the stabilization effect of nom humic and fulvic acids on ag nps has been described in several studies topuz and talinli 2015 yu et al 2018 zhang and jiang 2017 wimmer et al 2018 huang et al 2019 high nom concentration inhibits the dissolution and aggregations of ag nps when released into surface waters thus making ag nps more persistent in such natural matrices the formation of ag nps through reduction of ag by nom can also lead to the increase of ag nps concentration along with nom akaighe et al 2011 sal nikov et al 2009 yin et al 2012a wimmer et al 2018 as reported in fig 3 there is a large reservoir of dissolved ag either as free ag or ag bound to nom to justify the potential increase of ag nps by this process for the agricultural and urban watersheds no significant trends between doc and ag nps number or mass concentrations were found this lack of trend does not mean that similar processes are not at work but that the smaller range of nom concentrations variations δnom 2 2 mg l 1 and 1 7 mg l 1 versus 5 7 mg l 1 for agricultural and urban versus forested watersheds respectively prevented the building of a reliable correlation moreover other potential processes which work more efficiently might be operating in those two watersheds indeed we found that the particle number concentration and the equivalent size for sphere of ag nps correlate negatively with conductivity and positively with ca concentration in agricultural and urban water samples respectively figs 5 and 6 this means that ag nps number concentration decreases with increasing charged ions concentration in the aquatic media the agricultural and urban waters have higher concentrations of charged ions while their average particle size is significantly higher than ag nps from the forested waters table 1 the charge induced aggregation and even sedimentation of silver nanoparticles has been reported in simplified natural systems with the presence of calcium ions topuz et al 2014 these aggregates will interact with colloids or induce further sedimentation labille et al 2015 thus escape from the top layer sampling since the sampling river surfaces are quite small and water column is shallow 0 3 m in the case of the agricultural water samples the lack of increase in size with ca2 could be due to fast sedimentation or formation of nanoparticles outside the range of our analytical detection window considering negative correlation between ag nps concentration and conductivity together with size growing with ca2 content we can conclude that in the charge abundant river the aggregation or even sedimentation is favorable and the fate is more controlled by charge determining ions such as divalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 or al3 in extreme conditions with very low ph another explanation for this correlation is that the observed changes are related to variable inputs of different sources with time for instance the urban watershed is partly covered by agricultural land but the differences in bulk geochemistry especially for major ions are not that large for a single river table s3 and cannot totally explain the observed trend however correlations can also help to identify sources of elements and colloids benedetti et al 2003a for instance for the forested site water samples there is a strong correlation between the ag nps mass concentration and trace elements zr y la and ce in the fraction 0 22 μm two examples are given in fig 7 and s3 zr is often considered as a geological background indicator because of its limited mobilization under most environmental conditions aja et al 1995 hodson 2002 as for la and ce their speciation is generally controlled by natural organic matter sonke 2006 which explains their good correlation with ag nps number and mass concentrations moreover the ce la ratio is equal to 1 9 0 1 for all water samples in the forested watershed this value is equal to the geochemical background value of 1 9 given for french soils and suspended matter sediments reimann et al 2018 thus silver nanoparticles in forest water are very likely to be of natural origin in addition to the natural leaching from bedrock qi et al 2007 other potential pathways of naturally occurring ag containing nps include the reduction of dissolved ag by natural organic matter akaighe et al 2011 sal nikov et al 2009 yin et al 2012a wimmer et al 2018 the oxidation and reduction of macroscale ag objects qi et al 2007 and biological processes klaus et al 1999 kroll et al 2014 moreover the stability of ag nps in the environment could be enhanced by surface sulfidation levard et al 2011 via interactions with extracellular polymeric substances eps kroll et al 2014 li et al 2016 and with noms topuz and talinli 2015 yu et al 2018 zhang and jiang 2017 present in the natural matrix le pape et al 2012 identified antimony sb as a typical anthropogenic element in the orge river catchment very close to our sampled watersheds they concluded that sb was of anthropogenic origin and carried by organic matter or sulfur containing species in the agricultural watershed we have a good correlation between sb and ag nps number concentration fig 8 this could mean that both elements were trapped in or carried by the same species organic matter or sulfur containing species could originate from biosolids recycled from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and used as fertilizers and soil amendments healy et al 2016 del real et al 2016 le pape et al 2012 several studies have confirmed the release of ag nps in the effluent of wwtps at the level from 12 ng l 1 up to 100 ng l 1 li et al 2013 mitrano et al 2012 an historical pollution for sb and as as well as ag is reported and well known in the seine river watershed ayrault et al 2010 le cloarec et al 2011 we cannot exclude this old source that because of its dispersion via the atmosphere all over the catchment has probably reached the agricultural watershed under investigation therefore it suggests that silver nanoparticles in agricultural water would be of anthropogenic origin in the case of urban river water samples no clear correlations with the previously mentioned drivers such as organic matter or trace elements issued from anthropogenic activities are reported a recent evaluation on historical trace pollutants load sb ag ni cu zn as pb in the seine river watershed reports lower values in sediments reflecting the progressive decontamination of the catchment le gall et al 2018 thus new source of silver such as biocidal plastics and textiles vance 2015 are uncorrelated to those historical trace pollutant elements as seen in this study in addition the mixed contribution of three type of waters forested 19 agricultural 44 and artificial 37 makes complex the interpretation of the source identification especially in the case of small watersheds that promptly react to hydrological and environmental changes a weak trend is observed between ag nps number concentration and the temperature of the sampling river r 2 0 48 p 0 0377 the higher the temperature the higher the number of ag nps temperature and sunlight affects the reductive formation of ag nps yin et al 2014 2012b in summer warmer water temperature months increased exposition to uv light would promote the reduction of ag by organic compounds leading to higher ag nps concentrations badireddy et al 2014 odzak et al 2017 yin et al 2015 similar enhanced process by sunlight takes place for the reduction formation ag nps by natural eps components kroll et al 2014 they thus result in the persistence of ag nps in sunlight waters the issue of the land use effect is still standing even after identifying potential sources for the forested watershed samples natural and the agricultural watershed contamination calculation of normalized fluxes of ag nps that can be obtained by the combination of the monthly water discharge data and the respective area of the three watersheds may help to evidence clear differences between each of the studied sites 3 3 effect of land use on exportation fluxes the measured normalized in km 2 y 1 export rate for ag nps and dissolved silver are given in fig 9 it is clear in this figure that the flux from the urban site is the highest for nano and dissolved silver if the monthly export rates of ag nps are averaged an annual export rate of 2 3 1 3 g km 2 y 1 is obtained this value is ten times higher than the export rate calculated for the agricultural and forested watersheds whose respective values are 0 4 0 3 and 0 2 0 2 g km 2 y 1 the difference between the urban site and the two others is also seen for dissolved ag export rates that are respectively equal to 2 6 3 1 0 6 0 5 and 0 2 0 1 g km 2 y 1 for urban agricultural and forested sites these large difference cannot be due to due to the constant release of ag nps from consumer products into freshwaters as reported in several studies benn and westerhoff 2008 mitrano et al 2014 farkas and thomas 2011 aznar et al 2017 kaegi and burkhardt 2010 the amount of nanosized silver registered in the r nano french declaration of use or production site https www r nano fr is equal to 10 kg in 2017 and was equal to 1 kg in 2013 in addition for france in the https www nanotechproject org cpi data base of products with nano sized silver only 33 products are listed another approach is to use the data of wang et al 2018 for europe and downscale it to france using europe and france population as the scaling factor we can estimate that 27 kg ag nano y 1 i e 0 042 g km 2 y 1 and 425 kg ag nano y 1 i e 0 66 g km 2 y 1 could be delivered to soils and waters respectively these are very small numbers for the french territory other sources of ag nps must be found to account for the fluxes in all three watersheds in table s4 we have compiled the known input data of bulk ag and nano ag to soils for the world europe france and switzerland with available data from johnston et al 2010 muller and novack 2008 and wang et al 2018 we can clearly see that bulk ag issued mostly from wwtps represents a much bigger source of ag to soils and consequently to rivers or aquatic ecosystems than the input of nano ag wang et al 2018 material flow analysis expressed in mass per capita per year or in mass per km2 per year relies on land use or product use to simulate concentrations of ag nps in aquatic systems as two of the three watersheds are experiencing different land uses i e forestry agricultural practices and artificial areas we can recalculate the actual specific export rate of ag nps for agricultural practices and artificial areas the forested watershed 0 2 0 2 g km 2 y 1 or 80 mg capita 1 y 1 is one end member that will allow the calculation of the agricultural end member since the agricultural basin is only covered by those two types of activities i e 72 agriculture and 22 forestry the calculated rate of export of ag nps is therefore equal to 0 5 0 3 g km 2 y 1 or 5 mg capita 1 y 1 for land only used for agricultural purposes now the same calculation can be done for the artificial areas using the urban watershed data i e 37 artificial areas 44 agriculture 19 forestry the calculated rate of export of ag nps is therefore equal to 5 5 3 0 g km 2 y 1 or 3 mg capita 1 y 1 for artificial areas considering the large uncertainties due to the high variability of ag nps concentrations along the year for artificial land and agricultural practices we can conclude that both activities generate the same amounts of ag nps expressed in mg capita 1 y 1 the highest of all being the forested watershed i e 80 mg capita 1 y 1vs 5 mg capita 1 y 1 the major characteristic of forested watershed is that its lithology corresponds to a sandy soil vs carbonated soils for the other watersheds and that it is richer in carbon in the top soil bonnot 2015 recent studies have shown that soils organic matter could significantly contribute to the formation of silver nanoparticles in soils huang et al 2019 the low number of inhabitants and the favored production of ag nps by soils organic matter would account for this higher number the origin of the ag nps for the agricultural and urban watersheds is probably different from the geochemical background and is from anthropogenic origin since in the seine river watershed biosolids were and are used on agricultural land buzier et al 2011 thévenot et al 2007 artificial areas will generate the highest flux of ag nps by more than one order of magnitude compared to the two other land uses when expressed in g km 2 y 1 the corine land cover map updated in 2006 can be used to calculate the total ag nps annual export for the entire catchment of the seine river i e 78650 km2 using two end members an urban one corresponding to 13 of the total catchment ag nps 5 5 3 0 g km 2 y 1 and an average value corresponding to the agricultural and forested end members which represents the rest of the land use in the catchment ag nps 0 4 0 3 g km 2 y 1 the calculated flux is equal to 80 51 kg y 1 corresponding to a release per capita of 4 mg capita 1 y 1 the urban source representing 56 30 kgy 1 the same calculation can be done for the dissolved fraction of ag with the same hypothesis the dissolved flux of ag is 94 50 kg y 1 with the urban source representing 64 30 kg y 1 in total a flux of 174 kg y 1 of silver would be exported from the catchment dissolved and nano this flux is much smaller than the particulate flux calculated by ayrault equal to 1700 kgy 1 in 2003 ayrault et al 2010 corresponding to a flux of 85 mg capita 1 y 1 table s4 data show a huge input to soils of bulk silver in france compared to the nano silver whatever the units used and suggest that the difference between our seine river flux and the one from ayrault et al 2010 could be due to a missing source input not captured by our 3 watersheds but existing at the scale of the larger seine river watershed for instance the cause could be higher inputs of biosolids from wwtps on agricultural land thevenot et al 2007 buzier et al 2011 since we do not have the mass of biosolids that are actually spread over the lands in our three sites in addition the data from ayrault et al 2010 was calculated with data from sediments of two cores about 100 km downstream of paris draining 96 of the seine river basin and are located within the last major meander of the seine river before it reaches its estuary this location has been flooded at least once each year until 2004 ayrault et al 2010 flood events were never recorded in our small watersheds during our year of survey and could explain part of the discrepancy as we are missing in our calculations all the material arriving during the flood events thus despite the increased use of ag nps consumer products benn and westerhoff 2008 farkas and thomas 2011 kaegi and burkhardt 2010 their contribution to the general flow is still limited i e 7 more long term surveys are needed to confirm this result 4 conclusion our results clearly demonstrate that material flow analysis models should generate export rates that are land use dependent in order to have improved predicting capabilities ag nps in three surface waters were found in the range of 1 5 107 to 2 3 109 particles l 1 at number concentration and 0 4 28 3 ng l 1 at mass concentration in addition some driving process factors and potential sources were identified by using correlations between ag nps concentrations and other parameters like the control of natural organic matters of ag nps in the forested water whereas various contributions and more complex process were found in agricultural and urban waters besides the export rate of ag nps from artificial agricultural and forested areas were respectively 5 5 3 0 0 5 0 3 and 0 2 0 2 g km 2 y 1 in addition our study also demonstrates that the dissolved compartment should be taken into account in material flow analysis and toxicity models since it is the most reactive as well as the most toxic future studies should be focused on high resolution samplings during a given specific month when climatic factor varies a lot and when farming and or hunting activities are active to better constrain the sources of the ag nps as well as their fluxes declaration of

17975,this study focused on surface waters from three small creeks within the seine river watershed which are characterized by different land uses namely forested agricultural and urban silver nanoparticles ag nps in these waters were detected and quantified by single particle icpms during one year of monthly sampling their temporal and spatial variations were investigated ag nps in the three types of surface water were found to range from 1 5 107 to 2 3 109 particles l 1 and from 0 4 to 28 3 ng l 1 at number and mass concentrations respectively these values are in consistent with the very few previous studies in addition the role of factors driving process and potential sources are discussed with correlations between ag nps concentrations and biogeochemical parameters like dissolved organic carbon concentration and divalent cations concentrations for the forested watershed nom controls the stability number and mass of the ag nps as recently observed in the field in lake water in germany in the case of the agricultural and urban watersheds major cations such as ca would control the number and mass of ag nps dilution processes are rejected as conductivity and cl ions do not show significant correlations with ag nps or other major geochemical parameters the specific exportation rates of ag nps for artificial agricultural and forested areas were calculated based on the monthly data for the full year and are equal to 5 5 3 0 0 5 0 3 and 0 2 0 2 gy 1km 2 respectively these data suggest a constant release of ag nps from consumer products into freshwaters in artificial areas for instance from textiles washing machines domestic tap water filters outdoor paints these first data of ag nps fluxes in surface waters of france enlarge the very limited database of field measurements moreover for the first time the influence of time land use and aquatic geochemistry parameters on ag nps in real natural water samples is reported it is also helpful to further understand the fate and the process of ag nps in natural waters as well as to the ecotoxicity studies in real world environment keywords silver nanoparticles surface water single particle icpms land use fate concentration 1 introduction the first report of silver colloids goes back to 130 years ago in 1889 lea 1889 for decades nanosilver was mostly used under different names collargol argyrol and protargol in therapeutic treatments nowack et al 2011 more recently the introduction and rapid development of nanotechnology opened up wider applications of silver nanoparticles including textiles cosmetics food packaging medical devices catalysts electronics biosensors moreover silver nanoparticles are reported by vance 2015 as the most frequently used nanomaterial and found in 435 consumer products 24 of total items in a more general way these silver nanoparticles may find their way into natural waters during their life cycle even though wastewater treatment plants wwtps are effective to remove silver nanoparticles nano sized silver silver sulfides were found in the effluent of wwtps wang et al 2018 for europe input rate via wwtp residues to soils is estimated 0 37 tons y 1 and 4 7 tons y 1 to large rivers wang et al 2018 in addition to anthropogenic sources silver nanoparticles could be also naturally formed from the silver ions in the water or in soils as recently reported by huang et al 2019 for soils and wimmer et al 2018 for fresh waters johnston et al 2010 have estimated for france an input of 11 tons y 1 of anthropogenic bulk silver from waste management to surface environments official registration in france recently reported 10 kg in 2017 r nano https www r nano fr that is a very small amount so we would not expect so see too much engineered nano ag in waters however using the data of wang et al 2018 for europe and downscaling it to france using europe and france populations as the scaling factor we can also estimate that 27 kg ag nano y 1 and 425 kg ag nano y 1 will be delivered to soils and waters respectively this extensive spreading of nano sized silver and the lack of information regarding their long term effect inevitably cause emerging concerns about their potential risks to aquatic ecosystems and or humans despite a long history of use more and more studies showed their adverse impacts on aquatic and terrestrial organisms mammalian cells and potentially on human health bian et al 2019 dobrzyńska and kruszewski 2014 gaillet and rouanet 2015 johnston et al 2010 musee 2010 modeled their possible toxicity to the aquatic ecosystems of the city of johannesburg with a risk quotient defined as the ratio of the estimated environmental exposure to the predicted no effect concentration mostly 1 the detection and quantification of nanosized silver from different sources ranging from engineered and incidental to natural ones in the environment and named from here and after ag nps is however quite limited because of their expected low concentrations and the biogeochemical complexity of aquatic ecosystems to circumvent this limitation material flow analysis models have been developed to predict environmental concentrations since 2007 boxall et al 2007 the modeled concentrations of ag nps in surface waters vary significantly from 0 008 to 619 ng l 1 depending on modeling parameters and studied sites dumont et al 2015 good et al 2016 gottschalk et al 2015 mueller and nowack 2008 musee 2010 o brien and cummins 2010 silva et al 2011 sun et al 2016 however these predictions are currently not validated due to the lack of field measurements in aquatic environments which also limits the further advancement of modeling in other domains such as their fate and toxicology in complex ecosystems there is thus an urgent need for frequent and robust measurements of ag nps concentrations on fluxes in continental surface waters a first issue is that to date only a limited number of studies are available on the quantification of ag nps in freshwaters some of them confirmed the presence of colloidal wen et al 1997 and more recently nano silver in wastewater effluent and river water mitrano et al 2012 peters et al 2018 yang et al 2016 however most studies either focus on one sampling site or several sites along the same river for which a single sampling is performed moreover those studies do not try to relate changes in concentration or size of ag nps to bulk geochemical parameters i e ph dissolved organic carbon concentration ionic strength redox of the aquatic ecosystems as for any other type of natural colloids benedetti et al 2003b ilina et al 2016 it is also expected that the ag nps flux will vary along the river and with the hydrological and climatic variations during the year this knowledge is critical to build better material flow analysis models that can take into account such variations if they exist and give outputs that can be compared to real field data like the one collected in this work the second issue is the identification in the field of the mechanisms and sources that could account for the variations of measured concentrations and fluxes of ag nps among different type of waters indeed most of the processes reported in literature are determined from laboratory experiments shevlin et al 2018 or small scale column experiments to understand the fate of ag nps in soils solutions and their migration towards continental waters yang et al 2014 this vast literature reports that organic matter om ph ionic strength redox conditions and the concentration of charged cations i e ca2 al3 are critical parameters that will control the number and size of ag nps in such designed experiments only recently wimmer et al 2018 showed that in field in lake water om promoted the formation of agnps these factors were also shown to be important for the fate of trace metals and contaminants in a watershed under a high anthropogenic pressure like the seine river bonnot et al 2016 the direct evidence from field data of the role played by such drivers is still missing it is therefore important to explore how they will be effectively related to changes in concentration size and flux of ag nps in river watersheds the third issue generally addressed in material flow analysis models but not in today published field studies is the impact of the land use within a watershed for instance for the whole seine river watershed an increase in trace metal concentrations from pristine headwaters to heavily impacted urban waters was reported chen et al 2014 grosbois et al 2006 horowitz et al 1999 with a significant impact of paris conurbation due to wastewater treatment plants and combined sewer overflow inputs estèbe et al 1997 estebe et al 1998 garban b ollivon d carru am 1996 in addition a recent field monitoring of ag nps was conducted on meuse and ijssel watersheds which are characterized by different land uses peters et al 2018 based on the measured concentrations of ag nps from this study a first order estimation of the ag nps normalized export rates can be calculated using an annual average discharge rate and watershed area source wikipedia 2018 we calculated the export rates normalized per km2 or per capita and they are equal to 0 3 g km 2y 1 1 mg ag nps capita 1y 1 and 2 0 g km 2y 1 6 mg ag nps capita 1y 1 for the meuse and ijssel rivers respectively using only the 10 kg of nano engineered year declared in the r nano database gives a rate of release equal to 0 15 mg ag nps y capita for france potential explanations for such differences in two rivers are their different processes governing the fate of the nps along the rivers course their differences in soils nature and in compositions and may be the most importantly their differences in land use for instance the meuse basin is comprised by croplands 39 forests 29 pastures 18 and built up areas 12 by the end of the 20th century lambert et al 2017 while rural areas characterize the ijssel watershed with intensive agricultural dominating with croplands covering 70 of the basin verwijmeren and wiering 2007 putting aside the obvious effect of the land use for the contaminants and ag nps sources mobilization one can wonder to what extent are the normalized fluxes of ag nps governed by the land use or if these fluxes are only regulated by the above mentioned biogeochemical drivers the answers to these questions will help to better constrain the hypothesis made in material flow analysis models they will also provide an accurate range of ag nps environmental concentrations in combination with realistic biogeochemical parameter values to be tested in future studies on ag nps toxicity toward aquatic fauna to address those issues the best approach is to sample waters from low to heavily human impacted territories and to precisely assess the seasonal dynamics of ag nps under such different land uses the present study relies on concentration analysis for the dissolved 1 kda and nano particulate silver in three characteristic sub basins i e forested agricultural and urban selected in a previous study on the identification of trace element geochemical background values in the seine river watershed bonnot et al 2016 small size sub watersheds 120 km2 were chosen as the water samples will be prone to rapid modifications of their biogeochemical parameters as a function of hydro climatic and land use changes in order to identify their role on the ag nps concentration and fate and to inter compare export rates specific to these three land uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and protocol the three sampling sites are located on the west of paris their lithology and land uses composed of artificial surfaces agricultural areas and natural areas are given in fig 1 detailed information on the watersheds area distribution of land uses and discharge rates as measured during this study are given in table s1 a snapshot of the water geochemistry was obtained by grab sampling of the three creek waters taken each month or each two months from october 2016 to december 2017 for ag nps detection using 1 l polyethylene containers before field sampling the containers were previously washed with 1 n hcl for 2 days then rinsed three times with mq water in the laboratory on each sampling site one 1 l bottle was placed horizontally at the surface about 10 cm of creek until filled by water and it was done within 5 10 s depending of the flow rate for the urban watershed the water was collected from a bridge with a bucket and the 1 l bottle filed directly with the bucket in less than 5 s to evaluate the sampling effect three additional samplings were performed for each sampling site during three field missions sampling replicates were individually analyzed to evaluate the contribution of sampling to the overall uncertainty the sampling effect was evaluated by performing anova test for water sampling replicates and was not significant the ph dissolved oxygen and conductivity were measured in the field using multi 3410 multiparameter meter the sensors and electrodes were calibrated before field measurements in the lab and the calibration verified in the field prior to measurements various sub aliquots were filtered in the field through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate for analysis of the dissolved anions non acidified and cations acidified triplicate sub samples were acidified with 65 hno3 for trace elements and rare earth elements analysis glass vials previously washed with acid rinsed and pyrolyzed at 500 c were used to store samples for the analysis of dissolved organic carbon doc obtained from another aliquot filtered through 0 7 μm glass microfiber filters and acidified with 85 h3po4 all containers and materials used for sampling were rinsed three times with river waters in the field before collection unacidified unfiltered sub samples were immediately analyzed back to laboratory for alkalinity determination and all the others above mentioned samples were stocked at 4 c prior to analysis the alkalinity was measured by titration with 10 2 mol l 1 hcl titrando 809 metrohm the doc was analyzed with a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimazu the anions were quantified with ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 thermo scientific the cations were analyzed with an icp aes icap 6200 series thermo scientific so called dissolved i e 0 22 μm and 1 kda trace element concentrations were determined with a hr icp ms element ii thermo scientific and the raw data were treated with ufreasi software tharaud et al 2015 immediately after field sampling in the laboratory an aliquot 500 ml of the bulk 1 l sample taken for ag nps analysis was ultra filtered through 1 kda regenerated cellulose in order to remove all the particles present in waters to get access to the fraction of free ag ions and ag bound to organic matter or associated to nanoparticles smaller than a few nanometers 1 3 nm guo and santschi 2007 this ultra filtrate was further used as the matrix to prepare all standards and solutions for sp icpms analysis it aims at conserving the same environment of ag nps in waters and avoiding matrix effect during measurement 2 1 1 digestion of bulk water additionally in 2019 the total silver was quantified after acid digestion in 9 samples which came from the urban watershed a sub sample of 10 ml was taken for total silver analysis in triplicates and mineralized with a mixture of 3 concentrated acids 3 ml hcl 1 ml hno3 and 0 5 ml hf in a pfa closed vessel and heated for 24 h at 105 c after the digestion the mixture was evaporated at 85 c to dryness the residue was then dissolved in 10 ml of 2 hno3 blanks were run at the same time in triplicates and pfa vessels were cleaned with a concentrated hno3 at 120 c before use and rinsed 3 times with mq water 2 2 single particles icpms sp icpms measurements of ag nps 2 2 1 instrumental parameter and standard preparation a high resolution icpms thermo scientific element ii was used for ag nps measurements in this study it was joined with a quartz cyclonic spray chamber and a pfa microflow nebulizer the peristaltic pump rate was set at 12 rpm generating a sample uptake flow of 0 2 ml min 1 certified reference material au nanoparticles of 60 nm rm8013 nist was used to determine sample loss during sample uptake ca transport efficiency the au np stock suspension was diluted 2 5 105 times in the ultra filtered matrix to achieve a proper particle concentration for sp icpms measurements and avoid nps coincidence at milli second dwell time dissolved calibration curves au 50 5000 ng l 1 ag 50 1000 ng l 1 were prepared in the ultra filtered matrix to determine the element sensitivity in the same matrix as the water samples and thus prevent matrix effect the analysis of ag nps in river waters was carried out with 1 ms dwell time and 1 ms settling time tharaud et al 2017 10 000 data points were acquired and the isotope 107ag and 197au were measured in low resolution mode and each measurement was performed in triplicate which allows to calculate means and standard deviations the dilution of the natural water samples was unnecessary considering the expected low concentrations in natural waters all suspensions and solutions were freshly prepared with the minimum delay between sampling and analysis 2 2 2 data processing according to the literature the transport efficiency te is needed to determine the concentration and size of ag nps in river waters and can be obtained by three methods based on 1 waste collection 2 particle size and 3 particle frequency pace et al 2011 here the second method is selected since the reference material used in this study is better certified for the particle size than the particle concentration taking into account the matrix effect te was determined independently for each type of river water the calculation method and the formula of te are detailed in the supplementary materials before data processing can be performed nps must be correctly distinguished from the dissolved background different methods exist to determine the threshold between dissolved and particulate fractions such as average plus 3σ pace et al 2012 iterative algorithms with 3σ tuoriniemi and hassellöv 2012 or simply by using the first minimum as the boundary between dissolved fraction and nps montaño et al 2014 however for the size range expected for ag nps peters et al 2018 those approaches could lead to a large number of false negatives during nps counting i e underestimation of the representative number of nps events instead we used in this study another approach to prevent such artifacts the subtraction method it is analogous to the deconvolution method cornelis and hassellöv 2014 but uses the ultra filtered natural waters as the blank because the ultra filtrate was supposed to best represent the realistic dissolved background in case of natural water samples basically the histogram of frequency vs intensity of the ultra filtrate through 1 kda is subtracted from that of the raw water sample using the same bin width same range of intensity for each bin of both histograms the resulting histogram is then used to calculate the concentration and size of ag nps calculations of particle number concentration from the signal frequency and of particle size from the signal intensity are well described in literature here we used the procedure developed by pace and co workers pace et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 ag nps concentrations in three waters first of all ag nps are detected in all waters sampled throughout the year the concentrations range their average and their size and the results of previous studies are summarized in table 1 the presence of ag nps can be directly observed by comparing the signal of raw water and the matrix blank with all particles removed i e filtrate through 1 kda fig s1 ag nps number concentrations range from 1 5 107 to 2 3 109 particles l 1 with an average of 9 1 108 particles l 1 their mass concentrations are in the range of 0 4 28 3 ng l 1 with an average of 7 9 ng l 1 compared with the scare database of ag nps in surface waters table 1 the particle number concentrations found here are in a larger range and the average is 100 times higher than that of dutch rivers peters et al 2018 it mostly results from the different data processing approach applied the subtraction method in our study allows to better constrain the false negatives where the small ag nps are counted as the dissolved background regarding the mass concentration our results cover the concentration range of the recent study in surface waters of netherland they are in agreement with previous measurements of colloidal ag in texas rivers moreover from the modeling view ag nps are expected in surface waters between 0 04 and 619 ng l 1 table 1 our measured concentrations are within this global range but a bit higher than most estimations for europe 0 002 2 3 ng l 1 dumont and williams 2015 however the existence of naturally occurring ag nps is not included in the concentration estimation by modeling resulting in an underestimation in that case also for now the challenges raised by all modeling studies in natural rivers come from the complex transformations undergone by silver nanoparticles on one hand and their interactions with environmental components on the other hand thus the field data obtained here will constitute a strong constraint to better refine the possible control factors in surface waters among the three waters in this study the largest ag nps amount is found in the urban site with an average concentration of 1 2 109 particle l 1 and of 12 3 ng l 1 table 1 ag nps mass concentrations in agricultural and forested waters are very close considering the significant variations measured over the year however the forested water has a higher particle number concentration than the agricultural water this is mainly ascribed to their different size populations of ag nps table 1 the size might be related to the water geochemistry affecting processes of ag nps in this environment which is to be discussed in more details in following sections monthly sampling was performed on each catchment to investigate temporal variations of the ag nps concentration over the year the particle number concentrations are presented in fig 2 it shows that the flux in the urban site is quite constant throughout the whole year but the two other sites have larger temporal variations since average annual water flows are 22 9 l s and 51 27 l s for the forested and agricultural creeks respectively the larger variations in water flow rates reported for the agricultural and the forested sites account therefore for the temporal variability showed in fig 2 indeed forested and agricultural sites as small watersheds react very quickly to the climatic and hydrological effects whereas the urban watershed of greater size has diverse contributions mixture of artificial agricultural and natural areas and its concentration variation can thus be slighter over time additionally an increase of ag nps from winter to spring is observed for forested and agricultural waters the dissolved silver 1 kda is also quantified by sp icpms in order to investigate the speciation of silver in three natural waters the signal intensity in counts per second of ultra filtered samples is converted into ng l 1 using the dissolved ag sensitivity calibration curve fig 3 shows the concentrations of dissolved and nano ag in three waters it should be noted that values under the limit of quantification 2 5 ng l 1 are not discussed here for most forested watershed water samples more nano silver is measured than dissolved this is in agreement with results of delay et al 2011 showing that nom significantly influences the particle size distribution the stability and the surface properties of ag nps in the aqueous phase preventing it further dissolution and that in presence nom ag nps suspensions are also stable at variable ionic strength which will facilitate their transport in addition it was recently shown that natural organic matter content i e 10 mgl 1 nom in lake water encourage the natural silver based nanoparticle formation wimmer et al 2018 however in agricultural and urban waters the distribution changes from one sampling period to another no conclusion has been made for these two sites in which the transformation of silver is more complex and may be controlled by multiple parameters and processes size and coating of ag nps ph doc is dissolved oxygen light irradiation biofilm desmau et al 2018 shevlin et al 2018 the total silver quantified in 2019 after acid digestion of the 9 remaining samples from the urban watershed are given in table s4 the total amount of ag is higher than the addition of nanosized and dissolved fractions in almost all urban waters except the sample of 2016 11 30 this is most probably related to the ageing water samples since those samples were stored in the refrigerator with no prior acidification for two or three years part of the silver may have been lost to the container wall besides when eliminating sample of 2016 11 30 the average of percentage of measured ag nano dissolved is equal to 70 it means that a part of ag is incorporated in larger particles or aggregates not detected by sp icpms 3 2 field mechanisms and the sources accounting for the variations of measured concentrations correlation between elements and ag nps concentrations i e number or mass can be interpreted within a mass balance approach or as the identification of driving parameter or process for small watersheds benedetti et al 2003a all related data in the following discussion ph doc conductivity is and elements concentrations in the dissolved fraction are detailed in supplementary material tables s2 and s3 the correlation between two variants is considered statistically significant when r 2 0 6 and p value 0 01 there is a positive correlation between doc concentrations and ag nps concentrations in forested water fig 4 and s2 this strong correlation reflects the control of the natural organic matter nom on the number and the mass of ag nps the more nom the more ag nps are detected in forested water samples this trend is explained by two combined effects stabilization and reduction the stabilization effect of nom humic and fulvic acids on ag nps has been described in several studies topuz and talinli 2015 yu et al 2018 zhang and jiang 2017 wimmer et al 2018 huang et al 2019 high nom concentration inhibits the dissolution and aggregations of ag nps when released into surface waters thus making ag nps more persistent in such natural matrices the formation of ag nps through reduction of ag by nom can also lead to the increase of ag nps concentration along with nom akaighe et al 2011 sal nikov et al 2009 yin et al 2012a wimmer et al 2018 as reported in fig 3 there is a large reservoir of dissolved ag either as free ag or ag bound to nom to justify the potential increase of ag nps by this process for the agricultural and urban watersheds no significant trends between doc and ag nps number or mass concentrations were found this lack of trend does not mean that similar processes are not at work but that the smaller range of nom concentrations variations δnom 2 2 mg l 1 and 1 7 mg l 1 versus 5 7 mg l 1 for agricultural and urban versus forested watersheds respectively prevented the building of a reliable correlation moreover other potential processes which work more efficiently might be operating in those two watersheds indeed we found that the particle number concentration and the equivalent size for sphere of ag nps correlate negatively with conductivity and positively with ca concentration in agricultural and urban water samples respectively figs 5 and 6 this means that ag nps number concentration decreases with increasing charged ions concentration in the aquatic media the agricultural and urban waters have higher concentrations of charged ions while their average particle size is significantly higher than ag nps from the forested waters table 1 the charge induced aggregation and even sedimentation of silver nanoparticles has been reported in simplified natural systems with the presence of calcium ions topuz et al 2014 these aggregates will interact with colloids or induce further sedimentation labille et al 2015 thus escape from the top layer sampling since the sampling river surfaces are quite small and water column is shallow 0 3 m in the case of the agricultural water samples the lack of increase in size with ca2 could be due to fast sedimentation or formation of nanoparticles outside the range of our analytical detection window considering negative correlation between ag nps concentration and conductivity together with size growing with ca2 content we can conclude that in the charge abundant river the aggregation or even sedimentation is favorable and the fate is more controlled by charge determining ions such as divalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 or al3 in extreme conditions with very low ph another explanation for this correlation is that the observed changes are related to variable inputs of different sources with time for instance the urban watershed is partly covered by agricultural land but the differences in bulk geochemistry especially for major ions are not that large for a single river table s3 and cannot totally explain the observed trend however correlations can also help to identify sources of elements and colloids benedetti et al 2003a for instance for the forested site water samples there is a strong correlation between the ag nps mass concentration and trace elements zr y la and ce in the fraction 0 22 μm two examples are given in fig 7 and s3 zr is often considered as a geological background indicator because of its limited mobilization under most environmental conditions aja et al 1995 hodson 2002 as for la and ce their speciation is generally controlled by natural organic matter sonke 2006 which explains their good correlation with ag nps number and mass concentrations moreover the ce la ratio is equal to 1 9 0 1 for all water samples in the forested watershed this value is equal to the geochemical background value of 1 9 given for french soils and suspended matter sediments reimann et al 2018 thus silver nanoparticles in forest water are very likely to be of natural origin in addition to the natural leaching from bedrock qi et al 2007 other potential pathways of naturally occurring ag containing nps include the reduction of dissolved ag by natural organic matter akaighe et al 2011 sal nikov et al 2009 yin et al 2012a wimmer et al 2018 the oxidation and reduction of macroscale ag objects qi et al 2007 and biological processes klaus et al 1999 kroll et al 2014 moreover the stability of ag nps in the environment could be enhanced by surface sulfidation levard et al 2011 via interactions with extracellular polymeric substances eps kroll et al 2014 li et al 2016 and with noms topuz and talinli 2015 yu et al 2018 zhang and jiang 2017 present in the natural matrix le pape et al 2012 identified antimony sb as a typical anthropogenic element in the orge river catchment very close to our sampled watersheds they concluded that sb was of anthropogenic origin and carried by organic matter or sulfur containing species in the agricultural watershed we have a good correlation between sb and ag nps number concentration fig 8 this could mean that both elements were trapped in or carried by the same species organic matter or sulfur containing species could originate from biosolids recycled from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and used as fertilizers and soil amendments healy et al 2016 del real et al 2016 le pape et al 2012 several studies have confirmed the release of ag nps in the effluent of wwtps at the level from 12 ng l 1 up to 100 ng l 1 li et al 2013 mitrano et al 2012 an historical pollution for sb and as as well as ag is reported and well known in the seine river watershed ayrault et al 2010 le cloarec et al 2011 we cannot exclude this old source that because of its dispersion via the atmosphere all over the catchment has probably reached the agricultural watershed under investigation therefore it suggests that silver nanoparticles in agricultural water would be of anthropogenic origin in the case of urban river water samples no clear correlations with the previously mentioned drivers such as organic matter or trace elements issued from anthropogenic activities are reported a recent evaluation on historical trace pollutants load sb ag ni cu zn as pb in the seine river watershed reports lower values in sediments reflecting the progressive decontamination of the catchment le gall et al 2018 thus new source of silver such as biocidal plastics and textiles vance 2015 are uncorrelated to those historical trace pollutant elements as seen in this study in addition the mixed contribution of three type of waters forested 19 agricultural 44 and artificial 37 makes complex the interpretation of the source identification especially in the case of small watersheds that promptly react to hydrological and environmental changes a weak trend is observed between ag nps number concentration and the temperature of the sampling river r 2 0 48 p 0 0377 the higher the temperature the higher the number of ag nps temperature and sunlight affects the reductive formation of ag nps yin et al 2014 2012b in summer warmer water temperature months increased exposition to uv light would promote the reduction of ag by organic compounds leading to higher ag nps concentrations badireddy et al 2014 odzak et al 2017 yin et al 2015 similar enhanced process by sunlight takes place for the reduction formation ag nps by natural eps components kroll et al 2014 they thus result in the persistence of ag nps in sunlight waters the issue of the land use effect is still standing even after identifying potential sources for the forested watershed samples natural and the agricultural watershed contamination calculation of normalized fluxes of ag nps that can be obtained by the combination of the monthly water discharge data and the respective area of the three watersheds may help to evidence clear differences between each of the studied sites 3 3 effect of land use on exportation fluxes the measured normalized in km 2 y 1 export rate for ag nps and dissolved silver are given in fig 9 it is clear in this figure that the flux from the urban site is the highest for nano and dissolved silver if the monthly export rates of ag nps are averaged an annual export rate of 2 3 1 3 g km 2 y 1 is obtained this value is ten times higher than the export rate calculated for the agricultural and forested watersheds whose respective values are 0 4 0 3 and 0 2 0 2 g km 2 y 1 the difference between the urban site and the two others is also seen for dissolved ag export rates that are respectively equal to 2 6 3 1 0 6 0 5 and 0 2 0 1 g km 2 y 1 for urban agricultural and forested sites these large difference cannot be due to due to the constant release of ag nps from consumer products into freshwaters as reported in several studies benn and westerhoff 2008 mitrano et al 2014 farkas and thomas 2011 aznar et al 2017 kaegi and burkhardt 2010 the amount of nanosized silver registered in the r nano french declaration of use or production site https www r nano fr is equal to 10 kg in 2017 and was equal to 1 kg in 2013 in addition for france in the https www nanotechproject org cpi data base of products with nano sized silver only 33 products are listed another approach is to use the data of wang et al 2018 for europe and downscale it to france using europe and france population as the scaling factor we can estimate that 27 kg ag nano y 1 i e 0 042 g km 2 y 1 and 425 kg ag nano y 1 i e 0 66 g km 2 y 1 could be delivered to soils and waters respectively these are very small numbers for the french territory other sources of ag nps must be found to account for the fluxes in all three watersheds in table s4 we have compiled the known input data of bulk ag and nano ag to soils for the world europe france and switzerland with available data from johnston et al 2010 muller and novack 2008 and wang et al 2018 we can clearly see that bulk ag issued mostly from wwtps represents a much bigger source of ag to soils and consequently to rivers or aquatic ecosystems than the input of nano ag wang et al 2018 material flow analysis expressed in mass per capita per year or in mass per km2 per year relies on land use or product use to simulate concentrations of ag nps in aquatic systems as two of the three watersheds are experiencing different land uses i e forestry agricultural practices and artificial areas we can recalculate the actual specific export rate of ag nps for agricultural practices and artificial areas the forested watershed 0 2 0 2 g km 2 y 1 or 80 mg capita 1 y 1 is one end member that will allow the calculation of the agricultural end member since the agricultural basin is only covered by those two types of activities i e 72 agriculture and 22 forestry the calculated rate of export of ag nps is therefore equal to 0 5 0 3 g km 2 y 1 or 5 mg capita 1 y 1 for land only used for agricultural purposes now the same calculation can be done for the artificial areas using the urban watershed data i e 37 artificial areas 44 agriculture 19 forestry the calculated rate of export of ag nps is therefore equal to 5 5 3 0 g km 2 y 1 or 3 mg capita 1 y 1 for artificial areas considering the large uncertainties due to the high variability of ag nps concentrations along the year for artificial land and agricultural practices we can conclude that both activities generate the same amounts of ag nps expressed in mg capita 1 y 1 the highest of all being the forested watershed i e 80 mg capita 1 y 1vs 5 mg capita 1 y 1 the major characteristic of forested watershed is that its lithology corresponds to a sandy soil vs carbonated soils for the other watersheds and that it is richer in carbon in the top soil bonnot 2015 recent studies have shown that soils organic matter could significantly contribute to the formation of silver nanoparticles in soils huang et al 2019 the low number of inhabitants and the favored production of ag nps by soils organic matter would account for this higher number the origin of the ag nps for the agricultural and urban watersheds is probably different from the geochemical background and is from anthropogenic origin since in the seine river watershed biosolids were and are used on agricultural land buzier et al 2011 thévenot et al 2007 artificial areas will generate the highest flux of ag nps by more than one order of magnitude compared to the two other land uses when expressed in g km 2 y 1 the corine land cover map updated in 2006 can be used to calculate the total ag nps annual export for the entire catchment of the seine river i e 78650 km2 using two end members an urban one corresponding to 13 of the total catchment ag nps 5 5 3 0 g km 2 y 1 and an average value corresponding to the agricultural and forested end members which represents the rest of the land use in the catchment ag nps 0 4 0 3 g km 2 y 1 the calculated flux is equal to 80 51 kg y 1 corresponding to a release per capita of 4 mg capita 1 y 1 the urban source representing 56 30 kgy 1 the same calculation can be done for the dissolved fraction of ag with the same hypothesis the dissolved flux of ag is 94 50 kg y 1 with the urban source representing 64 30 kg y 1 in total a flux of 174 kg y 1 of silver would be exported from the catchment dissolved and nano this flux is much smaller than the particulate flux calculated by ayrault equal to 1700 kgy 1 in 2003 ayrault et al 2010 corresponding to a flux of 85 mg capita 1 y 1 table s4 data show a huge input to soils of bulk silver in france compared to the nano silver whatever the units used and suggest that the difference between our seine river flux and the one from ayrault et al 2010 could be due to a missing source input not captured by our 3 watersheds but existing at the scale of the larger seine river watershed for instance the cause could be higher inputs of biosolids from wwtps on agricultural land thevenot et al 2007 buzier et al 2011 since we do not have the mass of biosolids that are actually spread over the lands in our three sites in addition the data from ayrault et al 2010 was calculated with data from sediments of two cores about 100 km downstream of paris draining 96 of the seine river basin and are located within the last major meander of the seine river before it reaches its estuary this location has been flooded at least once each year until 2004 ayrault et al 2010 flood events were never recorded in our small watersheds during our year of survey and could explain part of the discrepancy as we are missing in our calculations all the material arriving during the flood events thus despite the increased use of ag nps consumer products benn and westerhoff 2008 farkas and thomas 2011 kaegi and burkhardt 2010 their contribution to the general flow is still limited i e 7 more long term surveys are needed to confirm this result 4 conclusion our results clearly demonstrate that material flow analysis models should generate export rates that are land use dependent in order to have improved predicting capabilities ag nps in three surface waters were found in the range of 1 5 107 to 2 3 109 particles l 1 at number concentration and 0 4 28 3 ng l 1 at mass concentration in addition some driving process factors and potential sources were identified by using correlations between ag nps concentrations and other parameters like the control of natural organic matters of ag nps in the forested water whereas various contributions and more complex process were found in agricultural and urban waters besides the export rate of ag nps from artificial agricultural and forested areas were respectively 5 5 3 0 0 5 0 3 and 0 2 0 2 g km 2 y 1 in addition our study also demonstrates that the dissolved compartment should be taken into account in material flow analysis and toxicity models since it is the most reactive as well as the most toxic future studies should be focused on high resolution samplings during a given specific month when climatic factor varies a lot and when farming and or hunting activities are active to better constrain the sources of the ag nps as well as their fluxes declaration of

17976,urban disaster response requires disposal of complex wastes this study regards a case wherein high intensity rainfall fell over a remote mountainous area previously burned by wildfire generating debris flows that devastated a downstream town sanitary sewers and homes with septic systems were damaged releasing human waste into the debris flow field contaminated sediments with their high fecal indicator bacteria fib concentrations were cleared from public rights of way and creek channels by local authorities then disposed onto distant goleta beach for beach nourishment causing immediate surf zone microbiological water quality exceedances to determine potential public health threats disposed sediments and surf zone waters were sampled and analyzed relative to reference samples of mountain soil and raw sewage for fib pathogens human hf183 and other host gull2 taqman and dogbact associated dna based fecal markers and bacterial community 16s rrna gene sequences approximately 20

bacterial sequences that were shared with disposed sediments and sewage yet surf zone bacterial communities returned to mostly marine clades within weeks taken together multiple conventional and dna

environmental challenges brown et al 2011 for debris flows those challenges include how to safely dispose of contaminated sediments while minimizing degradation of the receiving locations under non disaster situations freshwater or marine sediments from reservoirs or harbors respectively may be dredged classified to remove large debris and rocks and the sandy portions deposited onto coastal beaches for physical restoration called beach nourishment ludka et al 2018 targusi et al 2019 conceptually de vincenzo et al 2019 and practically california department of boating and waterways and state coastal conservancy 2002 u s army corps of engineers 2007 sediments for beach nourishment should match the particle size distributions of the receiving beach and the percentage of sediment fines should be less than 20 rippy et al 2013 because trace elements pit et al 2017 and fecal indicator bacteria fib such as enterococcus rippy et al 2013 associate with fine sediment debris flows triggered by rainfall are common in coastal mountain ranges degraff et al 2009 often where beach nourishment occurs however the implications of disposing of debris flow sediments by beach nourishment are not well studied and therefore difficult to anticipate during urgent decision making this research examines montecito ca where intense rainfall triggered catastrophic debris flows emanating from a mountain range that was previously burned by a major wildfire sewer pipes were broken by the flows and homes with septic systems were damaged or destroyed therefore human waste with fib and other microorganisms was mixed with debris flow sediments public rights of way and creeks became clogged with sediments that were found to be contaminated with fib kryszak 2018 cleared sediments were transported for disposal onto nearby goleta beach where surf zone fib concentrations spiked after disposal santa barbara county public health department 2018 goleta beach had previously been nourished using sediments that were dredged from upstream creeks for flood control however in january 2018 beach nourishment was an emergency response using fib contaminated sediments that potentially contained human waste from montecito fib can derive from many fecal sources such as birds goodwin et al 2016 dogs ervin et al 2014 and human fecal material which is relatively hazardous to swimmers soller et al 2017 to examine possible human waste in sediments disposed to goleta beach and reveal the impact of such disposal on surf zone microbiological water quality a field study was conducted including

sourcetracker knights et al 2011 have also been successfully applied to attribute water body contamination to a variety of fecal sources ahmed et al 2015 staley et al 2018 in this study samples were thus analyzed for fib pathogens salmonella and human adenovirus human and other host associated dna fecal markers and bacterial community composition by dna sequencing similar measurements were made for reference samples of the soils in the debris flow source areas and of untreated sewage from the montecito sanitary district the qualities of surf zone waters prior to during and after sediment disposal were compared to one another modeling was used to relate the human waste reference sewage fecal content to fecal indicator measures in field samples modeling was also used to simulate the influences of fecal contamination introduced into the surf zone by disposed sediments as they translocated from on to offshore the results indicated a human waste contamination cascade beginning with damaged sanitary infrastructure releasing human waste into the debris flow field continuing with contaminated sediments trucked to and disposed of on goleta beach and ending with contaminated sediment transport into the surf zone human waste contamination was prevalent in the surf zone during the early sediment disposal period but surf zone bacterial communities returned to more typical marine compositions within weeks of the cessation of disposal 2 materials and methods 2 1 study context and background the december 2017 thomas fire the largest wildfire to date in california burned a mountainous landscape above the town of montecito subsequently january 9 2018 an intense rainfall over the burned area slurried mountain soil that mobilized rocks boulders and vegetation into a debris flow kean et al 2019 devastating the downstream town appendix a fig a 1 a 3 and damaging community sewers fig a 3 and homes with septic systems over weeks approximately january 12 february 20 2018 the sediments from public rights of way and creeks were excavated sorted and then disposed to two beaches including goleta beach located 23 km to the west fig a 1 approximately 31 200 m3 of sediment were disposed to goleta beach spencer 2018 from january 13 14 2018 sediments from ten montecito debris flow field locations were sampled by others and analyzed for total coliform and escherichia coli across these samples total coliform and e coli averaged 53 800 5 682 and 22 883 4 217 mpn g sediment respectively kryszak 2018 falling within the upper end of ranges across many studies of sediment fecal contamination pachepsky and shelton 2011 the montecito sanitary district msd reported locations of sewer damage montecito sanitary district 2018 but spilled sewage volumes were unknown while some homes in the affected area used septic systems information about septage spills was not available thus the human waste spilled into debris flow sediments was not directly estimable although neither the debris flow source areas nor the debris flow fields are agricultural appendix a fig a 2 there may be wildlife pets and some privately stabled horses in the debris flow field areas regardless sediments destined for goleta beach were excavated from areas of sanitary infrastructure damage or downstream of those areas and thus the disposed sediments were likely contaminated with human waste 2 2 sites sampling sample processing and physicochemical analyses beach disposal of sediments occurred continuously from january 12 to february 20 2018 disposed sediment and surf zone water samples were collected on every weekday during january 18 26 and then on mondays wednesdays and fridays during january 29 february 28 approximately one week after the end of disposal from january 18 to february 19 2018 17 disposed sediment samples and 51 goleta beach surf zone water samples were collected and processed for analyzing fib host associated fecal dna markers bacterial communities and selected pathogens details in appendix a on each sampling day water samples were collected at three surf zone sites surrounding the sediment disposal area and one composite sediment sample was taken from the sediment disposal area inland from the swash zone appendix a fig a 4 similar sampling continued for 4 days after sediment disposal stopped on february 20 2018 except that since no new sediment was being disposed sand underlying the disposal site above the mean tideline was sampled approximately 2 months later during may june 2018 18 surf zone water and 6 beach sand samples were collected over 6 days to follow post disposal fib trends at the 2018 surf zone sampling locations and in beach sand at sampling location g04 tables b 1 and b 2 fig a 4 additionally 9 intertidal beach sand samples and 65 surf zone water samples which had been collected from may october 2017 using identical methods were used as pre event controls for comparison to 2018 tables b 1

total organic carbon toc methods in appendix a soils representing source materials that had formed the debris flows were sampled from the overlooking mountains appendix a fig a 6 raw sewage representative of the human fecal source was sampled on each of 4 days in july 2018 from the msd wwtp these mountain soil and sewage samples were reference materials for the disposed sediment bacterial communities the soil was also a reference for sediment texture and toc content and the sewage was also a reference for human associated fib pathogens and human associated dna markers soil and sewage samples were processed similarly to disposed sediments and surf zone waters appendix a 2 3 fib measurement public agency data of surf zone fib concentrations at goleta beach for the weeks preceding during and following the debris flow were available santa barbara county public health department 2018 here fib were quantified for sewage and surf zone waters using defined substrate culture methods according to the manufacturer s instructions idexx westbrook me as described before ervin et al 2014 surf zone fib exceedances were evaluated by comparing measurements to california single sample ab411 criteria for total coliform 10000 mpn 100 ml e coli 400 mpn 100 ml and enterococci 104 mpn 100 ml california department of health services 2000 for mountain soil samples disposed sediments and beach sands approximately 5 g exact mass recorded of solid sample was suspended in 25 ml of sterile 0 2 hexametaphosphate sigma aldrich usa shaken for 5 min and settled for 1 min supernatant 10 ml was collected and analyzed for fib similarly to water samples assuming fib in sediments were particle associated the fib concentration for each sample was normalized to the solid sample dry mass which was calculated using the associated measured gravimetric moisture content 2 4 dna extraction qpcr and ddpcr water and sewage samples were split and filtered through either 0 22

μm hawp filters millipore burlington ma for pathogen tests salmonella ttr gene human adenovirus dna extraction was performed using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen carol stream il for the 0 22 μm supor filters following the manufacturer s protocol the 0 45 μm hawp filters for pathogen tests were extracted using the rneasy powerwater kit qiagen following the manufacturer s protocol except for omitting dnase to allow eluting dna plus rna the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen carol stream il was used to extract dna from sediment sand and soil samples duplicate extractions were performed for each solid sample the extracted dna eluates were pooled an extraction blank without any sample was included in each batch dna concentrations were quantified using the quant it dsdna broad range assay kit invitrogen carlsbad ca on a cytation3 cell imaging multi mode reader biotek instruments inc winooski vt extracted dna was stored at 20 c prior to analysis besides human waste or mountain soil it was possible that canines or birds owing to their frequent presence in the vicinity of goleta beach could have introduced fecal contamination and thus fib into disposed sediments there are no agricultural land uses in the area fig a 2 and thus no livestock fecal sources horse fecal contamination was assumed to not be significant given the few private horse stables near the debris flow depositional areas human dog and gull fecal materials were assessed in the disposed sediments and human fecal material was also evaluated in the surf zone using qpcr assay details in appendix a with hf183 as the human associated fecal marker bernhard and field 2000 green et al 2014 dogbact as the dog marker dick et al 2005 sinigalliano et al 2010 and gull2taqman as the gull fecal marker lu et al 2008 sinigalliano et al 2010 these host associated markers were selected based on their prior performance boehm et al 2013 the entero1a assay haugland et al 2005 2012 was used to quantify enterococci in all samples in units of cell equivalents c eq per 100 ml by assuming 6 ribosomal rna copies for enterococcus oana et al 2002 the ttr gene was used to quantify salmonella spp as a bacterial pathogen in the surf zone samples malorny et al 2004 qpcr assays were performed using the taqman environmental master mix life technologies grand island ny on a bio rad cfx96 real time pcr detection system hercules ca with a no template negative control no dna sample included on each plate dna containing qpcr targeted sequences was serially diluted to generate standard curves for each qpcr assay sample inhibition was assessed by comparing sample internal amplification control iac results from the hf183 assay to the calculated interference and competition thresholds green et al 2014 extracted filter blanks and extraction blanks were analyzed to assess contamination during sample filtration and dna extraction all samples blanks and standards were analyzed in triplicate samples with two or more replicates amplifying within the range of the standard curve were considered to be within the range of quantification roq and were quantified samples with two or more replicates amplifying below the lowest standard were considered detected but not quantifiable dnq and samples with one or zero replicates amplifying were considered not detected nd as described previously ervin et al 2014 all individual qpcr plates had efficiencies between 86 and 99 with an r2 of 0 97 human adenovirus hadv was quantified using ddpcr details in appendix a with a bio rad qx200 droplet digital pcr system hercules ca as previously published steele et al 2018 2 5 bacterial community sequencing and analysis genes encoding 16s rrna were sequenced using dna that had been extracted and archived from representative 2018 samples appendix a of surf zone waters disposed sediments raw sewage and mountain soils table b 3 dna was also sequenced for samples collected during the pre disposal period of june october 2017 for these samples dna had been extracted and archived using protocols identical to those herein the 2017 pre disposal samples were from five representative goleta beach surfzone and nearshore marine water nine beach sand and two representative nearshore sediment samples the details of amplification and purification were published previously li et al 2017 except that the 27f forward primer 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and the 534r reverse primer 5 attaccgcggctgctgg 3 which target the v1 v3 region of genes encoding 16s rrna oh et al 2014 were used here as with the qpcr reactions filter blanks extraction blanks and no template controls were used as negative controls during pcr amplification amplification products were purified with agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter genomics and quality checked using the agilent tapestation the nextera xt index kit was used to attach dual indices and illumina sequencing adapters to amplicons after purification with ampure xp beads and quality checking using tapestation amplicons were normalized and pooled before paired end sequencing on the illumina miseq platform with a miseq v3 600 cycle kit 2 by 300 bp in the california nanosystems institute cnsi university of california santa barbara the sequencing data were deposited with ncbi as bioproject id prjna558958 sequences were processed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v 1 9 1 pipeline with default settings caporaso et al 2010 paired end reads were assembled with a minimum 100 base pair bp overlap the minimum sequence length was set to 460 bp after quality filtering 22 048 747 sequences were obtained for 55 samples with the number of sequences for each sample ranging from 205 863 to 609 945 sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence similarity representative sequences for each otu were picked and taxonomic data were assigned using the greengenes 13 8 aligned reference database possible chimeric sequences were checked with the chimeraslayer wrapper in qiime the shannon diversity index was calculated in qiime raw sequences for each sample were also processed and aligned through the 16spip pipeline against a human pathogen 16s rrna sequence database consisting of 29 258 sequences representing 346 bacterial species miao et al 2017 the bwa mem algorithm was utilized for sequence alignment and the sequences with similarity higher than 99 to reference sequences were identified as taxa of potential human health concern opportunistic human pathogens identified in the sequences such as bacteroides fragilis aeromonas hydrophila acinetobacter lwoffii and citrobacter freundii could have originated from soil or marine water and so were excluded from the results 2 6 statistical analyses and bioinformatics sourcetracker analysis was performed to allocate the disposed sediment bacterial community sequences according to their similarities to reference sequences from mountain soil and raw sewage using sourcetracker 1 0 https github com danknights sourcetracker releases with default parameters and with the otu tables from the qiime pipeline as input following the instructions available online sourcetracker was also used to relate the disposed sediment as a bacterial community source to the surf zone as a sink for each set of source and sink samples average predicted source proportions and rsd values were obtained by running sourcetracker in triplicate the bacterial genera utilized in the sourcetracker program to assign potential sources to sink samples were the abundant groups or specific clades significantly associated with each category table b 5 the weighted unifrac distance matrix generated in qiime was used for non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of bacterial community sequence data using primer 6 clarke and gorley 2006 bacterial taxonomic groups at the genus level significantly associated with individual samples were determined with the lefse the linear discriminant analysis effect size algorithm that employs the non parametric factorial kruskal wallis test followed by the post hoc linear discriminant analysis segata et al 2011 as well as the deseq2 method within qiime additional statistical analyses including wilcoxon tests mann whitney for two categories or kruskal wallis with steel dwass pairwise comparisons for three or more categories spearman rank correlation non metric multidimensional scaling nmds anosim and permanova were performed using jmp10 sas cary nc the spss package version 16 0 or primer 6 significance was reported for p values less than 0 05 over range fib measurements for water table b 1 or sediments table b 2 were excluded from the analyses when estimating human waste contamination percentages for the debris flow field disposed sediment and the surf zone water samples errors were propagated according to standard methods taylor 1997 2 7 modeling sewage in sediments and sediment fecal indicators in the surf zone the percentages of sewage contamination of the studied environmental compartments debris flow field disposed sediments and surf zone were estimated appendix a using all available results depending on the compartment culturable fib entero1a copies by qpcr hadv and hf183 marker detections and bacterial community sequences although it is well known that culturable fib are not specific to human waste harwood et al 2014 the modeling nonetheless employed fib data because fib concentrations spiked in the surf zone upon sediment disposal to goleta beach during the study period santa barbara county public health department 2018 thus elevated surf zone fib were hypothesized to originate from disposed sediments excavated from the debris flow field for the debris flow field measurements of fecal contamination were for fib total coliform and e coli by others kryszak 2018 therefore sewage could only be related to the debris flow field on the basis of these fib calculated as proportional sewage contamination appendix a the measurements of the disposed sediment fib were also related to sewage fib concentrations also by calculating the percentage sewage contamination that would have resulted in disposed sediment fib concentrations table b 2 appendix a however concentrations of other specific fecal indicators entero1a hadv and hf183 detections and bacterial community sequences in disposed sediments were also related to their concentrations in sewage briefly appendix a the calculated sewage volumes ml assuming a specific gravity of 1 were normalized to 1 g dry sediment and multiplied by 100 to estimate the percent sewage equivalent contamination in sediments the calculated fib based contamination percentages were compared to each other for the disposed sediments they were also compared to estimates of contamination percentages calculated from hf183 and human adenovirus detections entero1a concentrations and bacterial community sequence data such comparisons allowed for quantitatively assessing the evidence for and consistency of sewage contamination across the multiple compartments of the debris flow field the disposed sediments and the surf zone a simple box model of the surf zone was used to test the hypothesis that the surf zone became contaminated with fib by disposed sediments translocating into nearshore waters for example from surf action over the tidal range appendix a the model accounts for sediment influx to the surf zone of sediment associated fib the surf zone was assumed to be well mixed with first order fib attenuation perhaps from combined sediment settling and decay maraccini et al 2016 the surf zone fecal indicator concentration was simulated and compared to the average measured values

percentages similar to disposed sediments sequences varied 0 1 42 4 and the contributions from mountain soil and sewage became negligible less than 1 0 on average fig 3b 3 4 estimated sewage content and modeled disposed sediment contaminant fate because sewage had contaminated the debris flow field the fib total coliform and e coli concentrations in the debris flow sediment samples n 10 kryszak 2018 were compared to concentrations in raw sewage to estimate percent sewage contamination based on total coliform approximately 11 sewage mass basis was in the debris flow field based on e coli the percentage sewage contamination was approximately 17 fig 5 appendix a based on fib data including total coliform e coli and enterococci in this study the estimated percent human waste contamination of disposed sediments averaged 12 1 3 8 n 12 0 8 0 4 n 16 and 81 5 25 4 n 15 a similar estimation based on the qpcr entero1a quantification of enterococcus sp yielded the average percentage of human waste as 392 1 158 8 n 17 which may reflect the previously reported slow decay of qpcr based enterococcus sp relative to culture based enterococci measurements potentially also compounded by growth of enterococcus sp in the sediments yamahara et al 2012 there were four disposed sediment samples out of 17 that contained dnq levels of the human associated fecal marker hf183 table b 2 on this basis 24 of disposed sediments were contaminated with human waste appendix a fig 5 assuming that hf183 markers in sediments decay faster than general fecal indicators zimmer faust et al 2017 these dnq levels were regarded as true detections for which quantifiable evidence had attenuated prior to sediment disposal human adenovirus being detected in 1 of 17 disposed sediment samples indicated approximately 6 human waste contamination ignoring the human waste equivalent contamination on the basis of entero1a which was anomalously high i e 300 the average across the other metrics is approximately 20 sewage contamination for disposed sediments fig 5 by using a simple box model eq a 8 the simulated concentrations of surf zone fecal analytes total coliform e coli enterococci and enterococcus sp by qpcr of entero1a correlated reasonably with measured average values table a 1 the simulated concentrations also appeared to correspond with one another as would be expected if there was a common source i e disposed sediments fig a 12 however the measured values proportionately exceeded those simulated fig a 12 which suggests a lower actual rate of attenuation relative to that assumed in the simulation 4 discussion urban natural disasters can degrade environmental quality owing to sanitary infrastructure damage for example by hurricanes and flooding kapoor et al 2018 kiaghadi and rifai 2019 yu et al 2018 debris flows are similarly destructive degraff et al 2009 but the resulting accumulated sediments are less studied for their impacts the need to restore urban function requires removing and disposing of disaster wastes while avoiding further environmental harm brown et al 2011 after the montecito debris flows fib contaminated sediments were used to nourish a popular bathing beach using direct pathogen analysis bacterial community sequencing and qpcr analysis of host associated fecal markers the elevated fib of disposed sediments and surf zone were explainable by sewage contamination while other fib sources such as wildlife or domesticated animal feces could have been entrained in the debris flow sediments the evidence for other sources was low the mountain soils did not contain fecal contamination there are no farms in the area fig a 2 and there was no evidence by host associated qpcr of canine or gull fecal contamination further by relating various fecal indicators to the human waste reference material sewage across the three compartments debris flow field disposed sediments and surf zone there is a reasonably consistent finding of approximately 20 human waste contamination within the samples fig 5 still while others have reported that hf183 marker and community sequencing results combined with sourcetracker analysis are complementary for confirming human waste contamination ahmed et al 2015 there is a downside in the sourcetracker analysis here in that a large proportion of bacterial sequences in the disposed sediments were from unknown sources fig 3 also the four sewage samples contained replicable bacterial communities fig 4b yet sewage in january during the debris flow may have differed from that in reference samples from july 2018 further the bacterial communities in the mountain soil samples were somewhat disparate fig 4b and may not have fully represented the soil bacterial communities comprising the sediments soil bacterial communities are extremely diverse lozupone and knight 2007 and many soil samples would have been required to characterize the mountain soil which was known to be the main sediment contributor to the debris flow kean et al 2019 more soil samples could have improved the total sequence allocation by sourcetracker regardless of the quantitative details of relative contributions across the various measures goleta beach surf zone water quality deteriorated as a direct consequence of fecal contaminated sediments being disposed onto the beach many potential human pathogen sequences in the disposed sediments and surf zone waters were associated with facultative anaerobes that can persist in soil or water enterobacter species shigella sonnei klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa reinforcing that disposed sediments changed surf zone microbiology further surf zone water fib concentrations and disposed sediment fib concentrations and percentages of clay and silt were correlated confirming that disposed sediments contributed both fib and niches for their survival in surf zone water fib concentrations in surf zone water and surf zone water turbidity were correlated as in previous studies he and he 2008 lee et al 2006 also simulations of fecal indicator concentrations that would manifest from sediments translocating into the surf zone were reasonably similar to measured concentrations appendix a fig a 12 yet after jan 29 2018 the surf zone bacterial community composition was recovering with intestinal bacterial including possible human pathogen sequence abundances diminishing the nearshore davidson current or the southern california countercurrent could have contributed to the community shift e g by bringing pristine nearshore waters to the contaminated area bray et al 1999 thus beach nourishment under this emergency situation was unlikely to result in long term microbiological contamination of the goleta beach surf zone this is also confirmed by the observation that the concentrations of fib particularly enterococci in surf zone waters continued to decrease after the disposal of sediments stopped as evidenced by this study and a report by others steets and ervin 2019 5 conclusions this study contributes to the understanding of microbiological contamination of urban debris flow sediments and the consequences of contaminated sediment disposal to a public beach the study demonstrated coupled molecular and conventional sediment and water quality tools for environmental forensics following a disaster the main findings of this study included human fecal material presumably sewage and possibly septage contaminated sediments during a destructive urban debris flow contaminated sediment disposal to nourish a recreational beach immediately fouled surf zone waters and continued to do so throughout the disposal period raw sewage associated fecal bacterial dna sequences were initially prevalent in disposed sediments and adjacent surf zone waters within weeks bacterial communities in surf zone waters returned to being dominated by marine bacterial clades approaches in conventional and molecular microbiology were useful forensically still under future emergencies human waste diagnoses during the planning of disposal options could allow for sediment disposal decisions to promptly and more

17976,urban disaster response requires disposal of complex wastes this study regards a case wherein high intensity rainfall fell over a remote mountainous area previously burned by wildfire generating debris flows that devastated a downstream town sanitary sewers and homes with septic systems were damaged releasing human waste into the debris flow field contaminated sediments with their high fecal indicator bacteria fib concentrations were cleared from public rights of way and creek channels by local authorities then disposed onto distant goleta beach for beach nourishment causing immediate surf zone microbiological water quality exceedances to determine potential public health threats disposed sediments and surf zone waters were sampled and analyzed relative to reference samples of mountain soil and raw sewage for fib pathogens human hf183 and other host gull2 taqman and dogbact associated dna based fecal markers and bacterial community 16s rrna gene sequences approximately 20 of disposed sediment samples contained the hf183 marker sequencing suggested that all samples were contaminated by sewage in an initial sediment disposal period surf zone waters harbored intestinal bacterial sequences that were shared with disposed sediments and sewage yet surf zone bacterial communities returned to mostly marine clades within weeks taken together multiple conventional and dna based analyses informed this forensic assessment of human waste contamination in the future similar analyses could be used earlier in disaster response to guide sediment disposal decisions towards

disaster situations freshwater or marine sediments from reservoirs or harbors respectively may be dredged classified to remove large debris and rocks and the sandy portions deposited onto coastal

state coastal conservancy 2002 u s army corps of engineers 2007 sediments for beach nourishment should match the particle size distributions of the receiving beach and the percentage of sediment fines should be less than 20 rippy et al 2013 because trace elements pit et al 2017 and fecal indicator bacteria fib such as enterococcus rippy et al 2013 associate with fine sediment debris flows triggered by rainfall are common in coastal mountain ranges degraff et al 2009 often where beach nourishment occurs however the implications of disposing of debris flow sediments by beach nourishment are not well studied and therefore difficult to anticipate during urgent decision making this research examines montecito ca where intense rainfall triggered catastrophic debris flows emanating from a mountain range that was previously burned by a major wildfire sewer pipes were broken by the flows and homes with septic systems were damaged or destroyed therefore human waste with fib and other microorganisms was mixed with debris flow sediments public rights of way and creeks became clogged with sediments that were found to be contaminated with fib kryszak 2018 cleared sediments were transported for disposal onto nearby goleta beach where surf zone fib concentrations spiked after disposal santa barbara county public health department 2018 goleta beach had previously been nourished using sediments that were dredged from upstream creeks for flood control however in january 2018 beach nourishment was an emergency response using fib contaminated sediments that potentially contained human waste from montecito fib can derive from many fecal sources such as birds goodwin et al 2016 dogs ervin et al 2014 and human fecal material which is relatively hazardous to swimmers soller et al 2017 to examine possible human waste in sediments disposed to goleta beach and reveal the impact of such disposal on surf zone microbiological water quality a field study was conducted including

sourcetracker knights et al 2011 have also been successfully applied to attribute water body contamination to a variety of fecal sources ahmed et al 2015 staley et al 2018 in this study samples were thus analyzed for fib pathogens salmonella and human adenovirus human and other host associated dna fecal markers and bacterial community composition by dna sequencing similar measurements were made for reference samples of the soils in the debris flow source areas and of untreated sewage from the montecito sanitary district the qualities of surf zone waters prior to during and after sediment disposal were compared to one another modeling was used to relate the human waste reference sewage fecal content to fecal indicator measures in field samples modeling was also used to simulate the influences of fecal contamination introduced into the surf zone by disposed sediments as they translocated from on to offshore the results indicated a human waste contamination cascade beginning with damaged sanitary infrastructure releasing human waste into the debris flow field continuing with contaminated sediments trucked to and disposed of on goleta beach and ending with contaminated sediment transport into the surf zone human waste contamination was prevalent in the surf zone during the early sediment disposal period but surf zone bacterial communities returned to more typical marine compositions within weeks of the cessation of disposal 2 materials and methods 2 1 study context and background the december 2017 thomas fire the largest wildfire to date in california burned a mountainous landscape above the town of montecito subsequently january 9 2018 an intense rainfall over the burned area slurried mountain soil that mobilized rocks boulders and vegetation into a debris

sediments from public rights of way and creeks were excavated sorted and then disposed to two beaches including goleta beach located 23 km to the west fig a 1 approximately 31 200 m3 of sediment were disposed to goleta beach spencer 2018 from january 13 14 2018 sediments from ten montecito debris flow field locations were sampled by others and analyzed for total coliform and escherichia coli

fecal contamination pachepsky and shelton 2011 the montecito sanitary district msd reported locations of sewer damage montecito sanitary district 2018 but spilled sewage volumes were unknown while some homes in the affected area used septic systems information about septage spills was not available thus the human waste spilled into debris flow sediments was not directly estimable although neither the debris flow source areas nor the debris flow fields are agricultural appendix a fig a 2 there may be wildlife pets and some privately stabled horses in the debris flow field areas regardless sediments destined for goleta beach were excavated from areas of sanitary infrastructure damage or downstream of those areas and thus the disposed sediments were likely contaminated with human waste 2 2 sites sampling sample processing and physicochemical analyses beach disposal of sediments occurred continuously from january 12 to february 20 2018 disposed sediment and surf zone water samples were collected on every weekday during january 18 26 and then on mondays wednesdays and fridays during january 29 february 28 approximately one week after the end of disposal from january 18 to february 19 2018 17 disposed sediment samples and 51 goleta beach surf zone water samples were collected and processed for analyzing fib host associated fecal dna markers bacterial communities and selected pathogens details in appendix a on each sampling day water samples were collected at three surf zone sites surrounding the sediment disposal area and one composite sediment sample was taken from the sediment disposal area inland from the swash zone appendix a fig a 4 similar sampling continued for 4 days after sediment disposal stopped on february 20 2018 except that since no new sediment was being disposed sand underlying the disposal site above the mean tideline was sampled approximately 2 months later during may june 2018 18 surf zone water and 6 beach sand

representative of the human fecal source was sampled on each of 4 days in july 2018 from the msd wwtp these mountain soil and sewage samples were reference materials for the disposed sediment bacterial communities the soil was also a reference for sediment texture and toc content and the sewage was also a reference for human associated fib pathogens and human associated dna markers soil and sewage samples were processed similarly to disposed sediments and surf zone waters appendix a 2 3 fib measurement public agency data of surf zone fib concentrations at goleta beach for the weeks preceding during and following the debris flow were available santa barbara county public health department 2018 here fib were quantified for sewage and surf zone waters using defined substrate culture methods according to the manufacturer s instructions idexx westbrook me as described before ervin et al 2014 surf zone fib exceedances were evaluated by comparing measurements to california

invitrogen carlsbad ca on a cytation3 cell imaging multi mode reader biotek instruments inc winooski vt extracted dna was stored at 20 c prior to analysis besides human waste or mountain soil it was possible that canines or birds owing to their frequent presence in the vicinity of goleta beach could have introduced fecal contamination and thus fib into disposed sediments there are no agricultural land uses in the area fig a 2 and thus no livestock fecal sources horse fecal contamination was assumed to not be significant given the few private horse stables near the debris flow depositional areas human dog and gull fecal materials were assessed in the disposed sediments and human fecal material was also evaluated in the surf zone using qpcr assay details in appendix a with hf183 as the human associated fecal marker bernhard and field 2000 green et al 2014 dogbact as the dog marker dick et al 2005 sinigalliano et al 2010 and gull2taqman as the gull fecal marker lu et al 2008

inhibition was assessed by comparing sample internal amplification control iac results from the hf183 assay to the calculated interference and competition thresholds green et al 2014 extracted filter blanks and extraction blanks were analyzed to assess contamination during sample filtration and dna extraction all samples blanks and standards were analyzed in triplicate samples with two or more

hercules ca as previously published steele et al 2018 2 5 bacterial community sequencing and analysis genes encoding 16s rrna were sequenced using dna that had been extracted and archived from representative 2018 samples appendix a of surf zone waters disposed sediments raw sewage and mountain soils table b 3 dna was also sequenced for samples collected during the pre disposal period of june october 2017 for these samples dna had been extracted and archived using protocols identical to those herein the 2017 pre disposal samples were from five representative goleta beach surfzone and nearshore marine water nine beach sand and two representative nearshore sediment samples the details of amplification and purification were published previously li et al 2017 except that the 27f

operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence similarity representative sequences for each otu were picked and taxonomic data were assigned using the greengenes 13 8 aligned reference database possible chimeric sequences were checked with the chimeraslayer wrapper in qiime the shannon diversity index was calculated in qiime raw sequences for each sample were also processed and aligned through the 16spip pipeline against a human pathogen 16s rrna sequence database consisting of 29 258 sequences representing 346 bacterial species miao et al 2017 the bwa mem algorithm was utilized for sequence alignment and the sequences with similarity higher than 99 to reference sequences were identified as taxa of potential human health concern opportunistic human pathogens identified in the sequences such as bacteroides fragilis aeromonas hydrophila acinetobacter lwoffii and citrobacter freundii could have originated from soil or marine water and so were excluded from the results 2 6 statistical analyses and bioinformatics sourcetracker analysis was performed to allocate the disposed sediment bacterial community sequences according to their similarities to reference sequences from mountain soil and raw sewage using sourcetracker 1 0 https github com danknights sourcetracker releases with default parameters and with the otu tables from the qiime pipeline as input following the instructions available online sourcetracker was also used to relate the disposed sediment as a bacterial community source to the surf zone as a sink for each set of source and sink samples average predicted source proportions and rsd values were obtained by running sourcetracker in triplicate the bacterial genera utilized in the sourcetracker program to assign potential sources to sink samples

percentages for the debris flow field disposed sediment and the surf zone water samples errors were propagated according to standard methods taylor 1997 2 7 modeling sewage in sediments and sediment fecal indicators in the surf zone the percentages of sewage contamination of the studied environmental compartments debris flow field disposed sediments and surf zone were estimated appendix a using all available results depending on the compartment culturable fib entero1a copies by qpcr hadv and hf183 marker detections and bacterial community sequences although it is well known that culturable fib are not specific to human waste harwood et al 2014 the modeling nonetheless employed fib data because fib concentrations spiked in the surf zone upon sediment disposal to goleta beach during the study period santa barbara county public health department 2018 thus elevated surf zone fib were hypothesized to originate from disposed sediments excavated from the debris flow field for the debris flow field measurements of fecal contamination were for fib total coliform and e coli by others kryszak 2018 therefore sewage could only be related to the debris flow field on the basis of these fib calculated as proportional sewage contamination appendix a the measurements of the disposed sediment fib were also related to sewage fib concentrations also by calculating the percentage sewage contamination that would have resulted in disposed sediment fib concentrations table b 2 appendix a however concentrations of other specific fecal indicators entero1a hadv and hf183 detections and bacterial community sequences in disposed sediments were also related to their concentrations in sewage briefly appendix a the calculated sewage volumes ml assuming a specific gravity of 1 were normalized to 1 g dry sediment and multiplied by 100 to estimate the percent sewage equivalent contamination in sediments the calculated fib based contamination percentages were compared to each other for the disposed sediments they were also compared to estimates of contamination percentages calculated from hf183 and human adenovirus detections entero1a concentrations and bacterial community sequence data such comparisons allowed for quantitatively assessing the evidence for and consistency of sewage contamination across the multiple compartments of the debris flow field the disposed sediments and the surf zone a simple box model of the surf zone was used to test the hypothesis that the surf zone became contaminated with fib by disposed sediments translocating into nearshore waters for example from surf action over the tidal range appendix a the model accounts for sediment influx to the surf zone of sediment associated fib the surf zone was assumed to be well mixed with first order fib attenuation perhaps from combined sediment settling and decay maraccini et al 2016 the surf zone fecal indicator concentration was simulated and compared to the average measured values appendix a 3 results 3 1 mountain soil and sewage characteristics mountain soils contained few fib fecal markers and human adenovirus were not detected table b 2 the lack of fecal contamination was

streptococcus suis pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae table b 6 3 2 disposed sediment characteristics the disposed sediment was dominated by silt and clay particles sizes the

sediment disposal particularly after the initial sampling period table b 6 almost no less than 0 001 potential human pathogen species were found in 2017 surf zone and nearshore waters by sourcetracker analysis sequences from mountain soils sewage and disposed sediments comprised surf zone water bacterial communities during jan 18 26 2018 with the percentages of approximately 44 3 19 5 and 17 8 respectively contributions from other tested sources including 2017 surf zone waters nearshore waters and beach sands were negligible all less than 0 05 fig 3 b after the initial sampling period jan 26 2018 2017 nearshore water sequences comprised 60 5 of the 2018 surf zone sequences concomitantly less than 10 of 2018 surf zone sequences were similar to 2017 surf zone water sequences the percentages similar to disposed sediments sequences varied 0 1 42 4 and the contributions from mountain soil and sewage became negligible less than 1 0 on average fig 3b 3 4 estimated sewage content and modeled disposed sediment contaminant fate because sewage had contaminated the debris flow field the fib total coliform and e coli concentrations in the debris flow sediment samples n 10 kryszak 2018 were compared to concentrations in raw sewage to estimate percent sewage contamination based on total coliform approximately 11 sewage mass basis was in the debris flow field based on e coli the percentage sewage contamination was approximately 17 fig 5 appendix a based on fib data including total coliform e coli and enterococci in this study the estimated percent human waste contamination of disposed sediments averaged 12 1 3 8 n 12 0 8 0 4 n 16 and 81 5 25 4 n 15 a similar estimation based on the qpcr entero1a quantification of enterococcus sp yielded the average percentage of human waste as 392 1 158 8 n 17 which may reflect the previously reported slow decay of qpcr based enterococcus sp relative to culture based enterococci measurements potentially also compounded by growth of enterococcus sp in the sediments yamahara et al 2012 there were four disposed sediment samples out of 17 that contained dnq levels of the human associated fecal marker hf183 table b 2 on this basis 24 of disposed sediments were contaminated with human waste appendix a fig 5 assuming that hf183 markers in sediments decay faster than general fecal indicators zimmer faust et al 2017 these dnq levels were regarded as true detections for which quantifiable evidence had attenuated prior to sediment disposal human adenovirus being detected in 1 of 17 disposed sediment samples indicated approximately 6 human waste contamination ignoring the human waste equivalent contamination on the basis of entero1a which was anomalously high i e 300 the average across the other metrics is approximately 20 sewage contamination for disposed sediments fig 5 by using a simple box model eq a 8 the simulated concentrations of surf zone fecal analytes total coliform e coli enterococci and enterococcus sp by qpcr of entero1a correlated reasonably with measured average values table a 1 the simulated concentrations also appeared to correspond with one another as would be expected if there was a common source i e disposed sediments fig a 12 however the measured values proportionately exceeded those simulated fig a 12 which suggests a lower actual rate of attenuation relative to that assumed in the simulation 4 discussion urban natural disasters can degrade environmental quality owing to sanitary infrastructure damage for example by hurricanes and flooding kapoor et al 2018 kiaghadi and rifai 2019 yu et al 2018 debris flows are similarly destructive degraff et al 2009 but the resulting accumulated sediments are less studied for their impacts the need to restore urban function requires removing and disposing of disaster wastes while avoiding further environmental harm brown et al 2011 after the montecito debris flows fib contaminated sediments were used to nourish a popular bathing beach using direct pathogen analysis bacterial community sequencing and qpcr analysis of host associated fecal markers the elevated fib of disposed sediments and surf zone were explainable by sewage contamination while other fib sources such as wildlife or domesticated animal feces could have been entrained in the debris flow sediments the evidence for other sources was low the mountain soils did not contain fecal contamination there are no farms in the area fig a 2 and there was no evidence by host associated qpcr of canine or gull fecal contamination further by relating various fecal indicators to the human waste reference material sewage across the three compartments debris flow field disposed sediments and surf zone there is a reasonably consistent finding of approximately 20 human waste contamination within the samples fig 5 still while others have reported that hf183 marker and community sequencing results combined with sourcetracker analysis are complementary for confirming human waste contamination ahmed et al 2015 there is a downside in the sourcetracker analysis here in that a large proportion of bacterial sequences in the disposed sediments were from unknown sources fig 3 also the four sewage samples contained replicable bacterial communities fig 4b yet sewage in january during the debris flow may have differed from that in reference samples from july 2018 further the bacterial communities in the mountain soil samples were somewhat disparate fig 4b and may not have fully represented the soil bacterial communities comprising the sediments soil bacterial communities are extremely diverse lozupone and knight 2007 and many soil samples would have been required to characterize the mountain soil which was known to be the main sediment contributor to the debris flow kean et al 2019 more soil samples could have improved the total sequence allocation by sourcetracker regardless of the quantitative details of relative contributions across the various measures goleta beach surf zone water quality deteriorated as a direct consequence of fecal contaminated sediments being disposed onto the beach many potential human pathogen sequences in the disposed sediments and surf zone waters were associated with facultative anaerobes that can persist in soil or water enterobacter species shigella sonnei klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa reinforcing that disposed sediments changed surf zone microbiology further surf zone water fib concentrations and disposed sediment fib concentrations and percentages of clay and silt were correlated confirming that disposed sediments contributed both fib and niches for their survival in surf zone water fib concentrations in surf zone water and surf zone water turbidity were correlated as in previous studies he and he 2008 lee et al 2006 also simulations of fecal indicator concentrations that would manifest from sediments translocating into the surf zone were reasonably similar to measured concentrations appendix a fig a 12 yet after jan 29 2018 the surf zone bacterial community composition was recovering with intestinal bacterial including possible human pathogen sequence abundances diminishing the nearshore davidson current or the southern california countercurrent could have contributed to the community shift e g by bringing pristine nearshore waters to the contaminated area bray et al 1999 thus beach nourishment under this emergency situation was unlikely to result in long term microbiological contamination of the goleta beach surf zone this is also confirmed by the observation that the concentrations of fib particularly enterococci in surf zone waters continued to decrease after the disposal of sediments stopped as evidenced by this study and a report by others steets and ervin 2019 5 conclusions this study contributes to the understanding of microbiological contamination of urban debris flow sediments and the consequences of contaminated sediment disposal to a public beach the study demonstrated coupled molecular and conventional sediment and water quality tools for environmental forensics following a disaster the main findings of this study included human fecal material presumably sewage and possibly septage contaminated sediments during a destructive urban debris flow contaminated sediment disposal to nourish a recreational beach immediately fouled surf zone waters and continued to do so throughout the disposal period raw sewage associated fecal bacterial dna sequences were initially prevalent in disposed sediments and adjacent surf zone waters within weeks bacterial communities in surf zone waters returned to being dominated by marine bacterial clades approaches in conventional and molecular microbiology were useful forensically still under future emergencies human waste diagnoses during the planning of disposal options could allow for sediment disposal decisions to promptly and more

17977,bioelectrochemical systems bes have long been viewed as a promising wastewater treatment technology however in reality the performance of bioelectrochemical systems fed with real and therefore complex wastewaters is often disappointing we have sought to investigate the combined impacts of complex substrates and presence of electron acceptors in particular this study illustrates and systematically evaluates the disparity in performance between a bes acclimatised with acetate and those acclimatised with more complex carbohydrates glucose sucrose or starch and in the presence and absence of sulphate relative to acetate only operating with complex carbohydrates reduced current by 73 87 and coulombic efficiency by 4 50 acclimation with complex carbohydrates seriously impeded the colonisation anode by geobacteraceae resulting in substantially reduced capacity to produce current 60 2 on average combined acclimation with sulphate further reduced current by 35 on average and resulted in a total reduction of 83 93 relative to the acetate control however the presence of an electrogenic sulphide sulphur shuttle meant sulphate had little effect on the coulombic efficiency of the bes the results indicate that a reduction in current and coulombic efficiency is at present an unavoidable consequence of operating a bes fed with complex wastewater researchers designers and policy makers should incorporate such losses in both their plans and their prognostications graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioelectrochemical systems carbohydrate sulphate 1 introduction bioelectrochemical systems bes are viewed as a promising wastewater treatment technology in principle they can remove waste whilst producing energy or valuable chemicals he et al 2017 logan and rabaey 2012 their ability to remove chemical oxygen demand cod sulphate ammonia phosphate and heavy metal in wastewater has been demonstrated coma et al 2013 kelly and he 2014 liang et al 2018 wang and ren 2014 however the potential to be energy positive is what makes bes technology exciting to achieve this efficient electron scavenging from wastewater is required improvements in reactor configuration logan et al 2015 electrode material sonawane et al 2017 and operation kaur et al 2014 have increased bes performance however when fed with real wastewater this performance remains problematic with serious implications for the prospects for bes as a treatment technology bess fed with acetate a simple readily degradable substrate can produce high current densities and coulombic efficiencies of up to 0 99 ma cm2 and 100 respectively fan et al 2007 nevin et al 2008 yet the disparity between the performances of bess operated on acetate and wastewater is huge in studies which directly compare acetate to wastewater in the same reactors current density has been observed to decrease by 67 at lab scale dhar and lee 2014 while power density decreased by 95 at pilot scale of 1000l liang et al 2018 the utilization of wastewater by bes is not just slow but also incomplete the coulombic efficiency with raw wastewater is often less than 20 pandey et al 2016 the use of real wastewaters has implications for the abiotic aspects of these systems such as low conductivity typically 1 ms cm and ph gradients rozendal et al 2008 as well as the biotic aspects the biotic factors include microbial diversity stratford et al 2014 competition parameswaran et al 2009 and substrate heterogeneity pandey et al 2016 the limited performance of wastewater fed bess is well known he et al 2017 but not well understood there is clearly a need for a more systematic approach to this problem that will take us at least some of the way towards an understanding of the disparity between performance of acetate and wastewater fed bess zhao et al 2020 one rational approach to understanding the impact of wastewater complexity on bes would be to start with basic components in wastewater integrating the most fundamental aspects first and then stepwise adding more complexity to assemble a full picture of the complex network of interactions in wastewater two obvious and important differences between wastewater and acetate medium are i most electron donors in wastewater need to be anaerobically converted into smaller molecules before they can be used by electrogenic microorganisms at the bio anode logan et al 2019 while acetate is a simple molecules that can be directly used by electrogenic microorganisms ii wastewater usually contains electron acceptors such as nitrite and sulphate that compete and interfere with the electron accepting function of the anode ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 whereas an artificial acetate media does not understanding the interplay between substrate complexity and alternative electron acceptors on the performance of bes is expected to shed some light on the fundamental aspects of the impact of wastewater complexity on this technology anaerobic carbohydrate degradation is a common organic removal process in wastewater treatment it helps bes to take up complex organics as electrogenic microorganisms have limited ability of to use complex organics as substrate catal et al 2011 logan et al 2019 in bes the rate of carbohydrate degradation through hydrolysis and fermentation is thought to be limiting reducing the rate at which current is produced velasquez orta et al 2011 zhao et al 2020 carbohydrate degradation gives rise to the formation of carbohydrate degrading biomass and can also give rise to methanogenesis both pathways cause a loss of coulombic efficiency lee et al 2008 sulphate is a common electron acceptor in environmental waste streams and frequently the major alternative electron acceptor in bess fed with municipal wastewater zhang et al 2013 petropoulos et al 2019 however the products of sulphate reduction such as sulphide and sulphur are potentially electrogenic therefore unlike other terminal electron acceptors such as nitrite or carbon dioxide that often bind electrons permanently sulphate receives electrons and then delivers them to the anode via direct electrogenic oxidation of sulphur species dutta et al 2009 sun et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 this pathway can interact with the function of bes recycling the electrons from sulphate reduction boosting coulombic efficiency individually the presence of either complex carbohydrate or sulphate as components in the substrate can affect the performance of a bes however these two components also interact with the ability to use a wide range of substrates sulphur reducers might help bes to utilize complex carbohydrates via alternative processes by forming electrogenic sulphur species muyzer and stams 2008 this might either attenuate the accumulation of rate limiting intermediates and products of carbohydrate degradation and recover them as current or force them into a less efficient electrogenic pathway increasing the disparity of the performance between bes with and without sulphate thus the coexistence of just two fundamental components of wastewater carbohydrate and sulphate causes already substantial uncertainty into the performance of bes furthermore and in spite of the simplistic belief that acetate is the most readily degradable organic carbon acetate degradation itself is not necessarily easy and straightforward while many sulphate reducers oxidize complex organics to co2 there is also a substantial group of incomplete oxidizers that stop at acetate rather than co2 rabus et al 2013 another case in point is the oxidation of acetate by an intricate association between geobacter sulfurreducens and a hydrogen utilizing exoelectrogen kimura and okabe 2013 dolfing 2014 it is tempting to speculate that hydrogen utilizing exoelectrogens can take up a similar integrative role by simultaneously removing hydrogen that leaks away during degradation of more complex carbon sources which in turn may affect acetate degradation by g sulfurreducens like electrogens the aim of this study is to illustrate and evaluate the combined impact of two representative wastewater components carbohydrate and sulphate on the performance of bes with acetate acclimatised reactor as positive control the carbohydrates in order of increasing complexity were glucose sucrose and starch glucose is fermentable to produce simple electrogenic compounds and the basic unit for building complex carbohydrates sucrose is a disaccharide that consists of two glucose moieties with a glycosidic bond starch is a complex carbohydrate that is composed of a chain of glucose molecules with glycosidic bonds the substrates were provided at concentrations equivalent to 640mgcod l which simulated the cod of high strength domestic wastewater wastewater treatment is complex and multifaceted this study tackles one aspect of this complexity demonstrating a rigorous and systematic methodology as to how such challenges can be approached 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor design eight tubular two chamber reactors were constructed by combining two tubular acrylic vessels with an individual working volume of 78 5 ml as the anodic and cathodic chambers separated by a nafion ion exchange membrane sigma aldrich usa fig s1 the membranes were soaked in 2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 for 1 h before use the anode and cathode were made of carbon felt 2 5 cm 2 5 cm 1 cm olmec uk and platinum mesh 2 5 cm 2 5 cm ti shop uk respectively prior to use the electrodes were rinsed with deionized water to remove residuals the anode and cathode were connected via a 1 0 mm diameter stainless steel wire goodfellow uk the ohmic resistance of each electrode set up was tested with a voltammeter to ensure that the resistance was less

treatment plant durham uk was used as inoculum in the anodic chambers for the initial acclimation the inoculum was diluted in a 1 5 v v ratio with the anodic media the anodic media was made of disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 4 58 g l sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 2h2o 2 77 g l ammonia chloride nh4cl 1 g l trace element solution 10 ml l and vitamin solution 10 ml l gimkiewicz and

medium containing one of the following 0 82 g l sodium acetate c2h3nao2 or 0 60 g l glucose c6h12o6 or 0 30 g l sucrose c12h22o11 or 0 60 g l starch c6h10o5 n in addition to these organics one series also received 0 71 g l sodium sulphate na2so4 final concentration while the other series did not the cod so4 2 ratio in the sulphate containing media was 1 33 g g quad potentiostats whistonbrook uk were used to stabilize the anode potentials of all the reactors at 0 mv vs standard hydrogen electrode she reference electrodes mf 2052 ag agcl reference electrode basi usa were connected with the anolyte via a salt bridge to prevent biological contamination the salt bridge was built by a 10 ml pipette tip filled with mixture of 3m sodium chloride nacl and 5 agar at the bottom and extra 3m nacl solution to soak the tip of reference electrode the top of the salt bridge was sealed with a rubber stopper to prevent evaporation and leakage of nacl solution salt bridges were replaced monthly the potential of each reference electrode with salt bridge was tested to ensure that the potential drift was less than 10 mv before the experiment started to minimize potential losses the distance between reference electrode and anode was kept to less than 10 mm current was recorded once per minute unless indicated otherwise by version 3 data logging software whistonbrook uk all the reactors were inoculated and equilibrated for fifteen days until stable and reproducible current was obtained before any test 2 4 evaluation of the combined impact of carbohydrate and sulphate on the performance of bes to evaluate the combined impact of carbohydrates and sulphate on the performance of bes the individual impacts need to be specified therefore the reactors were tested under four conditions table 1 condition 1 was the condition under which the individual reactors were acclimatised this condition provided the baseline to the other tests under condition 2 the sulphate was absent while under condition 3 carbohydrate were replaced by acetate these conditions allowed specific evaluation of the presence of sulphate and carbohydrates in reactors acclimated to these components under condition 4 both components were absent allowing evaluation of the combined effects of these components on the acclimation of the reactors the concentrations of the test substrates were as described in 2 3 above the tests for the individual conditions were run until current production dropped to 0 5 ma the concentrations of sulphate sulphide cod and toc were measured at the start and the end of the tests after the tests under condition 2 3 and 4 all the reactors were switched back to condition 1 overnight to stabilize the microbial communities the peak current production and the coulombic efficiency of each test were recorded for further analysis 2 5 characterising the reduction of sulphate in bes to separate the mechanisms behind the impact of sulphate reduction on the performance of bes the sulphur pathway in the reactor acclimatised with sulphate and acetate was deciphered to do this the potential occurrence of downstream reactions of sulphate reduction was examined by four

2 g l sodium sulphide hydrate na2s 9h2o only this test was only carried out for 2 h because of concern for the high toxicity of sulphide and excessive accumulation of sulphur deposits scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx were used to examine the presence of sulphur on the anode iii electrogenic elemental sulphur oxidation by feeding with blank media iv sulphur reduction by measuring the concentration of acetate sulphate and sulphide in both influent and effluent in condition 2 to understand the effect of sulphate reduction on the performance of bess the sulphate and acetate acclimatised reactor was further characterized with regard to a the response to anode potential to give insight into the effect of the applied energy of electrogenic oxidation of acetate on its competitive reaction sulphate reduction and on the performance of bess b the response to the ratio of cod sulphate to demonstrate the effect of sulphate reduction on the performance of bess under the extreme conditions with either high sulphate supply or low acetate supply to investigate the response to anode potentials the reactor was operated with the acclimatisation feed in six individual 24 h cycles with anode potentials of 250mv 150 mv 0 mv 200 mv 500 mv and 700 mv individually then to investigate the response to the ratio of cod sulphate the reactor was supplied with either 0 82 g l sodium acetate and 0 36 g l 0 72 g l 1 08 g l 1 44 g l 2 16 g l sodium sulphate in six cycles or with 0 72 g l sodium sulphate and 0 08 g l 0 21 g l 0 41 g l

with cod kits 25 mg l 1500 mg l merck co inc usa according to the manufacturer s protocol due to the volatile nature of acetate the concentration of acetate was evaluated based on the measurement of toc rather than cod δcodacetate δtocacetate 2 67 the concentration of starch was evaluated only based on cod measurements as starch blocked the sampling needle of the total carbon analyzer cod and toc of glucose and sucrose samples were very consistent this implies that there was no interference of sulphate on cod analysis sulphate was determined by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1000

in duplicate the chemical elements on the surface of anode were analysed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx and scanning electron microscopy sem tm3030 benchtop hitachi japan before the tests the carbon felt anodes were cut into half and one half was rinsed with deionized water and individually preserved in 100 ml serum vials under a nitrogen 99 atmosphere and sealed with butyl rubber caps and aluminium crimp seals to prevent oxidation the other half was used for the analysis of the biofilm 2 7 anodic biofilm analysis to evaluate the combined impact of sulphate and carbohydrates at the acclimation stage the anodic biofilms in the bess were analysed to quantify the geobacteraceae number the half of the carbon felt anodes were pinched into small 250 mg 3 mg pieces with sterilized tweezers and transferred into the tubes containing lysing matrix provided in the qbiogene fastdna spin soil kit mp biomedicals uk for homogenisation the dna was then extracted according to the

according to the manufacturer s protocol the raw sequencing data was obtained from the ion pgm system and deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database accession number samn13214580 prjna587771 the raw data was then filtered to minimum length of 200bp by qiime denoiser and targeted barcoded genes by matching the genes with the silva database at 97 similarity the operational taxonomic unit

minitab 17 minitab inc usa 3 results and discussion our first task was to produce two sets of reactors whose bioanodes were acclimated under specified conditions one set was acclimated on either acetate glucose sucrose or starch the other set was identical except for the presence of sulphate we then conducted experiments on the acclimated reactors with the acclimated biofilms each test was run until current decreased to 0 5 ma and most substrate had been consumed 74 4 7 9 this meant the run time for the acetate acclimatised reactor was on average 24 h versus 48 h for the reactor acclimatised with acetate plus sulphate the reaction time of reactors acclimatised with glucose or sucrose was much longer as current was sustained over 0 5 ma for about 75 h the current in the reactors acclimatised with starch stayed at around 0 5 ma throughout these were also run for about 75 h when most substrate had been consumed 77 3 6 7 3 1 electron donor complexity decreases current production and coulombic efficiency when the reactors were fed with the same substrates they were acclimated to condition 1 the current production and coulombic efficiency decreased by 73 87 and 4 50 respectively with increasing complexity of electron donor fig 1 a the highest current was observed with acetate 6 2 0 1 ma while current was substantially lower with glucose and sucrose 1 4 0 1 ma and 1 7 0 2 ma respectively the lowest current was observed with the most complex substrate starch 0 8 0 2 ma there was an analogous trend in the coulombic efficiency of the reactors fig 1c highest coulombic efficiency was with acetate 77 5 0 8 coulombic efficiencies with glucose and sucrose were similar but slightly lower 70 2 1 3 and 69 3 2 0 respectively and with starch coulombic efficiency was substantially lower 38 3 5 5 3 2 acclimation with complex carbohydrates reduces geobacteraceae numbers in anodic biofilm the effect of complexity on current production and coulombic efficiency described above was essentially as expected the electrogenic degradation of substrates more complex than acetate requires the involvement of a series of organisms that sequentially degrade these substrates into acetate and other small molecules that can be directly used by electrogenic microorganisms to verify this reasoning we sampled and analysed the anodic biofilms enriched in the four reactors acclimatised in the absence of sulphate the anodic biofilm acclimatised with acetate which had shown by far the highest current production contained 8 4 0 0 108 cells of geobacteraceae a group of frequently observed electrogenic acetate users logan et al 2019 with more complex carbohydrates as acclimation feed which as stated in fig 1a resulted in lower current production the geobacteraceae numbers in these biofilms dropped to as low as 1 6 0 0 108 cells per anode this drop coincided with an increase in the proportional abundance of carbohydrate degraders such as aeromonadaceae and porphyromonadaceae chung and okabe 2009 palakawong na ayudthaya et al 2018 fig 2 the percentage reduction in current density resulting from enriching and feeding with complex substrates was in the range of 73 4 86 8 fig 1a the impact on geobacteraceae population was more varied with reductions between 52 7 and 80 4 3 3 upstream activity limits current production and coulombic efficiency from complex substrates since relative to the acetate control the drop in current production with acclimatised feeds in the reactors acclimatised with complex carbohydrates was greater than the drop in geobacteraceae numbers the activity of the organisms upstream of the electrogenic microorganisms might be rate limiting with acclimatised feeds this is also indicated by the aforementioned observation that it took much longer to consume complex substrates than to consume acetate switching feeds to acetate condition 3 was used to examine this hypothesis and in such condition current production increased by between 15 and 24 6 fig 1a given that starch mineralisation involves hydrolysis as first step and that degradation of sucrose and glucose encompasses fermentation and acidogenesis the results indicate that low acetate supply from hydrolysis and fermentation limited the current production our previous study indicates that the slow conversion of fermentative intermediates such as ethanol and propionate to acetate could be a major reason of this low acetate supply zhao et al 2020 also the potential formation of fermentative electron sinks such as methane and biomass could have diverted electrons away from acetate formation and have decreased the production of acetate lee et al 2008 although when fed with acetate the current production in these systems increased substantially it was still much lower 60 2 on average than in the acetate control fig 1a reflecting the lower numbers of electrogenic microorganisms such as geobacteraceae in these biofilms in fact there was a tenuous linear relationship between the number of geobacteraceae in the reactors and the current produced with acetate in condition 3 indicating that the number of geobacteraceae on the anode affects the current capacity of the reactor fig 3 furthermore while these relative values of current production are of interest batch rates as reported here are of limited value for real life long term operation in continuously fed flow through systems however the coulombic efficiency in condition 3 where all the reactors had their substrate switched to acetate was essentially similar to that of the acetate control fig 1c for the glucose and sucrose acclimated biofilms this increase in coulombic efficiency was relatively minor 8 8 and 19 6 respectively but in the starch acclimatised system the increase was substantial 65 0 we conclude that there are major losses of electrons associated with the hydrolysis of starch and presumably other polymers in bes resulting in a low coulombic efficiency these results indicate that the more varied biofilms created when reactors are acclimated on mixed substrates contain less electrogenic microorganisms and that even when fed acetate these biofilms cannot produce the same current as those with more electrogenic microorganisms however they are able to convert this acetate efficiently into current the electron losses experienced in a mixed biofilm fed a complex substrate are likely to be due to the non electrogenic products such as methane or biomass being formed lee et al 2008 not competition for the acetate 3 4 sulphate has a lasting effect on current production but not on coulombic efficiency due to the development of a cryptic sulphur pathway we expected sulphate to act as an electron acceptor muyzer and stams 2008 rabus et al 2013 and to compete with the anode for the reducing equivalents embedded in the organic compounds in the waste and thus divert electrons away from the electrogenic microorganisms logan et al 2019 reducing current production and coulombic efficiency in bes to test this hypothesis we compared current production in systems acclimatised in the presence and absence of sulphate fig 1a and 1b there was indeed a reduction in current production 53 2 with acetate and sulphate and on average 35 3 with complex carbohydrates and sulphate in the reactors acclimatised with sulphate this resulted in the reactors acclimatised with carbohydrates being 83 93 lower than the acetate control this was a lasting effect when these sulphate acclimated reactors were fed without sulphate added condition 2 and 4 current production only slightly increased 1 3 on average that is was essentially the same as the current produced in these reactors in the presence of sulphate condition 1 and 3 t test p 0 05 fig 1b interestingly current production increased substantially 67 8 on average when the reactors were switched from the acclimation substrate to acetate plus sulphate condition 3 but did not increase any further when the reactors were operated with acetate only condition 4 fig 1b there were two major differences between the sulphate acclimated series of reactors and the reactors that had never been exposed to sulphate firstly upon being switched to acetate the current production in the sulphate acclimated systems decreased with increasing complexity of the substrate secondly current production was consistently lower than in the comparable systems acclimatised in the absence of sulphate 13 0 69 5 it is clear that the capacity to produce current was diminished by acclimation with sulphate analysis and evaluation of the biofilms developed in these systems places this into context in the reactor using acetate as substrate with acclimation to sulphate geobacteraceae numbers in the anodic biofilm were 5 3 0 4 108 cells per anode a reduction of 36 5 compared to the reactor acclimated with acetate only when complex carbohydrates were substrates acclimation with sulphate reduced the number of geobacteraceae by between 91 2 and 95 2 only 4 0 0 3 107 to 7 4 0 5 107 geobacteraceae per anode were present in these reactors the majority of geobacteraceae appear to have been replaced by either the uncultured family bva18 or carbohydrates degraders such as ruminococcaceae and aeromonadaceae chung and okabe 2009 xia et al 2015 fig 2 we conclude that the presence of sulphate at the acclimation stage seriously reduced the geobacteraceae numbers resulting in a lower capacity for current production in these reactors than the ones acclimatised without sulphate these results indicate that sulphate has a multifaceted effect on and in these systems its presence during the acclimation period results in a substantial reduction of geobacteraceae in the anodic biofilm as well as of current production but this reduction of geobacteraceae may be due to competition for space on the anode rather than for electrons in substrates once the biofilm is established current production is no longer affected by the presence of sulphate fig 1b this suggests that there was a cryptic sulphur pathway which was surprisingly as fast and efficient in donating electrons to the anode as the direct electrogenic oxidation of organics an analysis of the coulombic efficiency supports this premise as it shows that withdrawing sulphate conditions 2 and 4 similarly resulted in virtually no gain in coulombic efficiency relative to the ones with sulphate present conditions 1 and 3 fig 1d another explanation for this observation would be that the sulphate reducers were either dead or no longer active however sulphate was being removed from the reactors accounting for 23 8 and 28 8 of substrate consumption when fed using the acclimatisation protocol condition 1 or with acetate condition 3 respectively indicating that the sulphate reducers were active moreover at the end of the tests of these two conditions very little sulphide the product of sulphate reduction was detected accounting for 1 9 and 3 3 of substrate consumption respectively this suggests the presence of a cryptic sulphur pathway that recycled electrons from sulphate reduction was active in the reactors acclimatised with sulphate to understand how the cryptic sulphur pathway funnelled electrons from sulphate reduction into electrical current targeted experiments were performed in the acetate and sulphate acclimatised reactor in this reactor the amount of sulphide formed was much lower than the amount of sulphate removed indicating that most of the sulphide produced was oxidized when fed sulphide only this reactor produced 0 83 ma current indicating that sulphide oxidization was coupled to donation of electrons to the anode it was hypothesized that poly sulphur was produced from sulphide oxidation sem images and edx date fig s2 showed that sulphur did deposit on the anode surface of reactor acclimatised with acetate and sulphate with blank media alone this reactor produced no current which means that electrogenic elemental sulphur oxidation to sulphate zhang et al 2014 did not occur in this reactor adding acetate in blank media on the other hand resulted in sulphide formation indicating the sulphur deposits in the biofilm served as electron acceptor and were reduced to sulphide thus sulphide was the only electrogenic sulphur species in this cryptic sulphur pathway and there was a sulphide sulphur shuttle rather than a complete sulphate cycle to channel electrons from sulphate reduction fig 4 a thermodynamic analysis fig 5 provides perspective and illustrates how sulphide concentrations needed to sustain this pathway depend on the anode potential thauer et al 1977 sulphate and sulphur reduction are exergonic ch3coo so4 2 hs 2hco3 δg o 47 6 kj ch3coo 4s0 4h2o 4hs 2hco3 5h δg o 6 7 kj under standard conditions 1 m the minimum anode potentials for acetate oxidation and for sulphide oxidation are essentially the same e o of hco 3 acetate 280 mv and e o of s 0 hs 267 mv however the energetics of sulphide oxidation hs h s0 h 2e δg o 51 5 kj are more strongly affected by the anode potential than the energetics of acetate oxidation ch3coo 4h2o 2hco3 9h 8e δg o 216 3 kj thus in reactors like ours which were operated at 0 mv the theoretical minimum sulphide concentration required to sustain a cryptic sulphur cycle is about 10 9m while the minimum acetate concentration that can sustain current at 0 mv is 10 38m that is about 1029 fold lower thus while a sulphide driven cryptic sulphur cycle is thermodynamically feasible at 0 mv at lower anode potentials the sulphide levels needed to sustain such a cycle may not be attained further research is needed to experimentally establish these electrochemical limits especially the extent to which sulphate and sulphur metabolism actually occur in bioreactors as this is not dictated by thermodynamics alone cetecioglu et al 2019 further experiments showed that the coulombic efficiency decreased up to 20 when the proportion of electrons that were accepted by sulphate increased at either lower cod sulphate ratios or lower anode potentials tables s1 and s2 this indicates that the electron loss by sulphate reduction still occurred even with the presence of the sulphide sulphur shuttle and became more prominent when sulphate reduction increased desulfovibrionaceae were the only classic sulphate reducers in the reactors acclimatised with sulphate and occupied a low proportion 1 7 8 3 of the anodic microbial communities fig 2 desulfovibrionaceae can grow on a number of different fermentative metabolites muyzer and stams 2008 this suggests that in the present study desulfovibrionaceae were the main sulphur and sulphate reducers in anodic chamber the uncultured family desulfuromonadales bva18 increased with the acclimatisation to sulphate there is little available data about this family their closest cultured relative is geobacter psychrophilus schmidt 2016 thus while the presence of bva18 increased in the acclimatised reactors their role remains unclear and needs further studies on both taxonomy and metabolic pathway the experiments show that after acclimation at a cod sulphate ratio of 1 33 mg mg and anode potential of 0 mv sulphate reduction had a negligible effect on current production and coulombic efficiency in any of our reactors however the presence of sulphate may well change the biofilm in the long term due to build up of poly sulphur deposits that could occlude the anode conceptually there is no sulphate threshold for this phenomenon to occur every sulphur produced may conceivably stay in the biofilm therefore it will be prudent to evaluate bes performance over longer periods and a range of cod sulphate ratios to assemble the full picture of the impact of wastewater composition and complexity on bes and if we wish to use wastewater as energy source in this context dai et al 2019 mccarty et al 2011 4 conclusions using carbohydrates and sulphate as test compounds this study unravelled the impacts of two salient wastewater characteristics substrate complexity and presence of alternative electron acceptors on current production and coulombic efficiency of bess the combination of carbohydrates and sulphate reduced current production by interfering with geobacteraceae colonisation in the anodic biofilm coulombic efficiency was essentially only affected by hydrolysis not by sulphate the impact of sulphate reduction was minimised by sulphide sulphur shuttle these losses of current and coulombic efficiency are at present completely unavoidable in bes fed with real wastewater it follows that the losses should feature prominently into predictions of the performance and societal impact of such reactors and plans for their improvement the rationale and approach of this study can serve as a guiding framework for future studies on the impact of the

17977,bioelectrochemical systems bes have long been viewed as a promising wastewater treatment technology however in reality the performance of bioelectrochemical systems fed with real and therefore complex wastewaters is often disappointing we have sought to investigate the combined impacts of complex substrates and presence of electron acceptors in particular this study illustrates and systematically evaluates the disparity in performance between a bes acclimatised with acetate and those acclimatised with more complex carbohydrates glucose sucrose or starch and in the presence and absence of sulphate relative to acetate only operating with complex carbohydrates reduced current by 73 87 and coulombic efficiency by 4 50 acclimation with complex carbohydrates seriously impeded the colonisation anode by geobacteraceae resulting in substantially reduced capacity to produce current 60 2 on average combined acclimation with sulphate further reduced current by 35 on average and resulted in a total reduction of 83 93 relative to the acetate control however the presence of an electrogenic sulphide sulphur shuttle meant sulphate had little effect on the coulombic efficiency of the bes the results indicate that a reduction in current and coulombic efficiency is at present an unavoidable consequence of operating a bes fed with complex wastewater researchers designers and policy makers should incorporate such losses in both their plans and their prognostications graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioelectrochemical systems carbohydrate sulphate 1 introduction bioelectrochemical systems bes are viewed as a promising wastewater treatment technology in principle they can remove waste whilst producing energy or valuable chemicals he et al 2017 logan and rabaey 2012 their ability to remove chemical oxygen demand cod sulphate ammonia phosphate and heavy metal in wastewater has been demonstrated coma et al 2013 kelly and he 2014 liang et al 2018 wang and ren 2014 however the potential to be energy positive is what makes bes technology exciting to achieve this efficient electron scavenging from wastewater is required improvements in reactor configuration logan et al 2015 electrode material sonawane et al 2017 and operation kaur et al 2014 have increased bes performance however when fed with real wastewater this performance remains problematic with serious implications for the prospects for bes as a treatment technology bess fed with acetate a simple readily degradable substrate can produce high current densities and coulombic efficiencies of up to 0 99 ma cm2 and 100 respectively fan et al 2007 nevin et al 2008 yet the disparity between the performances of bess operated on acetate and wastewater is huge in studies which directly compare acetate to wastewater in the same reactors current density has been observed to decrease by 67 at lab scale dhar and lee 2014 while power density decreased by 95 at pilot scale of 1000l liang et al 2018 the utilization of wastewater by bes is not just slow but also incomplete the coulombic efficiency with raw wastewater is often less than 20 pandey et al 2016 the use of real wastewaters has implications for the abiotic aspects of these systems such as low conductivity typically 1 ms cm and ph gradients rozendal et al 2008 as well as the biotic aspects the biotic factors include microbial diversity stratford et al 2014 competition parameswaran et al 2009 and substrate heterogeneity pandey et al 2016 the limited performance of wastewater fed bess is well known he et al 2017 but not well understood there is clearly a need for a more systematic approach to this problem that will take us at least some of the way towards an understanding of the disparity between performance of acetate and wastewater fed bess zhao et al 2020 one rational approach to understanding the impact of wastewater complexity on bes would be to start with basic components in wastewater integrating the most fundamental aspects first and then stepwise adding more complexity to assemble a full picture of the complex network of interactions in wastewater two obvious and important differences between wastewater and acetate medium are i most electron donors in wastewater need to be anaerobically converted into smaller molecules before they can be used by electrogenic microorganisms at the bio anode logan et al 2019 while acetate is a simple molecules that can be directly used by electrogenic microorganisms ii wastewater usually contains electron acceptors such as nitrite and sulphate that compete and interfere with the electron accepting function of the anode ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 whereas an artificial acetate media does not understanding the interplay between substrate complexity and alternative electron acceptors on the performance of bes is expected to shed some light on the fundamental aspects of the impact of wastewater complexity on this technology anaerobic carbohydrate degradation is a common organic removal process in wastewater treatment it helps bes to take up complex organics as electrogenic microorganisms have limited ability of to use complex organics as substrate catal et al 2011 logan et al 2019 in bes the rate of carbohydrate degradation through hydrolysis and fermentation is thought to be limiting reducing the rate at which current is produced velasquez orta et al 2011 zhao et al 2020 carbohydrate degradation gives rise to the formation of carbohydrate degrading biomass and can also give rise to methanogenesis both pathways cause a loss of coulombic efficiency lee et al 2008 sulphate is a common electron acceptor in environmental waste streams and frequently the major alternative electron acceptor in bess fed with municipal wastewater zhang et al 2013 petropoulos et al 2019 however the products of sulphate reduction such as sulphide and sulphur are potentially electrogenic therefore unlike other terminal electron acceptors such as nitrite or carbon dioxide that often bind electrons permanently sulphate receives electrons and then delivers them to the anode via direct electrogenic oxidation of sulphur species dutta et al 2009 sun et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 this pathway can interact with the function of bes recycling the electrons from sulphate reduction boosting coulombic efficiency individually the presence of either complex carbohydrate or sulphate as components in the substrate can affect the performance of a bes however these two components also interact with the ability to use a wide range of substrates sulphur reducers might help bes to utilize complex carbohydrates via alternative processes by forming electrogenic sulphur species muyzer and stams 2008 this might either attenuate the accumulation of rate limiting intermediates and products of carbohydrate degradation and recover them as current or force them into a less efficient electrogenic pathway increasing the disparity of the performance between bes with and without sulphate thus the coexistence of just two fundamental components of wastewater carbohydrate and sulphate causes already substantial uncertainty into the performance of bes furthermore and in spite of the simplistic belief that acetate is the most readily degradable organic carbon acetate degradation itself is not necessarily easy and straightforward while many sulphate reducers oxidize complex organics to co2 there is also a substantial group of incomplete oxidizers that stop at acetate rather than co2 rabus et al 2013 another case in point is the oxidation of acetate by an intricate association between geobacter sulfurreducens and a hydrogen utilizing exoelectrogen kimura and okabe 2013 dolfing 2014 it is tempting to speculate that hydrogen utilizing exoelectrogens can take up a similar integrative role by simultaneously removing hydrogen that leaks away during degradation of more complex carbon sources which in turn may affect acetate degradation by g sulfurreducens like electrogens the aim of this study is to illustrate and evaluate the combined impact of two representative wastewater components carbohydrate and sulphate on the performance of bes with acetate acclimatised reactor as positive control the carbohydrates in order of increasing complexity were glucose sucrose and starch glucose is fermentable to produce simple electrogenic compounds and the basic unit for building complex carbohydrates sucrose is a disaccharide that consists of two glucose moieties with a glycosidic bond starch is a complex carbohydrate that is composed of a chain of glucose molecules with glycosidic bonds the substrates were provided at concentrations equivalent to 640mgcod l which simulated the cod of high strength domestic wastewater wastewater treatment is complex and multifaceted this study tackles one aspect of this complexity demonstrating a rigorous and systematic methodology as to how such challenges can be approached 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor design eight tubular two chamber reactors were constructed by combining two tubular acrylic vessels with an individual working volume of 78 5 ml as

bes to evaluate the combined impact of carbohydrates and sulphate on the performance of bes the individual impacts need to be specified therefore the reactors were tested under four conditions table 1 condition 1 was the condition under which the individual reactors were acclimatised this condition provided the baseline to the other tests under condition 2 the sulphate was absent while under condition 3 carbohydrate were replaced by acetate these conditions allowed specific evaluation of the presence of sulphate and carbohydrates in reactors acclimated to these components under condition 4 both components were absent allowing evaluation of the combined effects of these components on the acclimation of the reactors the concentrations of the test substrates were as described in 2 3 above the tests for the individual conditions were run until current production dropped to 0 5 ma the concentrations of sulphate sulphide cod and toc were measured at the start and the end of the tests after the tests under condition 2 3 and 4 all the reactors were switched back to condition 1 overnight to stabilize the microbial communities the peak current production and the coulombic efficiency of each test were recorded for further analysis 2 5 characterising the reduction of sulphate in bes to separate the mechanisms behind the impact of sulphate reduction on the performance of bes the sulphur pathway in the reactor acclimatised with sulphate and acetate was deciphered to do this the potential occurrence of downstream reactions of sulphate reduction was examined by four tests i sulphate reduction by measuring the concentration of sulphate and sulphide in both influent and effluent in condition 1 as specified in table 1 ii electrogenic sulphide oxidation by feeding 1 2 g l sodium sulphide hydrate na2s 9h2o only this test was only carried out for 2 h because of concern for the high toxicity of sulphide and excessive accumulation of sulphur deposits scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx were used to examine the presence of sulphur on the anode iii electrogenic elemental sulphur oxidation by feeding with blank media iv sulphur reduction by measuring the concentration of acetate sulphate and sulphide in both influent and effluent in condition 2 to understand the effect of sulphate reduction on the performance of bess the sulphate and acetate acclimatised reactor was further characterized with regard to a the response to anode potential to give insight into the effect of the applied energy of electrogenic oxidation of acetate on its competitive reaction sulphate reduction and on the performance of bess b the response to the ratio of cod sulphate to demonstrate the effect of sulphate reduction on the performance of bess under the extreme conditions with either high sulphate supply or low acetate supply to investigate the response to anode potentials the reactor was operated with the acclimatisation feed in six individual 24 h cycles with anode potentials of 250mv 150 mv 0 mv 200 mv 500 mv and 700 mv individually then to investigate the response to the ratio of cod sulphate the reactor was supplied with either 0 82 g l sodium acetate and 0 36 g l 0 72 g l 1 08 g l 1 44 g l 2 16 g l sodium sulphate in six cycles or with 0 72 g l sodium sulphate and 0 08 g l 0 21 g l 0 41 g l

filtration syringe filters with 0 2 μm nylon membrane vwr usa the starch samples were not filtered for cod tests toc was determined with a total carbon analyzer toc 5050a shimadzu usa cod was measured with cod kits 25 mg l 1500 mg l merck co inc usa according to the manufacturer s protocol due to the volatile nature of acetate the concentration of acetate was evaluated based on the measurement of toc rather than cod δcodacetate δtocacetate 2 67 the concentration of starch was evaluated only based on cod measurements as starch blocked the sampling needle of the total carbon analyzer cod and toc of glucose and sucrose samples were very consistent this implies that there was no interference of sulphate on cod analysis sulphate was determined by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1000 thermofisher usa sulphide was measured with a sulphide cuvette kit hach usa according to the manufacturer s protocol and read on spectrophotometer dr1900 hach usa all chemical analyses were performed in duplicate the chemical elements on the surface of anode were analysed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx and scanning electron microscopy sem tm3030 benchtop hitachi japan before the tests the carbon felt anodes were cut into half and one half was rinsed with deionized water and individually preserved in 100 ml serum vials under a nitrogen 99 atmosphere and sealed with butyl rubber caps and aluminium crimp seals to prevent oxidation the other half was used for the analysis of the biofilm 2 7 anodic biofilm analysis to evaluate the combined impact of sulphate and carbohydrates at the acclimation stage the anodic biofilms in the bess were analysed to quantify the geobacteraceae number the half of the carbon felt anodes were pinched into small 250 mg 3 mg pieces with sterilized tweezers and transferred into the tubes containing lysing matrix provided in the qbiogene fastdna spin soil kit mp biomedicals uk for homogenisation the dna was then extracted according to the manufacturer s instructions the geobacteraceae number in the dna samples was then quantified by quantitative pcr with forward primer geobacteraceae 494f 5 aggaagcaccggctaactcc 3 and reverse primer

cleaned by ampure bead purification reagent beckmancoulter uk then quantified by a qubit dsdna hs assay kit invitrogen using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer and pooled in equal concentration based on the manufacturer s protocol the sequencing was conducted using an ion torrent personal genome machine life technologies uk with ion 316 chip kit v2 and ion pgm sequencing 200 kit v2 life technologies uk according to the manufacturer s protocol the raw sequencing data was obtained from the ion pgm system and deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database accession number samn13214580 prjna587771 the raw data was then filtered to minimum length of 200bp by qiime denoiser and targeted barcoded genes by matching the genes with the silva database at 97 similarity the operational taxonomic unit

minitab 17 minitab inc usa 3 results and discussion our first task was to produce two sets of reactors whose bioanodes were acclimated under specified conditions one set was acclimated on either acetate glucose sucrose or starch the other set was identical except for the presence of sulphate we then conducted experiments on the acclimated reactors with the acclimated biofilms each test was run until current decreased to 0 5 ma and most substrate had been consumed 74 4 7 9 this meant the run time for the acetate acclimatised reactor was on average 24 h versus 48 h for the reactor acclimatised with acetate plus sulphate the reaction time of reactors acclimatised with glucose or sucrose was much longer as current was sustained over 0 5 ma for about 75 h the current in the reactors acclimatised with starch stayed at around 0 5 ma throughout these were also run for about 75 h when most substrate had been consumed 77 3 6 7 3 1 electron donor complexity decreases current production and coulombic efficiency when the reactors were fed with the same substrates they were acclimated to condition 1 the current production and coulombic efficiency decreased by 73 87 and 4 50 respectively with increasing complexity of electron donor fig 1 a the highest current was observed with acetate 6 2 0 1 ma while current was substantially lower with glucose and sucrose 1 4 0 1 ma and 1 7 0 2 ma respectively the lowest current was observed with the most complex substrate starch 0 8 0 2 ma there was an analogous trend in the coulombic efficiency of the reactors fig 1c highest coulombic efficiency was with acetate 77 5 0 8 coulombic efficiencies with glucose and sucrose were similar but slightly lower 70 2 1 3 and 69 3 2 0 respectively and with starch coulombic efficiency was substantially lower 38 3 5 5 3 2 acclimation with complex carbohydrates reduces geobacteraceae numbers in anodic biofilm the effect of complexity on current production and coulombic efficiency described above was essentially as expected the electrogenic degradation of substrates more complex than acetate requires the involvement of a series of organisms that sequentially degrade these substrates into acetate and other small molecules that can be directly used by electrogenic microorganisms to verify this reasoning we sampled and analysed the anodic biofilms enriched in the four reactors acclimatised in the absence of sulphate the anodic biofilm acclimatised with acetate which had shown by far the highest current production contained 8 4 0 0 108 cells of geobacteraceae a group of frequently observed electrogenic acetate users logan et al 2019 with more complex carbohydrates as acclimation feed which as stated in fig 1a resulted in lower current production the geobacteraceae numbers in these biofilms dropped to as low as 1 6 0 0 108 cells per anode this drop coincided with an increase in the proportional abundance of carbohydrate degraders such as aeromonadaceae and porphyromonadaceae chung and okabe 2009 palakawong na ayudthaya et al 2018 fig 2 the percentage reduction in current density resulting from enriching and feeding with complex substrates was in the range of 73 4 86 8 fig 1a the impact on geobacteraceae population was more varied with reductions between 52 7 and 80 4 3 3 upstream activity limits current production and coulombic efficiency from complex substrates since relative to the acetate control the drop in current production with acclimatised feeds in the reactors acclimatised with complex carbohydrates was greater than the drop in geobacteraceae numbers the activity of the organisms upstream of the electrogenic microorganisms might be rate limiting with acclimatised feeds this is also indicated by the aforementioned observation that it took much longer to consume complex substrates than to consume acetate switching feeds to acetate condition 3 was used to examine this hypothesis and in such condition current production increased by between 15 and 24 6 fig 1a given that starch mineralisation involves hydrolysis as first step and that degradation of sucrose and glucose encompasses fermentation and acidogenesis the results indicate that low acetate supply from hydrolysis and fermentation limited the current production our previous study indicates that the slow conversion of fermentative intermediates such as ethanol and propionate to acetate could be a major reason of this low acetate supply zhao et al 2020 also the potential formation of fermentative electron sinks such as methane and biomass could have diverted electrons away from acetate formation and have decreased the production of acetate lee et al 2008 although when fed with acetate the current production in these systems increased substantially it was still much lower 60 2 on average than in the acetate control fig 1a reflecting the lower numbers of electrogenic microorganisms such as geobacteraceae in these biofilms in fact there was a tenuous linear relationship between the number of geobacteraceae in the reactors and the current produced with acetate in condition 3 indicating that the number of geobacteraceae on the anode affects the current capacity of the reactor fig 3 furthermore while these relative values of current production are of interest batch rates as reported here are of limited value for real life long term operation in continuously fed flow through systems however the coulombic efficiency in condition 3 where all the reactors had their substrate switched to acetate was essentially similar to that of the acetate control fig 1c for the glucose and sucrose acclimated biofilms this increase in coulombic efficiency was relatively minor 8 8 and 19 6 respectively but in the starch acclimatised system the increase was substantial 65 0 we conclude that there are major losses of electrons associated with the hydrolysis of starch and presumably other polymers in bes resulting in a low coulombic efficiency these results indicate that the more varied biofilms created when reactors are acclimated on mixed substrates contain less electrogenic microorganisms and that even when fed acetate these biofilms cannot produce the same current as those with more electrogenic microorganisms however they are able to convert this acetate efficiently into current the electron losses experienced in a mixed biofilm fed a complex substrate are likely to be due to the non electrogenic products such as methane or biomass being formed lee et al 2008 not competition for the acetate 3 4 sulphate has a lasting effect on current production but not on coulombic efficiency due to the development of a cryptic sulphur pathway we expected sulphate to act as an electron acceptor muyzer and stams 2008 rabus et al 2013 and to compete with the anode for the reducing equivalents embedded in the organic compounds in the waste and thus divert electrons away from the electrogenic microorganisms logan et al 2019 reducing current production and coulombic efficiency in bes to test this hypothesis we compared current production in systems acclimatised in the presence and absence of sulphate fig 1a and 1b there was indeed a reduction in current production 53 2 with acetate and sulphate and on average 35 3 with complex carbohydrates and sulphate in the reactors acclimatised with sulphate this resulted in the reactors acclimatised with carbohydrates being 83 93 lower than the acetate control this was a lasting effect when these sulphate acclimated reactors were fed without sulphate added condition 2 and 4 current production only slightly increased 1 3 on average that is was essentially the same as the current produced in these reactors in the presence of sulphate condition 1 and 3 t test p 0 05 fig 1b interestingly current production increased substantially 67 8 on average when the reactors were switched from the acclimation substrate to acetate plus sulphate condition 3 but did not increase any further when the reactors were operated with acetate only condition 4 fig 1b there were two major differences between the sulphate acclimated series of reactors and the reactors that had never been exposed to sulphate firstly upon being switched to acetate the current production in the sulphate acclimated systems decreased with increasing complexity of the substrate secondly current production was consistently lower than in the comparable systems acclimatised in the absence of sulphate 13 0 69 5 it is clear that the capacity to produce current was diminished by acclimation with sulphate analysis and evaluation of the biofilms developed in these systems places this into context in the reactor using acetate as substrate with acclimation to sulphate geobacteraceae numbers in the anodic biofilm were 5 3 0 4 108 cells per anode a reduction of 36 5 compared to the reactor acclimated with acetate only when complex carbohydrates were substrates acclimation with sulphate reduced the number of geobacteraceae by between 91 2 and 95 2 only 4 0 0 3 107 to 7 4 0 5 107 geobacteraceae per anode were present in these reactors the majority of geobacteraceae appear to have been replaced by either the uncultured family bva18 or carbohydrates degraders such as ruminococcaceae and aeromonadaceae chung and okabe 2009 xia et al 2015 fig 2 we conclude that the presence of sulphate at the acclimation stage seriously reduced the geobacteraceae numbers resulting in a lower capacity for current production in these reactors than the ones acclimatised without sulphate these results indicate that sulphate has a multifaceted effect on and in these systems its presence during the acclimation period results in a substantial reduction of geobacteraceae in the anodic biofilm as well as of current production but this reduction of geobacteraceae may be due to competition for space on the anode rather than for electrons in substrates once the biofilm is established current production is no longer affected by the presence of sulphate fig 1b this suggests that there was a cryptic sulphur pathway which was surprisingly as fast and efficient in donating electrons to the anode as the direct electrogenic oxidation of organics an analysis of the coulombic efficiency supports this premise as it shows that withdrawing sulphate conditions 2 and 4 similarly resulted in virtually no gain in coulombic efficiency relative to the ones with sulphate present conditions 1 and 3 fig 1d another explanation for this observation would be that the sulphate reducers were either dead or no longer active however sulphate was being removed from the reactors accounting for 23 8 and 28 8 of substrate consumption when fed using the acclimatisation protocol condition 1 or with acetate condition 3 respectively indicating that the sulphate reducers were active moreover at the end of the tests of these two conditions very little sulphide the product of sulphate reduction was detected accounting for 1 9 and 3 3 of substrate consumption respectively this suggests the presence of a cryptic sulphur pathway that recycled electrons from sulphate reduction was active in the reactors acclimatised with sulphate to understand how the cryptic sulphur pathway funnelled electrons from sulphate reduction into electrical current targeted experiments were performed in the acetate and sulphate acclimatised reactor in this reactor the amount of sulphide formed was much lower than the amount of sulphate removed indicating that most of the sulphide produced was oxidized when fed sulphide only this reactor produced 0 83 ma current indicating that sulphide oxidization was coupled to donation of electrons to the anode it was hypothesized that poly sulphur was produced from sulphide oxidation sem images and edx date fig s2 showed that sulphur did deposit on the anode surface of reactor acclimatised with acetate and sulphate with blank media alone this reactor produced no current which means that electrogenic elemental sulphur oxidation to sulphate zhang et al 2014 did not occur in this reactor adding acetate in blank media on the other hand resulted in sulphide formation indicating the sulphur deposits in the biofilm served as electron acceptor and were reduced to sulphide thus sulphide was the only electrogenic sulphur species in this cryptic sulphur pathway and there was a sulphide sulphur shuttle rather than a complete sulphate cycle to channel electrons from sulphate reduction fig 4 a thermodynamic analysis fig 5 provides perspective and illustrates how sulphide concentrations needed to sustain this pathway depend on the anode potential thauer et al 1977 sulphate and sulphur reduction are exergonic ch3coo so4 2 hs 2hco3 δg o 47 6 kj ch3coo 4s0 4h2o 4hs 2hco3 5h δg o 6 7 kj under standard conditions 1 m the minimum anode potentials for acetate oxidation and for sulphide oxidation are essentially the same e o of hco 3 acetate 280 mv and e o of s 0 hs 267 mv however the energetics of sulphide oxidation hs h s0 h 2e δg o 51 5 kj are more strongly affected by the anode potential than the energetics of acetate oxidation ch3coo 4h2o 2hco3 9h 8e δg o 216 3 kj thus in reactors like ours which were operated at 0 mv the theoretical minimum sulphide concentration required to sustain a cryptic sulphur cycle is about 10 9m while the minimum acetate concentration that can sustain current at 0 mv is 10 38m that is about 1029 fold lower thus while a sulphide driven cryptic sulphur cycle is thermodynamically feasible at 0 mv at lower anode potentials the sulphide levels needed to sustain such a cycle may not be attained further research is needed to experimentally establish these electrochemical limits especially the extent to which sulphate and sulphur metabolism actually occur in bioreactors as this is not dictated by thermodynamics alone cetecioglu et al 2019 further experiments showed that the coulombic efficiency decreased up to 20 when the proportion of electrons that were accepted by sulphate increased at either lower cod sulphate ratios or lower anode potentials tables s1 and s2 this indicates that the electron loss by sulphate reduction still occurred even with the presence of the sulphide sulphur shuttle and became more prominent when sulphate reduction increased desulfovibrionaceae were the only classic sulphate reducers in the reactors acclimatised with sulphate and occupied a low proportion 1 7 8 3 of the anodic microbial communities fig 2 desulfovibrionaceae can grow on a number of different fermentative metabolites muyzer and stams 2008 this suggests that in the present study desulfovibrionaceae were the main sulphur and sulphate reducers in anodic chamber the uncultured family desulfuromonadales bva18 increased with the acclimatisation to sulphate there is little available data about this family their closest cultured relative is geobacter psychrophilus schmidt 2016 thus while the presence of bva18 increased in the acclimatised reactors their role remains unclear and needs further studies on both taxonomy and metabolic pathway the experiments show that after acclimation at a cod sulphate ratio of 1 33 mg mg and anode potential of 0 mv sulphate reduction had a negligible effect on current production and coulombic efficiency in any of our reactors however the presence of sulphate may well change the biofilm in the long term due to build up of poly sulphur deposits that could occlude the anode conceptually there is no sulphate threshold for this phenomenon to occur every sulphur produced may conceivably stay in the biofilm therefore it will be prudent to evaluate bes performance over longer periods and a range of cod sulphate ratios to assemble the full picture of the impact of wastewater composition and complexity on bes and if we wish to use wastewater as energy source in this context dai et al 2019 mccarty et al 2011 4 conclusions using carbohydrates and sulphate as test compounds this study unravelled the impacts of two salient wastewater characteristics substrate complexity and presence of alternative electron acceptors on current production and coulombic efficiency of bess the combination of carbohydrates and sulphate reduced current production by interfering with geobacteraceae colonisation in the anodic biofilm coulombic efficiency was essentially only affected by hydrolysis not by sulphate the impact of sulphate reduction was minimised by sulphide sulphur shuttle these losses of current and coulombic efficiency are at present completely unavoidable in bes fed with real wastewater it follows that the losses should feature prominently into predictions of the performance and societal impact of such reactors and plans for their improvement the rationale and approach of this study can serve as a guiding framework for future studies on the impact of the complexity of real wastewater on bes performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17978,the corrosion and scaling phenomenon have crucial impact on drinking water distribution systems dwds which might lead to pipe blockage or leakage colored water and other chemical stability issues in this study a simulating pipe system with continuous water flow was prepared to investigate the characteristics of corrosion and scaling on ductile iron pipe transporting ground water with sodium hypochlorite naocl disinfection electrochemical assays such as polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectra were applied to monitor the corrosion and scaling process results showed the morphology and components of scale were closely related with the electrochemical analysis results the corrosion current density decreased continuously as corrosion and scaling proceeded the process could be divided into three stages during stage i 0 20 days the corrosion current intensity of low naocl dosage experiments 1 2 mg l were higher than those of high naocl dosage experiments 5 10 mg l the difference could be explained by different oxidation potentials ph and caco3 deposition during stage ii 20 80 days higher proportions of fe3o4 in scale in experiments with no or low naocl dosages restrained the corrosion process and presented smaller corrosion current subsequently the ductile iron surface became passivated and the difference of various naocl dosages affecting corrosion and scaling process turned to be negligible during stage iii 80 90 days a negative linear relationship between the proportion of stable scale component and the corrosion current density was established besides the direct corrosion reaction with iron substrate naocl dosing was accompanied by an increase in ph and calcium carbonate precipitation potential values which affected the early period corrosion and scaling phenomenon greatly graphical abstract image 1 keywords corrosion scaling ductile iron pipe chlorine dosage electrochemical behavior drinking water 1 introduction iron pipes have been used extensively in drinking water distribution systems dwdss all over the world sancy et al 2010 iron pipes account for more than 56 6 of pipes in north america and even exceed 90 in some cities świetlik et al 2012 more than 85 of the recently constructed water mains of dwds are ductile iron pipes in china guo 2016 however internal corrosion and scale formation often occur inevitably in the dwdss which is caused by the interaction between pipe material and water the corrosion and scaling process has many negative effects on drinking water supply such as hydraulic capacity reduction water quality deterioration pipe material destruction and microbial proliferation peng et al 2012 yang et al 2012 thus research on corrosion and the corresponding scale formation is useful for global water industries shi et al 2018 typical corrosion scales generally showed the structure of three layers an inner porous layer that wraps the metal floor a compact shell like layer and a loose sediment layer that occurs on the top sancy et al 2010 sarin et al 2001 2004a the main components of the inner porous corrosion layer are lepidocrocite γ feooh ferrous hydroxide fe oh 2 hematite fe2o3 and ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 whereas those of the compact shell like scale layer are magnetite fe3o4 and goethite α feooh among them the unstable γ feooh often indicate the active and quick corrosion process whereas the compact fe3o4 and α feooh indicates a passivated process li et al 2016 tang et al 2006 however only a few reports exist on the detailed formation dynamic of these chemicals during corrosion process in dwds corrosion and scale formation processes are influenced significantly by feed water quality such as chlorides sulfates ph dissolved oxygen do disinfectant alkalinity and hardness and so on liang et al 2013 liu et al 2013 chloride and sulfate are well known corrosive ions which can break the scale benefit the release of iron chemicals inside and bring the red or yellow water phenomenon mi et al 2016 hu et al reported that an increase in chloride and sulfate accelerated the corrosion process whereas alkalinity and hardness presented an opposite effect hu et al 2018 mcneill et al revealed that corrosion processed more quickly as ph decreased in the ph range of 7 9 mcneill and edwards 2001 do is an important oxidant and electron acceptor in iron corrosion some investigators reported an increased corrosion rate often brought by increase in do whereas sarin at el declared that an increase in do favored stable corrosion scale formation and inhibited iron release from scale sarin et al 2004b besides do disinfectants also impact corrosion and scaling process tuthill et al reported that the corrosion rate of cast iron increased significantly as the increase of residual chlorine no water quality was given in this paper tuthill et al 1998 eisner et al confirmed this finding in water with a low alkalinity 33 mg l and low hardness 44 mg l eisner and gagnon 2004 however guo 2016 indicated that chlorine 1 mg l processed corrosion slowly on ductile iron in drinking water with a high alkalinity 112 mg l and high hardness 237 mg l 2001 moor et al reported high alkalinity restrained the effect of chlorine on iron corrosion initially while low alkalinity did not thus it is concluded that the effect of chlorine on corrosion will be affected greatly by the alkalinity and hardness in the water the alkalinity and hardness formed by hco3 co3 2 ca2 and mg2 in water also determine the caco3 deposition on the pipe surface calcium carbonate caco3 has been detected frequently as an important deposition on pipe surface in many reports hu et al 2018 tang et al 2006 meanwhile the magnesium precipitation chemicals i e mg oh 2 or mgco3 can hardly be formed in ground water under the normal temperature and ph according to their ksp values supporting information 1 caco3 precipitation has been proposed to control iron corrosion because it can hinder oxygen diffusion and provide a passivation effect umoru et al 2012 while some other researchers reported different results li et al 2019 clearly the interaction between corrosion and scaling deposits is complicated and related closely to water quality and physiochemical conditions during scale formation and growth zhu et al 2018 the iron release behavior brought by the chemical stability in dwds corrosion have been investigated mi et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 bei et al 2019 it is hard to explore the details of corrosion and scaling because of the lack of reliable real time or rapid detection tools li et al 2016 song et al 2016 tang et al 2006 in situ electrochemical assays have been developed in recent years in the domain of corrosion for marine oil gas and circulating cooling water situation these assays provide more information on initial corrosion pitting corrosion crack corrosion rust layer deposition and surface characterization which provides guidance for mechanism development corrosion inhibition passivation control and etc liu et al 2017 morcillo et al 2019 rocca et al 2019 skale et al 2008 yuan and pehkonen 2007 in recent decades more and more water utilities have replaced liquid chlorine by sodium hypochlorite naocl or bleach in china and the u s because of security concerns moreover lower corrosivity was also attained for naocl application wang 2018 although naocl has a similar disinfection capacity to liquid chlorine its influence on corrosion and scaling process could be different because of higher ph values especially in ground water with high hardness thus in this study we investigated the characteristics of early period corrosion and scaling process of ductile iron pipe with a simulating pipe system assembled with ductile iron electrodes under the effect of naocl in ground water with high hardness the objectives of this study include 1 to record the development of corrosion scale and component dynamics during corrosion process by material analysis 2 to investigate the mechanism of corrosion and scaling process by electrochemical assays 3 to establish the relationship between the corrosion and scaling properties with electrochemical parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up of simulating pipe system an electrochemical vessel assembled with new ductile iron pipe coupons was used as the simulating pipe system to investigate the corrosion and scaling characteristics as shown in fig 1 the simulating pipe system was composed of an electrochemical cell three electrodes an electrochemical

determined by acid base titration and edta titrimetric analysis respectively a spectrophotometer dr890 hach company usa was used to measure the chlorine concentration all experiments were performed at room temperature 22 2 c to evaluate the corrosive nature and scaling tendency several water quality indices have been developed such as the larson skold index lr larson and skold 1958 langelier saturation index lsi langelier 1936 and calcium carbonate precipitation potential ccpp merrill and sanks 1977 the description of these parameters and calculation formula are provided in supporting information 3 di water that was prepared by a milli q instrument millipore corp u s was used for comparison the basic water quality items and some chemical stability indices are provided in table 1 2 3 experimental operation and disinfectant addition naocl dosing was used to maintain the tap water with a residual chlorine concentration of 1 2 5 and 10 mg l respectively a higher dosage of disinfectant compared with real drinking water supply system i e 5 and 10 mg l was used to make the impact of naocl addition more obvious a hach dr890 spectrophotometer hach company usa served for chlorine measurement pristine tap water without chlorine addition was used as reference the tap water in our experiments is supplied by ground water with uv disinfection and without chlorine addition another group of simulated system with deionized di water was operated as a control to investigate the impact of ions on corrosion and scaling two same simulated pipe systems were used for every operating condition to ensure repeatability four working electrodes were present in one pipe system among these electrodes one was used for continuous electrochemical testing the other three were taken for periodic destructive scale characterization on day 20 30 90 chlorine dosing was achieved by using sodium hypochlorite naocl bulk naocl solution with 70 mg ml available chlorine analytical

impedance spectra were fitted to the equivalent circuit model by using zsimpwin software wuhan corrtest instruments corp ltd china 2 5 scale characterization scale on the ductile iron electrode surface was taken from the pipe system on the day 20 30 and 90 the scale was scraped gently with a knife and placed in a freeze dryer for 24 h fdu 1100 tokyo rikakikai co ltd japan before pretreatment photographs were taken of the sample by using a digital phone sem analysis was performed to record the scale morphology jsm 7001f field emission sem jeol japan x ray diffraction xrd r axis spider rigaku co japan was used to characterize the crystalline phase using a cu kα at 40 kv and 30 ma the scope range was from 10 to 80 with a 0 1 step the crystalline phase composition was identified by using jade software version 6 5 with standard pdf cards 2004 the quantitative xrd methods for determining the proportions of different solid materials are shown in supporting information 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality of feeding water and effluents the water characteristics were monitored over experiment period the water quality ph do and chlorine between influents and effluents was basically consistent according to table 1 the ground water had high alkalinity high hardness and high concentration of sulfate and chloride as well the larson index 0 42 indicates that this feed water is fairly corrosive the positive langelier index 0 45 and ccpp value 37 20 indicated that this feed water had the tendency to form caco3 precipitation as the increase of naocl dosage the ph chloride concentration and larson index increased correspondingly due to the hydrolysis reaction of naocl the increased ph could also change the hco3 co3 2 equilibrium in the feed water and brought the increase of ccpp and langelier index eqs 1 and 2 eq 1 ph pk a lg c o 3 2 h c o 3 eq 2 ca 2 c o 3 2 c a c o 3 thus compared with that in pristine tap water the higher larson index suggested a higher corrosion tendency and a lower chemical stability whereas the higher langelier index and ccpp index suggested a higher scaling tendency and higher chemical stability considering the contrary effect of these three indices on pipe protection the comprehensive impact of naocl disinfection on corrosion and scaling needs to be investigated comprehensively it is known that the oxidation capacity of hocl 1 49 v is much higher than that of ocl 0 89 v ph determined the proportions of chlorine species i e hocl and ocl in tap water pka of hocl 7 53 high naocl dosage increased ph decreased the proportion of hocl among total chlorine species however the real concentration of hocl was still larger in experimental water with higher naocl addition as indicated by higher orp in table 1 the di water had a low conductivity 3 55 μs cm revealing a high electron transfer resistance its orp was lower 258 8 mv than that of the tap water 574 mv indicating the lower oxidation capacity in di water 3 2 macroscopical morphology of corrosion and scaling product the macroscopical morphology of corrosion and scaling product on ductile iron coupons that had been exposed to tap water with various naocl concentrations was recorded on the day 20 30 and 90 which can be seen in supporting information 5 the surface of the ductile iron coupons in reference tap water and that with low naocl addition 1 2 mg l as cl2 was black brown on the day 20 whereas that with a high dosage of naocl 5 10 mg l as cl2 was reddish brown the corrosion and scaling products had a homogeneous structure and did not cover the ductile iron coupon surface completely until the day 20 some white particles can be seen obviously on the coupon surface under conditions of high naocl addition the surface morphology changed as corrosion and scaling process proceeded on the day 30 the scale merged into a layered structure and some loose yellow corrosion products can be clearly found depositing on the scale after 90 days the scale became denser and thicker and was hard to scrape from the ductile iron coupon it is worthy to mention that the white particles and the corrosion products were connected closely and did not have a distinct boundary which may be denoted as an entire layer 3 3 sem results of corrosion and scaling products sem analysis was conducted to study the corrosion and scaling product microstructure the images taken on the day 20 the day 30 and the day 90 can be seen in fig 2 distinct differences were visible between samples with various naocl dosages revealing the effect of naocl disinfectant on scale formation the scale morphology under sem was dynamic with time as shown in fig 2 a1 the scale composition in pristine tap water was more diversified and was mainly composed of lamellar and cottony structure the lamellar and cotton like materials were speculated as lepidocrocite γ feooh and goethite α feooh respecitively according to previous research li et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 the structures in fig 2 a2 a3 were composed of cotton like substance with a few reed leaf shaped materials probably caco3 deposits however more reed leaf shaped materials dotted with few spherical mineral were visible in samples a4 and a5 with a high naocl addition which might be related to the higher scaling tendency according to the calculated ccpp results rakitin and kichigin 2009 after 30 days operation the globular structure with some flocculent was visible in scale with the chlorine free tap water as shown in fig 2 b1 however the structures of scale with naocl addition remained diversiform such as the triangular structure and blocky structure in sample b2 hexagonal structure in sample b3 and spherical products and snowflake products in samples b4 and b5 after 90 days operation the surface of scales in all five electrodes became denser and thicker the triangular hexagonal and lamellar crystals were not easily visible whereas spherical crystals were in the majority moreover the blocky or reed leaf shaped structures appeared highly integrated with the globular corrosion products which might be functioned as a protective layer 3 4 composition analysis of corrosion and scaling products the proportion of different corrosion and scaling products were determined by xrd analysis as shown in table 2 iron oxides and hydroxides such as α feooh γ feooh fe2o3 and fe3o4 as well as caco3 were the main crystalline minerals in ductile iron scale among the samples in the same batch naocl addition had a large effect on scale components with 1 mg l of cl2 addition γ feooh had the highest proportion at 25 8 followed by fe2o3 24 2 caco3 22 6 α feooh 18 2 and fe3o4 9 2 with an increase in naocl addition the proportion of caco3 increased significantly that of fe2o3 fluctuated slightly and that of γ feooh α feooh and fe3o4 decreased significantly tian et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 naocl dosage affected ph and the proportion of hclo ocl in tap water higher concentration of hocl and ocl could act as an oxidant to oxidize ferrous to ferric hydroxides in tap water eqs 3 and 4 the ferric hydroxide dehydrated slowly to ferric oxides eq 5 thus a higher proportion of fe2o3 was observed as increase of naocl dosage on day 20 eq 3 2 f e 2 h c l o h 2 f e 3 c l h 2 o eq 4 6 f e 2 3 c l o 3 h 2 o 2 f e o h 3 4 f e 3 3 c l eq 5 2 f e o h 3 f e 2 o 3 3 h 2 o on the other hand the hydrolysis of naocl increased ph favored the conversion of bicarbonate into carbonate and yielded higher caco3 precipitation rakitin and kichigin 2009 eqs 1 and 2 therefore an increased proportion of caco3 in the scale component was observed caco3 had the highest proportion once the naocl dosage was exceeded 2 mg l the high alkalinity calcium content and ccpp in the tap water provide a source of caco3 precipitation peng et al 2010 andritsos and karabelas also reported that the caco3 deposition increased from 2 mg cm2 to 12 mg cm2 when ph increased from 8 8 to 10 0 andritsos and karabelas 1999 the fairly high content of caco3 in pipe wall deposition has also been reported in pipes that transport ground water in beijing china yang et al 2012 a comparative study showed that caco3 was detected in much higher proportion than iron products in scale under the condition of high alkalinity contained tap water li et al 2016 as the corrosion and scaling proceeded the proportion of different scale components changed visibly on day 20 the unstable corrosion products such as γ feooh and fe2o3 were in a relatively higher proportion in all electrodes eqs 6 10 γ feooh usually formed during the early stages of corrosion process ma et al 2009 on day 30 the proportion of unstable corrosion products decreased and that of stable corrosion products α feooh and fe3o4 increased on all electrodes the preformed γ feooh in the early stage could transform to α feooh ma et al 2009 eqs 10 and 11 besides the accumulated corrosion and scaling products can hinder do diffusion inside the scale miyata and asakura 2002 the anoxic or anaerobic circumstance in scale favored fe3o4 formation over γ feooh and the preformed ferric oxides or hydroxides act as the new electron acceptors could be transformed to fe3o4 cornell and schwertmann 1996 eqs 12 14 on day 90 the proportion of stable scale components such as caco3 α feooh and fe3o4 increased and accounted for more than 90 of all minerals whereas the content of unstable γ feooh and fe2o3 almost vanished which indicates that the scale in all samples tended to be stable eq 6 2 f e o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e o h 2 eq 7 f e o h 2 1 4 o 2 γ f eooh 1 2 h 2 o eq 8 2 γ f e o o h f e 2 o 3 h 2 o eq 9 2 f e 2 3 h 2 o 2 e f e 2 o 3 6 h eq 10 2 f e 2 1 2 o 2 4 o h 2 α f eooh h 2 o eq 11 γ f eooh α f eooh do eq 12 3 f e o o h

by do presented the highest percentage of fe3o4 after 20 days compared with that in the naocl dosing pipes eq 14 fe3o4 was reported as the main component in the passivated shell layer and could inhibit further corrosion liu et al 2013 sarin et al 2004a the proportion of fe3o4 decreased with the increase in naocl dosage which might be attributed to corrosion products transformation more corrosion products were produced in tap water with zero or low naocl addition i e 0 1 2 mg l more details will be discussed in section 3 5 the continuously accumulated corrosion and scaling products can hinder do diffusion and result in anoxic or anaerobic circumstance in scale miyata and asakura 2002 here the preformed unstable corrosion products used as new electron acceptor and might be transformed into stable corrosion products as shown in eqs 12 14 thus fe3o4 presented higher proportion in reference tap water moreover higher proportion of chloride content in naocl dosing environments eqs 15 18 could destroy the fe o fe linkages in the scale formation and reduce fe3o4 formation ahn et al 2005 cui et al 2016 meng at al 2014 zhang et al 2018 sun et al also reported that the relative abundance of fe3o4 were much lower under disinfected conditions compared with those under raw tap water conditions sun et al 2014 eq 15 h c l o h 2 e c l h 2 o e 0 1 49 v eq 16 c l o h 2 o 2 e c l 2 o h e 0 0 89 v eq 17 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 o h e 0 0 40 v eq 18 f e 2 e f e 2 e 0 0 44 v additionally corrosion scales that were formed in di water appeared slime like deposit the dominant components include fe2o3 α feooh β feooh and γ feooh but no stable fe3o4 the result showed that the lower ion strength restrained the corrosion reaction and yielded less stable corrosion products 3 5 electrochemical analysis of corrosion and scaling process 3 5 1 dynamic of resistance and capacitance of corrosion and scaling layer compared with the destructive sem experiment and component analysis electrochemical assays can provide a non destructive real time and continuous observation of corrosion and scaling process typical electrochemical impedance spectra of ductile iron pipes in tap water with different naocl dosages are shown in supporting information 6 the nyquist results on the day 20 and day 30 showed two capacitive loops shown in supporting information 7 that in the high frequency region 102 hz was associated with the corrosion and scaling layer and another in the low frequency region 10 2 102 hz was possibly related with the electron transfer process rakitin and kichigin 2009 therefore the electrochemical impedance spectra can be fitted using an equivalent circuit that is composed of two capacitive resistances after 80 days operation the loops in the low frequency region disappeared and a nearly ideal warburg tail with an angle of 45 appeared which mean the equivalent circuit changed obviously these electrochemical analyses can result in the values of fitted film resistance rf charge transfer resistance rct film capacitance cf and the calculated 1 cf cf0 supporting information 8 as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 a rf and rct increased rapidly during the first 80 days and became stable gradually illustrating the increase of film resistance and transfer resistance during the first 20 days the rf values of the electrodes with zero or low naocl dosages 1 2 mg l were close and those with high naocl dosages 5 10 mg l were higher after 20 days the rf value in pristine tap water increased more rapidly than others the higher naocl dosage was added in the reactor and the lower rf value was observed as the corrosion and scaling proceeded all electrodes presented a similar rf after 80 days a similar trend resulted for the charge transfer resistance rct as shown in fig 3 b rct was several times larger than rf which indicates that the resistance between the scale and substrate was the corrosion control procedure in fig 3 c the higher film capacitance resulted for low naocl dosage 0 1 2 mg l cl2 than that for higher naocl dosage during the first 20 days the scale coverage increased when naocl dosage increased this result showed that high naocl addition favored the increase of scale surface coverage which might be attributed to the faster scaling caused by orp ph and ccpp elevation with naocl dosage dawson 1990 the xrd results also confirmed that more scaling products such as caco3 could be formed under these circumstances however the film resistance charge transfer resistance and 1 cf cf0 curves in pristine tap water after 20 days showed a quicker upturn than that with naocl dosage it indicates that naocl reduced the film resistance and charge transfer resistance during this stage subsequently all film transfer resistance charge transfer resistance in the systems with different naocl dosages leveled off at the maximum level during stage iii the film capacitances decreased gradually to almost zero at the end of the experiments indicating that the scale layer became dense skale et al 2008 meanwhile the 1 cf cf0 values presented a clear upward trend and tend to be constant 1 0 the results indicated the electrode surface was covered almost completely by corrosion and scaling products in all the corrosion and scaling layer got stable during this process and the difference by different chlorine dosage on the scale variation could be negligible 3 5 2 corrosion current density analysis the dynamic of corrosion current density icorr on the ductile iron electrodes with di water and tap water with naocl disinfection is shown in fig 4 the results were obtained by fitting the polarization curves polarization resistance fitting according to zhu et al 2018 the icorr of the ductile iron electrodes fluctuated slightly in range of 1 0 2 0 μa cm2 in di water which showed the low electron transfer process under this condition liang et al 2013 the icorr values were much higher in tap water than those in di water revealing the higher potential for corrosion in tap water than that in di water which might be caused by the higher ionic strength orp or conductivity in the former liu et al 2017 świetlik et al 2012 yang et al 2014 the curves of icorr values for different naocl dosages all decreased continuously as corrosion and scaling proceeded the corrosion process was divided into three stages stage i 0 20 days stage ii 20 80 days and stage iii 80 90 days according to the dynamic of icorr stage i the icorr was highest for electrodes in tap water with zero or low naocl addition i e 0 1 2 mg l the icorr values for a high naocl addition were lower indicating the inhibition corrosion effect of a high residual concentration of chlorine on the ductile iron as mentioned before naocl has multiple effects on the corrosion and scaling process oxidizing iron to ferrous ions or ferric oxide or hydroxide in bulk water eqs 3 and 4 tuthill et al 1998 bring ph increment that favors caco3 formation and deposition thus with the increase in naocl dosage caco3 takes a higher proportion in scale quickly the caco3 deposit can act as protective layer block the electron transfer and restrain corrosion occurrence as a result the icorr values with high naocl addition were distinctly lower stage ii the icorr values in the chlorine free tap water decreased more rapidly than those in naocl dosing environments after 20 days lower naocl dosage brought more rapid decrease in icorr which might be ascribed to the corrosion and scaling morphology and composition liang et al 2013 the rapid corrosion process in stage i in tap water with zero or low naocl addition i e 0 1 2 mg l resulted in more corrosion products formation indicated by the area covered by corrosion current density curves and the horizontal axis in fig 4 besides the accumulated corrosion and scaling products can hinder do diffusion and result in anoxic or anaerobic circumstance inside the scale miyata and asakura 2002 then the preformed unstable corrosion products might be transformed into stable corrosion products according to eqs 12 14 thus the stable corrosion products fe3o4 presented higher proportion in reference tap water this speculation were also reported by sun et al 2014 however the higher chloride content brought by high naocl dose as shown in table 1 helps to destroy the fe o fe bonds in the scale and reduce the fe3o4 formation cui et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 all these results made that the icorr values in the reference tap water decreased much faster than those for naocl dosing environments at this stage stage iii the icorr with different naocl dosage approached almost the same eventually which shows that the stable corrosion scales were formed and the effect of naocl dosage on corrosion could be neglected then as shown in fig 2 c1 c5 the scale morphology was dense and thick and the globular corrosion product was highly integrated with the blocky or reed leaf shaped structures in all samples which might be functioned as a protective layer against further corrosion the 1 cf cf0 values of all samples were close to 1 0 which suggests that the ductile iron surfaces were covered completely in all experiments the xrd results also confirmed that stable corrosion and scaling products such as fe3o4 α feooh and caco3 accounted for more than 90 of all minerals in this stage the icorr values in tap water were 1 5 3 μa cm2 which is close to a previous report on the formation of the passivation layer yohai et al 2015 thus this relatively stable and well incorporated corrosion and scaling layer blocked the mass transfer process and passivated further corrosion 3 6 conceptual model of corrosion and scaling process according to the above discussion a three stage conceptual model of corrosion and scaling process in reference tap water and tap water with naocl dosing were constructed as shown in fig 5 in fig 5 a and b the corrosion process occurs with dissolved oxygen as the electron acceptor under the situation of reference tap water while free chlorine species i e hocl or ocl acts as the domain electron acceptor under the situation of naocl dosed tap water during stage i meanwhile iron corrosion products emerge more precipitation of caco3 emerged due to the ph increase by higher addition of naocl during stage ii the accumulation of iron corrosion products and caco3 precipitation narrows the electron transmission route as the corrosion process goes on after the whole surface of pipe substrate is covered by dense layer of fe3o4 α feooh and caco3 the electron transmission route is almost completely blocked and the corrosion process arrives the stable stage iii 3 7 correlation between corrosion and scaling composition and electrochemical parameters a linear relationship between the corrosion current density and the sum of the proportions of caco3 fe3o4 and α feooh was established according to table 2 as the operation time prolonged the proportion of stable scale caco3 fe3o4 and α feooh increased whereas icorr decreased the icorr values presented a good linearity that corresponded to the proportion sum of stable corrosion and scale products y 0 172x 18 95 r2 0 81 the negative slope coincides with the proportion increase of stable corrosion products caco3 fe3o4 and α feooh which limits corrosion tang et al 2006 yang et al used the fe3o4 α feooh ratio to evaluate the scale characteristics the ratio in pipe wall transporting surface water is usually higher than that when the scale was relatively stable yang et al 2012 besides the stable fe3o4 component the positive effect of caco3 cannot be ignored the langlier or larson index has been applied to assess the corrosiveness of water the main reason behind these indices is the formation of caco3 under high ph or alkalinity we find that caco3 α feooh and fe3o4 can explain the remediation effect of high ph or alkalinity to handle the red or yellow water problem 4 conclusions an investigation on early period corrosion and scaling for ductile iron pipe was conducted for 90 days with simulating systems with continuous water flow the characteristics of corrosion and scaling with naocl disinfection were detected by morphological observation sem and electrochemical assays such as polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectra the following conclusions were obtained 1 naocl has multiple effects on corrosion and scaling like liquid chlorine naocl can accept electrons from iron substrate or oxidize ferrous ions to ferric oxide or hydroxide in bulk water which enhances corrosion unlike liquid chlorine the alkaline naocl solution favors caco3 formation and deposition especially in high alkalinity and hardness water and present different effect on corrosion 2 early period corrosion and scaling of ductile iron pipe with naocl could be divided into three stages during stage i 0 20 days the higher proportion of caco3 deposition because of the high dosage of naocl covered more surface area enhanced the scale film resistance decreased the corrosion current and restrained the corrosion process during stage ii 20 80 days the accumulation of corrosion products made the scale increasingly integrated a higher proportion of fe3o4 under zero or low dosage of naocl made the scale more compact which restrained electron transition as evidenced by the rapid decrease in icorr the film resistance charge transfer resistance and 1 c c0 curves with no or low naocl addition showed a quicker upturn trend than that with a higher naocl dosing in stage iii 80 90 days the iron substrate surface with different amounts of naocl was covered completely by stable scale their film transfer resistance charge transfer resistance reached a maximum and remained almost constant the effect of chlorine dosage on the scale variation was negligible 3 a negative linear relationship between corrosion current density and the proportional sum of stable scale components including fe3o4 α feooh and caco3 was established giving note to the readers that these high naocl circumstances 5 10 mg l do not typical occur in the distribution system there are three reasons for us to conduct experiments with such high disinfectant dosage first we hope to accelerate the early period corrosion and scaling process in months rather than in years second we hope to enlarge the signals of electrochemical analysis of corrosion and scaling process to allow the more accurate observation moreover high naocl dosage over 10 mg l can be applied in industrial water or wastewater treatment and transportation thus this study may provide some useful information for professionals working in these fields this study focused only on the early period of corrosion and scaling process of ductile iron pipe in tap water with high hardness during longer period operation the caco3 deposition are universal phenomenon on dwds pipe walls in northern china under the circumstances the corrosion and scaling process may be different from the individual process reported a lot before thus the interaction mechanisms of corrosion and scaling need to be investigated comprehensively and the measures to maintain the pipe scale stability also require further studies especially using the in situ electrochemical assays declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17978,the corrosion and scaling phenomenon have crucial impact on drinking water distribution systems dwds which might lead to pipe blockage or leakage colored water and other chemical stability issues in this study a simulating pipe system with continuous water flow was prepared to investigate the characteristics of corrosion and scaling on ductile iron pipe transporting ground water with sodium hypochlorite naocl disinfection electrochemical assays such as polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectra were applied to monitor the corrosion and scaling process results showed the morphology and components of scale were closely related with the electrochemical analysis results the corrosion current density decreased continuously as corrosion and scaling proceeded the process could be divided into three stages during stage i 0 20 days the corrosion current intensity of low naocl dosage experiments 1 2 mg l were higher than those of high naocl dosage experiments 5 10 mg l the difference could be explained by different oxidation potentials ph and caco3 deposition during stage ii 20 80 days higher proportions of fe3o4 in scale in experiments with no or low naocl dosages restrained the corrosion process and presented smaller corrosion current subsequently the ductile iron surface became passivated and the difference of various naocl dosages affecting corrosion and scaling process turned to be negligible during stage iii 80 90 days a negative linear relationship between the proportion of stable scale component and the corrosion current density was established besides the direct corrosion reaction with iron substrate naocl dosing was accompanied by an increase in ph and calcium carbonate precipitation potential values which affected the early period corrosion and scaling phenomenon greatly graphical abstract image 1 keywords corrosion scaling ductile iron pipe chlorine dosage electrochemical behavior drinking water 1 introduction iron pipes have been used extensively in drinking water distribution systems dwdss all over the world sancy et al 2010 iron pipes account for more than 56 6 of pipes in north america and even exceed 90 in some cities świetlik et al 2012 more than 85 of the recently constructed water mains of dwds are ductile iron pipes in china guo 2016 however internal corrosion and scale formation often occur inevitably in the dwdss which is caused by the interaction between pipe material and water the corrosion and scaling process has many negative effects on drinking water supply such as hydraulic capacity reduction water quality deterioration pipe material destruction and microbial proliferation peng et al 2012 yang et al 2012 thus research on corrosion and the corresponding scale formation is useful for global water industries shi et al 2018 typical corrosion scales generally showed the structure of three layers an inner porous layer that wraps the metal floor a compact shell like layer and a loose sediment layer that occurs on the top sancy et al 2010 sarin et al 2001 2004a the main components of the inner porous corrosion layer are lepidocrocite γ feooh ferrous hydroxide fe oh 2 hematite fe2o3 and ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 whereas those of the compact shell like scale layer are magnetite fe3o4 and goethite α feooh among them the unstable γ feooh often indicate the active and quick corrosion process whereas the compact fe3o4 and α feooh indicates a passivated process li et al 2016 tang et al 2006 however only a few reports exist on the detailed formation dynamic of these chemicals during corrosion process in dwds corrosion and scale formation processes are influenced significantly by feed water quality such as chlorides sulfates ph dissolved oxygen do disinfectant alkalinity and hardness and so on liang et al 2013 liu et al 2013 chloride and sulfate are well known corrosive ions which can break the scale benefit the release of iron chemicals inside and bring the red or yellow water phenomenon mi et al 2016 hu et al reported that an increase in chloride and sulfate accelerated the corrosion process whereas alkalinity and hardness presented an opposite effect hu et al 2018 mcneill et al revealed that corrosion processed more quickly as ph decreased in the ph range of 7 9 mcneill and edwards 2001 do is an important oxidant and electron acceptor in iron corrosion some investigators reported an increased corrosion rate often brought by increase in do whereas sarin at el declared that an increase in do favored stable corrosion scale formation and inhibited iron release from scale sarin et al 2004b besides do disinfectants also impact corrosion and scaling process tuthill et al reported that the corrosion rate of cast iron increased significantly as the increase of residual chlorine no water quality was given in this paper tuthill et al 1998 eisner et al confirmed this finding in water with a low alkalinity 33 mg l and low hardness 44 mg l eisner and gagnon 2004 however guo 2016 indicated that chlorine 1 mg l processed corrosion slowly on ductile iron in drinking water with a high alkalinity 112 mg l and high hardness 237 mg l 2001 moor et al reported high alkalinity restrained the effect of chlorine on iron corrosion initially while low alkalinity did not thus it is concluded that the effect of chlorine on corrosion will be affected greatly by the alkalinity and hardness in the water the alkalinity and hardness formed by hco3 co3 2 ca2 and mg2 in water also determine the caco3 deposition on the pipe surface calcium carbonate caco3 has been detected frequently as an important deposition on pipe surface in many reports hu et al 2018 tang et al 2006 meanwhile the magnesium precipitation chemicals i e mg oh 2 or mgco3 can hardly be formed in ground water under the normal temperature and ph according to their ksp values supporting information 1 caco3 precipitation has been proposed to control iron corrosion because it can hinder oxygen diffusion and provide a passivation effect umoru et al 2012 while some other researchers reported different results li et al 2019 clearly the interaction between corrosion and scaling deposits is complicated and related closely to water quality and physiochemical conditions during scale formation and growth zhu et al 2018 the iron release behavior brought by the chemical stability in dwds corrosion have been investigated mi et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 bei et al 2019 it is hard to explore the details of corrosion and scaling because of the lack of reliable real time or rapid detection tools li et al 2016 song et al 2016 tang et al 2006 in situ electrochemical assays have been developed in recent years in the domain of corrosion for marine oil gas and circulating cooling water situation these assays provide more information on initial corrosion pitting corrosion crack corrosion rust layer deposition and surface characterization which provides guidance for mechanism development corrosion inhibition passivation control and etc liu et al 2017 morcillo et al 2019 rocca et al 2019 skale et al 2008 yuan and pehkonen 2007 in recent decades more and more water utilities have replaced liquid chlorine by sodium hypochlorite naocl or bleach in china and the u s because of security concerns moreover lower corrosivity was also attained for naocl application wang 2018 although naocl has a similar disinfection capacity to liquid chlorine its influence on corrosion and scaling process could be different because of higher ph values especially in ground water with high hardness thus in this study we investigated the characteristics of early period corrosion and scaling process of ductile iron pipe with a simulating pipe system assembled with ductile iron electrodes under the effect of naocl in ground water with high hardness the objectives of this study include 1 to record the development of corrosion scale and component dynamics during corrosion process by material analysis 2 to investigate the mechanism of corrosion and scaling process by electrochemical assays 3 to establish the relationship between the corrosion and scaling properties with electrochemical parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up of simulating pipe system an electrochemical vessel assembled with new ductile iron pipe coupons was used as the simulating pipe system to investigate the corrosion and scaling characteristics as shown in fig 1 the simulating pipe system was composed of an electrochemical cell three electrodes an electrochemical working station a peristaltic pump and a feed water tank the electrochemical cell was a 500 ml cylinder type glass vessel with round holes that was assembled with working electrodes a counter electrode and some reference electrodes the electrochemical vessels were filled with tap water by using a peristaltic pump which were operated continuously for 90 days the flow rate and inlet water flow velocity of the simulating pipe system was 15 ml min and 0 04 m s more details could be found in the supporting information 2 due to length limit 2 2 feed water tap water from ground water supply system of tsinghua university was used as the feed water water quality parameters such as ph do conductivity and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured by using a hach hq 40d water quality analyzer chloride and sulfate concentrations were analyzed by using an ion chromatographer thermo dioivex ics 5000 thermo fisher scientific america the alkalinity and hardness of the feed water were determined by acid base titration and edta titrimetric analysis respectively a spectrophotometer dr890 hach company usa was used to measure the chlorine concentration all experiments were performed at room temperature 22 2 c to evaluate the corrosive nature and scaling tendency several water quality indices have been developed such as the larson skold index lr larson and skold 1958 langelier saturation index lsi langelier 1936 and calcium carbonate precipitation potential ccpp merrill and sanks 1977 the description of these parameters and calculation formula are provided in supporting information 3 di water that was prepared by a milli q instrument millipore corp u s was used for comparison the basic water quality items and some chemical stability indices are provided in table 1 2 3 experimental operation and disinfectant addition naocl dosing was used to maintain the tap water with a residual chlorine concentration of 1 2 5 and 10 mg l respectively a higher dosage of disinfectant compared with real drinking water supply system i e 5 and 10 mg l was used to make the impact of naocl addition more obvious a hach dr890 spectrophotometer hach company usa served for chlorine measurement pristine tap water without chlorine addition was used as reference the tap water in our experiments is supplied by ground water with uv disinfection and without chlorine addition another group of simulated system with deionized di water was operated as a control to investigate the impact of ions on corrosion and scaling two same simulated pipe systems were used for every operating condition to ensure repeatability four working electrodes were present in one pipe system among these electrodes one was used for continuous electrochemical testing the other three were taken for periodic destructive scale characterization on day 20 30 90 chlorine dosing was achieved by using sodium hypochlorite naocl bulk naocl solution with 70 mg ml available chlorine analytical reagent shandong xiya reagent chemical industry co ltd linyi china was added to maintain specific chlorine concentration 2 4 electrochemical analysis once the simulation system was in operation the analysis of electrochemical properties and water quality was conducted on the day 1 5 10 20 25 30 40 50 60 80 and 90 all electrochemical tests were carried out on a cs350 electrochemical working station wuhan corrtest instruments corp ltd china equipped with 16 channel expanders polarization curve tests were conducted in range of 0 1 v 0 1 v around the open circuit potential at a scan rate of 10 mv s the electrochemical impedance spectra eis measurements were conducted in the frequency range of 100 khz 10 mhz with a 10 mv amplitude signal and 10 points per frequency decade the acquired impedance spectra were fitted to the equivalent circuit model by using zsimpwin software wuhan corrtest instruments corp ltd china 2 5 scale characterization scale on the ductile iron electrode surface was taken from the pipe system on the day 20 30 and 90 the scale was scraped gently with a knife and placed in a freeze dryer for 24 h fdu 1100 tokyo rikakikai co ltd japan before pretreatment photographs were taken of the sample by using a digital phone sem analysis was performed to record the scale morphology jsm 7001f field emission sem jeol japan x ray diffraction xrd r axis spider rigaku co japan was used to characterize the crystalline phase using a cu kα at 40 kv and 30 ma the scope range was from 10 to 80 with a 0 1 step the crystalline phase composition was identified by using jade software version 6 5 with standard pdf cards 2004 the quantitative xrd methods for determining the proportions of different solid materials are shown in supporting information 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality of feeding water and effluents the water characteristics were monitored over experiment period the water quality ph do and chlorine between influents and effluents was basically consistent according to table 1 the ground water had high alkalinity high hardness and high concentration of sulfate and chloride as well the larson index 0 42 indicates that this feed water is fairly corrosive the positive langelier index 0 45 and ccpp value 37 20 indicated that this feed water had the tendency to form caco3 precipitation as the increase of naocl dosage the ph chloride concentration and larson index increased correspondingly due to the hydrolysis reaction of naocl the increased ph could also change the hco3 co3 2 equilibrium in the feed water and brought the increase of ccpp and langelier index eqs 1 and 2 eq 1 ph pk a lg c o 3 2 h c o 3 eq 2 ca 2 c o 3 2 c a c o 3 thus compared with that in pristine tap water the higher larson index suggested a higher corrosion tendency and a lower chemical stability whereas the higher langelier index and ccpp index suggested a higher scaling tendency and higher chemical stability considering the contrary effect of these three indices on pipe protection the comprehensive impact of naocl disinfection on corrosion and scaling needs to be investigated comprehensively it is known that the oxidation capacity of hocl 1 49 v is much higher than that of ocl 0 89 v ph determined the proportions of chlorine species i e hocl and ocl in tap water pka of hocl 7 53 high naocl dosage increased ph decreased the proportion of hocl among total chlorine species however the real concentration of hocl was still larger in experimental water with higher naocl addition as indicated by higher orp in table 1 the di water had a low conductivity 3 55 μs cm revealing a high electron transfer resistance its orp was lower 258 8 mv than that of the tap water 574 mv indicating the lower oxidation capacity in di water 3 2 macroscopical morphology of corrosion and scaling product the macroscopical morphology of corrosion and scaling product on ductile iron coupons that had been exposed to tap water with various naocl concentrations was recorded on the day 20 30 and 90 which can be seen in supporting information 5 the surface of the ductile iron coupons in reference tap water and that with low naocl addition 1 2 mg l as cl2 was black brown on the day 20 whereas that with a high dosage of naocl 5 10 mg l as cl2 was reddish brown the corrosion and scaling products had a homogeneous structure and did not cover the ductile iron coupon surface completely until the day 20 some white particles can be seen obviously on the coupon surface under conditions of high naocl addition the surface morphology changed as corrosion and scaling process proceeded on the day 30 the scale merged into a layered structure and some loose yellow corrosion products can be clearly found depositing on the scale after 90 days the scale became denser and thicker and was hard to scrape from the ductile iron coupon it is worthy to mention that the white particles and the corrosion products were connected closely and did not have a distinct boundary which may be denoted as an entire layer 3 3 sem results of corrosion and scaling products sem analysis was conducted to study the corrosion and scaling product microstructure the images taken on the day 20 the day 30 and the day 90 can be seen in fig 2 distinct differences were visible between samples with various naocl dosages revealing the effect of naocl disinfectant on scale formation the scale morphology under sem was dynamic with time as shown in fig 2 a1 the scale composition in pristine tap water was more diversified and was mainly composed of lamellar and cottony structure the lamellar and cotton like materials were speculated as lepidocrocite γ feooh and goethite α feooh respecitively according to previous research li et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 the structures in fig 2 a2 a3 were composed of cotton like substance with a few reed leaf shaped materials probably caco3 deposits however more reed leaf shaped materials dotted with few spherical mineral were visible in samples a4 and a5 with a high naocl addition which might be related to the higher scaling tendency according to the calculated ccpp results rakitin and kichigin 2009 after 30 days operation the globular structure with some flocculent was visible in scale with the chlorine free tap water as shown in fig 2 b1 however the structures of scale with naocl addition remained diversiform such as the triangular structure and blocky structure in sample b2 hexagonal structure in sample b3 and spherical products and snowflake products in samples b4 and b5 after 90 days operation the surface of scales in all five electrodes became denser and thicker the triangular hexagonal and lamellar crystals were not easily visible whereas spherical crystals were in the majority moreover the blocky or reed leaf shaped structures appeared highly integrated with the globular corrosion products which might be functioned as a protective layer 3 4 composition analysis of corrosion and scaling products the proportion of different corrosion and scaling products were determined by xrd analysis as shown in table 2 iron oxides and hydroxides such as α feooh γ feooh fe2o3 and fe3o4 as well as caco3 were the main crystalline minerals in ductile iron scale among the samples in the same batch naocl addition had a large effect on scale components with 1 mg l of cl2 addition γ feooh had the highest proportion at 25 8 followed by fe2o3 24 2 caco3 22 6 α feooh 18 2 and fe3o4 9 2 with an increase in naocl addition the proportion of caco3 increased significantly that of fe2o3 fluctuated slightly and that of γ feooh α feooh and fe3o4 decreased significantly tian et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 naocl dosage affected ph and the proportion of hclo ocl in tap water higher concentration of hocl and ocl could act as an oxidant to oxidize ferrous to ferric hydroxides in tap water eqs 3 and 4 the ferric hydroxide dehydrated slowly to ferric oxides eq 5 thus a higher proportion of fe2o3 was observed as increase of naocl dosage on day 20 eq 3 2 f e 2 h c l o h 2 f e 3 c l h 2 o eq 4 6 f e 2 3 c l o 3 h 2 o 2 f e o h 3 4 f e 3 3 c l eq 5 2 f e o h 3 f e 2 o 3 3 h 2 o on the other hand the hydrolysis of naocl increased ph favored the conversion of bicarbonate into carbonate and yielded higher caco3 precipitation rakitin and kichigin 2009 eqs 1 and 2 therefore an increased proportion of caco3 in the scale component was observed caco3 had the highest proportion once the naocl dosage was exceeded 2 mg l the high alkalinity calcium content and ccpp in the tap water provide a source of caco3 precipitation peng et al 2010 andritsos and karabelas also reported that the caco3 deposition increased from 2 mg cm2 to 12 mg cm2 when ph increased from 8 8 to 10 0 andritsos and karabelas 1999 the fairly high content of caco3 in pipe wall deposition has also been reported in pipes that transport ground water in beijing china yang et al 2012 a comparative study showed that caco3 was detected in much higher proportion than iron products in scale under the condition of high alkalinity contained tap water li et al 2016 as the corrosion and scaling proceeded the proportion of different scale components changed visibly on day 20 the unstable corrosion products such as γ feooh and fe2o3 were in a relatively higher proportion in all electrodes eqs 6 10 γ feooh usually formed during the early stages of corrosion process ma et al 2009 on day 30 the proportion of unstable corrosion products decreased and that of stable corrosion products α feooh and fe3o4 increased on all electrodes the preformed γ feooh in the early stage could transform to α feooh ma et al 2009 eqs 10 and 11 besides the accumulated corrosion and scaling products can hinder do diffusion inside the scale miyata and asakura 2002 the anoxic or anaerobic circumstance in scale favored fe3o4 formation over γ feooh and the preformed ferric oxides or hydroxides act as the new electron acceptors could be transformed to fe3o4 cornell and schwertmann 1996 eqs 12 14 on day 90 the proportion of stable scale components such as caco3 α feooh and fe3o4 increased and accounted for more than 90 of all minerals whereas the content of unstable γ feooh and fe2o3 almost vanished which indicates that the scale in all samples tended to be stable eq 6 2 f e o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e o h 2 eq 7 f e o h 2 1 4 o 2 γ f eooh 1 2 h 2 o eq 8 2 γ f e o o h f e 2 o 3 h 2 o eq 9 2 f e 2 3 h 2 o 2 e f e 2 o 3 6 h eq 10 2 f e 2 1 2 o 2 4 o h 2 α f eooh h 2 o eq 11 γ f eooh α f eooh do eq 12 3 f e o o h

by do presented the highest percentage of fe3o4 after 20 days compared with that in the naocl dosing pipes eq 14 fe3o4 was reported as the main component in the passivated shell layer and could inhibit further corrosion liu et al 2013 sarin et al 2004a the proportion of fe3o4 decreased with the increase in naocl dosage which might be attributed to corrosion products transformation more corrosion products were produced in tap water with zero or low naocl addition i e 0 1 2 mg l more details will be discussed in section 3 5 the continuously accumulated corrosion and scaling products can hinder do diffusion and result in anoxic or anaerobic circumstance in scale miyata and asakura 2002 here the preformed unstable corrosion products used as new electron acceptor and might be transformed into stable corrosion products as shown in eqs 12 14 thus fe3o4 presented higher proportion in reference tap water moreover higher proportion of chloride content in naocl dosing environments eqs 15 18 could destroy the fe o fe linkages in the scale formation and reduce fe3o4 formation ahn et al 2005 cui et al 2016 meng at al 2014 zhang et al 2018 sun et al also reported that the relative abundance of fe3o4 were much lower under disinfected conditions compared with those under raw tap water conditions sun et al 2014 eq 15 h c l o h 2 e c l h 2 o e 0 1 49 v eq 16 c l o h 2 o 2 e c l 2 o h e 0 0 89 v eq 17 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 o h e 0 0 40 v eq 18 f e 2 e f e 2 e 0 0 44 v additionally corrosion scales that were formed in di water appeared slime like deposit the dominant components include fe2o3 α feooh β feooh and γ feooh but no stable fe3o4 the result showed that the lower ion strength restrained the corrosion reaction and yielded less stable corrosion products 3 5 electrochemical analysis of corrosion and scaling process 3 5 1 dynamic of resistance and capacitance of corrosion and scaling layer compared with the destructive sem experiment and component analysis electrochemical assays can provide a non destructive real time and continuous observation of corrosion and scaling process typical electrochemical impedance spectra of ductile iron pipes in tap water with different naocl dosages are shown in supporting information 6 the nyquist results on the day 20 and day 30 showed two capacitive loops shown in supporting information 7 that in the high frequency region 102 hz was associated with the corrosion and scaling layer and another in the low frequency region 10 2 102 hz was possibly related with the electron transfer process rakitin and kichigin 2009 therefore the electrochemical impedance spectra can be fitted using an equivalent circuit that is composed of two capacitive resistances after 80 days operation the loops in the low frequency region disappeared and a nearly ideal warburg tail with an angle of 45 appeared which mean the equivalent circuit changed obviously these electrochemical analyses can result in the values of fitted film resistance rf charge transfer resistance rct film capacitance cf and the calculated 1 cf cf0 supporting information 8 as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 a rf and rct increased rapidly during the first 80 days and became stable gradually illustrating the increase of film resistance and transfer resistance during the first 20 days the rf values of the electrodes with zero or low naocl dosages 1 2 mg l were close and those with high naocl dosages 5 10 mg l were higher after 20 days the rf value in pristine tap water increased more rapidly than others the higher naocl dosage was added in the reactor and the lower rf value was observed as the corrosion and scaling proceeded all electrodes presented a similar rf after 80 days a similar trend resulted for the charge transfer resistance rct as shown in fig 3 b rct was several times larger than rf which indicates that the resistance between the scale and substrate was the corrosion control procedure in fig 3 c the higher film capacitance resulted for low naocl dosage 0 1 2 mg l cl2 than that for higher naocl dosage during the first 20 days the scale coverage increased when naocl dosage increased this result showed that high naocl addition favored the increase of scale surface coverage which might be attributed to the faster scaling caused by orp ph and ccpp elevation with naocl dosage dawson 1990 the xrd results also confirmed that more scaling products such as caco3 could be formed under these circumstances however the film resistance charge transfer resistance and 1 cf cf0 curves in pristine tap water after 20 days showed a quicker upturn than that with naocl dosage it indicates that naocl reduced the film resistance and charge transfer resistance during this stage subsequently all film transfer resistance charge transfer resistance in the systems with different naocl dosages leveled off at the maximum level during stage iii the film capacitances decreased gradually to almost zero at the end of the experiments indicating that the scale layer became dense skale et al 2008 meanwhile the 1 cf cf0 values presented a clear upward trend and tend to be constant 1 0 the results indicated the electrode surface was covered almost completely by corrosion and scaling products in all the corrosion and scaling layer got stable during this process and the difference by different chlorine dosage on the scale variation could be negligible 3 5 2 corrosion current density analysis the dynamic of corrosion current density icorr on the ductile iron electrodes with di water and tap water with naocl disinfection is shown in fig 4 the results were obtained by fitting the polarization curves polarization resistance fitting according to zhu et al 2018 the icorr of the ductile iron electrodes fluctuated slightly in range of 1 0 2 0 μa cm2 in di water which showed the low electron transfer process under this condition liang et al 2013 the icorr values were much higher in tap water than those in di water revealing the higher potential for corrosion in tap water than that in di water which might be caused by the higher ionic strength orp or conductivity in the former liu et al 2017 świetlik et al 2012 yang et al 2014 the curves of icorr values for different naocl dosages all decreased continuously as corrosion and scaling proceeded the corrosion process was divided into three stages stage i 0 20 days stage ii 20 80 days and stage iii 80 90 days according to the dynamic of icorr stage i the icorr was highest for electrodes in tap water with zero or low naocl addition i e 0 1 2 mg l the icorr values for a high naocl addition were lower indicating the inhibition corrosion effect of a high residual concentration of chlorine on the ductile iron as mentioned before naocl has multiple effects on the corrosion and scaling process oxidizing iron to ferrous ions or ferric oxide or hydroxide in bulk water eqs 3 and 4 tuthill et al 1998 bring ph increment that favors caco3 formation and deposition thus with the increase in naocl dosage caco3 takes a higher proportion in scale quickly the caco3 deposit can act as protective layer block the electron transfer and restrain corrosion occurrence as a result the icorr values with high naocl addition were distinctly lower stage ii the icorr values in the chlorine free tap water decreased more rapidly than those in naocl dosing environments after 20 days lower naocl dosage brought more rapid decrease in icorr which might be ascribed to the corrosion and scaling morphology and composition liang et al 2013 the rapid corrosion process in stage i in tap water with zero or low naocl addition i e 0 1 2 mg l resulted in more corrosion products formation indicated by the area covered by corrosion current density curves and the horizontal axis in fig 4 besides the accumulated corrosion and scaling products can hinder do diffusion and result in anoxic or anaerobic circumstance inside the scale miyata and asakura 2002 then the preformed unstable corrosion products might be transformed into stable corrosion products according to eqs 12 14 thus the stable corrosion products fe3o4 presented higher proportion in reference tap water this speculation were also reported by sun et al 2014 however the higher chloride content brought by high naocl dose as shown in table 1 helps to destroy the fe o fe bonds in the scale and reduce the fe3o4 formation cui et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 all these results made that the icorr values in the reference tap water decreased much faster than those for naocl dosing environments at this stage stage iii the icorr with different naocl dosage approached almost the same eventually which shows that the stable corrosion scales were formed and the effect of naocl dosage on corrosion could be neglected then as shown in fig 2 c1 c5 the scale morphology was dense and thick and the globular corrosion product was highly integrated with the blocky or reed leaf shaped structures in all samples which might be functioned as a protective layer against further corrosion the 1 cf cf0 values of all samples were close to 1 0 which suggests that the ductile iron surfaces were covered completely in all experiments the xrd results also confirmed that stable corrosion and scaling products such as fe3o4 α feooh and caco3 accounted for more than 90 of all minerals in this stage the icorr values in tap water were 1 5 3 μa cm2 which is close to a previous report on the formation of the passivation layer yohai et al 2015 thus this relatively stable and well incorporated corrosion and scaling layer blocked the mass transfer process and passivated further corrosion 3 6 conceptual model of corrosion and scaling process according to the above discussion a three stage conceptual model of corrosion and scaling process in reference tap water and tap water with naocl dosing were constructed as shown in fig 5 in fig 5 a and b the corrosion process occurs with dissolved oxygen as the electron acceptor under the situation of reference tap water while free chlorine species i e hocl or ocl acts as the domain electron acceptor under the situation of naocl dosed tap water during stage i meanwhile iron corrosion products emerge more precipitation of caco3 emerged due to the ph increase by higher addition of naocl during stage ii the accumulation of iron corrosion products and caco3 precipitation narrows the electron transmission route as the corrosion process goes on after the whole surface of pipe substrate is covered by dense layer of fe3o4 α feooh and caco3 the electron transmission route is almost completely blocked and the corrosion process arrives the stable stage iii 3 7 correlation between corrosion and scaling composition and electrochemical parameters a linear relationship between the corrosion current density and the sum of the proportions of caco3 fe3o4 and α feooh was established according to table 2 as the operation time prolonged the proportion of stable scale caco3 fe3o4 and α feooh increased whereas icorr decreased the icorr values presented a good linearity that corresponded to the proportion sum of stable corrosion and scale products y 0 172x 18 95 r2 0 81 the negative slope coincides with the proportion increase of stable corrosion products caco3 fe3o4 and α feooh which limits corrosion tang et al 2006 yang et al used the fe3o4 α feooh ratio to evaluate the scale characteristics the ratio in pipe wall transporting surface water is usually higher than that when the scale was relatively stable yang et al 2012 besides the stable fe3o4 component the positive effect of caco3 cannot be ignored the langlier or larson index has been applied to assess the corrosiveness of water the main reason behind these indices is the formation of caco3 under high ph or alkalinity we find that caco3 α feooh and fe3o4 can explain the remediation effect of high ph or alkalinity to handle the red or yellow water problem 4 conclusions an investigation on early period corrosion and scaling for ductile iron pipe was conducted for 90 days with simulating systems with continuous water flow the characteristics of corrosion and scaling with naocl disinfection were detected by morphological observation sem and electrochemical assays such as polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectra the following conclusions were obtained 1 naocl has multiple effects on corrosion and scaling like liquid chlorine naocl can accept electrons from iron substrate or oxidize ferrous ions to ferric oxide or hydroxide in bulk water which enhances corrosion unlike liquid chlorine the alkaline naocl solution favors caco3 formation and deposition especially in high alkalinity and hardness water and present different effect on corrosion 2 early period corrosion and scaling of ductile iron pipe with naocl could be divided into three stages during stage i 0 20 days the higher proportion of caco3 deposition because of the high dosage of naocl covered more surface area enhanced the scale film resistance decreased the corrosion current and restrained the corrosion process during stage ii 20 80 days the accumulation of corrosion products made the scale increasingly integrated a higher proportion of fe3o4 under zero or low dosage of naocl made the scale more compact which restrained electron transition as evidenced by the rapid decrease in icorr the film resistance charge transfer resistance and 1 c c0 curves with no or low naocl addition showed a quicker upturn trend than that with a higher naocl dosing in stage iii 80 90 days the iron substrate surface with different amounts of naocl was covered completely by stable scale their film transfer resistance charge transfer resistance reached a maximum and remained almost constant the effect of chlorine dosage on the scale variation was negligible 3 a negative linear relationship between corrosion current density and the proportional sum of stable scale components including fe3o4 α feooh and caco3 was established giving note to the readers that these high naocl circumstances 5 10 mg l do not typical occur in the distribution system there are three reasons for us to conduct experiments with such high disinfectant dosage first we hope to accelerate the early period corrosion and scaling process in months rather than in years second we hope to enlarge the signals of electrochemical analysis of corrosion and scaling process to allow the more accurate observation moreover high naocl dosage over 10 mg l can be applied in industrial water or wastewater treatment and transportation thus this study may provide some useful information for professionals working in these fields this study focused only on the early period of corrosion and scaling process of ductile iron pipe in tap water with high hardness during longer period operation the caco3 deposition are universal phenomenon on dwds pipe walls in northern china under the circumstances the corrosion and scaling process may be different from the individual process reported a lot before thus the interaction mechanisms of corrosion and scaling need to be investigated comprehensively and the measures to maintain the pipe scale stability also require further studies especially using the in situ electrochemical assays declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17979,widespread occurrence of emerging organic contaminants eocs in water have been explicitly associated with adverse effects on human health therefore representing a major risk to public health especially the increased toxicity is frequently observed during the photodegradation of eocs in natural water and even wastewater treatment plants however the culprit of increased toxicity and formation mechanism has yet to be recognized regarding the estrogenic activity in this study by combining laboratory experiments with quantum chemical calculations the induction of human estrogenic activity was investigated using the yeast two hybrid reporter assay during the photodegradation of preservatives ethylparaben ep along with identification of toxic products and formation mechanisms results showed that the increase in estrogenic effect was induced by photochemically generated oligomers rather than the expected oh adduct the maximum estrogenic activity corresponded to the major formation of oligomers while oh adducts were less than 12 two photochemically generated oligomers were found to contribute to estrogenic activity produced from the cleavage of excited triplet state molecules and subsequent radical radical reactions computational toxicology results showed that the increased estrogenic activity was attributed to oligomer 4 hydroxy isophthalic acid 1 ethyl ester 3 4 hydroxy phenyl and its ec50 was lower than that of the parent ep in contrast oh adducts exhibited higher ec50 values than the parent ep while still possessing estrogenic activity therefore more attention should be paid to these photodegradation products of eocs including oh adducts graphical abstract image 1 keywords parabens photochemical transformation degradation mechanism estrogenic effect theoretical calculation 1 introduction due to the widespread occurrence of emerging organic contaminants eocs in water there has been much attention paid to their environmental behaviors and adverse effects on human health fenner et al 2013 especially it is frequently observed the increased toxicity during the photodegradation of eocs in natural water gao et al 2019 rozas et al 2016 and even in real effluent wastewater an et al 2015 klamerth et al 2010 although eocs can be successfully photodegraded to negligible concentration therefore the culprit of increased toxicity and their formation mechanisms is of increasing concern during the photodegradation of eocs in water parabens are an important group of eocs in aquatic environment which for more than a century have been widely used as preservatives in food additives freese et al 1973 cosmetics and pharmaceutical products bledzka et al 2014 boberg et al 2010 in particular parabens with short chain esters are the most commonly used such as methylparaben ethylparaben ep n propylparaben and n butylparaben soni et al 2002 it has been estimated that the annual global consumption of parabens reaches 8000 tons ramaswamy et al 2011 accordingly parabens are detected ubiquitously in various aquatic environments e g wastewater surface water and drinking water with the concentration range of 0 3 30 000 ng l haman et al 2015 and even human body samples guo and kannan 2013 karthikraj et al 2017 paul et al 2005 raza et al 2018 in particular recent studies have suggested that parabens have the potential for carcinogenicity teratogenicity and reproductive toxicology as well as adipogenesis adoamnei et al 2018 darbre and harvey 2008 fransway et al 2019 both in vivo and in vitro results show that parabens have the potential to exert estrogenic activity and could bind to estrogenic receptors causing unwanted effects at concentrations far below those required to induce acute toxicity ramaswamy et al 2011 furthermore adverse effects could be enhanced by photochemical irradiation of parabens fransway et al 2019 lee et al 2017 therefore the photochemical degradation mechanism of parabens in aquatic environments and the consequence of these degradation mechanisms on health effects are of high concern photodegradation is an important process for the transformation of eocs in aquatic environments due to bond breakage and the formation of new products gmurek et al 2017 recent researches have suggested that the photochemical degradation of parabens occurs quickly with exposure to uv gmurek et al 2015 uv c supported oxidants dhaka et al 2018 n doped tio2 petala et al 2015 and photocatalytic ozonation with o3 uv zno asgari et al 2019 under optimum conditions mainly hydroxylation and dealkylation products were reported during the photocatalytic and photochemical degradation of parabens petala et al 2015 hydroxylated products oh products were predicted by theoretical calculations which were found to increase the aquatic toxicity of parabens during oh induced indirect degradation in aquatic environments gao et al 2014 2016 subsequently this finding was confirmed based on the aquatic toxicity of parabens to daphnia magna during their photocatalytic degradation in water hu et al 2019 with transformation products found to be potentially more refractory and toxic to aquatic organisms than the parent compound frontistis et al 2017 gao et al 2016 mendez arriaga et al 2008 olmez hanci et al 2015 estrogenic activity during transformation has rarely been assessed however parabens have been associated with the occurrence of breast cancer due to their estrogenic activity a previous study finding that estrogenic activity increased during the photolytic process of propylparaben in water an et al 2014 while decreasing during its photocatalytic degradation fang et al 2013 this finding indicates that photolytic products are estrogenic and could enhance estrogenic activity which has also been observed during the photolysis of other organic pollutants for example photochemical degradation products that exert estrogenic activity are formed from estrone and bisphenol a frontistis et al 2017 olmez hanci et al 2015 souissi et al 2014 although no photochemical degradation products have been identified due to the poor separation technology of intermediates and the lack of standard samples generally ring hydroxylated products are believed to be responsible for the increased estrogenic activity due to the similarity of their structures with estradiol montero et al 2019 based on this the ring hydroxylated product 3 hydroxy propyl paraben 3 oh ppb was suspected to be responsible for the increased estrogenic activity observed during paraben photolysis an et al 2014 although this remains uncertain due to a lack of direct experimental evident in contrast the decreased estrogenic activity was observed during the photocatalytic degradation of ethyl paraben frontistis et al 2017 and propyl parabens fang et al 2013 in which ring hydroxylated products are the major products these results indicate that unexpectedly the ring hydroxylated products may not be a main contributor to the increase in estrogenic activity in the present study ep was selected as a typical paraben in aquatic environment and the concentrations were detected as high as 0 15 and 9 9 μg l in freshwater water and wastewater treatment plants haman et al 2015 respectively the estrogenic activity evolution was determined during the photochemical transformation

specific experiment to investigate the reactive species in the photodegradation reaction systems 2 2 photochemical transformation experiments the photochemical transformation of ep was performed in a cylindrical quartz reactor diameter 2 4 cm height 20 cm with a double walled cooling water jacket to maintain a constant temperature for solutions throughout all experiments a 1000 w high pressure mercury lamp maximum emission wavelength of 365 nm bilon inc shanghai china was used as a light source after complete stirring the lamp was turned on and 1 5 ml of reaction solution was collected at required time intervals for ep concentration analysis and the identification of photochemical degradation products the pseudo first order rate constant k was used for the description of the photochemical degradation kinetics of ep the total organic carbon toc concentrations of the solutions were analyzed using a shimadzu toc 5000a toc analyzer 2 3 analysis methods for ep concentration and transformation products the ep concentration during photochemical degradation was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 series with photodiode array detector and an agilent c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm particle diameter used for chromatographic separation at 25 c a 20 μl injection volume was applied with a mobile phase 0 5 ml min 1 consisting of 50 acetonitrile and 50 milli q water the detection wavelength was set to 255 nm the transformation products of ep were identified using hplc tof ms agilent g6545b usa approximately 10 μl sample volumes were directly

acetic acid the ratio of a b was maintained at 1 9 for 2 min changed linearly to 2 8 over 20 min and to 4 6 over 40 min then maintained at 4 6 for 5 min subsequently the composition was returned to 1 9 over 45 min and maintained at this ratio for 5 min the electrospray ionization esi mass spectrometry ms in the negative ion mode was operated with a fragmentor voltage of 175 v with argon acted as a collision gas with various collision energies for the analysis of daughter ions 2 4 laser flash photolysis and scavenging experiments laser flash photolysis lfp was performed with a nd yag laser with a 266 nm laser pulse for a 5 ns duration with the energy of 10 15 mj per pulse the detection light source was a xenon lamp with the laser and analytical light beam passing perpendicularly through a slit 1 10 mm and then to a quartz cell 10 10 40 mm for reaction the transmitted light entered a monochromator equipped with an r955 photomultiplier the output signals from the hp 54510 b digital oscillograph were recorded for further analysis the assessments of all samples were performed immediately at 25 c after preparation for lfp all experiments were carried out in an anaerobic environment through deoxidizing with high purity nitrogen the specific experiments were designed to investigate the contribution of the reactive species for example 100 mm of isopropanol was added to quench the hydroxyl radicals oh while the effect of oxygen o2 was investigated by bubbling n2 into the solution at different o2 concentrations further triethanolamine teoa 10 mm was used to quench the triplet excited state while acetone 10 was added to enhance the production of excited triplet states approximately 1 ml solution was sampled at various reaction time intervals to analyze the levels of the residual ep 2 5 estrogenic activity assessment during the photochemical degradation of ep estrogenic activity was evaluated using the yeast estrogenic assay according to previously described methods wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 briefly the yeast cells were grown at 30 c with continual agitation at 150 200 rpm for 24 48 h to achieve logarithmic growth approximately 20 μl of serial dilutions of chemicals were combined with 160 μl of the medium containing the yeast cells and 20 μl of blank medium subsequently 200 μl of the test solution was transferred to a 96 well plate incubated at 30 c for 4 h with 800 rpm in a thermo shaker heidolph incubator 1000 germany the cell density was assessed at 600 nm using ultraviolet spectrophotometry spectrophotometer unico uv 2000 shanghai china following this 150 μl of the test solution was removed and different reagents were added to the remaining solution in the sequence as instructed by the kit manufacturer s instructions state key laboratory of environmental aquatic chemistry china finally the solution absorbance was recorded at 420 nm each sample was analyzed in quadruplicate and each assay was carried out more than three times 2 6 quantum chemistry calculations and computational toxicology the electronic structures of ep and its products were optimized using gaussian 09 software frisch et al 2009 the hybrid density functional b3lyp method with the 6 31g d p basis set was used and the solvent effect was simulated using the continuum solvation model cpcm moreover the vibrational frequencies of ep and its products were calculated at the same level to identify the most stable of all optimized structures in addition the potential estrogenic effects of ep and its photochemical degradation products were theoretically evaluated using the virtualtoxlab package based on multi dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship as early described in references vedani et al 2012 2015 vedani and smiesko 2009 the binding affinity to the estrogen receptors was expressed as the 50 inhibitive concentration ic50 value 3 results and discussion 3 1 the evolution of estrogenic activity during photochemical degradation the photochemical degradation of ep in water was performed both under visible light and uv irradiation with the results illustrated in fig 1 approximately 500 μm ep was found to be completely removed under uv irradiation within 90 min while only 10 was photochemically degraded under visible light irradiation at the same concentration the data suggested that ep could be rapidly degraded in water under uv light exposure furthermore the curves of the photochemical degradation of ep fitted well with the pseudo first order kinetics equation inset of fig 1 and a rate constant of 6 70 0 76 10 2 min 1 was obtained with a half time of 10 2 min furthermore the evolution of estrogenic activity during the photochemical degradation of ep was also evaluated with the yeast two hybrid reporter assay transfected with the human estrogen receptor α a saccharomyces cerevisiae based lac z β galactosidase firstly this method was performed to estimate the estrogenic activity of e2 an established natural estrogen with very potent estrogenic activity the deduced ec50 value was 2 04 0 15 10 10 m for e2 fig s1 which is consistent with previous observations ec50 2 3 10 10 m gaido et al 1997 suggesting the reliability of this method for evaluating the estrogenic activity furthermore the estrogenic activity evolution during the photochemical degradation of ep was also investigated as shown fig 2 it is noticeable that the estrogenic activity initially increased and then decreased with maximum estrogenic activity at 40 min of irradiation this phenomenon indicated that the photochemical products had higher estrogenic activity than the original compound ep and that products might include hydroxylated parabens oh ep it is generally thought that oh adducts on a benzene ring might increase the estrogenic activity of the original organic pollutants it has previously been reported mboula et al 2015 that the phenol group was not destroyed during the photocatalysis of e2 and the estrogenic effect remained in the corresponding solution the persistently existed estrogenic activity during the photocatalysis is believed to be owing to the presence of the phenol group in the intermediates thus the oh adduct products are considered to be a possible reason for the increase of estrogenic activity during the photochemical degradation of ep in water the typical oh adduct 3 4 dihydroxy benzoic acid ethyl ester or 3 oh ep for short was indeed detected by hplc tof ms and confirmed by comparison with standard substances fig 3 however it was observed that the evolution of estrogenic activity in the degradation solution was inconsistent with the formation of oh adducts during the photochemical degradation of ep the peak area of 3 oh ep initially increased reaching a maximum at 20 min of irradiation while the estrogenic activity was slightly reduced in comparison with the original ep fig 2 during the photochemical degradation reaction the oh adduct was further decomposed and almost completely depleted 12 after 40 min of irradiation while the solution continued to exhibit maximum estrogenic activity thus these data implied that the oh adduct 3 oh ep was not responsible for the increase in estrogenic activity during the photochemical degradation of ep in water in order to confirm the estrogenic activity of oh adducts the dose response curves were established for 3 oh ep and ep as a control fig s2 the ec50 value of 3 oh ep was found to be 2 32 10 4 m which is an order of magnitude higher than that of ep 1 35 10 5 m fig s3 therefore it can be concluded that the estrogenic activity of the oh adduct 3 oh ep is lower than that of the parent compound ep this finding further confirmed the above mentioned experiment that the increase in estrogenic activity during the photochemical degradation of ep could not be attributed to the formation of the oh adduct product 3 oh ep therefore in order to identify the core mechanism it is essential to identify the photochemical products formed during the degradation of ep in water especially the degradation products at 40 min of irradiation 3 2 identification of photochemical transformation products in order to explore the direct cause for the increase in estrogenic activity during the photochemical degradation of ep further analysis of the photochemical degradation products was performed total ion current tic chromatograms and the fragmentation patterns of each product are shown in figs s4 and s5 respectively also the structures of degradation intermediates are summarized in table s2 as shown by the identified products after 40 min of irradiation fig 3 four main chromatographic peaks were obtained with the retention times of 10 6 32 0 34 9 and 53 3 min respectively the peak at 34 9 min was identified as the parent ep compound by lc tof ms analysis and comparison with standard substances similarly the transformation product a with a peak at 10 6 min was identified as p hydroxybenzoic acid hb based on the measurement of estrogenic activity fig s6 and previously reported literatures watanabe et al 2013 zhu and wei 2019 hb was confirmed as an inactive endocrine component and therefore the increase in estrogenic activity cannot be attributed to hb formation accordingly the remaining degradation products b 32 0 min and c 53 3 min were investigated more thoroughly as shown in fig 2 the peak areas of products b and c increased initially and then declined with the photochemical transformation of ep products b and c were the main components in the degradation solution at 40 min and therefore might account for the increase in estrogenic activity the structures of b and c were inferred from the results of hplc tof ms analysis fig s5 b c product b had a m h of 301 0720 and the molecular formula of c16h14o6 analysis of the fragment ions m z 273 0405 229 0506 and 185 0608 indicated the loss of a coo group also the mass difference between the fragment ion m z 273 0405 and parent ion m z 301 0720 matched with the loss of c2h4 therefore product b was rationally identified as the photochemically generated oligomer 4 hydroxy isophthalic acid 1 ethyl ester 3 4 hydroxy phenyl fig 2 similarly product c had a m h of 329 1028 and the molecular formula of c18h18o6 containing two ep structures therefore product c was also identified as the photochemically generated oligomer 4 hydroxy 3 2 4 hydroxy phenoxycarbonyl ethyl benzoic acid ethyl ester fig 2 furthermore the predicted estrogenic activity ic50 of the product b was calculated as 1 29 μm which was lower than that of the original ep indicating that the estrogenic activity of the product b was higher than that of the parent compound thus the adverse effects on human health involving estrogenic activity of the two kinds of degradation products b and c should pay more attention in the further study 3 3 contributions of reactive species in order to better understand the formation mechanism of these toxic products during the photochemical transformation of ep in water it is necessary to comprehensively assess the dominant reactive species and their contribution to ep photochemical degradation the specific scavengers experiments were sophisticatedly designed and the degradation kinetics curves in the presence and absence of scavengers are demonstrated in fig 4 the experimental conditions purpose pseudo first order rate constant k and half life for ep under each different set of experimental condition are summarized in table s1 firstly the photochemical degradation of ep in water was not suppressed with addition of isopropanol the oh scavenger suggesting that oh was not the main reactive species involved in the photochemical transformation of ep however the transformation of ep was clearly suppressed with addition of teoa which served as a quencher of the excited state 3ep that is the rate constant remarkably reduced from 0 067 min 1 no scavenger to 0 005 min 1 indicating that the excited molecular species 3ep devoted to 75 of the photochemical degradation of ep in water and that the reaction might be mostly induced by the excited triplet state 3ep moreover o2 is an established efficient quencher of the excited triplet state molecules as well as being capable of reacting with excited triplet state 3ep leading to the generation of oxygen containing reactive species including superoxide anions o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 therefore the exclusion of o2 was performed by bubbling n2 through the solution to explore the roles of excited triplet state and oxygen containing reactive species in the absence of o2 the rate constant dramatically increased to a maximum of 0 127 min 1 which was 2 times higher than that in the presence of o2 this further indicated that the contribution of the excited triplet state molecule was more important than that of oxygen containing reactive species confirming the significant role of excited triplet state 3ep to further establish the role of 3ep in this system 10 volume fraction acetone was introduced as a sensitizer of triplet state resulting in a rate constant of 0 324 min 1 which was increased by nearly 4 fold compared to the ep solution without acetone this result further confirmed that excited triplet state 3ep was the main contributor of the photochemical degradation of ep 3 4 transient intermediates and photochemical degradation mechanism the transient intermediates and the degradation mechanisms in water were further investigated using laser flash photolysis as fig 5 shows two characteristic absorption peaks were observed at 320 and 640 nm according to the observation of similar spectra of the photochemical degradation of various structural analog cheng et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 the absorption peak in the region 600 800 nm corresponded to hydrated electrons and the maximum absorption at 320 nm was tentatively attributed to several transient intermediates including 3ep phenoxyl radical ep h and the radical cation ep unlike the 3ep the transient intermediates ep h and ep could not be quenched by o2 instead enhancing the formation of ep by acting as an electron acceptor therefore for this reaction to occur the absorption peak at 320 nm should be enhanced although it disappeared completely in the presence of o2 fig s7 this observation indicated that the ep h and ep could not be generated and that the absorption peak at 320 nm could be attributed only to 3ep furthermore this conclusion was confirmed by the exclusion of o2 from solution with n2 bubbling fig s7 with the direct evidence from these assays indicating that only 3ep initiated the photochemical degradation of ep as shown from fig 5 the transient intermediate 3ep was generated and then increased within the short time period of 35 ns followed by rapid decay in order to investigate the subsequent transformation mechanism in water quantum chemical calculations were also performed and the reaction energies of all possible pathways for bond cleavage are shown in fig s8 the calculated results show that only the cleavage of the o ch2ch3 bond was an exothermic process with a reaction energy δg of 5 86 kcal mol while the energies of other bonds cleavage reactions were endothermic with positive δg values of 1 15 27 36 kcal mol these data indicated that the o ch2ch3 bond of 3ep was more likely to be broken than other bonds leading to the formation of transformation products in water based on the aforementioned results the photochemical degradation mechanism in water was proposed as shown in fig 6 the excited singlet state of ep 1ep was initially formed under ep irradiation and then further transformed to an excited triplet state 3ep due to instability of 1ep furthermore the transformation of 3ep mainly occurred via the cleavage of the o ch2ch3 bond resulting in the formation of carboxylic radicals simultaneously 1o2 can be generated from o2 in aerobic environments with 1o2 formation was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr fig s9 the transformation product 3 oh ep was formed through the reaction of ep with 1o2 rather than via a reaction with oh in addition to the formation of hb with non estrogenic activity the carboxylic radicals could result in the formation of oligomers b and c causing an increase in estrogenic activity during the photochemical transformation of ep in water systems 4 conclusions understanding the photochemical transformations of eocs in water and the consequential effect on the adverse effects to human health is highly significant therefore using a typical preservative ep as an example the evolution of estrogenic activity during photochemical degradation in water was studied with results showing that the estrogenic activity increased with ongoing degradation duration interestingly the expected oh adduct was found not to be responsible for the increase in estrogenic activity exhibiting an ec50 value an order of magnitude higher than that of the original ep parent compound this result provides new insights into the estrogenic activity of oh adducts altering the conventional understanding that the oh adduct is responsible for the increase in estrogenic activity as compared with the original parent compound these results explain previous results showing the continual decrease of estrogenic activity during the photocatalytic degradation of parabens in water due to the main product being oh adducts in contrast increased estrogenic activity during photochemical degradation is due to the formation of photochemically generated oligomers in water despite the recent increase in research interest into the degradation products of eocs in water several gaps in knowledge remain regarding their adverse effects and the specific identification of products inducing an increase in toxicity the limited available literature currently suggests that transformation products could be persistent and retain toxicity after the original eoc is eliminated completely in water thus the environmental and health impact of degradation products together with the original parent eocs in water should be paid more

17979,widespread occurrence of emerging organic contaminants eocs in water have been explicitly associated with adverse effects on human health therefore representing a major risk to public health especially the increased toxicity is frequently observed during the photodegradation of eocs in natural water and even wastewater treatment plants however the culprit of increased toxicity and formation mechanism has yet to be recognized regarding the estrogenic activity in this study by combining laboratory experiments with quantum chemical calculations the induction of human estrogenic activity was investigated using the yeast two hybrid reporter assay during the photodegradation of preservatives ethylparaben ep along with identification of toxic products and formation mechanisms results showed that the increase in estrogenic effect was induced by photochemically generated oligomers rather than the expected oh adduct the maximum estrogenic activity corresponded to the major formation of oligomers while oh adducts were less than 12 two photochemically generated oligomers were found to contribute to estrogenic activity produced from the cleavage of excited triplet state molecules and subsequent radical radical reactions computational toxicology results showed that the increased estrogenic activity was attributed to oligomer 4 hydroxy isophthalic acid 1 ethyl ester 3 4 hydroxy phenyl and its ec50 was lower than that of the parent ep in contrast oh adducts exhibited higher ec50 values than the parent ep while still possessing estrogenic activity therefore more attention should be paid to these photodegradation products of eocs including oh adducts graphical abstract image 1 keywords parabens photochemical transformation degradation mechanism estrogenic effect theoretical calculation 1 introduction due to the widespread occurrence of emerging organic contaminants eocs in water there has been much attention paid to their environmental behaviors and adverse effects on human health fenner et al 2013 especially it is frequently observed the increased toxicity during the photodegradation of eocs in natural water gao et al 2019 rozas et al 2016 and even in real effluent wastewater an et al 2015 klamerth et al 2010 although eocs can be successfully photodegraded to negligible concentration therefore the culprit of increased toxicity and their formation mechanisms is of increasing concern during the photodegradation of eocs in water parabens are an important group of eocs in aquatic environment which for more than a century have been widely used as preservatives in food additives freese et al 1973 cosmetics and pharmaceutical products bledzka et al 2014 boberg et al 2010 in particular parabens with short chain esters are the most commonly used such as methylparaben ethylparaben ep n propylparaben and n butylparaben soni et al 2002 it has been estimated that the annual global consumption of parabens reaches 8000 tons ramaswamy et al 2011 accordingly parabens are detected ubiquitously in various aquatic environments e g wastewater surface water and drinking water with the concentration range of 0 3 30 000 ng l haman et al 2015 and even human body samples guo and kannan 2013 karthikraj et al 2017 paul et al 2005 raza et al 2018 in particular recent studies have suggested that parabens have the potential for carcinogenicity teratogenicity and reproductive toxicology as well as adipogenesis adoamnei et al 2018 darbre and harvey 2008 fransway et al 2019 both in vivo and in vitro results show that parabens have the potential to exert estrogenic activity and could bind to estrogenic receptors causing unwanted effects at concentrations far below those required to induce acute toxicity ramaswamy et al 2011 furthermore adverse effects could be enhanced by photochemical irradiation of parabens fransway et al 2019 lee et al 2017 therefore the photochemical degradation mechanism of parabens in aquatic environments and the consequence of these degradation mechanisms on health effects are of high concern photodegradation is an important process for the transformation of eocs in aquatic environments due to bond breakage and the formation of new products gmurek et al 2017 recent researches have suggested that the photochemical degradation of parabens occurs quickly with exposure to uv gmurek et al 2015 uv c supported oxidants dhaka et al 2018 n doped tio2 petala et al 2015 and photocatalytic ozonation with o3 uv zno asgari et al 2019 under optimum conditions mainly hydroxylation and dealkylation products were reported during the photocatalytic and photochemical degradation of parabens petala et al 2015 hydroxylated products oh products were predicted by theoretical calculations which were found to increase the aquatic toxicity of parabens during oh induced indirect degradation in aquatic environments gao et al 2014 2016 subsequently this finding was confirmed based on the aquatic toxicity of parabens to daphnia magna during their photocatalytic degradation in water hu et al 2019 with transformation products found to be potentially more refractory and toxic to aquatic organisms than the parent compound frontistis et al 2017 gao et al 2016 mendez arriaga et al 2008 olmez hanci et al 2015 estrogenic activity during transformation has rarely been assessed however parabens have been associated with the occurrence of breast cancer due to their estrogenic activity a previous study finding that estrogenic activity increased during the photolytic process of propylparaben in water an et al 2014 while decreasing during its photocatalytic degradation fang et al 2013 this finding indicates that photolytic products are estrogenic and could enhance estrogenic activity which has also been observed during the photolysis of other organic pollutants for example photochemical degradation products that exert estrogenic activity are formed from estrone and bisphenol a frontistis et al 2017 olmez hanci et al 2015 souissi et al 2014 although no photochemical degradation products have been identified due to the poor separation technology of intermediates and the lack of standard samples generally ring hydroxylated products are believed to be responsible for the increased estrogenic activity due to the similarity of their structures with estradiol montero et al 2019 based on this the ring hydroxylated product 3 hydroxy propyl paraben 3 oh ppb was suspected to be responsible for the increased estrogenic activity observed during paraben photolysis an et al 2014 although this remains uncertain due to a lack of direct experimental evident in contrast the decreased estrogenic activity was observed during the photocatalytic degradation of ethyl paraben frontistis et al 2017 and propyl parabens fang et al 2013 in which ring hydroxylated products are the major products these results indicate that unexpectedly the ring hydroxylated products may not be a main contributor to the increase in estrogenic activity in the present study ep was selected as a typical paraben in aquatic environment and the concentrations were detected as high as 0 15 and 9 9 μg l in freshwater water and wastewater treatment plants haman et al 2015 respectively the estrogenic activity evolution was determined during the photochemical transformation

estrogen with very potent estrogenic activity the deduced ec50 value was 2 04 0 15 10 10 m for e2 fig s1 which is consistent with previous observations ec50 2 3 10 10 m gaido et al 1997 suggesting the reliability of this method for evaluating the estrogenic activity furthermore the estrogenic activity evolution during the photochemical degradation of ep was also investigated as shown fig 2 it is noticeable that the estrogenic activity initially increased and then decreased with maximum estrogenic activity at 40 min of irradiation this phenomenon indicated that the photochemical products had higher estrogenic activity than the original compound ep and that products might include hydroxylated parabens oh ep it is generally thought that oh adducts on a benzene ring might increase the estrogenic activity of the original organic pollutants it has previously been reported mboula et al 2015 that the phenol group was not destroyed during the photocatalysis of e2 and the estrogenic effect remained in the corresponding solution the persistently existed estrogenic activity during the photocatalysis is believed to be owing to the presence of the phenol group in the intermediates thus the oh adduct products are considered to be a possible reason for the increase of estrogenic activity during the photochemical degradation of ep in water the typical oh adduct 3 4 dihydroxy benzoic acid ethyl ester or 3 oh ep for short was indeed detected by hplc tof ms and confirmed by comparison with standard substances fig 3 however it was observed that the evolution of estrogenic activity in the degradation solution was inconsistent with the formation of oh adducts during the photochemical degradation of ep the peak area of 3 oh ep initially increased reaching a maximum at 20 min of irradiation while the estrogenic activity was slightly reduced in comparison with the original ep fig 2 during the photochemical degradation reaction the oh adduct was further decomposed and almost completely depleted 12 after 40 min of irradiation while the solution continued to exhibit maximum estrogenic activity thus these data implied that the oh adduct 3 oh ep was not responsible for the increase in estrogenic activity during the photochemical degradation of ep in water in order to confirm the estrogenic activity of oh adducts the dose response curves were established for 3 oh ep and ep as a control fig s2 the ec50 value of 3 oh ep was found to be 2 32 10 4 m which is an order of magnitude higher than that of ep 1 35 10 5 m fig s3 therefore it can be concluded that the estrogenic activity of the oh adduct 3 oh ep is lower than that of the parent compound ep this finding further confirmed the above mentioned experiment that the increase in estrogenic activity during the photochemical degradation of ep could not be attributed to the formation of the oh adduct product 3 oh ep therefore in order to identify the core mechanism it is essential to identify the photochemical products formed during the degradation of ep in water especially the degradation products at 40 min of irradiation 3 2 identification of photochemical transformation products in order to explore the direct cause for the increase in estrogenic activity during the photochemical degradation of ep further analysis of the photochemical degradation products was performed total ion current tic chromatograms and the fragmentation patterns of each product are shown in figs s4 and s5 respectively also the structures of degradation intermediates are summarized in table s2 as shown by the identified products after 40 min of irradiation fig 3 four main chromatographic peaks were obtained with the retention times of 10 6 32 0 34 9 and 53 3 min respectively the peak at 34 9 min was identified as the parent ep compound by lc tof ms analysis and comparison with standard substances similarly the transformation product a with a peak at 10 6 min was identified as p hydroxybenzoic acid hb based on the measurement of estrogenic activity fig s6 and previously reported literatures watanabe et al 2013 zhu and wei 2019 hb was confirmed as an inactive endocrine component and therefore the increase in estrogenic activity cannot be attributed to hb formation accordingly the remaining degradation products b 32 0 min and c 53 3 min were investigated more thoroughly as shown in fig 2 the peak areas of products b and c increased initially and then declined with the photochemical transformation of ep products b and c were the main components in the degradation solution at 40 min and therefore might account for the increase in estrogenic activity the structures of b and c were inferred from the results of hplc tof ms analysis fig s5 b c product b had a m h of 301 0720 and the molecular formula of c16h14o6 analysis of the fragment ions m z 273 0405 229 0506 and 185 0608 indicated the loss of a coo group also the mass difference between the fragment ion m z 273 0405 and parent ion m z 301 0720 matched with the loss of c2h4 therefore product b was rationally identified as the photochemically generated oligomer 4 hydroxy isophthalic acid 1 ethyl ester 3 4 hydroxy phenyl fig 2 similarly product c had a m h of 329 1028 and the molecular formula of c18h18o6 containing two ep structures therefore product c was also identified as the photochemically generated oligomer 4 hydroxy 3 2 4 hydroxy phenoxycarbonyl ethyl benzoic acid ethyl ester fig 2 furthermore the predicted estrogenic activity ic50 of the product b was calculated as 1 29 μm which was lower than that of the original ep indicating that the estrogenic activity of the product b was higher than that of the parent compound thus the adverse effects on human health involving estrogenic activity of the two kinds of degradation products b and c should pay more attention in the further study 3 3 contributions of reactive species in order to better understand the formation mechanism of these toxic products during the photochemical transformation of ep in water it is necessary to comprehensively assess the dominant reactive species and their contribution to ep photochemical degradation the specific scavengers experiments were sophisticatedly designed and the degradation kinetics curves in the presence and absence of scavengers are demonstrated in fig 4 the experimental conditions purpose pseudo first order rate constant k and half life for ep under each different set of experimental condition are summarized in table s1 firstly the photochemical degradation of ep in water was not suppressed with addition of isopropanol the oh scavenger suggesting that oh was not the main reactive species involved in the photochemical transformation of ep however the transformation of ep was clearly suppressed with addition of teoa which served as a quencher of the excited state 3ep that is the rate constant remarkably reduced from 0 067 min 1 no scavenger to 0 005 min 1 indicating that the excited molecular species 3ep devoted to 75 of the photochemical degradation of ep in water and that the reaction might be mostly induced by the excited triplet state 3ep moreover o2 is an established efficient quencher of the excited triplet state molecules as well as being capable of reacting with excited triplet state 3ep leading to the generation of oxygen containing reactive species including superoxide anions o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 therefore the exclusion of o2 was performed by bubbling n2 through the solution to explore the roles of excited triplet state and oxygen containing reactive species in the absence of o2 the rate constant dramatically increased to a maximum of 0 127 min 1 which was 2 times higher than that in the presence of o2 this further indicated that the contribution of the excited triplet state molecule was more important than that of oxygen containing reactive species confirming the significant role of excited triplet state 3ep to further establish the role of 3ep in this system 10 volume fraction acetone was introduced as a sensitizer of triplet state resulting in a rate constant of 0 324 min 1 which was increased by nearly 4 fold compared to the ep solution without acetone this result further confirmed that excited triplet state 3ep was the main contributor of the photochemical degradation of ep 3 4 transient intermediates and photochemical degradation mechanism the transient intermediates and the degradation mechanisms in water were further investigated using laser flash photolysis as fig 5 shows two characteristic absorption peaks were observed at 320 and 640 nm according to the observation of similar spectra of the photochemical degradation of various structural analog cheng et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 the absorption peak in the region 600 800 nm corresponded to hydrated electrons and the maximum absorption at 320 nm was tentatively attributed to several transient intermediates including 3ep phenoxyl radical ep h and the radical cation ep unlike the 3ep the transient intermediates ep h and ep could not be quenched by o2 instead enhancing the formation of ep by acting as an electron acceptor therefore for this reaction to occur the absorption peak at 320 nm should be enhanced although it disappeared completely in the presence of o2 fig s7 this observation indicated that the ep h and ep could not be generated and that the absorption peak at 320 nm could be attributed only to 3ep furthermore this conclusion was confirmed by the exclusion of o2 from solution with n2 bubbling fig s7 with the direct evidence from these assays indicating that only 3ep initiated the photochemical degradation of ep as shown from fig 5 the transient intermediate 3ep was generated and then increased within the short time period of 35 ns followed by rapid decay in order to investigate the subsequent transformation mechanism in water quantum chemical calculations were also performed and the reaction energies of all possible pathways for bond cleavage are shown in fig s8 the calculated results show that only the cleavage of the o ch2ch3 bond was an exothermic process with a reaction energy δg of 5 86 kcal mol while the energies of other bonds cleavage reactions were endothermic with positive δg values of 1 15 27 36 kcal mol these data indicated that the o ch2ch3 bond of 3ep was more likely to be broken than other bonds leading to the formation of transformation products in water based on the aforementioned results the photochemical degradation mechanism in water was proposed as shown in fig 6 the excited singlet state of ep 1ep was initially formed under ep irradiation and then further transformed to an excited triplet state 3ep due to instability of 1ep furthermore the transformation of 3ep mainly occurred via the cleavage of the o ch2ch3 bond resulting in the formation of carboxylic radicals simultaneously 1o2 can be generated from o2 in aerobic environments with 1o2 formation was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr fig s9 the transformation product 3 oh ep was formed through the reaction of ep with 1o2 rather than via a reaction with oh in addition to the formation of hb with non estrogenic activity the carboxylic radicals could result in the formation of oligomers b and c causing an increase in estrogenic activity during the photochemical transformation of ep in water systems 4 conclusions understanding the photochemical transformations of eocs in water and the consequential effect on the adverse effects to human health is highly significant therefore using a typical preservative ep as an example the evolution of estrogenic activity during photochemical degradation in water was studied with results showing that the estrogenic activity increased with ongoing degradation duration interestingly the expected oh adduct was found not to be responsible for the increase in estrogenic activity exhibiting an ec50 value an order of magnitude higher than that of the original ep parent compound this result provides new insights into the estrogenic activity of oh adducts altering the conventional understanding that the oh adduct is responsible for the increase in estrogenic activity as compared with the original parent compound these results explain previous results showing the continual decrease of estrogenic activity during the photocatalytic degradation of parabens in water due to the main product being oh adducts in contrast increased estrogenic activity during photochemical degradation is due to the formation of photochemically generated oligomers in water despite the recent increase in research interest into the degradation products of eocs in water several gaps in knowledge remain regarding their adverse effects and the specific identification of products inducing an increase in toxicity the limited available literature currently suggests that transformation products could be persistent and retain toxicity after the original eoc is eliminated completely in water thus the environmental and health impact of degradation products together with the original parent eocs in water should be paid more
