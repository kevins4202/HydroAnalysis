15815,recent investigations confirmed the inhibitory effect of microplastics with single sizes on the anaerobic granular sludge ags wastewater treatment system however the differences of toxicity from different sizes of microplastics toward ags and their underlying mechanism are still unclear in this work the responds of ags exposed to different particle sizes of polystyrene microplastics ps mps were reported the results showed that the increasing particle sizes from 0 5 μm to 150 μm of ps mps induced a gradually increasing and distinct inhibitory from 6 7 to 16 2 effect on the cumulative methane production by ags accompanied by the similar decreasing organic carbon degradation trends correspondingly the integrity and the cell viability of the ags granules were damaged and the populations of the key acidogens and methanogens were reduced when exposed to ps mps which was particularly evident in the reactors affected by the larger micron sized ps mps the zeta potential and contact angle indicated that the larger sized ps mps had the stronger dispersive properties and affinity for ags causing the higher oxidative stress and leachates toxicity further investigation revealed that the tolerance of ags to ps mps toxicity also exhibited size dependent trend larger particles e g 150 μm of ps mps inhibited extracellular polymeric substance eps secretion while smaller

skyrocketed cole et al 2011 silva et al 2021 and the unmanaged plastic waste would exist in the ecosystem attributed to the improper disposal after natural weathering microbial degradation and ultraviolet radiation the plastic block would be gradually transformed into tiny particulates of varied sizes cole and galloway 2015 wei et al 2020 microplastics mps generally defined to be tiny plastic particles between 100nm and 5mm in diameter have received increasing attentions due to their environmental risks and biological toxicity previous laboratory studies have confirmed the suppressing effects of mps on microorganisms wang et al 2020 according to zhang et al mps had obvious inhibition on the growth and photosynthesis efficiency of microalgae zhang et al 2017 moreover it was also reported that mps e g polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyvinyl chloride pvc showed side effects on the functional microbes in waste activated sludge was anaerobic digestion wei et al 2019a wei et al 2019b wei et al 2019c furthermore it was widely acknowledged that the chemical additives contained in various plastics were the main contributors to the biotoxicity of mps luo et al 2018 zaki and shoeib 2018 capolupo et al 2020 which were applied to achieve the durability and flexibility of plastic products zhang et al 2020a as an important receiver of pollutants the existence of mps has been broadly detected in wastewater ascribed to the production utilization and disposal of plastics murphy et al 2016 these particles would inevitably accumulate in wastewater treatment facilities and induce certain impacts on the performance of the wastewater treatment systems anaerobic granular sludge ags is one of the important microbial systems for anaerobic treatment of high concentration organic wastewater that may contain mps previously overlooked ags has numerous advantages over conventional floc sludge such as the stronger settling performances and more fixed and tight microbial distribution pol et al 2004 extracellular polymetric substance eps is considered to be an important component of ags which functions as the backbone of ags to bind cells to form sludge aggregates and as the protector to protect the internal microorganisms from the external shocks yan et al 2008 altas 2009 previous investigations have centered on the inhibitory effect of single sizes of microplastics i e pet and or pvc on the ags wastewater anaerobic treatment system and the mechanisms involved zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b however the possible effects on microbes may vary with plastic size due to the different physical properties microbial contact capabilities and chemical leaching capabilities for instance it was found that polystyrene ps microplastics with different particle sizes would pose varying degrees of inhibition on the microalgae related properties including photosynthesis and cell integrity liu et al 2020 however no efforts have been made so far to reveal the effect of various particle sizes of microplastics on the performances of ags in anaerobic wastewater treatment this work attempted to evaluate the distinct effects of different sizes of mps on the microbial responses of ags using ps mps as example and the mechanisms involved specially ps mps particles with six micron scale diameters 0 5 μm 1 μm 10 μm 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm covering the reported sizes in literature were selected as the model mps with the performances of methane production and ags properties being assessed furthermore the microbial analysis and the intermediate measurements in metabolic transformation steps were performed to explore the impacts of ps mps with different sizes on anaerobic wastewater treatment by ags from a microscopic perspective finally the contributions of the physical properties of ps mps and the corresponding leaching products were analyzed to explore the toxicity mechanism of varying sizes of ps mps with the constituents of the eps adhered to the surface of ags being quantified to assess the toxicity resistance mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 ps microplastics and ags sources polystyrene microplastics particles with sizes of 0 5 μm 1 μm 10 μm and 50 μm were purchased from huge biotechnology shanghai china with 5 w v ps dispersing in deionized water and traces of surfactant these ps suspensions were then placed at 4 c in a refrigerator in addition larger ps microplastics 75 μm and 150 μm were obtained from zhongcheng co ltd guangzhou china moreover the inoculated ags average particle diameter 1 37 mm for methane production was extracted from an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb system treating citric acid wastewater in detail the percentage of the volatile suspended solid vss to total suspended solid tss of the ags was 88 2 2 2 impacts of different sizes of ps microplastics on ags performances extensive batch exposure tests were conducted in seven groups of serum bottles which received 100 ml synthetic wastewater and 2 g tss l ags the wastewater ph 6 9 0 1 was consisted of 2000 mg cod l glucose serving as cod source 1000 mg l nh4cl 500 mg l kh2po4 200 mg l cacl2 200 mg l mgcl2 6h2o 50 mg l fecl3 and 10 ml l concentrated trace element solution zhang et al 2020a among the bottles one group served as control without ps mps addition while the other six groups contained the same content mass concentration based of ps mps with different particle sizes i e 0 5 μm 1 μm 10 μm 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm respectively the experimental ps mps content was selected as 75 mg l considering that ps mps of different sizes showed clear inhibitory effects on methane production from ags when the concentration increased to this level and the selected concentration of mps was based on the preliminary results of ps mps concentration ags response according to the concentration selection principle mentioned in literature liu et al 2020 after being flushed by nitrogen for over 5 min to maintain anaerobic conditions all the groups of bottles were sealed and incubated at 35 c in a shaker 150 rpm for 13 days when the gas content reached a saturated level the biogas h2 ch4 and co2 volume and composition were monitored every 1 2 days from which the production of methane could be calculated in addition samples were taken from each group of reactors with triplicates for the determination of lactate dehydrogenase ldh and the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy after the anaerobic exposure tests 2 3 ags characterization eps extraction and quantification notably ags samples were collected from all groups of reactors after the exposure tests for the measurement of the ags particle size distribution eps extraction and analysis morphology observations microbial community analysis oxidative stress by different sizes of ps mps and the analysis of live and dead cells additionally the distribution of the sizes of ags granules was analyzed by using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 uk after the pretreatment of removing the floating mps in detail the collected ags granules were washed by deionized water for three times and then were suspended in 1 phosphate buffer solution pbs the observation of the morphological properties of ags was achieved by using scanning electron microscopy sem in addition the measurement of reactive oxygen species ros was conducted in this work to express the oxidative stress induced by the ps mps the fluorescence tracking of the live and dead cells existing within ags was also performed by applying live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 wei et al 2020 whose detailed descriptions were provided in supporting information si specially the eps on the surface of the collective ags was extracted by heating 60 c in detail the sludge samples were firstly filtered to screening the supernatants prior to being washed three times by nacl solution w v 0 05 subsequently the ags samples were resuspended in the above nacl solution to 20 ml before heating with a water bath at 60 c for 30 min mu et al 2012 thereafter the contents of the compositions polysaccharides proteins humic acids and dna were quantified in the extracted eps solutions 2 4 impacts of different sizes of ps microplastics on the steps of acidification and methanation in ags basically the anaerobic ags treatment of wastewater with glucose as the cod source continuously undergoes two steps of acidification and methanation which comprehensively affect the response of ags during cod biotransformation thus two additional series of batch tests were set up to explore the impacts of different sizes of ps mps on these processes similarly 100 ml of synthetic wastewater with 75 mg l ps mps of corresponding sizes was introduced to serum bottles afterwards ags granules tss 2 g l were inoculated into each bottle with 10 5 g l 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid besa being dosed to interrupt the subsequent methanogenesis process each bottle was also flushed with nitrogen for over 5 min and sealed which was then cultivated in an air bath shaker 35 1 c 150 rpm afterwards the productions of volatile fatty acids vfas after 2 days reaction were measured to investigate the performances of the acidification step affected by ps mps the operation of the methanation test was similar to that of acidification except that 2 g cod l sodium acetate became a substitute for the equivalent amount of glucose without besa being added finally the cumulative methane production was measured in each bottle after 8 days anaerobic biochemical reaction when it stopped rising 2 5 impacts of the leachates from different sizes of ps microplastics on methane production by ags with an attempt to further explore the toxicity mechanism regarding chemicals leaching from the ps mps with different sizes on methane production by ags leachate solutions of the corresponding ps mps were obtained as reported by li et al 2016 for another groups of tests specially 100 ml synthetic wastewater as mentioned above and 75 mg l ps mps with the studied diameters i e 0 5 μm 1 μm 10 μm 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm were mixed in each serum bottle which was then incubated 35 c anaerobically for 13 days subsequently wastewater solutions with different leachates were obtained by filtering out the ps mps particles finally seven groups of bottles were inoculated with 2 g tss l ags including one group of control and six groups of bottles with mp leachates after being filled with nitrogen the serum bottles were sealed with aluminum caps and placed in a constant temperature shaker for incubation the effects of the leachates from these ps mps on ags performance were assessed by measuring methane production from each group of bottles after 13 days 2 6 chemical and microbial analysis the parameters of tss and vss were monitored with reference to the standard methods apha 2005 and the total gas volume of each anaerobic bottle was obtained by equilibrating the headspace gas pressure with the atmospheric pressure the actual composition of the generated biogas was assessed by introducing a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd lunan 6890 the distributions of vfas were measured by another gc with a flame ionization detector gc fid agilent gc 2010 plus specially the detailed procedure about the operation of the gcs for biogas and vfa measurements was following the descriptions in previous work zhang et al 2020a in addition the affinity of ags for different ps mps was measured by assessing the corresponding contact angles by using a contact angle goniometer the zeta potential of the mp solutions with equivalent concentrations as the ags exposure test was monitored by using a zetasizer nano zs instrument while an eem fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to measure the distributions of the organic compounds in reaction supernatants and eps solutions and normalization was introduced prior to calculating the relative contents of the organic compounds moreover the release of ldh was quantified based on the chromogenic reaction of pyruvic acid originated from the catalysis of lactic acid with 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine zhang et al 2020b notably the quantifications of polysaccharides proteins humic acids and dna were consistent with the detailed descriptions in previous publications wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a all experiments were conducted in triplicate in this study with the calculating p value 0 05 being statistically significant the microbial compositions in the collected ags samples at the end of the ags tests section 2 2 were analyzed using illumina miseq sequencing herein two primers of 515modf and 806modr were introduced during the real time pcr amplification prior to the final sequence analysis based on illumina miseq pf300 platform specially the sequences would be clustered into an operational unit otu once their similarity reached 97 in regard to microbial clustering 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of ags systems with exposure to different sizes of ps microplastics in this work the control ags batch test and six experimental ags tests with exposure to different sizes of ps mps were in operation for 13 days during which the cumulative methane production from wastewater reached saturation the results of methane production trends and the distribution of organic substances of the reaction supernatants are presented in fig 1 in general the cumulative methane production showed varying degrees of decline in the experimental tests with ps mps exposure overall the inhibition on methane production by ps mps in the studied range increased with the rising ps mps sizes the cumulative methane volume decreased by 6 7 0 5 μm test p 0 013 8 6 1 μm test p 0 0038 9 7 10 μm test p 0 0024 10 0 50 μm test p 0 0013 11 1 75 μm test p 0 0019 and 16 2 150 μm test p 0 0004 in comparison with the control reactors respectively after the batch exposure tests reaction supernatants in each serum bottle were extracted for further eem analysis based on the locations of organics in fluorescence spectra the organic substances dissolved in the supernatants could be classified into two types region ⅳ biodegradable polysaccharide like substances and region ⅴ nonbiodegradable humic acid like substances wang et al 2019 figure 1b represented the relative fluorescence intensity of region ⅳ which also reflected the relative content of glucose in the supernatant notably the relative glucose concentrations showed no significant differences compared to control in tests with smaller sizes of ps mps i e 0 5 μm 1 μm and 10 μm however this parameter increased from 57 8 control to 64 2 exposure to 150 μm indicating that the degradation of glucose was greatly inhibited with the presence of 75 mg l and 150 μm ps mps which was well corresponding with the declining cumulative methane production profiles 3 2 granule size distributions and morphological properties of ags with exposure to different sizes of ps microplastics the particle size distribution of ags collected from the bottles with differently sized and without ps mps exposure was demonstrated in fig 2 a which suggested that the ags particle size varied in the range of 10 3960 μm specially the medium particle diameter dx 50 in each anaerobic bottle was summarized in the graph the dx 50 of ags in the control group was 1387 μm with the ags particles from the experimental bottles having lower dx 50 compared to control in the bottle with ps mps of the largest size in this study 150 μm the dx 50 of ags subsequently decreased to 912 μm these results demonstrated that the existence of ps mps caused the breakage of ags particles and the larger sizes of ps mps contributed to stronger damage to ags integrity morphology properties of ags collected from control 0 5 μm test and 150 μm test were determined by the observation of sem in fig 2b as indicated by the figure the surface of the granule in the control ags bottle was smooth and rigid while some cracks appeared on the surface of ags exposed to 0 5 μm ps mps moreover ags from 150 μm exposure test exhibited staggered fissures with an inclination to being detached from the buck confirming the deduction of ags breakage besides microscopic compositions of ags could be observed from the higher magnification in particular filamentous bacteria occupied a larger proportion in the control granule which was considered to be functional microbes for methanation zhang et al 2020a nevertheless more bacilli and cocci made up the microcolony structure of the experimental ags especially in the 150 μm ps mps test as presented in fig 2b thus ps mps caused variable effects on the apparent structure and microbial composition of ags which were mps size dependent 3 3 ros production and cell viability of ags with exposure to different sizes of ps microplastics it was generally accepted that ros e g hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the hydroxyl radical oh and the superoxide o2 would induce oxidative stress to cells mu and chen 2011 which could be induced by microplastics wei et al 2019c zhang et al 2020a in the anaerobic systems the residual oxygen in the nutrient solution would react with the functional groups appearing on the surface of the microplastics leading to the generation of nanomolar h2o2 and o2 through chemical reactions nel et al 2006 cell death would happen once the ros production exceeded the threshold of biological resistance to oxidative stress xia et al 2008 thus it was necessary to explore the effects of different particle sizes of ps mps on the production of ros in ags cells with the results being shown in fig 2c the maximum ros production was 126 3 4 0 150 μm test in comparison with control in this work similarly ldh a parameter indicating cell membrane integrity presented a consistent increase in experimental tests specially ldh release with exposure to larger sizes of ps mps was obviously increased to 145 2 75 μm and 188 4 150 μm of control moreover the boost of ros production was believed to be related to the damage of cell viability bhattacharya et al 2010 the live and dead cells of ags from all the bottles were monitored and calculated fig 2d j live cells could be viewed by the green section while dead cells were marked in red it could be observed that more dead cells appeared in the ps mps exposure tests since the relative occupation of dead cells increased from 6 5 control to 7 6 0 5 μm and 21 4 150 μm which was aligned with the trends of gradually weakening ags performances 3 4 microbial communities of ags with exposure to different sizes of ps microplastics in accordance with the high throughput sequencing of the ags samples from the control and experimental 0 5 μm 1 μm 10 μm 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm bottles the variations of the microbial compositions could be obtained the coverage index si fig s1 of all the seven mixed samples were above 0 99 suggesting that the sequencing was convincing for microbial analysis he et al 2020 figure 3 a showed the results of principal component analysis pca on the basis of the microbial analysis on a phylum level the pc1 and pc2 totally occupied 58 4 of the microbial variations it could be easily deduced from the distribution distance that microbiomes from control 0 5 μm and 1 μm tests clustered together while samples from 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm tests showed a tendency to disperse the relative abundances of specific microbes at the phylum level were exhibited in fig 3b from which archaeal and bacterial phyla were both monitored in the samples it was noteworthy that euryarchaeota acknowledged to be methanogens vanwonterghem et al 2014 occupied the largest proportions of the phylum microbes regarding all the ags microbiomes the relative abundances of euryarchaeota showed decreases in the experimental samples compared to control and the exposure to larger sizes of ps mps resulted in lower relative abundances with the decrease from 30 7 in control to 18 3 in 150 μm test additionally the abundances other enriched phyla including chloroflexi halobacterota bacteroidota and firmicutes presented similar decreasing trends in the ags samples with different sizes of ps mps most of these bacteria were reported to be functional in degrading organic compounds ariesyady et al 2007 the sum of the relative proportions of these microorganisms decreased from 54 1 control to 46 0 0 5 μm test 43 2 1 μm test 38 7 10 μm test 38 4 50 μm test 33 8 75 μm test and 29 4 150 μm test indicating that larger sizes of ps mps would reduce the capability of ags to degrade organic substances in wastewater the distributions of the dominant orders in the seven samples were compared in fig 3c based on the physiological functions of microorganisms these microorganisms are divided into acidification related and methanogenesis related species the members belonging to anaerolineales bacteroidales caldatribacteriales synergistales kosmotogales clostridiales and acidaminococcales were reported to be capable of degrading saccharides and synthesizing vfas magnuson et al 2009 nakasaki et al 2019 lanzilli et al 2021 the total relative abundances of these acidification related microbes showed decreasing trends from control to experimental groups exposure to larger sizes of ps mps especially 25 1 in 150 μm test accordingly the functional microbes for acidification would be gradually less abundant as the particle size of ps mps increased the other dominant order species e g methanomicrobiales methanosarciniales and methanobacteriales were included in methanogens anderson et al 2009 lee et al 2011 whose populations exhibited similar trends to acidogens that the lower abundances were correlated with the larger sizes of ps mps further investigation of the microbial compositions on a genus level was displayed in fig 3d which confirmed that the existence of ps mps especially those with larger sizes decreased the relative abundances of anaerobes for methane production from wastewater species relevant to acidification were explored to be less abundant after exposure to ps mps with the decline in samples from 150 μm group being the most obvious in particular the population of candidatus caldatribacterium sp the predominant acidogens among the seven samples decreased by 14 8 to 39 7 of control with the increasing particle size of ps mps from 0 5 μm to 150 μm similarly anaerolinea sp and longilinea sp were documented to be functional in the synthesis of organic acids from carbohydrates yamada et al 2006 additionally hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium sp and acetoclastic methanosaeta sp methanogens were both detected in all the sludge samples sundberg et al 2013 whose relative abundances decreased by 15 1 40 4 and 60 2 74 4 of control when exposed to 0 5 150 μm ps mps hence the existence of ps mps shifted the microorganisms in ags system in a direction that was unfavorable for acidification and methanation with larger sizes of ps mps being strongly associated with lower functional microbial richness 3 5 redirection of acidification and methanation with exposure to different sizes of ps microplastics as displayed in fig 4 a the comparison of the generation of vfas i e acetic propionic butyric acids and valeric acids was accomplished after acidification test in the experimental bottles with exposure to ps mps the total production of vfas exhibited size dependent inhibition effects compared to control specifically the extent of inhibition on the acidification step increased with the rising ps mps particle sizes until the total vfa yield dropped to 38 3 of control with the existence of 150 μm ps mps similarly the cumulative methane production from acidification products decreased by 7 9 to 36 2 of control p 0 05 with the particle sizes of ps mps increasing from 0 5 μm to 150 μm thus the steps of acidification and methanation were both restrained by ps mps especially those with larger mp sizes which were corresponding to the shifts of microbial compositions in the ags samples forming the internal causes of the suppressed methane productions 3 6 mechanisms of the distinct effects of different sizes of ps microplastics on ags systems in this work the impacts of the particle sizes of ps mps on the performances of ags system treating wastewater were evaluated from which it could be deduced that larger particle sizes of mps exerted greater negative effects on recovering methane from wastewater as well as the integrity of ags further investigation emphasized that ps mps exacerbated size dependent oxidative stress on microorganisms on the basis of these findings questions about how these mps posed distinct toxicity to the ags microbes and how ags responded to the toxicity were raised according to the ros production results the existence of ps mps particularly those with larger sizes in this study was an incentive for the surge in the generation of ros which might be on account of the physical properties of ps mps it could be summarized in fig 4b that zeta potential value of the ps solutions decreased with the system with the largest size of ps in this work showing the most negative zeta potential from 13 7 0 1 mv to 16 6 0 2 mv thus larger particles of ps mps had stronger dispersing ability while the smaller microplastics tended to aggregate in aqueous systems huang et al 2021 correspondingly the propensity of the large sized ps mps to contact ags increased as confirmed by the decreasing affinity of ags for ps mps solutions of increasing particle diameters in this study in detail the contact angle of ps mps solutions against ags decreased from 59 57 to 39 76 with the increase of plastic size from 0 5 μm to 150 μm fig 4d it is noteworthy that the differences in the physical properties of the studied micro scale mps contributed to their varying degrees of toxicity to ags system nevertheless this positive correlation between microbial toxicity and ps mps particle size may not be reasonable when the plastic size reduced to the nanometer level it was acknowledged that the ags granules had micropores with average pore sizes in the range of 291 5 446 5 nm he et al 2017 as such nanoplastics 100 nm would penetrate the ags surface to access functional microbes in the inner core of ags forming another distinctive but important ags toxicity pathway regarding the existence of nanoplastics wei et al 2020 moreover previous publications have reported that the leachates from mps inhibited microbial growth thus affecting the performances of microbial activities for instance the toxicity of leaches from mps to algae luo et al 2019 aquatic organisms li et al 2016 and sludge wei et al 2019b were documented herein the performances of methane production with exposure to the leachates from different sizes of ps mps were assessed to verify the toxicity mechanisms of mp leachates fig 4c the experimental results indicated that the leachates from varying sizes of ps mps were strongly associated with the dropping methane production from wastewater by ags the leachates from 0 5 μm 1 μm and 10 μm ps mps had slighter effects on ags performances with decreases of 4 0 8 2 of control however the leachates from larger mp particles were more unfavorable for methane production in detail the cumulative methane production with exposure to 150 μm ps mps decreased to 85 2 of control p 0 004 showing the consistent trends with the batch exposure tests of mps consequently the inhibition effect of leachates from different sizes of ps mps was also a contributor to the toxicity to ags in addition to the varying dispersion properties of mps and their affinity with ags additionally further investigations on eps were also conducted to evaluate the microbial responses of ags to the toxicity induced by differently sized ps mps as an important constitute of ags eps was responsible for the stability of ags and the resistance to the external toxicity he et al 2017 the quantification of eps compositions was summarized in fig 5 a from which the contents of proteins polysaccharides humic acids and dna are presented regarding the 0 5 μm exposure bottles the sum of these organic substances increased to 113 9 of control among the experimental groups the eps secretion was negatively correlated with the ps mp sizes exposed to ags with the eps in the 150 μm test decreasing to 93 4 of control notably the reduction of eps would contribute to the cell death of the anaerobic microbes inside ags that cannot be effectively protected mu et al 2012 subsequently the eps extraction solutions were measured by eem to measure the compositions of the organic substances and the results were corresponding to those based on eps quantification test it was apparent that there located a peak in the region ⅴ confirming the existence of humic acids in the eps solution the ags samples with exposure to smaller sizes of ps mps i e 0 5 μm 1 μm and 10 μm secreted more humic acids than control with the increases of relative intensities of humic acids from 42 4 control to 63 1 0 5 μm 58 1 1 μm and 56 1 10 μm respectively however the relative content of humic acid in the 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm test was depressed by 22 5 26 2 and 27 5 of control liu et al reported that humic acids would alleviate the toxicity of mps especially those with smaller sizes liu et al 2020 therefore ags could resist the toxicity of ps mps with smaller sizes through biochemical reactions which was also consistent with the above findings of ags performances however the excessive toxicity originated from larger ps mps would destroy the resistance capability of ags through eps protection which might be another contribution to the suppressed performances of the ags the deductions from this study were expected to provide messages on the effects particle sizes of microplastics on ags and the toxicity mechanisms involved based on these mechanistic explorations the performances of the ags systems exposed to different sizes of ps mps were correlated with the combined effect of the toxicity mechanism and the ags defense mechanism considering the natural degradation of microplastic debris the exposure effects of micron scale ps mps were comprehensively explored including the comparisons about overall ags performances morphology properties and cell viabilities of ags the defensing systems against toxicity in ags and the insights into the varying degrees of mp toxicity it could be concluded that micron sized ps mps with the larger studied sizes brought about more obvious inhibition to ags wastewater treatment systems as such this work also introduced a new perspective for the operation of ags wastewater treatment system this was appropriate pretreatment methods could be applied to remove mps of specific size which might ultimately reduce the overall toxicity of mps to functional microbes in biological treatment facilities 4 conclusions based on the exposure tests of different sizes of ps mps to ags in this work larger sizes of ps mps particles contributed to more deteriorative performances of ags than the small ps mps including methane production and cod degradation the size distribution and morphological features of ags suggested the damage of granules with the existence of ps mps especially those with larger sizes with the ros production and cell viability confirming the death of ags cells in addition the microbial analysis revealed that the functional microbes relevant to acidification and methanation were the least abundant in samples exposed to 150 μm ps mps further mechanistic study demonstrated that the degree of the toxicity of the ps mps with the studied sizes was correlated with their dispersibility and contact ability with ags as well as the inhibitory effects of the leachates furthermore ags would excrete eps including humic acids to alleviate the external toxic pressure when exposed to small sizes of ps mps however this ability cannot resist the strong toxicity derived from ps mps particles with larger sizes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

was also reported that mps e g polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyvinyl chloride pvc showed side effects on the functional microbes in waste activated sludge was anaerobic digestion wei et al 2019a wei et al 2019b wei et al 2019c furthermore it was widely acknowledged that the chemical additives contained in various plastics were the main contributors to the biotoxicity of mps luo et al 2018 zaki and shoeib 2018 capolupo et al 2020 which were applied to achieve the durability and flexibility of plastic products zhang et al 2020a as an important receiver of pollutants the existence of mps has been broadly detected in wastewater ascribed to the production utilization and disposal of plastics murphy et al 2016 these particles would inevitably accumulate in wastewater treatment facilities and induce certain impacts on the performance of the wastewater treatment systems anaerobic granular sludge ags is one of the important microbial systems for anaerobic treatment of high concentration organic wastewater that may contain mps previously overlooked ags has numerous advantages over conventional floc sludge such as the stronger settling performances and more fixed and tight microbial distribution pol et al 2004 extracellular polymetric substance eps is considered to be an important component of ags which functions as the backbone of ags to bind cells to form sludge aggregates and as the protector to protect the internal microorganisms from the external shocks yan et al 2008 altas 2009 previous investigations have centered on the inhibitory effect of single sizes of microplastics i e pet and or pvc on the ags wastewater anaerobic treatment system and the mechanisms involved zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b however the possible effects on microbes may vary with plastic size due to the different physical properties microbial contact capabilities and chemical leaching capabilities for instance it was found that polystyrene ps microplastics with different particle sizes would pose varying degrees of inhibition on the microalgae related properties including photosynthesis and cell integrity liu et al 2020 however no efforts have been made so far to reveal the effect of various particle sizes of microplastics on the performances of ags in anaerobic wastewater treatment this work attempted to evaluate the distinct effects of different sizes of mps on the microbial responses of ags using ps mps as example and the mechanisms involved specially ps mps particles with six micron scale diameters 0 5 μm 1 μm 10 μm 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm covering the reported sizes in literature were selected as the model mps with the performances of methane production and ags properties being assessed furthermore the microbial analysis and the intermediate measurements in metabolic transformation steps were performed to explore the impacts of ps mps with different sizes on anaerobic wastewater treatment by ags from a microscopic perspective finally the contributions of the physical properties of ps mps and the corresponding leaching products were analyzed to explore the toxicity mechanism of varying sizes of ps mps with the constituents of the eps adhered to the surface of ags being quantified to assess the toxicity resistance mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 ps microplastics and ags sources polystyrene microplastics particles with sizes of 0 5 μm 1 μm 10 μm and 50 μm were purchased from huge biotechnology shanghai china with 5 w v ps dispersing in deionized water and traces of surfactant these ps suspensions were then placed at 4 c in a refrigerator in addition larger ps microplastics 75 μm and 150 μm were obtained from zhongcheng co ltd guangzhou china moreover the inoculated ags average particle diameter 1 37 mm for methane production was extracted from an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb system treating citric acid wastewater in detail the percentage of the volatile suspended solid vss to total suspended solid tss of the ags was 88 2 2 2 impacts of different sizes of ps microplastics on ags performances extensive batch exposure tests were conducted in seven groups of serum bottles which received 100 ml synthetic wastewater and 2 g tss l ags the wastewater ph 6 9 0 1 was consisted of 2000 mg cod l glucose serving as cod source 1000 mg l nh4cl 500 mg l kh2po4 200 mg l cacl2 200 mg l mgcl2 6h2o 50 mg l fecl3 and 10 ml l concentrated trace element solution zhang et al 2020a among the bottles one group served as control without ps mps addition while the other six groups contained the same content mass concentration based of ps mps with different particle sizes i e 0 5 μm 1 μm 10 μm 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm respectively the experimental ps mps content was selected as 75 mg l considering that ps mps of different sizes showed clear inhibitory effects on methane production from ags when the concentration increased to this level and the selected concentration of mps was based on the preliminary results of ps mps concentration ags response according to the concentration selection principle mentioned in literature liu et al 2020 after being flushed by nitrogen for over 5 min to maintain anaerobic conditions all the groups of bottles were sealed and incubated at 35 c in a shaker 150 rpm for 13 days when the gas content reached a saturated level the biogas h2 ch4 and co2 volume and composition were monitored every 1 2 days from which the production of methane could be calculated in addition samples were taken from each group of reactors with triplicates for the determination of lactate dehydrogenase ldh and the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy after the anaerobic exposure tests 2 3 ags characterization eps extraction and quantification notably ags samples were collected from all groups of reactors after the exposure tests for the measurement of the ags particle size distribution eps extraction and analysis morphology observations microbial community analysis oxidative stress by different sizes of ps mps and the analysis of live and dead cells additionally the distribution of the sizes of ags granules was analyzed by using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 uk after the pretreatment of removing the floating mps in detail the collected ags granules were washed by deionized water for three times and then were suspended in 1 phosphate buffer solution pbs the observation of the morphological properties of ags was achieved by using scanning electron microscopy sem in addition the measurement of reactive oxygen species ros was conducted in this work to express the oxidative stress induced by the ps mps the fluorescence tracking of the live and dead cells existing within ags was also performed by applying live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 wei et al 2020 whose detailed descriptions were provided in supporting information si specially the eps on the surface of the collective ags was extracted by heating 60 c in detail the sludge samples were firstly filtered to screening the supernatants prior to being washed three times by nacl solution w v 0 05 subsequently the ags samples were resuspended in the above nacl solution to 20 ml before heating with a water bath at 60 c for 30 min mu et al 2012 thereafter the contents of the compositions polysaccharides proteins humic acids and dna were quantified in the extracted eps solutions 2 4 impacts of different sizes of ps microplastics on the steps of acidification and methanation in ags basically the anaerobic ags treatment of wastewater with glucose as the cod source continuously undergoes two steps of acidification and methanation which comprehensively affect the response of ags during cod biotransformation thus two additional series of batch tests were set up to explore the impacts of different sizes of ps mps on these processes similarly 100 ml of synthetic wastewater with 75 mg l ps mps of corresponding sizes was introduced to serum bottles afterwards ags granules tss 2 g l were inoculated into each bottle with 10 5 g l 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid besa being dosed to interrupt the subsequent methanogenesis process each bottle was also flushed with nitrogen for over 5 min and sealed which was then cultivated in an air bath shaker 35 1 c 150 rpm afterwards the productions of volatile fatty acids vfas after 2 days reaction were measured to investigate the performances of the acidification step affected by ps mps the operation of the methanation test was similar to that of acidification except that 2 g cod l sodium acetate became a substitute for the equivalent amount of glucose without besa being added finally the cumulative methane production was measured in each bottle after 8 days anaerobic biochemical reaction when it stopped rising 2 5 impacts of the leachates from different sizes of ps microplastics on methane production by ags with an attempt to further explore the toxicity mechanism regarding chemicals leaching from the ps mps with different sizes on methane production by ags leachate solutions of the corresponding ps mps were obtained as reported by li et al 2016 for another groups of tests specially 100 ml synthetic wastewater as mentioned above and 75 mg l ps mps with the studied diameters i e 0 5 μm 1 μm 10 μm 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm were mixed in each serum bottle which was then incubated 35 c anaerobically for 13 days subsequently wastewater solutions with different leachates were obtained by filtering out the ps mps particles finally seven groups of bottles were inoculated with 2 g tss l ags including one group of control and six groups of bottles with mp leachates after being filled with nitrogen the serum bottles were sealed with aluminum caps and placed in a constant temperature shaker for incubation the effects of the leachates from these ps mps on ags performance were assessed by measuring methane production from each group of bottles after 13 days 2 6 chemical and microbial analysis the parameters of tss and vss were monitored with reference to the standard methods apha 2005 and the total gas volume of each anaerobic bottle was obtained by equilibrating the headspace gas pressure with the atmospheric pressure the actual composition of the generated biogas was assessed by introducing a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd lunan 6890 the distributions of vfas were measured by another gc with a flame ionization detector gc fid agilent gc 2010 plus specially the detailed procedure about the operation of the gcs for biogas and vfa measurements was following the descriptions in previous work zhang et al 2020a in addition the affinity of ags for different ps mps was measured by assessing the corresponding contact angles by using a contact angle goniometer the zeta potential of the mp solutions with equivalent concentrations as the ags exposure test was monitored by using a zetasizer nano zs instrument while an eem fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to measure the distributions of the organic compounds in reaction supernatants and eps solutions and normalization was introduced prior to calculating the relative contents of the organic compounds moreover the release of ldh was quantified based on the chromogenic reaction of pyruvic acid originated from the catalysis of lactic acid with 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine zhang et al 2020b notably the quantifications of polysaccharides proteins humic acids and dna were consistent with the detailed descriptions in previous publications wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a all experiments were conducted in triplicate in this study with the calculating p value 0 05 being statistically significant the microbial compositions in the collected ags samples at the end of the ags tests section 2 2 were analyzed using illumina miseq sequencing herein two primers of 515modf and 806modr were introduced during the real time pcr amplification prior to the final sequence analysis based on illumina miseq pf300 platform specially the sequences would be clustered into an operational unit otu once their similarity reached 97 in regard to microbial clustering 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of ags systems with exposure to different sizes of ps microplastics in this work the control ags batch test and six experimental ags tests with exposure to different sizes of ps mps were in operation for 13 days during which the cumulative methane production from wastewater reached saturation the results of methane production trends and the distribution of organic substances of the reaction supernatants are presented in fig 1 in general the cumulative methane production showed varying degrees of decline in the experimental tests with ps mps exposure overall the inhibition on methane production by ps mps in the studied range increased with the rising ps mps sizes the cumulative methane volume decreased by 6 7 0 5 μm test p 0 013 8 6 1 μm test p 0 0038 9 7 10 μm test p 0 0024 10 0 50 μm test p 0 0013 11 1 75 μm test p 0 0019 and 16 2 150 μm test p 0 0004 in comparison with the control reactors respectively after the batch exposure tests reaction supernatants in each serum bottle were extracted for further eem analysis based on the locations of organics in fluorescence spectra the organic substances dissolved in the supernatants could be classified into two types region ⅳ biodegradable polysaccharide like substances and region ⅴ nonbiodegradable humic acid like substances wang et al 2019 figure 1b represented the relative fluorescence intensity of region ⅳ which also reflected the relative content of glucose in the supernatant notably the relative glucose concentrations showed no significant differences compared to control in tests with smaller sizes of ps mps i e 0 5 μm 1 μm and 10 μm however this parameter increased from 57 8 control to 64 2 exposure to 150 μm indicating that the degradation of glucose was greatly inhibited with the presence of 75 mg l and 150 μm ps mps which was well corresponding with the declining cumulative methane production profiles 3 2 granule size distributions and morphological properties of ags with exposure to different sizes of ps microplastics the particle size distribution of ags collected from the bottles with differently sized and without ps mps exposure was demonstrated in fig 2 a which suggested that the ags particle size varied in the range of 10 3960 μm specially the medium particle diameter dx 50 in each anaerobic bottle was summarized in the graph the dx 50 of ags in the control group was 1387 μm with the ags particles from the experimental bottles having lower dx 50 compared to control in the bottle with ps mps of the largest size in this study 150 μm the dx 50 of ags subsequently decreased to 912 μm these results demonstrated that the existence of ps mps caused the breakage of ags particles and the larger sizes of ps mps contributed to stronger damage to ags integrity morphology properties of ags collected from control 0 5 μm test and 150 μm test were determined by the observation of sem in fig 2b as indicated by the figure the surface of the granule in the control ags bottle was smooth and rigid while some cracks appeared on the surface of ags exposed to 0 5 μm ps mps moreover ags from 150 μm exposure test exhibited staggered fissures with an inclination to being detached from the buck confirming the deduction of ags breakage besides microscopic compositions of ags could be observed from the higher magnification in particular filamentous bacteria occupied a larger proportion in the control granule which was considered to be functional microbes for methanation zhang et al 2020a nevertheless more bacilli and cocci made up the microcolony structure of the experimental ags especially in the 150 μm ps mps test as presented in fig 2b thus ps mps caused variable effects on the apparent structure and microbial composition of ags which were mps size dependent 3 3 ros production and cell viability of ags with exposure to different sizes of ps microplastics it was generally accepted that ros e g hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the hydroxyl radical oh and the superoxide o2 would induce oxidative stress to cells mu and chen 2011 which could be induced by microplastics wei et al 2019c zhang et al 2020a in the anaerobic systems the residual oxygen in the nutrient solution would react with the functional groups appearing on the surface of the microplastics leading to the generation of nanomolar h2o2 and o2 through chemical reactions nel et al 2006 cell death would happen once the ros production exceeded the threshold of biological resistance to oxidative stress xia et al 2008 thus it was necessary to explore the effects of different particle sizes of ps mps on the production of ros in ags cells with the results being shown in fig 2c the maximum ros production was 126 3 4 0 150 μm test in comparison with control in this work similarly ldh a parameter indicating cell membrane integrity presented a consistent increase in experimental tests specially ldh release with exposure to larger sizes of ps mps was obviously increased to 145 2 75 μm and 188 4 150 μm of control moreover the boost of ros production was believed to be related to the damage of cell viability bhattacharya et al 2010 the live and dead cells of ags from all the bottles were monitored and calculated fig 2d j live cells could be viewed by the green section while dead cells were marked in red it could be observed that more dead cells appeared in the ps mps exposure tests since the relative occupation of dead cells increased from 6 5 control to 7 6 0 5 μm and 21 4 150 μm which was aligned with the trends of gradually weakening ags performances 3 4 microbial communities of ags with exposure to different sizes of ps microplastics in accordance with the high throughput sequencing of the ags samples from the control and experimental 0 5 μm 1 μm 10 μm 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm bottles the variations of the microbial compositions could be obtained the coverage index si fig s1 of all the seven mixed samples were above 0 99 suggesting that the sequencing was convincing for microbial analysis he et al 2020 figure 3 a showed the results of principal component analysis pca on the basis of the microbial analysis on a phylum level the pc1 and pc2 totally occupied 58 4 of the microbial variations it could be easily deduced from the distribution distance that microbiomes from control 0 5 μm and 1 μm tests clustered together while samples from 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm tests showed a tendency to disperse the relative abundances of specific microbes at the phylum level were exhibited in fig 3b from which archaeal and bacterial phyla were both monitored in the samples it was noteworthy that euryarchaeota acknowledged to be methanogens vanwonterghem et al 2014 occupied the largest proportions of the phylum microbes regarding all the ags microbiomes the relative abundances of euryarchaeota showed decreases in the experimental samples compared to control and the exposure to larger sizes of ps mps resulted in lower relative abundances with the decrease from 30 7 in control to 18 3 in 150 μm test additionally the abundances other enriched phyla including chloroflexi halobacterota bacteroidota and firmicutes presented similar decreasing trends in the ags samples with different sizes of ps mps most of these bacteria were reported to be functional in degrading organic compounds ariesyady et al 2007 the sum of the relative proportions of these microorganisms decreased from 54 1 control to 46 0 0 5 μm test 43 2 1 μm test 38 7 10 μm test 38 4 50 μm test 33 8 75 μm test and 29 4 150 μm test indicating that larger sizes of ps mps would reduce the capability of ags to degrade organic substances in wastewater the distributions of the dominant orders in the seven samples were compared in fig 3c based on the physiological functions of microorganisms these microorganisms are divided into acidification related and methanogenesis related species the members belonging to anaerolineales bacteroidales caldatribacteriales synergistales kosmotogales clostridiales and acidaminococcales were reported to be capable of degrading saccharides and synthesizing vfas magnuson et al 2009 nakasaki et al 2019 lanzilli et al 2021 the total relative abundances of these acidification related microbes showed decreasing trends from control to experimental groups exposure to larger sizes of ps mps especially 25 1 in 150 μm test accordingly the functional microbes for acidification would be gradually less abundant as the particle size of ps mps increased the other dominant order species e g methanomicrobiales methanosarciniales and methanobacteriales were included in methanogens anderson et al 2009 lee et al 2011 whose populations exhibited similar trends to acidogens that the lower abundances were correlated with the larger sizes of ps mps further investigation of the microbial compositions on a genus level was displayed in fig 3d which confirmed that the existence of ps mps especially those with larger sizes decreased the relative abundances of anaerobes for methane production from wastewater species relevant to acidification were explored to be less abundant after exposure to ps mps with the decline in samples from 150 μm group being the most obvious in particular the population of candidatus caldatribacterium sp the predominant acidogens among the seven samples decreased by 14 8 to 39 7 of control with the increasing particle size of ps mps from 0 5 μm to 150 μm similarly anaerolinea sp and longilinea sp were documented to be functional in the synthesis of organic acids from carbohydrates yamada et al 2006 additionally hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium sp and acetoclastic methanosaeta sp methanogens were both detected in all the sludge samples sundberg et al 2013 whose relative abundances decreased by 15 1 40 4 and 60 2 74 4 of control when exposed to 0 5 150 μm ps mps hence the existence of ps mps shifted the microorganisms in ags system in a direction that was unfavorable for acidification and methanation with larger sizes of ps mps being strongly associated with lower functional microbial richness 3 5 redirection of acidification and methanation with exposure to different sizes of ps microplastics as displayed in fig 4 a the comparison of the generation of vfas i e acetic propionic butyric acids and valeric acids was accomplished after acidification test in the experimental bottles with exposure to ps mps the total production of vfas exhibited size dependent inhibition effects compared to control specifically the extent of inhibition on the acidification step increased with the rising ps mps particle sizes until the total vfa yield dropped to 38 3 of control with the existence of 150 μm ps mps similarly the cumulative methane production from acidification products decreased by 7 9 to 36 2 of control p 0 05 with the particle sizes of ps mps increasing from 0 5 μm to 150 μm thus the steps of acidification and methanation were both restrained by ps mps especially those with larger mp sizes which were corresponding to the shifts of microbial compositions in the ags samples forming the internal causes of the suppressed methane productions 3 6 mechanisms of the distinct effects of different sizes of ps microplastics on ags systems in this work the impacts of the particle sizes of ps mps on the performances of ags system treating wastewater were evaluated from which it could be deduced that larger particle sizes of mps exerted greater negative effects on recovering methane from wastewater as well as the integrity of ags further investigation emphasized that ps mps exacerbated size dependent oxidative stress on microorganisms on the basis of these findings questions about how these mps posed distinct toxicity to the ags microbes and how ags responded to the toxicity were raised according to the ros production results the existence of ps mps particularly those with larger sizes in this study was an incentive for the surge in the generation of ros which might be on account of the physical properties of ps mps it could be summarized in fig 4b that zeta potential value of the ps solutions decreased with the system with the largest size of ps in this work showing the most negative zeta potential from 13 7 0 1 mv to 16 6 0 2 mv thus larger particles of ps mps had stronger dispersing ability while the smaller microplastics tended to aggregate in aqueous systems huang et al 2021 correspondingly the propensity of the large sized ps mps to contact ags increased as confirmed by the decreasing affinity of ags for ps mps solutions of increasing particle diameters in this study in detail the contact angle of ps mps solutions against ags decreased from 59 57 to 39 76 with the increase of plastic size from 0 5 μm to 150 μm fig 4d it is noteworthy that the differences in the physical properties of the studied micro scale mps contributed to their varying degrees of toxicity to ags system nevertheless this positive correlation between microbial toxicity and ps mps particle size may not be reasonable when the plastic size reduced to the nanometer level it was acknowledged that the ags granules had micropores with average pore sizes in the range of 291 5 446 5 nm he et al 2017 as such nanoplastics 100 nm would penetrate the ags surface to access functional microbes in the inner core of ags forming another distinctive but important ags toxicity pathway regarding the existence of nanoplastics wei et al 2020 moreover previous publications have reported that the leachates from mps inhibited microbial growth thus affecting the performances of microbial activities for instance the toxicity of leaches from mps to algae luo et al 2019 aquatic organisms li et al 2016 and sludge wei et al 2019b were documented herein the performances of methane production with exposure to the leachates from different sizes of ps mps were assessed to verify the toxicity mechanisms of mp leachates fig 4c the experimental results indicated that the leachates from varying sizes of ps mps were strongly associated with the dropping methane production from wastewater by ags the leachates from 0 5 μm 1 μm and 10 μm ps mps had slighter effects on ags performances with decreases of 4 0 8 2 of control however the leachates from larger mp particles were more unfavorable for methane production in detail the cumulative methane production with exposure to 150 μm ps mps decreased to 85 2 of control p 0 004 showing the consistent trends with the batch exposure tests of mps consequently the inhibition effect of leachates from different sizes of ps mps was also a contributor to the toxicity to ags in addition to the varying dispersion properties of mps and their affinity with ags additionally further investigations on eps were also conducted to evaluate the microbial responses of ags to the toxicity induced by differently sized ps mps as an important constitute of ags eps was responsible for the stability of ags and the resistance to the external toxicity he et al 2017 the quantification of eps compositions was summarized in fig 5 a from which the contents of proteins polysaccharides humic acids and dna are presented regarding the 0 5 μm exposure bottles the sum of these organic substances increased to 113 9 of control among the experimental groups the eps secretion was negatively correlated with the ps mp sizes exposed to ags with the eps in the 150 μm test decreasing to 93 4 of control notably the reduction of eps would contribute to the cell death of the anaerobic microbes inside ags that cannot be effectively protected mu et al 2012 subsequently the eps extraction solutions were measured by eem to measure the compositions of the organic substances and the results were corresponding to those based on eps quantification test it was apparent that there located a peak in the region ⅴ confirming the existence of humic acids in the eps solution the ags samples with exposure to smaller sizes of ps mps i e 0 5 μm 1 μm and 10 μm secreted more humic acids than control with the increases of relative intensities of humic acids from 42 4 control to 63 1 0 5 μm 58 1 1 μm and 56 1 10 μm respectively however the relative content of humic acid in the 50 μm 75 μm and 150 μm test was depressed by 22 5 26 2 and 27 5 of control liu et al reported that humic acids would alleviate the toxicity of mps especially those with smaller sizes liu et al 2020 therefore ags could resist the toxicity of ps mps with smaller sizes through biochemical reactions which was also consistent with the above findings of ags performances however the excessive toxicity originated from larger ps mps would destroy the resistance capability of ags through eps protection which might be another contribution to the suppressed performances of the ags the deductions from this study were expected to provide messages on the effects particle sizes of microplastics on ags and the toxicity mechanisms involved based on these mechanistic explorations the performances of the ags systems exposed to different sizes of ps mps were correlated with the combined effect of the toxicity mechanism and the ags defense mechanism considering the natural degradation of microplastic debris the exposure effects of micron scale ps mps were comprehensively explored including the comparisons about overall ags performances morphology properties and cell viabilities of ags the defensing systems against toxicity in ags and the insights into the varying degrees of mp toxicity it could be concluded that micron sized ps mps with the larger studied sizes brought about more obvious inhibition to ags wastewater treatment systems as such this work also introduced a new perspective for the operation of ags wastewater treatment system this was appropriate pretreatment methods could be applied to remove mps of specific size which might ultimately reduce the overall toxicity of mps to functional microbes in biological treatment facilities 4 conclusions based on the exposure tests of different sizes of ps mps to ags in this work larger sizes of ps mps particles contributed to more deteriorative performances of ags than the small ps mps including methane production and cod degradation the size distribution and morphological features of ags suggested the damage of granules with the existence of ps mps especially those with larger sizes with the ros production and cell viability confirming the death of ags cells in addition the microbial analysis revealed that the functional microbes relevant to acidification and methanation were the least abundant in samples exposed to 150 μm ps mps further mechanistic study demonstrated that the degree of the toxicity of the ps mps with the studied sizes was correlated with their dispersibility and contact ability with ags as well as the inhibitory effects of the leachates furthermore ags would excrete eps including humic acids to alleviate the external toxic pressure when exposed to small sizes of ps mps however this ability cannot resist the strong toxicity derived from ps mps particles with larger sizes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15816,in many parts of the world climate change has already caused a decline in groundwater recharge whereas groundwater demand for drinking water production and irrigation continues to increase in such regions groundwater tables are steadily declining with major consequences for groundwater surface water interactions predominantly gaining streams that rely on discharge of groundwater from the adjacent aquifer turn into predominantly losing streams whose water seeps into the underground this reversal of groundwater surface water interactions is associated with an increase of low river flows drying of stream beds and a switch of lotic ecosystems from perennial to intermittent with consequences for fluvial and groundwater dependent ecosystems moreover water infiltrating from rivers and streams can carry a complex mix of contaminants accordingly the diversity and concentrations of compounds detected in groundwater has been increasing over the past decades during low flow stream and river discharge may consist mainly of treated wastewater in losing stream systems this contaminated water seeps into the adjoining aquifers this threatens both ecosystems as well as drinking and irrigation water quality climate change is therefore severely altering landscape water balances with groundwater surface water interactions having reached a tipping point in many cases current model projections harbor huge uncertainties and scientific evidence for these tipping points remains very limited in particular quantitative data on groundwater surface water interactions are scarce both on

projected to impact key river flow characteristics such as long term average discharge seasonality and extreme water levels more strongly than dam constructions and water withdrawals have done up to the year 2000 döll and zhang 2010 more obviously climate change and water overuse will also lead to increasing salinization of fresh coastal groundwater bodies due to dropping aquifers water tables

response to groundwater tables dropping below stream level they lose their water into the subsurface the natural water balance between surface waters and aquifers is driven by exchanging flows between both compartments whether a stream gains or loses water depends on hydraulic head differences the so called hydraulic gradient between the stream and the adjacent aquifer brunke and gonser 1997 schneidewind et al 2015 under natural conditions infiltration and exfiltration zones alternate within different morphological stream features and on different spatial and temporal scales brunke and

groundwater tables groundwater discharge to streams decreases de graaf et al 2019 gleeson and richter 2018 the water balance may even reach a tipping point where gaining stream sections change to losing ones in such cases surface water infiltrates into the subsurface fig 1 in the worst case this may cause streams and wetlands to dry up jasechko et al 2021 analyzed 4 2 million wells and the

groundwater pollution by infiltrating surface water is a problem of global significance under low flow conditions wastewater treatment plant effluents to streams and rivers can make up more than 50 of

et al 2022b 5 conclusions climate change regionally triggers groundwater table decline due to reduced groundwater recharge additionally reduced recharge and extended drought periods lead to increasing groundwater extraction as a consequence more streams will turn from gaining to losing streams this increases the risk of groundwater contamination by intrusion of polluted surface water to date there is little public and political awareness of this problem and data on groundwater surface water interactions are scarce we thus strongly encourage research on groundwater surface water interactions and

15816,in many parts of the world climate change has already caused a decline in groundwater recharge whereas groundwater demand for drinking water production and irrigation continues to increase in such regions groundwater tables are steadily declining with major consequences for groundwater surface water interactions predominantly gaining streams that rely on discharge of groundwater from the adjacent aquifer turn into predominantly losing streams whose water seeps into the underground this reversal of groundwater surface water interactions is associated with an increase of low river flows drying of stream beds and a switch of lotic ecosystems from perennial to intermittent with consequences for fluvial and groundwater dependent ecosystems moreover water infiltrating from rivers and streams can carry a complex mix of contaminants accordingly the diversity and concentrations of compounds detected in groundwater has been increasing over the past decades during low flow stream and river discharge may consist mainly of treated wastewater in losing stream systems this contaminated water seeps into the adjoining aquifers this threatens both ecosystems as well as drinking and irrigation water quality climate change is therefore severely altering landscape water balances with groundwater surface water interactions having reached a tipping point in many cases current model projections harbor huge uncertainties and scientific evidence for these tipping points remains very limited in particular quantitative data on groundwater surface water interactions are scarce both on

15817,detection of the agricultural acid herbicide mcpa 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid in drinking water source catchments is of growing concern with economic and environmental implications for water utilities and wider ecosystem services mcpa is poorly adsorbed to soil and highly mobile in water but hydrological pathway processes are relatively unknown at the catchment scale and limited by coarse resolution data this understanding is required to target mitigation measures and to provide a framework to monitor their effectiveness to address this knowledge gap this study reports findings from river discharge and synchronous mcpa concentration datasets continuous 7 hour and with additional hourly sampling during storm events collected over a 7 month herbicide spraying season the study was undertaken in a surface source water catchment 384 km2 of which 154 km2 is agricultural land use in the cross border area of ireland combined into loads and using two pathway separation techniques the mcpa data were apportioned into event and baseload components and the former was further separated to quantify a quickflow qf and other event pathways based on the 7 hourly dataset 85 2 kg 0 22 kg km 2 by catchment area or 0 55 kg km 2 by agricultural area of mcpa was exported from the catchment in 7 months of this load 87 7 was transported via event flow pathways with 72 0 transported via surface dominated qf pathways approximately 12 of the mcpa load was transported via deep baseflows indicating a persistence in this delayed pathway and this was the primary pathway condition monitored in a weekly regulatory sampling programme however overall the data indicated a dominant acute storm dependent process of incidental mcpa loss during the spraying season reducing use and or implementing extensive surface pathway disconnection measures are the mitigation options with greatest potential the success of which can only be assessed using high temporal resolution monitoring

gus groundwater ubiquity score 1 introduction meeting food demand through intensive agriculture without further environmental degradation is recognised as a global challenge cassman and grassini 2020 to meet production targets for example pesticide application has become a fundamental component of modern agriculture to maximise yields and to protect crops pretty 2018 however residual losses of agro chemicals following application increase ecological and human health risks yadav 2010 when transferred to adjacent water bodies from point and diffuse sources malaj et al 2014 consequently vital ecosystem goods and services that are provided by freshwater systems can be compromised bunn 2016 including provision and access to safe drinking water swartjes and van der aa 2020 national and international legislation is designed to counteract potential residual pollutant losses from agricultural chemical applications for example the european union eu has implemented statutory policies to protect and secure member states water resources the water framework directive wfd ojec 2000 drinking water directive dwd ojeu 2015 and other sister directives also covering european economic area states and transposed into united kingdom law following departure from the eu have provided common policy frameworks for water management and environmental protection based on the concept of river basin planning water utilities are required to ensure water supplied to consumers meets regulatory standards treatment to reduce and remove contaminants including pesticides is therefore routine and particularly so for supplies derived from surface sources which may have reduced natural geological filtration however conventional flocculation treatment processes may not be efficient in the removal of pesticide compounds and can require an augmented treatment process with expensive granular activated carbon filters pirsaheb et al 2014 furthermore pesticide removal planning and efficiency at water treatment works wtw is based on data from sparse monitoring most often on a weekly basis behmel et al 2016 and may not account for high concentrations during storm events especially in hydrologically responsive flashy catchments phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicides have received attention from research and policy communities due to their global distribution extensive use in agriculture and mobility costa et al 2013 mcpa 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid for example is a systemic polar herbicide that is used for post emergence control of rushes juncus spp and annual and perennial broad leaved weeds in grasslands and cereal fields piwowarczyk and holden 2013 due to its potentially high solubility in water 29 4 g l 1 at 20 c and poor adsorption to the soil matrix log koc 1 73 2 07 ppdb 2021 but see oberleitner et al 2020 for adsorption potential to riverbank materials and seasonal redox boundaries mcpa is susceptible to mobilisation and transfer to adjacent water bodies by runoff and leaching hiller et al 2010 as a result the compound can be widespread in the water environment and has been detected in surface water sandin et al 2018 groundwater mcmanus et al 2017 and drinking water supplies donald et al 2007 epa 2019 mcpa degrades in the environment following application and hornsby et al 1996 reports that the degradation half life dt50 of mcpa is 7 60 days in oxic environments ppdb 2021 reports a typical dt50 of 24 days in soil and 13 5 days in the water phase thorstensen and lode 2001 found mcpa half lives of 4 days in organic soils and 16 days in mineral soils however seasonal usage and rainfall events largely influence mcpa transfers from land with incidental losses occurring before the compound has fully degraded müller et al 2003 furthermore it is likely the degradation rate of mcpa slows once in anoxic sub surface environments such as groundwater and sediments mcmanus et al 2017 gamhewage et al 2019 correspondingly concentrations of mcpa in water bodies can frequently be high and place pressures on wtws not to exceed the maximum permissible limits for treated drinking water of 0 1 µg l 1 for a single pesticide compound and 0 5 µg l 1 for the sum of total pesticide compounds dwd ojeu 2015 in ireland for example where mcpa is widely used to control juncus spp on marginal and improved agricultural land on poorly drained soils a comprehensive review of water quality from 2013 2018 noted that 80 of 144 rivers 55 6 monitored for mcpa recorded positive detections of the compound epa 2019 furthermore 42 drinking water supplies had exceedances above the limit of 0 1 µg l 1 and mcpa accounted for 75 of these failures epa 2019 despite its widespread use and growing detection in water bodies mcpa transport mechanisms following mobilisation its biological impacts and its synergistic interactions with other pesticides and nutrients remain relatively unknown morton et al 2020 indeed in a wide ranging review morton et al 2020 identified major knowledge gaps in terms of the dynamics apportioning and persistence of mcpa transfers via surface and sub surface hydrological pathways and progress has been hindered by the limited insights provided by a paucity of monitoring data e g lefrancq et al 2017 it follows that for highly soluble and mobile pesticides such as mcpa which are susceptible to transfer during rainfall events a higher resolution sampling approach is required this type of empirical research has precedence at lysimeter bergström 1990 and plot scale ulrich et al 2013 however beyond catchment modelling approaches to estimate pesticide transport routes e g holvoet et al 2007 other catchment scale research has focussed more on the extent and pattern of pesticide losses e g blanchoud et al 2004 rather than using data to assess flow pathway dynamics an exception is reported in lefrancq et al 2017 where high temporal resolution sampling of pesticides in storm events in a very small 2 2ha catchment indicated a dominant overland flow pathway for other surface water contaminants such as nutrients using high temporal resolution catchment scale datasets of synchronous river discharge and concentration has demonstrated that phosphorus p pathways could be apportioned from the recession characteristics of p loads during storm events mellander et al 2012 this mass apportionment approach has subsequently been used in agricultural catchment studies to understand the dynamics and magnitude of p loads delivered via dominant pathways and to monitor the effect of agri environmental policies on those magnitudes murphy et al 2015 therefore this study was based on a recognised knowledge gap and an empirical method to apportion pesticide pollution pathways from higher resolution synchronous river discharge and chemical concentration data the specific aim was to provide a deeper understanding of mcpa hydrological pathways at the catchment scale using a high temporal sampling resolution to obtain datasets of synchronous river discharge and mcpa concentration and in combination with other secondary datasets the objectives were to 1 investigate mcpa concentrations and load dynamics in the river during a spraying season 2 using a mass apportionment approach quantify catchment scale mcpa load and concentration pathways 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the cross border river derg catchment 384 km2 elevation 32 450 m is located in the north west of the island of ireland two principal tributaries start from lough derg and lough mourne and flow in an easterly

derg river joins the strule becoming the mourne river and joins the wider foyle catchment flowing north into the foyle estuary and the north atlantic ocean the derg catchment has developed on a post glacial landscape with rolling hills and a wide valley maximum width approximately 18 km river channels are characterised by cascade step pools and pool riffle glide type sections catchment geology is comprised of metamorphosed schistose sandstone shale limestone and basic igneous intrusive and extrusive rock overlain with extensive glacial till sands gravels and alluvium in the channel valleys nrfa 2022 aquifers are poorly productive soils are naturally poorly drained on surface water gleys and with drained peat areas high rainfall and valley gradients result in the catchment contributing to flashy storm hydrology smyth 2007 extensive coniferous forest plantations peatlands scrubby wet woodland and open moorland dominate the western headwaters and upland areas rough extensive and improved grassland land uses transition from west to east in the mid to lower reaches of the catchment this transition is typical for the island of ireland and elsewhere in nw europe where upland land uses are different from the lowlands in post glacial landscapes and where runoff is influenced by organic heavy and often drained soils and atlantic weather systems ulén et al 2007 data on individual farm mcpa use were not available in the derg catchment and so any measured exports are only contextualised with national statistics for application to grasslands and catchment assumptions on inputs for example total annual mcpa load to grass and fodder crops in northern ireland is estimated to be 3 81 kg km 2 and in the republic of ireland 2 39 kg km 2 dafm 2017 lavery et al 2017 using published

were used as models to account for potential underestimates of total discharges total loads and pathway loads at the 384 km2 site due to the use of upstream hydrological data furthermore thirty storm

conditions during storm discharges despite mcpa having a low affinity with particle bound transport ppdb 2021 it was assumed that a change point in turbidity recessions would occur between more energetic event flow pathways and those at baseflow as post storm conditions establish mellander et al 2012 moreover hydrological flow paths were further conceptualised using the terminology adapted from archbold et al 2010 quickflow qf from overland flow and near surface sources interflow if as lateral flow through the soil profile and elevated baseflow ebf as a transition zone to groundwater were assumed to be components of event discharges in pathways from the surface to shallow sub surface baseflow bf was assumed to be from deeper aquifer groundwater sources sustaining river flows between storm events and low rainfall periods kelly et al 2019 2 3 mcpa monitoring to monitor mcpa concentrations in the river a 24 7 one 350 ml sample every 7 hours 24 samples per week monitoring regime was implemented at the wtw abstraction point following the method described by halliday et al 2012 and applied by morton et al 2021 to complement these data and to characterise hydrological event pathways of mcpa further samples were collected hourly during storms the monitoring period encompassed a 7 month spraying season from 1st april to 31st october 2019 for each sampling arrangement automatic refrigerated samplers 6712 isco usa with silicone pump tubing and vinyl intake tubing with 24 bottle carousels were housed in a grp kiosk adjacent to the river the 24 7 method was a continuous programme within which the sampler carousel and bottles were switched weekly for the hourly method the sampler was actuated using a conductivity probe which initiated the sampling programme following a rise in water level that completed the electrical circuit 1640 liquid level actuator isco usa to prepare for storm events the conductivity probe was set to 1 cm above current water levels in the 24 hours prior to a forecast event once actuated the sampler was programmed to take a sample every hour until all bottles were filled the passage of storm peaks was monitored remotely by telemetry hydrovu in situ usa to view the troll500 water level data and plan sample retrieval within a maximum of 12 hours of the event concluding following retrieval all water samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 prior to chemical analysis sample bottle material polyethylene and storage temperature tests were undertaken prior to analysis to ensure acceptable recoveries described in morton et al 2021 to further contextualise mcpa hydrological patterns a secondary mcpa concentration dataset from regulatory grab samples at the catchment outlet was obtained from ni water analysis by lc ms in an independent uk accreditation system laboratory limit of detection 0 0005 µg l 1 this monitoring coincided with the sampling period of the high resolution datasets and on average samples were taken every seven days generally between 08 00 and 12 00 utc 2 4 chemical analysis the method used for mcpa extraction and concentration on the 7 and 1 hourly samples was adapted from gervais et al 2008 to save resources where 1 hour and 7 hour samples coincided the 7 hour sample was analysed and the data shared with the 1 hour dataset the method was based on solid phase extraction spe bond elut env 200 mg 6 ml agilent technologies separation shimadzu nexera x2 uhplc hplc system and an infinitylab poroshell 120 ec c18 column and analysis sciex 6500 q trap instrument sciex uk ltd mcpa concentrations below the limit of detection 0 0005 µg l 1 were treated as half this value usepa 2000 further detail on the mcpa extraction method including uncertainty analysis is provided as supplementary material sm3 and sm4 and in morton et al 2021 2 5 mcpa concentration and discharge analysis mcpa concentrations µg l 1 for both 7 hourly and 1 hourly datasets were synchronised to instantaneous river discharge m3 s 1 instantaneous mcpa and 7 hour loads mg s 1 and kg respectively were calculated as the product of mcpa concentrations and river discharge subsequent pathway load apportionment was based on the summary equations described in supplementary material sm5 automated filtering algorithms are used to estimate event and baseflow contributions to hydrographs from time series records of discharge sloto and crouse 1996 and can be used to identify hydrological processes that are useful for water quality assessment eckhardt 2008 some recursive filters assume baseflows incorporate an element of elevated baseflow due to specific catchment conditions the local minimum method lmm however reduces the baseflow separations to the lowest conditions by identifying minimum discharge values in a set interval n these are compared to neighbouring minima and if less than a proportion i e 1 of these values f are classed as turning points these turning points are then connected as the baseflow contribution o brien et al 2013 here the bfi software gregor 2010 was adapted for use on the 7 hour time series using the lmm to identify very low contributions from the aquifer two adaptions were first the time step was reduced to 7 hourly rather than daily and second in addition to the method being used to separate baseflow from total flow the mcpa baseload was also separated from total load as n is normally empirically derived in days as a function of catchment area o brien et al 2013 change to a 7 hourly interval could not use this relationship however as the intention was to quantify the lowest possible baseflows and baseloads from total discharge and loads trials with several coarse representative f and n values were undertaken to separate the time series 20 combinations starting at one increment higher than the default f 0 5 bayou et al 2021 the combinations covered the range f 0 6 and n 5 to f 0 9 and n 9 subsequently four combinations of f 0 6 to 0 9 with n 9 were judged to provide the lowest baseflow and baseload conditions and an average was used in subsequent analysis total discharge and total load minus baseflow and baseload provided estimates of event discharge and event load also providing estimates of flow weighted mean mcpa concentrations in total base and event flows event load conditions were consequently used in further pathway separations as follows the 1 hourly storm hydrology and mcpa mass load data were separated into event pathways and mcpa mass transfer pathways using the heuristic hydrograph separation and loadograph recession analysis lra methods this is the graphical separation of flow and pollutant time series loads and can only be produced with enhanced river discharge and synchronous pollution concentration datasets mellander et al 2012 inflection points on the recession limb of the hydrographs and loadographs were visually identified in storm event time series the section between two inflection points indicates dominant hydrological and mcpa transfer pathways in this case the pathways were interpreted using the qf if and ebf conceptualisation pathways were separated logarithmically from the start of the rising limb to inflection points assuming a logarithmic pathway response to the rainfall event mellander et al 2012 event flow and mcpa mass loads for each conceptualised pathway qf if ebf were then quantified by summing the flow and load for the active time and then subtracting that for other concurring pathways mellander at el 2016 and supplementary material for further references sm6 the average proportion of flow and load for each pathway was applied to the full 7 hourly event load dataset to estimate the event pathway loads kg the proportion of baseflow and baseload in the bf pathway was estimated independently using the lmm method as noted previously a work flow diagram of the data handling process is shown in supplementary material sm7 3 results 3 1 hydrometeorology a cumulative precipitation total of 1779 mm was measured in the river derg catchment for the 2018 2019 hydrological year and was comparable to long term rainfall recorded at lough derg i e 3 difference to the 30 year annual average of 1739 mm normalised discharge for the 2018 2019 hydrological year calculated from the castlederg hydrometric station was 1306 mm ten and five year fdcs constructed from long term mean daily discharge data recorded at the castlederg hydrometric station are presented in figure 2 with corresponding data from the 2018 19 hydrological year despite small differences at higher discharges kruskal wallis tests indicated that there was no statistical difference between fdcs p 0 66 however mean daily discharges during the monitoring period 1st april to 31st october 2019 were found to be 16 higher than the ten year record and 28 higher than the five year record these data indicated lower discharges over the sampling period during the spring april may conversely summer june onwards and early autumn conditions were found to have higher discharges in comparison to the ten and five year periods figure 3 3 2 mcpa concentration and load analysis over the monitoring period 7 hour sampling resulted in a dataset of n 734 thirteen rainfall events were also captured at 1 hour resolution figure 4 a providing a second dataset of n 330 also shown in figure 4a are the mcpa concentrations from ni water regulatory sampling during the period n 30 a summary of mcpa concentrations is presented in table 1 and with figure 4a and a concentration duration curve in figure 4b shows the extent of higher magnitude concentrations as storm peaks were sampled by focusing on sampled storm events the hourly dataset had 80 3 of samples above the maximum concentration threshold of 0 1 µg l 1 for a single pesticide in treated water as regulated in the dwd furthermore 43 4 of samples exceeded 0 5 µg l 1 in total 158 samples 47 9 were captured on rising limbs of storm hydrographs of which 125 37 9 were over 0 1 µg l 1 and 65 19 7 exceeded 0 5 µg l 1 highlighting the pressures on wtw treatment during these periods the product of 7 hour mcpa and discharge data over the seven month spraying sampling period yielded an mcpa load of 85 5 kg 0 22 kg km 2 or 0 55 kg km 2 by agricultural land use area the thirteen storm events had a combined load of 34 7 kg substituting the storm periods in the 7 hour dataset for those data captured in the hourly sampling the estimated load for the sampling period was 87 1 kg 3 3 mcpa load separations the four coarse lmm filter outputs separated total discharge flow on the 7 hour data into event flows and baseflows the median proportion of baseflow was 0 37 0 47 0 38 0 36 0 32 and compares with a long term 1975 2020 baseflow index of 0 31 nrfa 2022 similarly mcpa load on the 7 hourly data was separated into event and baseload proportions the median proportion of the baseload was 0 13 0 129 0 129 0 129 0 086 of the total load see fig 5 a and b for baseflow and baseload separation example using lmm parameters of f 0 6 and n 9 the dividend of the sum of mcpa total load 85 2 kg event load 74 7 kg and baseload 10 9 kg with total flow 2 43 108 m3 event flow 1 53 108 m3 and baseflow 8 94 107 m3 provided an estimate of flow weighted mean concentrations over the monitoring period which were 0 351 µg l 1 0 487 µg l 1 and 0 122 µg l 1 respectively storm hydrographs can be complex and may include multiple peaks associated with successive rainfall events in the catchment as the lra requires a reasonably stable recession curve for analysis the sampled storm events were screened for suitability to omit recessions with further rainfall an overview of mcpa concentration datasets and instantaneous discharge identified four near consecutive storm events of similar magnitude that were applicable to hydrograph separation and lra table 2 and supplementary material sm8 for a full rainfall runoff sequence the four storms exported 11 5 kg of mcpa which was over 30 of the total exported across the 13 storm events sampled in the hourly dataset the maximum event load occurred during storm 8 4 1 kg with storms 7 and 6 contributing 3 2 kg and 2 6 kg respectively over the four storms graphical analysis of the flow and mcpa event load time series identified a faster load component comprising of most of the storm peaks and two slower event load components the qf flow and load pathway dominated up to 10 hours into storm events and maximum mcpa loads were noted between 2 hours and 5 hours from the first sample an inflection point was also noted some hours before 10 hours and this may indicate a faster flow pathway within the qf component slower event flow and load components were separated into if pathways 10 hours after the first sample and ebf pathways after 14 hours to 15 hours supplementary material sm9 and sm10 of the four storms the c3 fluorometer captured turbidity time series data in just two owing to sensor logging malfunctions despite this figure 6 a and b indicates an approximate change point in turbidity after approximately 14 15 hours in transition from if to ebf while this adds some support to the method following mellander et al 2012 further data would be required for validation in future investigations averaging the graphical separations across the four storms the event flow and load proportions for qf if and ebf were 0 712 0 169 0 119 and 0 822 0 123 0 056 respectively supplementary material sm11 using these to partition the four lmm event load outputs the median qf pathway exported 61 4 kg 72 0 of the total mcpa load during the monitoring period and the if and ebf pathways exported 9 2 kg 10 8 and 4 1 kg 4 9 respectively the baseload proportion lmm was estimated to be 10 9 kg 12 3 the dividend of the sum of qf if and ebf mcpa event load pathways with each median event flow pathway 1 10 108 m3 2 59 107 m3 and 1 83 107 m3 respectively provided an estimate of flow weighted mean concentrations over the monitoring period which for qf if and ebf were 0 558 µg l 1 0 355 µg l 1 and 0 227 µg l 1 respectively fig 7 for ni water samples taken for regulatory monitoring n 30 fig 4 60 were taken during bf conditions 63 during combined ebf and bf conditions despite this pathway only accounting for 12 3 of the mcpa load thirty seven percent were taken during qf conditions despite this pathway accounting for 72 0 of the load 4 discussion 4 1 hydrometeorology there was little variation in river derg catchment rainfall during the sampling year when compared to the long term average this translated into low deviations from long term average fdcs despite an apparent increase in median discharges and a decrease in high discharge up to 11 during the sampling year however seasonal hydrological variability indicated lower than average 5 and 10 year means discharges in spring periods and higher than average discharges in summer and early autumn for the sampling year these two conditions have the potential to increase trafficability on farmland for spring summer spraying and to increase the potential for soil anoxia vink and van der zee 1997 and hydrological flushing in summer autumn the impact on mcpa use and loss in the sampling season has therefore to be viewed in the context of potentially increased applications of mcpa in spring summer relative to long term average conditions and in summer autumn lower potential for attenuation due to soil anoxia and higher potential for mobilisation due to higher discharge this may have resulted in a higher risk of mcpa delivery from land to water in the year of sampling than in long term average years it is worth noting however that these variations in hydrological conditions measured in this study are likely to be similar to those proposed for irish catchments in climate change scenarios steele dunne et al 2008 seasonal and future variations in hydrometeorological conditions are also noted as being particularly important vectors for increased agricultural pollutant transfers in nw europe ockenden et al 2017 4 2 mcpa concentration dynamics and loads the discharge and mcpa datasets in figures 4a and 4b reveal a number of features first the close agreement with the ni water sample results and the 7 hour sample results i e from two laboratories in figure 4a provide an informal inter laboratory comparison and confidence in a complex analysis and different sample handling methods second the distribution of data in figure 4a highlight storm dependent mcpa loss from land to water that is acute in nature and with concentrations indicated by the hourly and 7 hourly sampling that would cause pressure at wtws treating abstracted water into drinking water for example the maximum concentration in the hourly dataset is almost double that in the ni water dataset and over 1 µg l 1 higher than the 7 hour dataset table 1 third figure 4b shows that the ni water dataset reasonably falls within the range of the 7 hour dataset with a similar pattern across all percentiles and so a useful indicator of a descriptive river concentration range for example both datasets indicate that the 0 1 µg l 1 threshold is exceeded for 40 of the time and the 0 5 µg l 1 threshold between 10 and 20 of the time despite this the hourly dataset demonstrates that even at seven hourly and at large catchment scale acute storm dependent mcpa transfers are better captured at higher resolution this 1 hour dataset demonstrates that during storm conditions the 0 1 µg l 1 threshold can be exceeded for up to 90 of the time and the 0 5 µg l 1 threshold up to 50 of the time of storm periods this has implications for water treatment works design for abstraction and pesticide removal as this is generally based on a low temporal resolution dataset and where concentration is the parameter of concern finally this last point has also to be considered in the context that not all storm events were sampled at the higher 1 hour rate and particularly early in the season storms were mostly captured using the 7 hour rate therefore the mcpa concentrations were likely to be higher than indicated i e undetected and a higher burden on treatment facilities however the datasets did not clearly show concentration complexity as a result for example of the full connection of all storm runoff pathways proximal distal sources e g phillips and bode 2004 or incidental losses independent of storm events bruen et al 2021 such patterns are likely to be important in terms of spraying opportunity trafficability pre condition and the frequency intensity of storms in the future as noted previously the high concentrations captured with all three sampling methods follow similar findings in canadian water reservoirs 0 37 µg l 1 donald et al 2007 and german surface waters 0 06 to 4 17 µg l 1 müller et al 2002 although higher concentrations have been reported elsewhere in ireland epa 2019 there are fewer studies on mcpa or other pesticide catchment loads and none with enhanced datasets for example when normalised to the derg catchment area the 7 hour load data over the 7 month period of 85 kg 0 22 kg km2 by catchment area or 0 55 kg km2 by agricultural land use area is two orders of magnitude higher than those annual losses reported in germany 0 002 kg km2 huber et al 2000 and canada 0 004 kg km2 poissant et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 used two different monthly sampling approaches in a comparable sized river catchment in scotland the highest annual flux recorded from the sum of six pesticides including mcpa was 0 013 kg km 2 considering that a 25 litre container of mcpa product has an equivalent 12 5 kg mcpa content the load estimated by the 7 hour derg dataset is the equivalent of almost seven full containers of a single pesticide being lost from land to water over the seven month period or approximately 10 of the estimated input by agricultural land use area see sm1 this excludes all mcpa degradation products and other pesticides and represents a very high single pesticide export on a sub annual basis moreover when factoring in the extra discharge modelled from the 49 km2 of ungauged catchment the total mcpa load and individual pathway loads could increase by 9 to 15 above that measured and apportioned this will however need to be verified with the development of a specific stage discharge rating curve for the 384 km2 site 4 3 mcpa in hydrological pathways and implications the separation of event and baseloads was demonstrated using two methods lra and lmm and an approximate validation of changing storm pathways using the turbidity datasets there is therefore some confidence applied to the major pathway load estimates using a method that is applicable to catchments dominated by surface water runoff processes however use of the lmm to separate baseloads from total loads and hence event loads would benefit from further testing with similar high temporal resolution datasets but particularly in combination with daily time step data over a longer time period this will provide a theoretical basis for deriving the n parameter rather than optimising this and in combination with the turning point parameter f while the lra method cannot be easily applied as a full time series baseload filter due to the longer time step and interruptions to recessions isolation of some discrete events comparing the lmm separation with a heuristic approach does support the filter method sm12 however further validation of the baseload separation could be done with time series groundwater chemical concentrations from borehole clusters e g rivas et al 2017 khan et al 2020 in combination with baseflow separation data a challenge here would be the investment required for high temporal resolution data at the outlets of river catchments combined with high spatial resolution data from borehole clusters within the catchments furthermore it was found that the qf component of event flow delivered most mcpa to the catchment outlet and the load in the bf component accounted for approximately 12 3 fig 7 further understanding of the partitioning of event loads into faster qf pathways as well as if and ebf pathways and particularly the role these have in the transition from qf to bf would benefit from further higher resolution datasets and a complete picture would be gained from inclusion of data from other catchments likewise the similarly fast runoff patterns and pathways in karst zones of contribution where lra has been used to partition below ground p load pathways mellander et al 2013 could also be investigated with higher resolution pesticide datasets together this would provide a benchmark for alternative physical modelling approaches e g pullan et al 2016 targeted catchment based interventions aimed at reducing diffuse pollution at source are being increasingly adopted as a sustainable alternative to traditional water treatment methods mohamed ibrahim et al 2019 these alternatives include catchment pesticide pollution mitigation measures bloodworth et al 2015 and system redesign from simple changes to practice deffontaines et al 2020 the qf and other event load pathways provide an indication of how the bulk of mcpa can be lost in the higher storm conditions and how mitigation should be targeted both source related mcpa use and transport related the hydrological connections between land and water management is the foundation of addressing acute diffuse pollution issues in critical source areas as demonstrated for other diffuse pollutants doody et al 2012 beyond statutory obligations in both irish jurisdictions and in place for several years statutory instruments 155 2012 statutory instruments 1657 2012 source measures may include stricter regulation of mcpa use for rush control and promotion of alternative treatments such as cutting and weed wiping with other less mobile products measures focussed on transport should consider intercepting the pathways to watercourses through for example requiring wider buffer zones along drains and rivers and prohibiting use in areas of peaty or poorly drained soils a useful review is provided by reichenberger et al 2007 for both ground and surface water systems these measures are essential in combination with better advice and training for farmers on the proper use disposal and risks of pesticide use harrington and ghanizadeh 2017 damalas and koutrabas 2018 morton et al 2021 also consider periods of reduced abstraction or abstraction from different sources during periods of acute high magnitude pesticide loads and concentrations they propose an empirical approach based on catchment pre conditions and river discharge rate of change to predict such periods using the groundwater ubiquity score gus of gustafson 1989 mcpa has a groundwater contamination potential of 2 98 ppdb 2021 where the boundary between moderate and high is 3 0 the 12 3 of mcpa load transferred in the bf pathway in this study is a catchment reflection of this contamination potential it is likely to be from the presence of pesticide that has not degraded following application and has infiltrated to the aquifer via sub surface pathways and subsequently been released into surface water this persistence has been noted elsewhere in groundwaters mcmanus et al 2017 munira et al 2018 and calls into question the degradation rates published for mcpa in the literature e g hiller et al 2010 as this is likely to be a chronic signal in flowing water it will be an urgent next phase in determining residual ecotoxicological impacts in isolation or with multiple stressors von stackelberg 2013 jackson et al 2016 it will also be important to assess these signals in terms of the mitigation required for below ground pesticide reduction e g della rossa et al 2017 moreover the estimation of mcpa pathway loads in figure 7 provides an important cautionary benchmark for using low temporal resolution data to monitor for example the effectiveness of pesticide mitigations that have a storm dependency in this example the use of ni water data for monitoring purposes indicates that 60 of samples were taken during bf conditions and so not during qf conditions when i the bulk of mcpa is lost and ii mcpa mitigation should be targeted here at least the 7 hour method will likely provide a more robust sampling alternative for monitoring the effectiveness of mcpa catchment mitigation measures to complement this the 1 hour storm method would be a more robust dataset for wtw abstraction and the design of filters for pesticide removal or alternative abstraction periods for pesticide avoidance morton et al 2021 5 conclusions this study provided new insights on the dynamics and persistence of the acid herbicide mcpa in a large scale surface source water catchment over a 7 month period that spanned a spraying season a combination of continuous 7 hour n 734 and focused storm 13 storms 1 hour n 330 samples indicated a high incidence of undesirable concentrations 0 1 µg l 1 of 36 1 and 80 3 respectively and with concentrations up to 4 6 µg l 1 this shows a seasonal system where mcpa losses are incidental storm dependent and acute as loads the 85 kg of mcpa lost from the catchment occurred during hydrometeorological conditions that were ideal for both application and losses drier spring summer transitioning to wetter summer autumn while variable from longer term records these conditions may be more prevalent under future climate scenarios using a combination of methods pathway load separations indicated that approximately 87 7 of the mcpa was lost in storm event pathways and 12 3 in baseflows these event load pathways were dominated by quickflow qf 72 0 and therefore mitigation should focus on limiting herbicide use at the catchment scale for source water protection alternatives would be the large scale disconnection of quickflow pathways or reduced abstraction during critical times a combination of these three solutions would be desirable deep baseflow loads indicated a persistence of mcpa in the sub surface environment processes and chronic impacts of which should be research priorities moreover regulatory monitoring weekly indicated that over 60 of samples were taken during baseflow conditions and so cannot be used to effectively monitor the immediate impacts of mitigation measures

15817,detection of the agricultural acid herbicide mcpa 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid in drinking water source catchments is of growing concern with economic and environmental implications for water utilities and wider ecosystem services mcpa is poorly adsorbed to soil and highly mobile in water but hydrological pathway processes are relatively unknown at the catchment scale and limited by coarse resolution data this understanding is required to target mitigation measures and to provide a framework to monitor their effectiveness to address this knowledge gap this study reports findings from river discharge and synchronous mcpa concentration datasets continuous 7 hour and with additional hourly sampling during storm events collected over a 7 month herbicide spraying season the study was undertaken in a surface source water catchment 384 km2 of which 154 km2 is agricultural land use in the cross border area of ireland combined into loads and using two pathway separation techniques the mcpa data were apportioned into event and baseload components and the former was further separated to quantify a quickflow qf and other event pathways based on the 7 hourly dataset 85 2 kg 0 22 kg km 2 by catchment area or 0 55 kg km 2 by agricultural area of mcpa was exported from the catchment in 7 months of this load 87 7 was transported via event flow pathways with 72 0 transported via surface dominated qf pathways approximately 12 of the mcpa load was transported via deep baseflows indicating a persistence in this delayed pathway and this was the primary pathway condition monitored in a weekly regulatory sampling programme however overall the data indicated a dominant acute storm dependent process of incidental mcpa loss during the spraying season reducing use and or implementing extensive surface pathway disconnection measures are the mitigation options with greatest potential the success of which can only be assessed using high temporal resolution monitoring

to meet production targets for example pesticide application has become a fundamental component of modern agriculture to maximise yields and to protect crops pretty 2018 however residual losses of

ecosystem goods and services that are provided by freshwater systems can be compromised bunn 2016 including provision and access to safe drinking water swartjes and van der aa 2020 national and international legislation is designed to counteract potential residual pollutant losses from agricultural chemical applications for example the european union eu has implemented statutory policies to protect and secure member states water resources the water framework directive wfd ojec 2000 drinking water directive dwd ojeu 2015 and other sister directives also covering european economic area states and transposed into united kingdom law following departure from the eu have provided common policy frameworks for water management and environmental protection based on the concept of river basin planning water utilities are required to ensure water supplied to consumers meets regulatory standards treatment to reduce and remove contaminants including pesticides is therefore routine and particularly so for supplies derived from surface sources which may have reduced natural geological filtration however conventional flocculation treatment processes may not be efficient in the removal of pesticide compounds and can require an augmented treatment process with expensive granular activated carbon filters pirsaheb et al 2014 furthermore pesticide removal planning and efficiency at water treatment works wtw is based on data from sparse monitoring most often on a weekly basis behmel et al 2016 and may not account for high concentrations during storm events especially in hydrologically responsive flashy catchments phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicides have received attention from research and policy communities due to their global distribution extensive use in agriculture and mobility costa et al 2013 mcpa 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid for example is a systemic polar herbicide that is used for post emergence control of rushes juncus spp and annual and perennial broad leaved weeds in grasslands and cereal fields piwowarczyk and holden 2013 due to its potentially high solubility in water 29 4 g l 1 at 20 c and poor adsorption to the soil matrix log koc 1 73 2 07 ppdb 2021 but see oberleitner et al 2020 for adsorption potential to riverbank materials and seasonal redox boundaries mcpa is susceptible to mobilisation and transfer to adjacent water bodies by runoff and leaching hiller et al 2010 as a result the compound can be widespread in the water environment and has been detected in surface water sandin et al 2018 groundwater mcmanus et al 2017 and drinking water supplies donald et al 2007 epa 2019 mcpa degrades in the environment following application and hornsby et al 1996 reports that the degradation half life dt50 of mcpa is 7 60 days in oxic environments ppdb 2021 reports a typical dt50 of 24 days in soil and 13 5 days in the water phase thorstensen and lode 2001 found mcpa half lives of 4 days in organic soils and 16 days in mineral soils however seasonal usage and rainfall events largely influence mcpa transfers from land with incidental losses occurring before the compound has fully degraded müller et al 2003 furthermore it is likely the degradation rate of mcpa slows once in anoxic sub surface environments such as groundwater and sediments mcmanus et al 2017 gamhewage et al 2019 correspondingly concentrations of mcpa in water bodies can frequently be high and place pressures on wtws not to exceed the maximum permissible limits for treated drinking water of 0 1 µg l 1 for a single pesticide compound and 0 5 µg l 1 for the sum of total pesticide compounds dwd ojeu 2015 in ireland for example where mcpa is widely used to control juncus spp on marginal and improved agricultural land on poorly drained soils a comprehensive review of water quality from 2013 2018 noted that 80 of 144 rivers 55 6 monitored for mcpa recorded positive detections of the compound epa 2019 furthermore 42 drinking water supplies had exceedances above the limit of 0 1 µg l 1 and mcpa accounted for 75 of these failures epa 2019 despite its widespread use and growing detection in water bodies mcpa transport mechanisms following

identified major knowledge gaps in terms of the dynamics apportioning and persistence of mcpa transfers via surface and sub surface hydrological pathways and progress has been hindered by the limited insights provided by a paucity of monitoring data e g lefrancq et al 2017 it follows that for highly soluble and mobile pesticides such as mcpa which are susceptible to transfer during rainfall events a higher resolution sampling approach is required this type of empirical research has precedence at lysimeter bergström 1990 and plot scale ulrich et al 2013 however beyond catchment modelling approaches to estimate pesticide transport routes e g holvoet et al 2007 other catchment scale research has focussed more on the extent and pattern of pesticide losses e g blanchoud et al 2004 rather than using data to assess flow pathway dynamics an exception is reported in lefrancq et al 2017 where high temporal resolution sampling of pesticides in storm events in a very small 2 2ha catchment indicated a dominant overland flow pathway for other surface water contaminants such as nutrients using high temporal resolution catchment scale datasets of synchronous river discharge and concentration has demonstrated that phosphorus p pathways could be apportioned from the recession characteristics of p loads during storm events mellander et al 2012 this mass apportionment approach has subsequently been used in agricultural catchment studies to understand the dynamics and magnitude of p loads delivered via dominant pathways and to monitor the effect of agri environmental policies on those magnitudes murphy et al 2015 therefore this study was based on a recognised knowledge gap and an empirical method to apportion pesticide pollution pathways from higher resolution synchronous river discharge and chemical concentration data the specific aim was to provide a deeper understanding of mcpa hydrological pathways at the catchment scale using a high temporal sampling resolution to obtain datasets of synchronous river discharge and mcpa concentration and in combination with other secondary datasets the objectives were to 1 investigate mcpa concentrations and load dynamics in the river during a spraying season 2 using a mass apportionment approach quantify catchment scale mcpa load and concentration pathways 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the cross border river derg catchment 384 km2 elevation 32 450 m is located in the north west of the island of ireland two principal tributaries start from lough derg and lough mourne and flow in an easterly direction for this investigation the catchment outlet was delineated at the northern ireland water ni water wtw abstraction point approximately 7 km east of castlederg in northern ireland figure 1 the derg river joins the strule becoming the mourne river and joins the wider foyle catchment flowing north into the foyle estuary and the north atlantic ocean the derg catchment has developed on a post glacial landscape with rolling hills and a wide valley maximum width approximately 18 km river channels are characterised by cascade step pools and pool riffle glide type sections catchment geology is comprised of metamorphosed schistose sandstone shale limestone and basic igneous intrusive and extrusive rock overlain with extensive glacial till sands gravels and alluvium in the channel valleys nrfa 2022 aquifers are poorly productive soils are naturally poorly drained on surface water gleys and with drained peat areas high rainfall and valley gradients result in the catchment contributing to flashy storm hydrology smyth 2007 extensive coniferous forest plantations peatlands scrubby wet woodland and open moorland dominate the western headwaters and upland areas rough extensive and improved grassland land uses transition from west to east in the mid to lower reaches of the catchment this transition is typical for the island of ireland and elsewhere in nw europe where upland land uses are different from the lowlands in post glacial landscapes and where runoff is influenced by organic heavy and often drained soils and atlantic weather systems ulén et al 2007 data on individual farm mcpa use were not available in the derg catchment and so any measured exports are only contextualised with national statistics for application to grasslands and catchment assumptions on inputs for example total annual mcpa load to grass and fodder crops in northern ireland is estimated to be 3 81 kg km 2 and in the republic of ireland 2 39 kg km 2 dafm 2017 lavery et al 2017 using published mcpa input loads for the main grassland uses in each jurisdiction and collated to the majority improved and rough grazing grassland classes morton et al 2021 approximate area based annual mcpa inputs 149 3 km2 in ni and 5 1 km2 in roi 154 4 km2 in total for the derg catchment were estimated to be 5 38 kg km 2 supplementary material sm1 2 2 hydrometry and hydrological pathways stage height m and rated discharge data were measured at 15 minute intervals at the department for infrastructure dfi hydrometric station at castlederg 335 km2 for this investigation data for the hydrological year 2018 2019 were used and also compared with longer term data stage height was also measured downstream at the abstraction point 384 km2 using a water level logger level troll 500 in situ usa in the absence of a rating equation for this downstream hydrometric station it was assumed that discharge was approximately similar to the upstream station following morton et al 2021 however to provide reference points for the extra 49 km2 area based estimates of river discharge were taken from the upstream gauging station and a downstream station 1 844 km2 using long term records sm2 these reference points were used as models to account for potential underestimates of total discharges total loads and pathway loads at the 384 km2 site due to the use of upstream hydrological data furthermore thirty storm event water levels may oct 2018 were compared at both 335 km2 and 384 km2 stations to establish the time lag peaks between each the average time between water level peaks was 105 minutes range 75 240 minutes standard error 6 38 minutes and so the upstream discharge data were adjusted as a proxy for downstream station instantaneous discharge albeit with the uncertainty of the extra 49 km2 sm2 rainfall mm data were collected by a tipping bucket rain gauge arg 100 eml uk and logged at 15 minute intervals tgp 4901 tinytag uk 15 km from the wtw abstraction point in the approximate centre of the catchment these were compared with long term data from a weather station at lough derg met éireann 2020 station number 1042 to assess the hydrological response of the river during the study period deviations from long term mean daily discharges 10 and 5 year were investigated discharge data were obtained from the hydrometric station at castlederg over the three timescales 10 yr 5 yr sampling year these were ranked and percentile discharge ranges from each timescale were extracted q1 q99 for flow duration curves fdc and seasonal comparisons following kolmogorov smirnov tests of normality kruskal wallis tests spss v26 ibm corp 2019 were conducted on the fdc data to test for differences p 0 05 between each period ssegane et al 2012 turbidity was measured at the wtw abstraction point every hour using a water quality sonde c3 submersible fluorometer turner designs usa these data were intended to provide an independent reference point between event and baseflow hydrological pathway conditions during storm discharges despite mcpa having a low affinity with particle bound transport ppdb 2021 it was assumed that a change point in turbidity recessions would occur between more energetic event flow pathways and those at baseflow as post storm conditions establish mellander et al 2012 moreover hydrological flow paths were further conceptualised using the terminology adapted from archbold et al 2010 quickflow qf from overland flow and near surface sources interflow if as lateral flow through the soil profile and elevated baseflow ebf as a transition zone to groundwater were assumed to be components of event discharges in pathways from the surface to shallow sub surface baseflow bf was assumed to be from deeper aquifer groundwater sources sustaining river flows between storm events and low rainfall periods kelly et al 2019 2 3 mcpa monitoring to monitor mcpa concentrations in the river a 24 7 one 350 ml sample every 7 hours 24 samples per week monitoring regime was implemented at the wtw abstraction point following the method described by halliday et al 2012 and applied by morton et al 2021 to complement these data and to characterise hydrological event pathways of mcpa further samples were collected hourly during storms the monitoring period encompassed a 7 month spraying season from 1st april to 31st october 2019 for each sampling arrangement automatic refrigerated samplers 6712 isco usa with silicone pump tubing and vinyl intake tubing with 24 bottle carousels were housed in a grp kiosk adjacent to the river the 24 7 method was a continuous programme within which the sampler carousel and bottles were switched weekly for the hourly method the sampler was actuated using a conductivity probe which initiated the sampling programme following a rise in water level that completed the electrical circuit 1640 liquid level actuator isco usa to prepare for storm events the conductivity probe was set to 1 cm above current water levels in the 24 hours prior to a forecast event once actuated the sampler was programmed to take a sample every hour until all bottles were filled the passage of storm peaks was monitored remotely by telemetry hydrovu in situ usa to view the troll500 water level data and plan sample retrieval within a maximum of 12 hours of the event concluding following retrieval all water samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 prior to chemical analysis sample bottle material polyethylene and storage temperature tests were undertaken prior to analysis to ensure acceptable recoveries described in morton et al 2021 to further contextualise mcpa hydrological patterns a secondary mcpa concentration dataset from regulatory grab samples at the catchment outlet was obtained from ni water analysis by lc ms in an independent uk accreditation system laboratory limit of detection 0 0005 µg l 1 this monitoring coincided with the sampling period of the high resolution datasets and on average samples were taken every seven days generally between 08 00 and 12 00 utc 2 4 chemical analysis the method used for mcpa extraction and concentration on the 7 and 1 hourly samples was adapted from gervais et al 2008 to save resources where 1 hour and 7 hour samples coincided the 7 hour sample was analysed and the data shared with the 1 hour dataset the method was based on solid phase extraction spe bond elut env 200 mg 6 ml agilent technologies separation shimadzu nexera x2 uhplc hplc system and an infinitylab poroshell 120 ec c18 column and analysis sciex 6500 q trap instrument sciex uk ltd mcpa concentrations below the limit of detection 0 0005 µg l 1 were treated as half this value usepa 2000 further detail on the mcpa extraction method including uncertainty analysis is provided as supplementary material sm3 and sm4 and in morton et al 2021 2 5 mcpa concentration and discharge analysis mcpa concentrations µg l 1 for both 7 hourly and 1 hourly datasets were synchronised to instantaneous river discharge m3 s 1 instantaneous mcpa and 7 hour loads mg s 1 and kg respectively were calculated as the product of mcpa concentrations and river discharge subsequent pathway load apportionment was based on the summary equations described in supplementary material sm5 automated filtering algorithms are used to estimate event and baseflow contributions to hydrographs from time series records of discharge sloto and crouse 1996 and can be used to identify hydrological processes that are useful for water quality assessment eckhardt 2008 some recursive filters assume baseflows incorporate an element of elevated baseflow due to specific catchment conditions the local minimum method lmm however reduces the baseflow separations to the lowest conditions by identifying minimum discharge values in a set interval n these are compared to neighbouring minima and if less than a proportion i e 1 of these values f are classed as turning points these turning points are then connected as the baseflow contribution o brien et al 2013 here the bfi software gregor 2010 was adapted for use on the 7 hour time series using the lmm to identify very low contributions from the aquifer two adaptions were first the time step was reduced to 7 hourly rather than daily and second in addition to the method being used to separate baseflow from total flow the mcpa baseload was also separated from total load as n is normally empirically derived in days as a function of catchment area o brien et al 2013 change to a 7 hourly interval could not use this relationship however as the intention was to quantify the lowest possible baseflows and baseloads from total discharge and loads trials with several coarse representative f and n values were undertaken to separate the time series 20 combinations starting at one increment higher than the default f 0 5 bayou et al 2021 the combinations covered the range f 0 6 and n 5 to f 0 9 and n 9 subsequently four combinations of f 0 6 to 0 9 with n 9 were judged to provide the lowest baseflow and baseload conditions and an average was used in subsequent analysis total discharge and total load minus baseflow and baseload provided estimates of event discharge and event load also providing estimates of flow weighted mean mcpa concentrations in total base and event flows event load conditions were consequently used in further pathway separations as follows the 1 hourly storm hydrology and mcpa mass load data were separated into event pathways and mcpa mass transfer pathways using the heuristic hydrograph separation and loadograph recession analysis lra methods this is the graphical separation of flow and pollutant time series loads and can only be produced with enhanced river discharge and synchronous pollution concentration datasets mellander et al 2012 inflection points on the recession limb of the hydrographs and loadographs were visually identified in storm event time series the section between two inflection points indicates dominant hydrological and mcpa transfer pathways in this case the pathways were interpreted using the qf if and ebf conceptualisation pathways were separated logarithmically from the start of the rising limb to inflection points assuming a logarithmic pathway response to the rainfall event mellander et al 2012 event flow and mcpa mass loads for each conceptualised pathway qf if ebf were then quantified by summing the flow and load for the active time and then subtracting that for other concurring pathways mellander at el 2016 and supplementary material for further references sm6 the average proportion of flow and load for each pathway was applied to the full 7 hourly event load dataset to estimate the event pathway loads kg the proportion of baseflow and baseload in the bf pathway was estimated independently using the lmm method as noted previously a work flow diagram of the data handling process is shown in supplementary material sm7 3 results 3 1 hydrometeorology a cumulative precipitation total of 1779 mm was measured in the river derg catchment for the 2018 2019 hydrological year and was comparable to long term rainfall recorded at lough derg i e 3 difference to the 30 year annual average of 1739 mm normalised discharge for the 2018 2019 hydrological year calculated from the castlederg hydrometric station was 1306 mm ten and five year fdcs constructed from long term mean daily discharge data recorded at the castlederg hydrometric station are presented in figure 2 with corresponding data from the 2018 19 hydrological year despite small differences at higher discharges kruskal wallis tests indicated that there was no statistical difference between fdcs p 0 66 however mean daily discharges during the monitoring period 1st april to 31st october 2019 were found to be 16 higher than the ten year record and 28 higher than the five year record these data indicated lower discharges over the sampling period during the spring april may conversely summer june onwards and early autumn conditions were found to have higher discharges in comparison to the ten and five year periods figure 3 3 2 mcpa concentration and load analysis over the monitoring period 7 hour sampling resulted in a dataset of n 734 thirteen rainfall events were also captured at 1 hour resolution figure 4 a providing a second dataset of n 330 also shown in figure 4a are the mcpa concentrations from ni water regulatory sampling during the period n 30 a summary of mcpa concentrations is presented in table 1 and with figure 4a and a concentration duration curve in figure 4b shows the extent of higher magnitude concentrations as storm peaks were sampled by focusing on sampled storm events the hourly dataset had 80 3 of samples above the maximum concentration threshold of 0 1 µg l 1 for a single pesticide in treated water as regulated in the dwd furthermore 43 4 of samples exceeded 0 5 µg l 1 in total 158 samples 47 9 were captured on rising limbs of storm hydrographs of which 125 37 9 were over 0 1 µg l 1 and 65 19 7 exceeded 0 5 µg l 1 highlighting the pressures on wtw treatment during these periods the product of 7 hour mcpa and discharge data over the seven month spraying sampling period yielded an mcpa load of 85 5 kg 0 22 kg km 2 or 0 55 kg km 2 by agricultural land use area the thirteen storm events had a combined load of 34 7 kg substituting the storm periods in the 7 hour dataset for those data captured in the hourly sampling the estimated load for the sampling period was 87 1 kg 3 3 mcpa load separations the four coarse lmm filter outputs separated total discharge flow on the 7 hour data into event flows and baseflows the median proportion of baseflow was 0 37 0 47 0 38 0 36 0 32 and compares with a long term 1975 2020 baseflow index of 0 31 nrfa 2022 similarly mcpa load on the 7 hourly data was separated into event and baseload proportions the median proportion of the baseload was 0 13 0 129 0 129 0 129 0 086 of the total load see fig 5 a and b for baseflow and baseload separation example using lmm parameters of f 0 6 and n 9 the dividend of the sum of mcpa total load 85 2 kg event load 74 7 kg and baseload 10 9 kg with total flow 2 43 108 m3 event flow 1 53 108 m3 and baseflow 8 94 107 m3 provided an estimate of flow weighted mean concentrations over the monitoring period which were 0 351 µg l 1 0 487 µg l 1 and 0 122 µg l 1 respectively storm hydrographs can be complex and may include multiple peaks associated with successive rainfall events in the catchment as the lra requires a reasonably stable recession curve for analysis the sampled storm events were screened for suitability to omit recessions with further rainfall an overview of mcpa concentration datasets and instantaneous discharge identified four near consecutive storm events of similar magnitude that were applicable to hydrograph separation and lra table 2 and supplementary material sm8 for a full rainfall runoff sequence the four storms exported 11 5 kg of mcpa which was over 30 of the total exported across the 13 storm events sampled in the hourly dataset the maximum event load occurred during storm 8 4 1 kg with storms 7 and 6 contributing 3 2 kg and 2 6 kg respectively over the four storms graphical analysis of the flow and mcpa event load time series identified a faster load component comprising of most of the storm peaks and two slower event load components the qf flow and load pathway dominated up to 10 hours into storm events and maximum mcpa loads were noted between 2 hours and 5 hours from the first sample an inflection point was also noted some hours before 10 hours and this may indicate a faster flow pathway within the qf component slower event flow and load components were separated into if pathways 10 hours after the first sample and ebf pathways after 14 hours to 15 hours supplementary material sm9 and sm10 of the four storms the c3 fluorometer captured turbidity time series data in just two owing to sensor logging malfunctions despite this figure 6 a and b indicates an approximate change point in turbidity after approximately 14 15 hours in transition from if to ebf while this adds some support to the method following mellander et al 2012 further data would be required for validation in future investigations averaging the graphical separations across the four storms the event flow and load proportions for qf if and ebf were 0 712 0 169 0 119 and 0 822 0 123 0 056 respectively supplementary material sm11 using these to partition the four lmm event load outputs the median qf pathway exported 61 4 kg 72 0 of the total mcpa load during the monitoring period and the if and ebf pathways exported 9 2 kg 10 8 and 4 1 kg 4 9 respectively the baseload proportion lmm was estimated to be 10 9 kg 12 3 the dividend of the sum of qf if and ebf mcpa event load pathways with each median event flow pathway 1 10 108 m3 2 59 107 m3 and 1 83 107 m3 respectively provided an estimate of flow weighted mean concentrations over the monitoring period which for qf if and ebf were 0 558 µg l 1 0 355 µg l 1 and 0 227 µg l 1 respectively fig 7 for ni water samples taken for regulatory monitoring n 30 fig 4 60 were taken during bf conditions 63 during combined ebf and bf conditions despite this pathway only accounting for 12 3 of the mcpa load thirty seven percent were taken during qf conditions despite this pathway accounting for 72 0 of the load 4 discussion 4 1 hydrometeorology there was little variation in river derg catchment rainfall during the sampling year when compared to the long term average this translated into low deviations from long term average fdcs despite an apparent increase in median discharges and a decrease in high discharge up to 11 during the sampling year however seasonal hydrological variability indicated lower than average 5 and 10 year means discharges in spring periods and higher than average discharges in summer and early autumn for the sampling year these two conditions have the potential to increase trafficability on farmland for spring summer spraying and to increase the potential for soil anoxia vink and van der zee 1997 and hydrological flushing in summer autumn the impact on mcpa use and loss in the sampling season has therefore to be viewed in the context of potentially increased applications of mcpa in spring summer relative to long term average conditions and in summer autumn lower potential for attenuation due to soil anoxia and higher potential for mobilisation due to higher discharge this may have resulted in a higher risk of mcpa delivery from land to water in the year of sampling than in long term average years it is worth noting however that these variations in hydrological conditions measured in this study are likely to be similar to those proposed for irish catchments in climate change scenarios steele dunne et al 2008 seasonal and future variations in hydrometeorological conditions are also noted as being particularly important vectors for increased agricultural pollutant transfers in nw europe ockenden et al 2017 4 2 mcpa concentration dynamics and loads the discharge and mcpa datasets in figures 4a and 4b reveal a number of features first the close agreement with the ni water sample results and the 7 hour sample results i e from two laboratories in figure 4a provide an informal inter laboratory comparison and confidence in a complex analysis and different sample handling methods second the distribution of data in figure 4a highlight storm dependent mcpa loss from land to water that is acute in nature and with concentrations indicated by the hourly and 7 hourly sampling that would cause pressure at wtws treating abstracted water into drinking water for example the maximum concentration in the hourly dataset is almost double that in the ni water dataset and over 1 µg l 1 higher than the 7 hour dataset table 1 third figure 4b shows that the ni water dataset reasonably falls within the range of the 7 hour dataset with a similar pattern across all percentiles and so a useful indicator of a descriptive river concentration range for example both datasets indicate that the 0 1 µg l 1 threshold is exceeded for 40 of the time and the 0 5 µg l 1 threshold between 10 and 20 of the time despite this the hourly dataset demonstrates that even at seven hourly and at large catchment scale acute storm dependent mcpa transfers are better captured at higher resolution this 1 hour dataset demonstrates that during storm conditions the 0 1 µg l 1 threshold can be exceeded for up to 90 of the time and the 0 5 µg l 1 threshold up to 50 of the time of storm periods this has implications for water treatment works design for abstraction and pesticide removal as this is generally based on a low temporal resolution dataset and where concentration is the parameter of concern finally this last point has also to be considered in the context that not all storm events were sampled at the higher 1 hour rate and particularly early in the season storms were mostly captured using the 7 hour rate therefore the mcpa concentrations were likely to be higher than indicated i e undetected and a higher burden on treatment facilities however the datasets did not clearly show concentration complexity as a result for example of the full connection of all storm runoff pathways proximal distal sources e g phillips and bode 2004 or incidental losses independent of storm events bruen et al 2021 such patterns are likely to be important in terms of spraying opportunity trafficability pre condition and the frequency intensity of storms in the future as noted previously the high concentrations captured with all three sampling methods follow similar findings in canadian water reservoirs 0 37 µg l 1 donald et al 2007 and german surface waters 0 06 to 4 17 µg l 1 müller et al 2002 although higher concentrations have been reported elsewhere in ireland epa 2019 there are fewer studies on mcpa or other pesticide catchment loads and none with enhanced datasets for example when normalised to the derg catchment area the 7 hour load data over the 7 month period of 85 kg 0 22 kg km2 by catchment area or 0 55 kg km2 by agricultural land use area is two orders of magnitude higher than those annual losses reported in germany 0 002 kg km2 huber et al 2000 and canada 0 004 kg km2 poissant et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 used two different monthly sampling approaches in a comparable sized river catchment in scotland the highest annual flux recorded from the sum of six pesticides including mcpa was 0 013 kg km 2 considering that a 25 litre container of mcpa product has an equivalent 12 5 kg mcpa content the load estimated by the 7 hour derg dataset is the equivalent of almost seven full containers of a single pesticide being lost from land to water over the seven month period or approximately 10 of the estimated input by agricultural land use area see sm1 this excludes all mcpa degradation products and other pesticides and represents a very high single pesticide export on a sub annual basis moreover when factoring in the extra discharge modelled from the 49 km2 of ungauged catchment the total mcpa load and individual pathway loads could increase by 9 to 15 above that measured and apportioned this will however need to be verified with the development of a specific stage discharge rating curve for the 384 km2 site 4 3 mcpa in hydrological pathways and implications the separation of event and baseloads was demonstrated using two methods lra and lmm and an approximate validation of changing storm pathways using the turbidity datasets there is therefore some confidence applied to the major pathway load estimates using a method that is applicable to catchments dominated by surface water runoff processes however use of the lmm to separate baseloads from total loads and hence event loads would benefit from further testing with similar high temporal resolution datasets but particularly in combination with daily time step data over a longer time period this will provide a theoretical basis for deriving the n parameter rather than optimising this and in combination with the turning point parameter f while the lra method cannot be easily applied as a full time series baseload filter due to the longer time step and interruptions to recessions isolation of some discrete events comparing the lmm separation with a heuristic approach does support the filter method sm12 however further validation of the baseload separation could be done with time series groundwater chemical concentrations from borehole clusters e g rivas et al 2017 khan et al 2020 in combination with baseflow separation data a challenge here would be the investment required for high temporal resolution data at the outlets of river catchments combined with high spatial resolution data from borehole clusters within the catchments furthermore it was found that the qf component of event flow delivered most mcpa to the catchment outlet and the load in the bf component accounted for approximately 12 3 fig 7 further understanding of the partitioning of event loads into faster qf pathways as well as if and ebf pathways and particularly the role these have in the transition from qf to bf would benefit from further higher resolution datasets and a complete picture would be gained from inclusion of data from other catchments likewise the similarly fast runoff patterns and pathways in karst zones of contribution where lra has been used to partition below ground p load pathways mellander et al 2013 could also be investigated with higher resolution pesticide datasets together this would provide a benchmark for alternative physical modelling approaches e g pullan et al 2016 targeted catchment based interventions aimed at reducing diffuse pollution at source are being increasingly adopted as a sustainable alternative to traditional water treatment methods mohamed ibrahim et al 2019 these alternatives include catchment pesticide pollution mitigation measures bloodworth et al 2015 and system redesign from simple changes to practice deffontaines et al 2020 the qf and other event load pathways provide an indication of how the bulk of mcpa can be lost in the higher storm conditions and how mitigation should be targeted both source related mcpa use and transport related the hydrological connections between land and water management is the foundation of addressing acute diffuse pollution issues in critical source areas as demonstrated for other diffuse pollutants doody et al 2012 beyond statutory obligations in both irish jurisdictions and in place for several years statutory instruments 155 2012 statutory instruments 1657 2012 source measures may include stricter regulation of mcpa use for rush control and promotion of alternative treatments such as cutting and weed wiping with other less mobile products measures focussed on transport should consider intercepting the pathways to watercourses through for example requiring wider buffer zones along drains and rivers and prohibiting use in areas of peaty or poorly drained soils a useful review is provided by reichenberger et al 2007 for both ground and surface water systems these measures are essential in combination with better advice and training for farmers on the proper use disposal and risks of pesticide use harrington and ghanizadeh 2017 damalas and koutrabas 2018 morton et al 2021 also consider periods of reduced abstraction or abstraction from different sources during periods of acute high magnitude pesticide loads and concentrations they propose an empirical approach based on catchment pre conditions and river discharge rate of change to predict such periods using the groundwater ubiquity score gus of gustafson 1989 mcpa has a groundwater contamination potential of 2 98 ppdb 2021 where the boundary between moderate and high is 3 0 the 12 3 of mcpa load transferred in the bf pathway in this study is a catchment reflection of this contamination potential it is likely to be from the presence of pesticide that has not degraded following application and has infiltrated to the aquifer via sub surface pathways and subsequently been released into surface water this persistence has been noted elsewhere in groundwaters mcmanus et al 2017 munira et al 2018 and calls into question the degradation rates published for mcpa in the literature e g hiller et al 2010 as this is likely to be a chronic signal in flowing water it will be an urgent next phase in determining residual ecotoxicological impacts in isolation or with multiple stressors von stackelberg 2013 jackson et al 2016 it will also be important to assess these signals in terms of the mitigation required for below ground pesticide reduction e g della rossa et al 2017 moreover the estimation of mcpa pathway loads in figure 7 provides an important cautionary benchmark for using low temporal resolution data to monitor for example the effectiveness of pesticide mitigations that have a storm dependency in this example the use of ni water data for monitoring purposes indicates that 60 of samples were taken during bf conditions and so not during qf conditions when i the bulk of mcpa is lost and ii mcpa mitigation should be targeted here at least the 7 hour method will likely provide a more robust sampling alternative for monitoring the effectiveness of mcpa catchment mitigation measures to complement this the 1 hour storm method would be a more robust dataset for wtw abstraction and the design of filters for pesticide removal or alternative abstraction periods for pesticide avoidance morton et al 2021 5 conclusions this study provided new insights on the dynamics and persistence of the acid herbicide mcpa in a large scale surface source water catchment over a 7 month period that spanned a spraying season a combination of continuous 7 hour n 734 and focused storm 13 storms 1 hour n 330 samples indicated a high incidence of undesirable concentrations 0 1 µg l 1 of 36 1 and 80 3 respectively and with concentrations up to 4 6 µg l 1 this shows a seasonal system where mcpa losses are incidental storm dependent and acute as loads the 85 kg of mcpa lost from the catchment occurred during hydrometeorological conditions that were ideal for both application and losses drier spring summer transitioning to wetter summer autumn while variable from longer term records these conditions may be more prevalent under future climate scenarios using a combination of methods pathway load separations indicated that approximately 87 7 of the mcpa was lost in storm event pathways and 12 3 in baseflows these event load pathways were dominated by quickflow qf 72 0 and therefore mitigation should focus on limiting herbicide use at the catchment scale for source water protection alternatives would be the large scale disconnection of quickflow pathways or reduced abstraction during critical times a combination of these three solutions would be desirable deep baseflow loads indicated a persistence of mcpa in the sub surface environment processes and chronic impacts of which should be research priorities moreover regulatory monitoring weekly indicated that over 60 of samples were taken during baseflow conditions and so cannot be used to effectively monitor the immediate impacts of mitigation measures

15818,the prolonged reaction period and low methane yield have become a pivotal bottleneck in the anaerobic digestion ad of waste activated sludge was severely limiting its use in bioenergy this study evaluated the long term semi continuous ad of was with isoelectric point pi pretreatment in terms of the reaction period methane yield material resource recovery and economic and environmental benefits the experimental results show that after pi pretreatment at the same solids retention time srt the average methane yield and methane content in the biogas of was increased by 120 9 and 15 5 respectively the average methane yield from ad with pi pretreatment at a 5 day srt was 1 6 times that of the ad without pi pretreatment at a 15 day srt indicating that pi pretreatment significantly p 0 001 increased the methane yield from the ad of was at different srts even at an ultra short srt statistical analyses of the changes in the concentrations of soluble organic matter in the ad process with and without pi pretreatment confirmed that pi pretreatment enhanced the biochemical reactions related to the transformation of sludge organic matter during the whole ad process but not the initial organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of the sludge furthermore pi pretreatment recovered the nahco3 na2s and multivalent metals from the sludge indicating that ad with pi pretreatment efficiently recovered both bioenergy and material resources from the sludge economic and environmental analyses of ad with and without pi pretreatment further indicated that with pi pretreatment the annual economic benefit of ad increases by 162 and carbon emissions decreases by approximately 2 63 107 kg co2 year compared with conventional ad these findings serve as an important reference for the development of a novel ad technology for sludge that incorporates second generation pretreatment and operates at an ultra short srt graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioenergy fermentation sewage sludge sludge pretreatment resource recovery isoelectric point 1 introduction energy recovery from waste activated sludge was is gaining popularity due to the gradual depletion of conventional energy sources and the signing of the paris climate agreement xu et al 2021a anaerobic digestion ad is widely regarded as a promising method of sludge treatment and has the potential to reduce carbon emissions while recovering bioenergy methane from was however the low ad efficiency of was which is characterised by a long reaction period i e a solids retention time srt of more than 20 days and a low methane yield i e low methane production and methane content in the resulting biogas has been a significant impediment to its efficient use xu et al 2020a to improve the ad efficiency of was researchers have proposed and tested various sludge pretreatments such as physical chemical and biological pretreatments or their integration neumann et al 2016 gonzalez et al 2018 xu et al 2020a nguyen et al 2021 although most of these pretreatment methods have significantly improved the initial organic solubilisation of sludge no comparable increase in methane production has been observed from the ad process for example lee and rittmann 2011 reported a 110 460 increase in soluble compounds after the pulsed pretreatment of sludge but only a 10 33 increase in methane production park and ahn 2011 found that thermal and microwave pretreatment increased sludge organic solubilisation by 170 and 220 respectively but resulted in only a 33 and 53 increase in daily biogas production respectively xu et al 2014 found that the alkaline pretreatment of sludge increased soluble proteins and soluble carbohydrate concentrations by 201 1 and 179 4 respectively but biogas production increased by only 41 41 wei et al 2017 found that pretreatment with free ammonia increased sludge hydrolysis rate by 91 140 but the biochemical methane potential increased by only 14 22 silvestre et al 2015 investigated the ozonation pretreatment of sludge with varying ozone doses and found that the sludge organic solubilisation increased by 94 7 256 1 while biogas production increased by only 21 6 takashima and tanaka 2008 investigated the effects of thermal alkaline oxidative pretreatment on sludge and found that while sludge organic solubilisation was 14 6 21 5 times higher in the treated group than in the control group methane production increased by only 20 60 one reasonable explanation for these findings is that most pretreatment methods focus mainly on improving the initial organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge while ignoring the targeted removal of intrinsic inhibitory substances in the sludge we call this type of pretreatment first generation pretreatment xu et al 2021a as is well known the complex structure of sludge and the intrinsic inhibitory substances in sludge contribute to its low ad efficiency appels et al 2008 gonzalez et al 2018 xu et al 2020a 2021a thus second generation sludge pretreatment methods should not only focus on increasing the organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge but also on dismantling the complex structure of sludge and removing the inhibitory effect of key intrinsic inhibitory substances on was biodegradability in our previous studies we found that the intrinsic organic binding metals obms in sludge can significantly reduce the ad efficiency of was xu et al 2017 based on a mechanistic understanding of the obm limited ad of was we proposed a novel second generation pretreatment method isoelectric point pi pretreatment which aims to maximise the retention of organic substances in sludge while simultaneously removing the obm and its inhibitory effects xu et al 2018 then using a series of batch experiments we comprehensively investigated the detailed mechanisms by which the pi pretreatment improves acidogenic and methanogenic fermentation during the ad of was in terms of physical structure interfacial thermodynamics electron transfer and microbial community xu et al 2020b 2021a although it has been confirmed that pi pretreatment enhanced the acidogenic and methanogenic fermentation of was in the batch experiments many questions are still opening because the batch experiment is usually an independent reaction period the possible problems in the successive multi reaction periods of ad with pi pretreatment can not be found through an independent reaction period for example through batch experiment it is difficult to judge whether pi pretreatment can shorten srt of ad and whether ad with pi pretreatment can operate normally at the shortened srt additionally in an independent reaction period the high efficiency of methane generation was obtained by the pi pretreatment but it is uncertain whether this positive result can also be obtained via pi pretreatment in the successive multi reaction periods moreover the previous studies mainly focused on revealing the underlying mechanisms of pi pretreatment enhancing acidification and methanation of sludge through batch experiments but the feasibility of long term semi continuous ad process with pi pretreatment is unclear and its advantages in reaction period methane yield material resource recovery and economic and environmental benefits need to be further investigated in this study the main objective was to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of pi pretreatment to improve the ad efficiency of was in terms of the reaction period methane yield material resource recovery and economic and environmental benefits first we carried out a long term semi continuous ad of was with and without pi pretreatment at different srts the effects of pi pretreatment on methane yield and methane content in the biogas at different srts 5 day 10 day and 15 day srts were validated and variations in the concentrations of soluble total organic carbon stoc volatile fatty acids vfas and soluble total nitrogen stn were monitored we then investigated the recovery of nahco3 na2s and major multivalent metals from the sludge via pi pretreatment finally the economic and environmental benefits of ad were analysed both with and without pi pretreatment as far as we are aware this is the first time that a long term semi continuous ad of was has been achieved using pi pretreatment at an ultra short srt of 5 days this study can provide an important reference for developing high efficiency ad systems for was using second generation pretreatment methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics and isoelectric point pi pretreatment of sludge was was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in shanghai china the inoculum for the long term semi continuous ad was obtained from a 30 day mesophilic semi continuous anaerobic sludge digester table 1 summarises the basic characteristics of various sludge samples as shown in table 1 the pi of sludge in this study is about 2 6 which is consistent with the previous report that the pi of sludge is usually at 2 0 4 5 liao et al 2002 according to our previous study xu et al 2018 the descriptions of pi measurement as follows nine 50 ml of the was were subjected to different ph values by adding 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl the zeta potential values of the nine samples were measured at 25 c using a nanosizer zs90 instrument equipped with backscattering detection at 173 malvern instruments co uk the samples were carefully poured into zeta potential folded capillary cells dts1060 to avoid air bubble formation each sample was measured at least three times and evaluated by a zeta quality report to ensure validity the pi pretreatment processes were carried out according to our previous publication xu et al 2020b 2000 ml of the total was transferred into a 2500 ml bottle with a working volume of 2000 ml and the ph was controlled at 2 6 pi 2 6 with the addition of 4 m hcl the resulting mixture was then stirred 250 rpm at 25 c for 5 h after agitation the pretreated sludge was transferred into centrifugation tubes and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min to separate the solids from the solution the solid residues were collected and then resuspended in the original volume 2000 ml using deionised water and stored at 4 c until used 2 2 semi continuous anaerobic digestion process of sludge the 180 day mesophilic semi continuous ad process was carried out in a water bath cauldron 37 1 c two continuous stirred fermentation bottles working volume 2000 ml were used to separate the sludge with pi pretreatment labelled as the experimental group eg and without pretreatment labelled as the control group cg fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the continuous stirred fermentation bottle and the photograph of the ad device during the start up stage of ad 1000 ml of inoculum was transferred to each of the eg and cg fermentation bottles and the bottles were sealed after 2 min of n2 purging then the gas outlet of the fermentation bottle was connected with a 1000 ml airbag to collect and measure the biogas generated daily when the daily biogas production fell below 10 ml the inoculum biogas production was progressed to the platform stage subsequently semi continuous ad with different srts was carried out as follows 1 the 40 day semi continuous ad with a 5 day srt consisted of daily additions of 400 ml of raw sludge and 400 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and eg fermentation bottles respectively no slurry was discharged from the fermentation bottle until the slurry volume had reached the bottle s working volume of 2000 ml once the slurry volume had reached 2000 ml we replaced the airbags daily at the same time i e 10 a m daily discharged 400 ml of digested sludge from each fermentation bottle and then added 400 ml of raw sludge and or 400 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and or eg fermentation bottles respectively 2 the 50 day semi continuous ad with a 10 day srt consisted of daily additions of 200 ml of raw sludge and 200 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and eg fermentation bottles respectively no slurry was discharged from the fermentation bottle until the slurry volume had reached the bottle s working volume of 2000 ml once the slurry volume had reached 2000 ml we replaced the airbags daily at the same time i e 10 a m daily discharged 200 ml of digested sludge from each fermentation bottle and then added 200 ml of raw sludge and or 200 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and or eg fermentation bottles respectively 3 the 60 day semi continuous ad with a 15 day srt consisted of daily additions of 133 ml of raw sludge and 133 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and eg fermentation bottles respectively no slurry was discharged from the fermentation bottle until the slurry volume had reached the bottle s working volume of 2000 ml once the slurry volume was reached we replaced the airbags daily at the same time i e 10 a m daily discharged 133 ml of digested sludge from each fermentation bottle and then added 133 ml of raw sludge and or 133 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and or eg fermentation bottles respectively the collected airbags from each semi continuous ad process under different srts were then labelled e g the airbags collected on day 1 at a srt of 5 days from the cg and eg bottles were labelled as cg 5d 1 and eg 5d 1 respectively from the labelled airbags we measured the biogas production and then analysed the methane content in the biogas as mentioned in section 2 5 furthermore each day we measured the ts and vs of the added sludge and digested sludge respectively and collected 50 ml of digested sludge samples from the cg and eg fermentation bottles which were used to analyse the changes in concentrations of stoc vfas and stn in sludge during the ad process 2 3 collection and analysis of the gas produced by pi pretreatment a special alkali liquor absorption device was used during the pi pretreatment of the sludge and the schematic diagram of the device is shown in supplementary fig s1 about 2000 ml of total was was transferred to a agitator in supplementary fig s1 and the ph was adjusted to 2 6 pi 2 6 using 4 m hcl the resulting mixture was then stirred 250 rpm for 5 h at room temperature and the generated gases were allowed to pass to b an alkali liquor absorption device filled with 80 ml of 2 m naoh supplementary fig s1 after agitation we measured the inorganic carbon and sodium sulphide contents in the alkali liquor of b which were expressed by co2 mol co2 g ts and h2s mol h2s g ts respectively the pretreated sludge was transferred to centrifugation tubes and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min to separate the solids from the solution the sludge solid residues were collected and resuspended in deionised water to the initial volume 2000 ml and stored at 4 c until further use the supernatant was collected to recover the main multivalent metals 2 4 removal and collection of multivalent metals from sludge about 800 ml of the supernatant ph 4 5 from the section 2 3 was transferred to ten 100 ml beakers 80 ml beaker which were labelled from 1 to 10 the ph of the samples in the beakers 2 10 was adjusted using 3 m naoh to 6 5 7 5 8 5 9 5 10 5 11 5 12 5 13 5 and 14 respectively subsequently all of the samples 1 10 were stirred 100 rpm for 30 min at room temperature the samples were allowed to settle for 2 h and then the supernatants were collected finally we measured the main multivalent metals in the supernatant of the samples 1 10 and then calculated the corresponding rates of recovery 2 5 main analytical methods the concentrations of the main multivalent metals al ca fe mg zn cd cr cu mn ni and pb in the sludge and supernatant samples were measured using a standard method apha 2005 which was also used to determine the ts and vs of the sludge samples the concentrations of soluble inorganic carbon and na2s generated during pi pretreatment were determined using a toc analyser shimadzu toc l cph cpn japan and a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550 japan respectively meeprc 1996 the concentrations of stoc and stn in the digested sludge were measured using a toc analyser shimadzu toc l cph cpn japan and the vfa concentrations were determined using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 1020 plus japan the methane contents in the biogas were measured by gas chromatography shanghai yidian analytical instrument co ltd gc112a china all measurements were performed in triplicate and the data were analysed statistically using the spss statistics 22 software ibm usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 production of methane and its content in the biogas produced at different solids retention times the methane yield and methane content in the biogas produced during the semi continuous ad of sludge samples cg and eg with different srts and their corresponding boxplot changes are shown in fig 2 fig 2 a and c show that under three srts the methane yield of the eg was always greater than that of the cg for example under a 15 day srt the average methane yield of the eg was 265 4 42 6 ml ch4 g vsadded which is 2 1 times that of the cg 126 8 24 7 ml ch4 g vsadded under a 10 day srt the average methane yield of the eg 231 0 38 2 ml ch4 g vsadded was 2 3 times that of cg 100 5 28 2 ml ch4 g vsadded under a 15 day srt the average methane yield of the eg was 4 6 times that of the cg these results indicate that regardless of the srt the methane yield from the ad of was with pi pretreatment was significantly p 0 001 greater than that of the ad of was without pretreatment implying that pi pretreatment significantly increases the methane yield from the ad of was under different srts an interesting observation from fig 2 a and c is that under a 5 day srt the methane yield of the cg was always less than 65 ml of ch4 g vsadded and the average methane yield of the cg was only 45 7 5 8 ml ch4 g vsadded which is significantly less than that of the cg under other srts suggesting that the ad of the cg with a 5 day srt cannot operate normally however the average methane yield from the ad of the eg with a 5 day srt was 207 3 29 0 ml ch4 g vsadded which is not significantly different from that of the eg under other srts indicating that the ad of was with a 5 day srt is possible with the effect of pi pretreatment classical thermodynamics holds that biochemical reactions will always spontaneously change from a non equilibrium state to an equilibrium state resulting in a gradual decrease in the changes of reactants and products over time in contrast if changes in the contents of products i e methane production could fluctuate greatly in a particular system the corresponding biochemical reactions would not reach a state of equilibrium in the system which suggests that such a system could have great potential for increasing the extent of methane generation xu et al 2020b another interesting finding from fig 2 c is that under the same srts the daily methane yield of the eg fluctuated more than that of the cg which indicate that biochemical reactions related to methane yield are more intense in the ad of the eg than that of the cg suggesting that pi pretreatment could enhance these biochemical reactions in the ad process and thereby result in a great potential for methane generation these results are also consistent with our results obtained previously through batch experiments xu et al 2021a fig 2 b and d show the differences in the methane content between the cg and eg under three srts under these srts the methane yields of the eg were always higher than those of the cg p 0 001 for example the average methane content of the eg under three srts was 81 5 1 9 which is about 1 2 times that of the cg under three srts this finding together with our previous findings xu et al 2021a indicates that pi pretreatment can enrich hydrogenotrophic methanogens and promote the reduction of co2 to methane therefore regardless of srt pi pretreatment can enhance the reduction of co2 to methane during the ad of was even with an ultra short srt furthermore as illustrated in fig 2 d under the same srts the methane content of the cg fluctuated more than that of the eg one possible reason is that while the methanogenic pathway of acetate metabolism is dominant in the cg d silva et al 2021 xu et al 2020a lyu et al 2018 other methanogenic pathways i e the h2 co2 metabolism retain a competitive advantage and will occasionally overtake it resulting in a large fluctuation of the methane content during the ad process of cg however it has been found that pi pretreatment was conducive to the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and the reduction of co2 to methane xu et al 2021a with the effects of pi pretreatment other methanogenic pathways i e acetate metabolism gradually lose their competitive advantages resulting in a small fluctuation in the methane yield of the eg 3 2 concentrations of soluble total organic carbon stoc volatile fatty acids vfas and soluble total nitrogen stn in the sludge under different solids retention times fig 3 shows the changes in the concentrations of stoc vfas and stn during the semi continuous ad of the eg and cg under different srts whereas supplementary figs s2 and s3 show the changes in the degradation of vs and in the concentrations of individual vfas during the semi continuous ad of the eg and cg under different srts respectively as shown in fig 3 a and d the concentrations of stoc in the ad of the eg under different srts were always greater than those in the ad of the cg p 0 001 for example under a 15 day srt the average stoc concentration of the eg was 168 4 17 7 mg l which is two times that of the cg under a 10 day srt the average stoc concentration of the eg was 212 5 32 7 mg l while that of the cg was 126 3 50 1 mg l under a 5 day srt the average stoc concentration of the eg was 3 5 times that of the cg 87 9 11 6 mg l these results indicate that pi pretreatment increases the residual concentrations of soluble organic matter to a certain extent after its conversion to methane during the ad of was the pi pretreatment had no effect on the initial organic solubilisation of was table 1 but significantly increased the methane yield of was fig 2 hence we believe that pi pretreatment can induce the self driven organic solubilisation of sludge and enhance the biochemical reactions of sludge organic matter into methane during the ad process which can be supported by the degradation of vs supplementary fig s2 fig 3 d shows that the stoc concentrations of the eg fluctuated more than that of the cg under the same srts further confirming that pi pretreatment could promote the biochemical reactions related to sludge organic transformation in the ad process which is consistent with previous studies xu et al 2020b 2021a as shown in fig 3 b and 3 c under three srts the maximum vfa and stn concentrations of the eg and cg were less than 300 mg l and 600 mg l respectively which were lower than their corresponding inhibitory concentrations appels et al 2008 yenigün and demirel 2013 indicating no acid or ammonia inhibition during the semi continuous ad process of the eg and cg with different srts fig 3 b and e show that under a 5 day srt the vfa concentrations of the eg were always greater than that of the cg p 0 001 and the average vfa concentration of the eg was 124 1 70 2 mg l which is 25 3 times that of the cg however under a 10 day or 15 day srt the average vfa concentrations of the eg were significantly p 0 001 higher than those of the cg but the vfa concentrations of the eg were not always greater than those of the cg one possible reason is that the ad of the cg under a 5 day srt failed and almost no vfas were produced which is also supported by the corresponding methane yields in fig 2 furthermore under three srts the vfa concentrations of the eg fluctuated more than those of the cg suggesting that a series of biochemical reactions associated with vfa generation were more intense than those of the cg hence pi pretreatment enhances the biochemical reactions associated with vfa generation during the ad process of was as supported by our previous findings xu et al 2020b from fig 3 c and f under three srts the stn concentrations of the eg were always greater than those of the cg p 0 001 for example the average stn concentrations of the eg under three srts were 1 7 times 5 day srt 1 2 times 10 day srt and 1 0 times 15 day srt more than that of the cg indicating that pi pretreatment promotes the stn concentration during the ad process of was one reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that the main nitrogen containing organic matters in sludge are proteins bitton 2002 wilen et al 2003 wang et al 2018 which are typical amphoteric biological macromolecules pi pretreatment can greatly change the structure and properties of the amphoteric biological macromolecules i e protein in sludge latif et al 2017 xu et al 2020b and thereby affect their transformation in the ad process resulting in an increase of the residual stn concentration furthermore under three srts the stn concentrations of the eg fluctuated more than those of the cg hence a series of biochemical reactions involved in the transformation of nitrogen containing substances during the ad of the eg were more intense than those during the ad of the cg implying that pi pretreatment enhances the transformation of nitrogen containing substances during the ad of was moreover from fig 3 d and e compared with a 10 day or 15 day srt under a 5 day srt the stoc and vfa concentrations of the eg fluctuated severely one reasonable explanation for this finding is that the inoculum originates from the ad of was with a 30 day srt when the srt is shortened to 5 days 83 3 the initial microbial community of the inoculum will gradually change and the concentrations of stoc and vfas will not change significantly immediately but after a certain time about 10 days in this study fig 3 a and b the stoc and vfas concentrations will change greatly resulting in the large fluctuations another interesting finding from fig 3 d to f is that under a 5 day srt the fluctuations in the stn concentrations of the eg were insignificant compared with the fluctuations of stoc and vfa concentrations one possible reason is that after pi pretreatment although the soluble protein concentration could increase in the ad process xu et al 2018 2020b some anaerobes usually can use soluble nitrogen containing substances to synthesise substances for their cells which reduce the stn concentration thus resulting in less obvious fluctuations in the stn concentrations compared with the stoc and vfas concentrations during the ad process of was 3 3 recovery of material resources from the sludge by pi pretreatment the pi of sludge is usually at ph 2 0 4 5 liao et al 2002 and the sludge needs to be stirred at this ph for 5 h during the pi pretreatment acid gases such as co2 and h2s will inevitably escape from the sludge meanwhile due to the effect of pi pretreatment multivalent metals in the solid phase of sludge are easily transferred to the solution and the supernatant obtained by centrifugation after pi pretreatment may thus be rich in multivalent metals to investigate the migration of co2 h2s and the main multivalent metals during pi pretreatment the escape of co2 and h2s from the sludge was monitored and the removal and the recovery of main multivalent metals from the sludge were investigated by adjusting the ph of the supernatant fig 4 shows the h2s and co2 contents escaping from the sludge due to pi pretreatment fig 5 illustrates the changes in the contents of main multivalent metals in the sludge and the changes in the removal rates with and without pi pretreatment fig 6 shows the concentrations of the main multivalent metals in the supernatant from pretreated sludge under different ph conditions from fig 4 the average concentration of co2 escaping from the sludge was 1 3 10 4 mol g ts about 5 72 kg co2 t ts which is a very low value probably due to the carbonate and bicarbonate present in the sludge this finding indicates that pi pretreatment can maximise the use of inorganic carbon in the sludge while avoiding its diffusion into the atmosphere which will be conducive to reducing the fugitive carbon emission of sludge furthermore the average concentration of h2s escaping from sludge was 4 1 10 9 mol g ts indicating that pi pretreatment can achieve slight desulphurisation of sludge from fig 5 the average content of the main multivalent metals al ca fe mg zn cd cr cu mn ni and pb decreased from 10 7 1 6 ts in the cg to 6 3 0 9 ts in the eg with an average removal rate of 41 1 indicating that pi pretreatment reduced the content of the main multivalent metals including heavy metals in sludge which may be conducive to the land use of digested sludge recovered after from the ad process fig 6 shows that when the initial ph of the supernatant is 4 5 the concentrations of al ca fe and mg were about one order of magnitude higher than that of the other multivalent metals i e zn cd cr cu ni and pb according to fig 6 a except for ca the other main multivalent metals can be removed step by step from the supernatant via ph adjustment suggesting that after pi pretreatment the main multivalent metals in the supernatant can be recovered via ph adjustment for example when the ph was increased from 4 5 to 6 5 the al concentration in the supernatant decreased sharply from 8 7 2 1 mg l to 0 4 0 1 mg l with an average removal rate of 95 9 when the ph was increased from 4 5 to 7 5 the fe concentration in the supernatant decreased sharply from 74 3 2 0 mg l to 0 3 0 1 mg l with an average removal rate of 99 5 when the ph was increased from 4 5 to 9 5 the mn concentration in the supernatant decreased sharply from 6 3 1 0 mg l to 0 2 0 1 mg l with an average removal rate of 87 7 when the ph was increased from 4 5 to 12 5 the mg concentration in the supernatant decreased sharply from 141 1 8 0 mg l to 0 001 mg l under detection limit furthermore as shown in fig 6 b when the ph of the supernatant was adjusted to 6 5 the concentrations of cd cr pb zn cu and ni in the supernatant were lower than 0 25 mg l and their corresponding average removal rates were 88 0 88 8 88 3 91 4 92 4 and 84 9 respectively indicating that when the ph of the supernatant reaches neutral most heavy metals are removed from the supernatant the removed heavy metals exist in the form of hydroxide precipitation and can be further recovered a careful examination of fig 6 reveals that when the ph was adjusted to 7 5 the average concentrations of the main multivalent metals except ca and mg in the supernatant were lower than 1 0 mg l indicating that the supernatant will be free of metal toxicity when the ph is adjusted to neutral after removing ca and mg the supernatant can be further used as softened water to resuspend the residual sludge solids from the centrifugation following pi pretreatment which contributes to water conservation 3 4 economic and environmental evaluation to comprehensively evaluate the ad of was with pi pretreatment economic and environmental analyses were conducted the corresponding results are summarised in table 2 because the infrastructure cost equipment operation cost and labour cost are directly related to the existing facilities of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and they usually vary greatly depend on different wwtps in this analysis they are excluded leaving only the generated benefits and reagent cost as shown in table 2 taking the application of pi pretreatment in anaerobic sludge digestion of a wwtp in shanghai ad capacity 74 460 t ts year as an example the economic and environmental analysis are carried out from the aspects of benefits reagent consumption and carbon emission reduction according to the experimental results in this study first we compared the economic benefits between the conventional ad system and the ad with pi pretreatment system with a sludge treatment capacity of 74 460 t ts year the methane production from the ad with pi pretreatment is about 7 036 470 kg ch4 year while that from the conventional ad is only 3 176 464 kg ch4 year fig 2 if all of the methane produced is used to generate heat and power the annual heat 1 95 108 mj and power 4 50 107 kwh produced by the ad with pi pretreatment are double than those produced by the conventional ad process assuming that the power price is 0 852 yuan kwh then the annual benefit in terms of power generated by the ad with pi pretreatment is 38340000 yuan which is 2 2 times that of the conventional ad these results indicate that the ad with pi pretreatment is significantly more efficient at extracting bioenergy from sludge than conventional ad suggesting that it will save a significant amount of energy generated by conventional fossil fuels moreover for the ad with pi pretreatment approximately 819 1 t nahco3 and 24 0 kg na2s are recovered annually during the pi pretreatment of sludge fig 4 generating a profit of 1311187 yuan year based on current market prices of nahco3 and na2s table 2 in this study the average removal rate of the main multivalent metals from sludge was 41 fig 5 the corresponding average recovery efficiency from the supernatant by adjusting ph to 7 5 was about 87 fig 6 and assuming a 50 effective utilisation coefficient of the main multivalent metals the annual benefit in terms of the recovery of main multivalent metals would be approximately 5601400 yuan according to current market prices of the main multivalent metals supplementary table s1 however the benefits in terms of resource recovery i e nahco3 na2s and the main multivalent metals from sludge in conventional ad are negligible these results indicate that ad with pi pretreatment is better at extracting material resources from sludge than conventional ad suggesting that it will save a significant number of inorganic products generated by chemical synthesis therefore the total benefit in terms of bioenergy and resource recovery from sludge in the ad with pi pretreatment system is 45252587 yuan year which is 2 6 times that of the conventional ad system 17295600 yuan year indicating that pi pretreatment significantly promotes the economic benefit of the ad of sludge second we compared the chemical costs of the conventional ad system and the ad with pi pretreatment system the chemicals consumed acid hcl 37 and alkali naoh mainly the acid and alkali for the pi pretreatment of sludge alkali for the recoveries of nahco3 and na2s and alkali for the recovery of the main multivalent metals in the ad with pi pretreatment system whereas no chemical is consumed during the conventional ad system with a sludge treatment capacity of 74 460 t ts year 5956 8 t hcl 37 and 967 98 t naoh are required annually for the pi pretreatment of sludge 385 t naoh and 8 2 kg naoh are required for the recovery of nahco3 and na2s and the main multivalent metals ph 7 5 respectively based on current market prices of 1000 yuan t hcl 37 and 2500 yuan t naoh the total chemical costs of ad with pi pretreatment system is 9339270 yuan year however the conventional ad system has no chemical cost third we compared the net profits after deducting the chemical costs between the conventional ad system and the ad with pi pretreatment system in the conventional ad system the use of chemicals is very small and the corresponding cost is also very low which can usually be negligible thus the net profits after deducting chemical cost are 17295600 yuan year however the net profit after deducting chemical costs in the ad with a pi pretreatment system is 35913317 yuan year 45252587 9339270 yuan year which is 2 times that of the conventional ad system concluding that although there is a chemical cost the ad with pi pretreatment system has a significant advantage over the conventional ad system in terms of obtaining economic benefit from the sludge fourth we compared the environmental benefits of the conventional ad system and the ad with pi pretreatment system with a sludge treatment capacity of 74 460 t ts year the ad with pi pretreatment system produces 2 47 107 kwh year more power than the conventional ad system assuming that the energy generation coefficient associated with carbon emissions is 1 05 kg co2 kwh the application of ad with a pi pretreatment system reduces the energy source carbon emissions by about 2 59 107 kg co2 year xu et al 2021b moreover during the pi pretreatment of sludge 4 26 105 kg co2 year and 10 37 kg h2s year from sludge are transformed into nahco3 and na2s respectively which can reduce fugitive carbon and sulphur emissions however in the conventional ad system these co2 and h2s may be released into the atmosphere from the digested sludge these results indicate that the ad with pi pretreatment system has significant advantages over the conventional ad system in obtaining environmental benefits from the sludge furthermore the average methane yield from the ad with pi pretreatment under a 5 day srt was 207 3 29 0 ml ch4 g vsadded fig 2 which is 1 6 times that of the conventional ad under a 15 day srt 126 8 24 7 ml ch4 g vsadded fig 2 indicating that ad with pi pretreatment can efficiently obtain bioenergy from was at an ultra short srt according to a previous publication appels et al 2008 the srt and olr of a conventional ad in wwtp are usually 20 days and 0 75 1 75 kg vs m3 d respectively whereas from this study the srt of ad with pi pretreatment can be shortened to 5 days and the olr can be increased to 3 0 kg vs m3 d assuming the same amount of sludge is treated the volume of the anaerobic reactor in ad with pi pretreatment system is reduced by one quarter that of the conventional ad system significantly reducing the land footprint of the anaerobic reactor these results indicate that ad with pi pretreatment overcomes the bottleneck of the conventional ad such as a long reaction period and low methane yield and efficiently extracts bioenergy and material resources from sludge at an ultra short srt implying that the ad of sludge with pi pretreatment system is a novel technology with a high bioconversion efficiency and significant economic and environmental benefits 4 conclusions in this study we evaluated the feasibility of long term ad of was with a pi pretreatment system the novel ad with pi pretreatment has the higher bioenergy conversion efficiency more obvious recovery of material resources and the greater economic and environmental benefits than the conventional ad the main conclusions are as follows 1 pi pretreatment significantly p 0 001 enhanced the methane yield from the ad of was under different srts even at an ultra short srt 5 days for example the pi pretreatment increased the average methane yield and content in the biogas of was by more than 2 2 times and 1 2 times respectively 2 statistical analysis confirms that the pi pretreatment significantly p 0 001 enhanced the biochemical reactions involved in the production of methane and vfas during the whole ad process but not the initial organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge 3 the ad of was combined with a pi pretreatment system is capable of recovering both bioenergy i e methane and material resources i e nahco3 na2s and multivalent metals from the sludge 4 the ad with pi pretreatment system has a significant advantage in obtaining economic and environmental benefits from the sludge assuming that 74 460 t ts of sludge is treated every year compared with the conventional ad system the annual economic benefit from the sludge is increased by 162 and the carbon emissions are reduced by approximately 2 63 107 kg co2

15818,the prolonged reaction period and low methane yield have become a pivotal bottleneck in the anaerobic digestion ad of waste activated sludge was severely limiting its use in bioenergy this study evaluated the long term semi continuous ad of was with isoelectric point pi pretreatment in terms of the reaction period methane yield material resource recovery and economic and environmental benefits the experimental results show that after pi pretreatment at the same solids retention time srt the average methane yield and methane content in the biogas of was increased by 120 9 and 15 5 respectively the average methane yield from ad with pi pretreatment at a 5 day srt was 1 6 times that of the ad without pi pretreatment at a 15 day srt indicating that pi pretreatment significantly p 0 001 increased the methane yield from the ad of was at different srts even at an ultra short srt statistical analyses of the changes in the concentrations of soluble organic matter in the ad process with and without pi pretreatment confirmed that pi pretreatment enhanced the biochemical reactions related to the transformation of sludge organic matter during the whole ad process but not the initial organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of the sludge furthermore pi pretreatment recovered the nahco3 na2s and multivalent metals from the sludge indicating that ad with pi pretreatment efficiently recovered both bioenergy and material resources from the sludge economic and environmental analyses of ad with and without pi pretreatment further indicated that with pi pretreatment the annual economic benefit of ad increases by 162 and carbon emissions decreases by approximately 2 63 107 kg co2 year compared with conventional ad these findings serve as an important reference for the development of a novel ad technology for sludge that incorporates second generation pretreatment and operates at an ultra short srt graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioenergy fermentation sewage sludge sludge pretreatment resource recovery isoelectric point 1 introduction energy recovery from waste activated sludge was is gaining popularity due to the gradual depletion of conventional energy sources and the signing of the paris climate agreement xu et al 2021a anaerobic digestion ad is widely regarded as a promising method of sludge treatment and has the potential to reduce carbon emissions while recovering bioenergy methane from was however the low ad efficiency of was which is characterised by a long reaction period i e a solids retention time srt of more than 20 days and a low methane yield i e low methane production and methane content in the resulting biogas has been a significant impediment to its efficient use xu et al 2020a to improve the ad efficiency of was researchers have proposed and tested various sludge pretreatments such as physical chemical and biological pretreatments or their integration neumann et al 2016 gonzalez et al 2018 xu et al 2020a nguyen et al 2021 although most of these pretreatment methods have significantly improved the initial organic solubilisation of sludge no comparable increase in methane production has been observed from the ad process for example lee and rittmann 2011 reported a 110 460 increase in soluble compounds after the pulsed pretreatment of sludge but only a 10 33 increase in methane production park and ahn 2011 found that thermal and microwave pretreatment increased sludge organic solubilisation by 170 and 220 respectively but resulted in only a 33 and 53 increase in daily biogas production respectively xu et al 2014 found that the alkaline pretreatment of sludge increased soluble proteins and soluble carbohydrate concentrations by 201 1 and 179 4 respectively but biogas production increased by only 41 41 wei et al 2017 found that pretreatment with free ammonia increased sludge hydrolysis rate by 91 140 but the biochemical methane potential increased by only 14 22 silvestre et al 2015 investigated the ozonation pretreatment of sludge with varying ozone doses and found that the sludge organic solubilisation increased by 94 7 256 1 while biogas production increased by only 21 6 takashima and tanaka 2008 investigated the effects of thermal alkaline oxidative pretreatment on sludge and found that while sludge organic solubilisation was 14 6 21 5 times higher in the treated group than in the control group methane production increased by only 20 60 one reasonable explanation for these findings is that most pretreatment methods focus mainly on improving the initial organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge while ignoring the targeted removal of intrinsic inhibitory substances in the sludge we call this type of pretreatment first generation pretreatment xu et al 2021a as is well known the complex structure of sludge and the intrinsic inhibitory substances in sludge contribute to its low ad efficiency appels et al 2008 gonzalez et al 2018 xu et al 2020a 2021a thus second generation sludge pretreatment methods should not only focus on increasing the organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge but also on dismantling the complex structure of sludge and removing the inhibitory effect of key intrinsic inhibitory substances on was biodegradability in our previous studies we found that the intrinsic organic binding metals obms in sludge can significantly reduce the ad efficiency of was xu et al 2017 based on a mechanistic understanding of the obm limited ad of was we proposed a novel second generation pretreatment method isoelectric point pi pretreatment which aims to maximise the retention of organic substances in sludge while simultaneously removing the obm and its inhibitory effects xu et al 2018 then using a series of batch experiments we comprehensively investigated the detailed mechanisms by which the pi pretreatment improves acidogenic and methanogenic fermentation during the ad of was in terms of physical structure interfacial thermodynamics electron transfer and microbial community xu et al 2020b 2021a although it has been confirmed that pi pretreatment enhanced the acidogenic and methanogenic fermentation of was in the batch experiments many questions are still opening because the batch experiment is usually an independent reaction period the possible problems in the successive multi reaction periods of ad with pi pretreatment can not be found through an independent reaction period for example through batch experiment it is difficult to judge whether pi pretreatment can shorten srt of ad and whether ad with pi pretreatment can operate normally at the shortened srt additionally in an independent reaction period the high efficiency of methane generation was obtained by the pi pretreatment but it is uncertain whether this positive result can also be obtained via pi pretreatment in the successive multi reaction periods moreover the previous studies mainly focused on revealing the underlying mechanisms of pi pretreatment enhancing acidification and methanation of sludge through batch experiments but the feasibility of long term semi continuous ad process with pi pretreatment is unclear and its advantages in reaction period methane yield material resource recovery and economic and environmental benefits need to be further investigated in this study the main objective was to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of pi pretreatment to improve the ad efficiency of was in terms of the reaction period methane yield material resource recovery and economic and environmental benefits first we carried out a long term semi continuous ad of was with and without pi pretreatment at different srts the effects of pi pretreatment on methane yield and methane content in the biogas at different srts 5 day 10 day and 15 day srts were validated and variations in the concentrations of soluble total organic carbon stoc volatile fatty acids vfas and soluble total nitrogen stn were monitored we then investigated the recovery of nahco3 na2s and major multivalent metals from the sludge via pi pretreatment finally the economic and environmental benefits of ad were analysed both with and without pi pretreatment as far as we are aware this is the first time that a long term semi continuous ad of was has been achieved using pi pretreatment at an ultra short srt of 5 days this study can provide an important reference for developing high efficiency ad systems for was using second generation pretreatment methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics and isoelectric point pi pretreatment of sludge was was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in shanghai china the inoculum for the long term semi continuous ad was obtained from a 30 day mesophilic semi continuous anaerobic sludge digester table 1 summarises the basic characteristics of various sludge samples as shown in table 1 the pi of sludge in this study is about 2 6 which is consistent with the previous report that the pi of sludge is usually at 2 0 4 5 liao et al 2002 according to our previous study xu et al 2018 the descriptions of pi measurement as follows nine 50 ml of the was were subjected to different ph values by adding 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl the zeta potential values of the nine samples were measured at 25 c using a nanosizer zs90 instrument equipped with backscattering detection at 173 malvern instruments co uk the samples were carefully poured into zeta potential folded capillary cells dts1060 to avoid air bubble formation each sample was measured at least three times and evaluated by a zeta quality report to ensure validity the pi pretreatment processes were carried out according to our previous publication xu et al 2020b 2000 ml of the total was transferred into a 2500 ml bottle with a working volume of 2000 ml and the ph was controlled at 2 6 pi 2 6 with the addition of 4 m hcl the resulting mixture was then stirred 250 rpm at 25 c for 5 h after agitation the pretreated sludge was transferred into centrifugation tubes and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min to separate the solids from the solution the solid residues were collected and then resuspended in the original volume 2000 ml using deionised water and stored at 4 c until used 2 2 semi continuous anaerobic digestion process of sludge the 180 day mesophilic semi continuous ad process was carried out in a water bath cauldron 37 1 c two continuous stirred fermentation bottles working volume 2000 ml were used to separate the sludge with pi pretreatment labelled as the experimental group eg and without pretreatment labelled as the control group cg fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the continuous stirred fermentation bottle and the photograph of the ad device during the start up stage of ad 1000 ml of inoculum was transferred to each of the eg and cg fermentation bottles and the bottles were sealed after 2 min of n2 purging then the gas outlet of the fermentation bottle was connected with a 1000 ml airbag to collect and measure the biogas generated daily when the daily biogas production fell below 10 ml the inoculum biogas production was progressed to the platform stage subsequently semi continuous ad with different srts was carried out as follows 1 the 40 day semi continuous ad with a 5 day srt consisted of daily additions of 400 ml of raw sludge and 400 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and eg fermentation bottles respectively no slurry was discharged from the fermentation bottle until the slurry volume had reached the bottle s working volume of 2000 ml once the slurry volume had reached 2000 ml we replaced the airbags daily at the same time i e 10 a m daily discharged 400 ml of digested sludge from each fermentation bottle and then added 400 ml of raw sludge and or 400 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and or eg fermentation bottles respectively 2 the 50 day semi continuous ad with a 10 day srt consisted of daily additions of 200 ml of raw sludge and 200 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and eg fermentation bottles respectively no slurry was discharged from the fermentation bottle until the slurry volume had reached the bottle s working volume of 2000 ml once the slurry volume had reached 2000 ml we replaced the airbags daily at the same time i e 10 a m daily discharged 200 ml of digested sludge from each fermentation bottle and then added 200 ml of raw sludge and or 200 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and or eg fermentation bottles respectively 3 the 60 day semi continuous ad with a 15 day srt consisted of daily additions of 133 ml of raw sludge and 133 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and eg fermentation bottles respectively no slurry was discharged from the fermentation bottle until the slurry volume had reached the bottle s working volume of 2000 ml once the slurry volume was reached we replaced the airbags daily at the same time i e 10 a m daily discharged 133 ml of digested sludge from each fermentation bottle and then added 133 ml of raw sludge and or 133 ml of pretreated sludge to the cg and or eg fermentation bottles respectively the collected airbags from each semi continuous ad process under different srts were then labelled e g the airbags collected on day 1 at a srt of 5 days from the cg and eg bottles were labelled as cg 5d 1 and eg 5d 1 respectively from the labelled airbags we measured the biogas production and then analysed the methane content in the biogas as mentioned in section 2 5 furthermore each day we measured the ts and vs of the added sludge and digested sludge respectively and collected 50 ml of digested sludge samples from the cg and eg fermentation bottles which were used to analyse the changes in concentrations of stoc vfas and stn in sludge during the ad process 2 3 collection and analysis of the gas produced by pi pretreatment a special alkali liquor absorption device was used during the pi pretreatment of the sludge and the schematic diagram of the device is shown in supplementary fig s1 about 2000 ml of total was was transferred to a agitator in supplementary fig s1 and the ph was adjusted to 2 6 pi 2 6 using 4 m hcl the resulting mixture was then stirred 250 rpm for 5 h at room temperature and the generated gases were allowed to pass to b an alkali liquor absorption device filled with 80 ml of 2 m naoh supplementary fig s1 after agitation we measured the inorganic carbon and sodium sulphide contents in the alkali liquor of b which were expressed by co2 mol co2 g ts and h2s mol h2s g ts respectively the pretreated sludge was transferred to centrifugation tubes and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min to separate the solids from the solution the sludge solid residues were collected and resuspended in deionised water to the initial volume 2000 ml and stored at 4 c until further use the supernatant was collected to recover the main multivalent metals 2 4 removal and collection of multivalent metals from sludge about 800 ml of the supernatant ph 4 5 from the section 2 3 was transferred to ten 100 ml beakers 80 ml beaker which were labelled from 1 to 10 the ph of the samples in the beakers 2 10 was adjusted using 3 m naoh to 6 5 7 5 8 5 9 5 10 5 11 5 12 5 13 5 and 14 respectively subsequently all of the samples 1 10 were stirred 100 rpm for 30 min at room temperature the samples were allowed to settle for 2 h and then the supernatants were collected finally we measured the main multivalent metals in the supernatant of the samples 1 10 and then calculated the corresponding rates of recovery 2 5 main analytical methods the concentrations of the main multivalent metals al ca fe mg zn cd cr cu mn ni and pb in the sludge and supernatant samples were measured using a standard method apha 2005 which was also used to determine the ts and vs of the sludge samples the concentrations of soluble inorganic carbon and na2s generated during pi pretreatment were determined using a toc analyser shimadzu toc l cph cpn japan and a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550 japan respectively meeprc 1996 the concentrations of stoc and stn in the digested sludge were measured using a toc analyser shimadzu toc l cph cpn japan and the vfa concentrations were determined using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 1020 plus japan the methane contents in the biogas were measured by gas chromatography shanghai yidian analytical instrument co ltd gc112a china all measurements were performed in triplicate and the data were analysed statistically using the spss statistics 22 software ibm usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 production of methane and its content in the biogas produced at different solids retention times the methane yield and methane content in the biogas produced during the semi continuous ad of sludge samples cg and eg with different srts and their corresponding boxplot changes are shown in fig 2 fig 2 a and c show that under three srts the methane yield of the eg was always greater than that of the cg for example under a 15 day srt the average methane yield of the eg was 265 4 42 6 ml ch4 g vsadded which is 2 1 times that of the cg 126 8 24 7 ml ch4 g vsadded under a 10 day srt the average methane yield of the eg 231 0 38 2 ml ch4 g vsadded was 2 3 times that of cg 100 5 28 2 ml ch4 g vsadded under a 15 day srt the average methane yield of the eg was 4 6 times that of the cg these results indicate that regardless of the srt the methane yield from the ad of was with pi pretreatment was significantly p 0 001 greater than that of the ad of was without pretreatment implying that pi pretreatment significantly increases the methane yield from the ad of was under different srts an interesting observation from fig 2 a and c is that under a 5 day srt the methane yield of the cg was always less than 65 ml of ch4 g vsadded and the average methane yield of the cg was only 45 7 5 8 ml ch4 g vsadded which is significantly less than that of the cg under other srts suggesting that the ad of the cg with a 5 day srt cannot operate normally however the average methane yield from the ad of the eg with a 5 day srt was 207 3 29 0 ml ch4 g vsadded which is not significantly different from that of the eg under other srts indicating that the ad of was with a 5 day srt is possible with the effect of pi pretreatment classical thermodynamics holds that biochemical reactions will always spontaneously change from a non equilibrium state to an equilibrium state resulting in a gradual decrease in the changes of reactants and products over time in contrast if changes in the contents of products i e methane production could fluctuate greatly in a particular system the corresponding biochemical reactions would not reach a state of equilibrium in the system which suggests that such a system could have great potential for increasing the extent of methane generation xu et al 2020b another interesting finding from fig 2 c is that under the same srts the daily methane yield of the eg fluctuated more than that of the cg which indicate that biochemical reactions related to methane yield are more intense in the ad of the eg than that of the cg suggesting that pi pretreatment could enhance these biochemical reactions in the ad process and thereby result in a great potential for methane generation these results are also consistent with our results obtained previously through batch experiments xu et al 2021a fig 2 b and d show the differences in the methane content between the cg and eg under three srts under these srts the methane yields of the eg were always higher than those of the cg p 0 001 for example the average methane content of the eg under three srts was 81 5 1 9 which is about 1 2 times that of the cg under three srts this finding together with our previous findings xu et al 2021a indicates that pi pretreatment can enrich hydrogenotrophic methanogens and promote the reduction of co2 to methane therefore regardless of srt pi pretreatment can enhance the reduction of co2 to methane during the ad of was even with an ultra short srt furthermore as illustrated in fig 2 d under the same srts the methane content of the cg fluctuated more than that of the eg one possible reason is that while the methanogenic pathway of acetate metabolism is dominant in the cg d silva et al 2021 xu et al 2020a lyu et al 2018 other methanogenic pathways i e the h2 co2 metabolism retain a competitive advantage and will occasionally overtake it resulting in a large fluctuation of the methane content during the ad process of cg however it has been found that pi pretreatment was conducive to the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and the reduction of co2 to methane xu et al 2021a with the effects of pi pretreatment other methanogenic pathways i e acetate metabolism gradually lose their competitive advantages resulting in a small fluctuation in the methane yield of the eg 3 2 concentrations of soluble total organic carbon stoc volatile fatty acids vfas and soluble total nitrogen stn in the sludge under different solids retention times fig 3 shows the changes in the concentrations of stoc vfas and stn during the semi continuous ad of the eg and cg under different srts whereas supplementary figs s2 and s3 show the changes in the degradation of vs and in the concentrations of individual vfas during the semi continuous ad of the eg and cg under different srts respectively as shown in fig 3 a and d the concentrations of stoc in the ad of the eg under different srts were always greater than those in the ad of the cg p 0 001 for example under a 15 day srt the average stoc concentration of the eg was 168 4 17 7 mg l which is two times that of the cg under a 10 day srt the average stoc concentration of the eg was 212 5 32 7 mg l while that of the cg was 126 3 50 1 mg l under a 5 day srt the average stoc concentration of the eg was 3 5 times that of the cg 87 9 11 6 mg l these results indicate that pi pretreatment increases the residual concentrations of soluble organic matter to a certain extent after its conversion to methane during the ad of was the pi pretreatment had no effect on the initial organic solubilisation of was table 1 but significantly increased the methane yield of was fig 2 hence we believe that pi pretreatment can induce the self driven organic solubilisation of sludge and enhance the biochemical reactions of sludge organic matter into methane during the ad process which can be supported by the degradation of vs supplementary fig s2 fig 3 d shows that the stoc concentrations of the eg fluctuated more than that of the cg under the same srts further confirming that pi pretreatment could promote the biochemical reactions related to sludge organic transformation in the ad process which is consistent with previous studies xu et al 2020b 2021a as shown in fig 3 b and 3 c under three srts the maximum vfa and stn concentrations of the eg and cg were less than 300 mg l and 600 mg l respectively which were lower than their corresponding inhibitory concentrations appels et al 2008 yenigün and demirel 2013 indicating no acid or ammonia inhibition during the semi continuous ad process of the eg and cg with different srts fig 3 b and e show that under a 5 day srt the vfa concentrations of the eg were always greater than that of the cg p 0 001 and the average vfa concentration of the eg was 124 1 70 2 mg l which is 25 3 times that of the cg however under a 10 day or 15 day srt the average vfa concentrations of the eg were significantly p 0 001 higher than those of the cg but the vfa concentrations of the eg were not always greater than those of the cg one possible reason is that the ad of the cg under a 5 day srt failed and almost no vfas were produced which is also supported by the corresponding methane yields in fig 2 furthermore under three srts the vfa concentrations of the eg fluctuated more than those of the cg suggesting that a series of biochemical reactions associated with vfa generation were more intense than those of the cg hence pi pretreatment enhances the biochemical reactions associated with vfa generation during the ad process of was as supported by our previous findings xu et al 2020b from fig 3 c and f under three srts the stn concentrations of the eg were always greater than those of the cg p 0 001 for example the average stn concentrations of the eg under three srts were 1 7 times 5 day srt 1 2 times 10 day srt and 1 0 times 15 day srt more than that of the cg indicating that pi pretreatment promotes the stn concentration during the ad process of was one reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that the main nitrogen containing organic matters in sludge are proteins bitton 2002 wilen et al 2003 wang et al 2018 which are typical amphoteric biological macromolecules pi pretreatment can greatly change the structure and properties of the amphoteric biological macromolecules i e protein in sludge latif et al 2017 xu et al 2020b and thereby affect their transformation in the ad process resulting in an increase of the residual stn concentration furthermore under three srts the stn concentrations of the eg fluctuated more than those of the cg hence a series of biochemical reactions involved in the transformation of nitrogen containing substances during the ad of the eg were more intense than those during the ad of the cg implying that pi pretreatment enhances the transformation of nitrogen containing substances during the ad of was moreover from fig 3 d and e compared with a 10 day or 15 day srt under a 5 day srt the stoc and vfa concentrations of the eg fluctuated severely one reasonable explanation for this finding is that the inoculum originates from the ad of was with a 30 day srt when the srt is shortened to 5 days 83 3 the initial microbial community of the inoculum will gradually change and the concentrations of stoc and vfas will not change significantly immediately but after a certain time about 10 days in this study fig 3 a and b the stoc and vfas concentrations will change greatly resulting in the large fluctuations another interesting finding from fig 3 d to f is that under a 5 day srt the fluctuations in the stn concentrations of the eg were insignificant compared with the fluctuations of stoc and vfa concentrations one possible reason is that after pi pretreatment although the soluble protein concentration could increase in the ad process xu et al 2018 2020b some anaerobes usually can use soluble nitrogen containing substances to synthesise substances for their cells which reduce the stn concentration thus resulting in less obvious fluctuations in the stn concentrations compared with the stoc and vfas concentrations during the ad process of was 3 3 recovery of material resources from the sludge by pi pretreatment the pi of sludge is usually at ph 2 0 4 5 liao et al 2002 and the sludge needs to be stirred at this ph for 5 h during the pi pretreatment acid gases such as co2 and h2s will inevitably escape from the sludge meanwhile due to the effect of pi pretreatment multivalent metals in the solid phase of sludge are easily transferred to the solution and the supernatant obtained by centrifugation after pi pretreatment may thus be rich in multivalent metals to investigate the migration of co2 h2s and the main multivalent metals during pi pretreatment the escape of co2 and h2s from the sludge was monitored and the removal and the recovery of main multivalent metals from the sludge were investigated by adjusting the ph of the supernatant fig 4 shows the h2s and co2 contents escaping from the sludge due to pi pretreatment fig 5 illustrates the changes in the contents of main multivalent metals in the sludge and the changes in the removal rates with and without pi pretreatment fig 6 shows the concentrations of the main multivalent metals in the supernatant from pretreated sludge under different ph conditions from fig 4 the average concentration of co2 escaping from the sludge was 1 3 10 4 mol g ts about 5 72 kg co2 t ts which is a very low value probably due to the carbonate and bicarbonate present in the sludge this finding indicates that pi pretreatment can maximise the use of inorganic carbon in the sludge while avoiding its diffusion into the atmosphere which will be conducive to reducing the fugitive carbon emission of sludge furthermore the average concentration of h2s escaping from sludge was 4 1 10 9 mol g ts indicating that pi pretreatment can achieve slight desulphurisation of sludge from fig 5 the average content of the main multivalent metals al ca fe mg zn cd cr cu mn ni and pb decreased from 10 7 1 6 ts in the cg to 6 3 0 9 ts in the eg with an average removal rate of 41 1 indicating that pi pretreatment reduced the content of the main multivalent metals including heavy metals in sludge which may be conducive to the land use of digested sludge recovered after from the ad process fig 6 shows that when the initial ph of the supernatant is 4 5 the concentrations of al ca fe and mg were about one order of magnitude higher than that of the other multivalent metals i e zn cd cr cu ni and pb according to fig 6 a except for ca the other main multivalent metals can be removed step by step from the supernatant via ph adjustment suggesting that after pi pretreatment the main multivalent metals in the supernatant can be recovered via ph adjustment for example when the ph was increased from 4 5 to 6 5 the al concentration in the supernatant decreased sharply from 8 7 2 1 mg l to 0 4 0 1 mg l with an average removal rate of 95 9 when the ph was increased from 4 5 to 7 5 the fe concentration in the supernatant decreased sharply from 74 3 2 0 mg l to 0 3 0 1 mg l with an average removal rate of 99 5 when the ph was increased from 4 5 to 9 5 the mn concentration in the supernatant decreased sharply from 6 3 1 0 mg l to 0 2 0 1 mg l with an average removal rate of 87 7 when the ph was increased from 4 5 to 12 5 the mg concentration in the supernatant decreased sharply from 141 1 8 0 mg l to 0 001 mg l under detection limit furthermore as shown in fig 6 b when the ph of the supernatant was adjusted to 6 5 the concentrations of cd cr pb zn cu and ni in the supernatant were lower than 0 25 mg l and their corresponding average removal rates were 88 0 88 8 88 3 91 4 92 4 and 84 9 respectively indicating that when the ph of the supernatant reaches neutral most heavy metals are removed from the supernatant the removed heavy metals exist in the form of hydroxide precipitation and can be further recovered a careful examination of fig 6 reveals that when the ph was adjusted to 7 5 the average concentrations of the main multivalent metals except ca and mg in the supernatant were lower than 1 0 mg l indicating that the supernatant will be free of metal toxicity when the ph is adjusted to neutral after removing ca and mg the supernatant can be further used as softened water to resuspend the residual sludge solids from the centrifugation following pi pretreatment which contributes to water conservation 3 4 economic and environmental evaluation to comprehensively evaluate the ad of was with pi pretreatment economic and environmental analyses were conducted the corresponding results are summarised in table 2 because the infrastructure cost equipment operation cost and labour cost are directly related to the existing facilities of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and they usually vary greatly depend on different wwtps in this analysis they are excluded leaving only the generated benefits and reagent cost as shown in table 2 taking the application of pi pretreatment in anaerobic sludge digestion of a wwtp in shanghai ad capacity 74 460 t ts year as an example the economic and environmental analysis are carried out from the aspects of benefits reagent consumption and carbon emission reduction according to the experimental results in this study first we compared the economic benefits between the conventional ad system and the ad with pi pretreatment system with a sludge treatment capacity of 74 460 t ts year the methane production from the ad with pi pretreatment is about 7 036 470 kg ch4 year while that from the conventional ad is only 3 176 464 kg ch4 year fig 2 if all of the methane produced is used to generate heat and power the annual heat 1 95 108 mj and power 4 50 107 kwh produced by the ad with pi pretreatment are double than those produced by the conventional ad process assuming that the power price is 0 852 yuan kwh then the annual benefit in terms of power generated by the ad with pi pretreatment is 38340000 yuan which is 2 2 times that of the conventional ad these results indicate that the ad with pi pretreatment is significantly more efficient at extracting bioenergy from sludge than conventional ad suggesting that it will save a significant amount of energy generated by conventional fossil fuels moreover for the ad with pi pretreatment approximately 819 1 t nahco3 and 24 0 kg na2s are recovered annually during the pi pretreatment of sludge fig 4 generating a profit of 1311187 yuan year based on current market prices of nahco3 and na2s table 2 in this study the average removal rate of the main multivalent metals from sludge was 41 fig 5 the corresponding average recovery efficiency from the supernatant by adjusting ph to 7 5 was about 87 fig 6 and assuming a 50 effective utilisation coefficient of the main multivalent metals the annual benefit in terms of the recovery of main multivalent metals would be approximately 5601400 yuan according to current market prices of the main multivalent metals supplementary table s1 however the benefits in terms of resource recovery i e nahco3 na2s and the main multivalent metals from sludge in conventional ad are negligible these results indicate that ad with pi pretreatment is better at extracting material resources from sludge than conventional ad suggesting that it will save a significant number of inorganic products generated by chemical synthesis therefore the total benefit in terms of bioenergy and resource recovery from sludge in the ad with pi pretreatment system is 45252587 yuan year which is 2 6 times that of the conventional ad system 17295600 yuan year indicating that pi pretreatment significantly promotes the economic benefit of the ad of sludge second we compared the chemical costs of the conventional ad system and the ad with pi pretreatment system the chemicals consumed acid hcl 37 and alkali naoh mainly the acid and alkali for the pi pretreatment of sludge alkali for the recoveries of nahco3 and na2s and alkali for the recovery of the main multivalent metals in the ad with pi pretreatment system whereas no chemical is consumed during the conventional ad system with a sludge treatment capacity of 74 460 t ts year 5956 8 t hcl 37 and 967 98 t naoh are required annually for the pi pretreatment of sludge 385 t naoh and 8 2 kg naoh are required for the recovery of nahco3 and na2s and the main multivalent metals ph 7 5 respectively based on current market prices of 1000 yuan t hcl 37 and 2500 yuan t naoh the total chemical costs of ad with pi pretreatment system is 9339270 yuan year however the conventional ad system has no chemical cost third we compared the net profits after deducting the chemical costs between the conventional ad system and the ad with pi pretreatment system in the conventional ad system the use of chemicals is very small and the corresponding cost is also very low which can usually be negligible thus the net profits after deducting chemical cost are 17295600 yuan year however the net profit after deducting chemical costs in the ad with a pi pretreatment system is 35913317 yuan year 45252587 9339270 yuan year which is 2 times that of the conventional ad system concluding that although there is a chemical cost the ad with pi pretreatment system has a significant advantage over the conventional ad system in terms of obtaining economic benefit from the sludge fourth we compared the environmental benefits of the conventional ad system and the ad with pi pretreatment system with a sludge treatment capacity of 74 460 t ts year the ad with pi pretreatment system produces 2 47 107 kwh year more power than the conventional ad system assuming that the energy generation coefficient associated with carbon emissions is 1 05 kg co2 kwh the application of ad with a pi pretreatment system reduces the energy source carbon emissions by about 2 59 107 kg co2 year xu et al 2021b moreover during the pi pretreatment of sludge 4 26 105 kg co2 year and 10 37 kg h2s year from sludge are transformed into nahco3 and na2s respectively which can reduce fugitive carbon and sulphur emissions however in the conventional ad system these co2 and h2s may be released into the atmosphere from the digested sludge these results indicate that the ad with pi pretreatment system has significant advantages over the conventional ad system in obtaining environmental benefits from the sludge furthermore the average methane yield from the ad with pi pretreatment under a 5 day srt was 207 3 29 0 ml ch4 g vsadded fig 2 which is 1 6 times that of the conventional ad under a 15 day srt 126 8 24 7 ml ch4 g vsadded fig 2 indicating that ad with pi pretreatment can efficiently obtain bioenergy from was at an ultra short srt according to a previous publication appels et al 2008 the srt and olr of a conventional ad in wwtp are usually 20 days and 0 75 1 75 kg vs m3 d respectively whereas from this study the srt of ad with pi pretreatment can be shortened to 5 days and the olr can be increased to 3 0 kg vs m3 d assuming the same amount of sludge is treated the volume of the anaerobic reactor in ad with pi pretreatment system is reduced by one quarter that of the conventional ad system significantly reducing the land footprint of the anaerobic reactor these results indicate that ad with pi pretreatment overcomes the bottleneck of the conventional ad such as a long reaction period and low methane yield and efficiently extracts bioenergy and material resources from sludge at an ultra short srt implying that the ad of sludge with pi pretreatment system is a novel technology with a high bioconversion efficiency and significant economic and environmental benefits 4 conclusions in this study we evaluated the feasibility of long term ad of was with a pi pretreatment system the novel ad with pi pretreatment has the higher bioenergy conversion efficiency more obvious recovery of material resources and the greater economic and environmental benefits than the conventional ad the main conclusions are as follows 1 pi pretreatment significantly p 0 001 enhanced the methane yield from the ad of was under different srts even at an ultra short srt 5 days for example the pi pretreatment increased the average methane yield and content in the biogas of was by more than 2 2 times and 1 2 times respectively 2 statistical analysis confirms that the pi pretreatment significantly p 0 001 enhanced the biochemical reactions involved in the production of methane and vfas during the whole ad process but not the initial organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge 3 the ad of was combined with a pi pretreatment system is capable of recovering both bioenergy i e methane and material resources i e nahco3 na2s and multivalent metals from the sludge 4 the ad with pi pretreatment system has a significant advantage in obtaining economic and environmental benefits from the sludge assuming that 74 460 t ts of sludge is treated every year compared with the conventional ad system the annual economic benefit from the sludge is increased by 162 and the carbon emissions are reduced by approximately 2 63 107 kg co2

15819,this study systematically quantified the impacts of different operation conditions e g ph chlorine dosages contact times and temperatures towards the disinfection by product dbp formation integrated toxicity and structural changes in seawater natural organic matter during seawater chlorination higher concentrations of total dbps were found under longer contact times higher chlorine dosages higher temperatures and lower ph the concentration of tribromomethane the most abundant dbp was found lowest at ph 10 monobromoacetic acid dibromoacetonitrile and dibromoacetaldehyde were the three main contributors to integrated cyto and geno toxicity stressing the need to monitor dbps based on their contributions to integrated toxicity regardless they are regulated or nonregulated the concentrations of total organic chlorine remained stable under different conditions while those of total organic bromine increased with increasing contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures but with decreasing ph indicating the changes of toxicity in chlorinated seawater compared to drinking water or groundwater changes of ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm and fluorescence excitation emission

potential human health risks and cause ecological risks agus et al 2009 kim et al 2015 le roux et al 2015 rahman et al 2010 dbps formed in prechlorination stages of desalination plants if not rejected by ro membranes enter the ro permeate and drinking water supplies le roux et al 2015 the dbps rejected by ro membranes are concentrated in the ro brine and discharged to the marine environment chronic exposure to dbps in the vicinity of the discharging points of the ro brine and chlorinated seawater from cooling pipes were reported to have adverse effects on sensitive marine species agus et al 2009 allonier et al 1999 for example tribromomethane exposure at 50 μg l has chronic toxic effects on oyster larvae stewart et al 1979 low concentrations of monochloroacetic acid and monobromoacetic acid at 7 and 20 μg l respectively were found to inhibit the growth of green algae kühn and pattard 1990 swimmers in pools containing chlorinated seawater are exposed to dbps via dermal absorption inhalation and ingestion and are at increased risk of bladder cancer villanueva et al 2007 major dbps formed by seawater chlorination are trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas agus et al 2009 kim et al 2015 manasfi et al 2017 while other unregulated dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms haloacetamides hacams halophenols and iodinated dbps were also detected in chlorinated seawater but at relatively lower concentrations agus et al 2009 kim et al 2015 le roux et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 most previous studies focused on dbp formation potentials in chlorinated seawater under specific operating conditions rather than explored the dynamic changes in dbp speciation and concentrations under different operating conditions le roux et al 2015 shi et al 2013 yang et al 2017 however in practice operating conditions i e ph chlorine dosages contact times and temperatures change during pretreatment in seawater ro desalination plants badruzzaman et al 2019 saeed et al 2019 the ph may be adjusted from 8 in seawater to 6 to prevent scaling or be raised to 10 to remove boron edzwald and haarhoff 2011 chlorine dosages vary from 2 to 10 mgcl2 l and contact times vary from minutes to hours to inactivate bacteria and prevent biofouling in the intake seawater badruzzaman et al 2019 kim et al 2015 saeed et al 2019 seawater temperatures are normally in the range of 20 35 c because of seasonal variation saeed et al 2019 previous studies investigated dbp formation potentials in chlorinated seawater under different contact times or chlorine dosages abdel wahab et al 2010 agus and sedlak 2010 fabbricino and korshin 2005 but they only explored bromine containing thms haas and hans therefore it is necessary to assess dbp formation under various real world conditions to understand their dependency nonetheless concentrations of dbps formed in chlorinated seawater do not necessarily reflect their toxicities unregulated dbps such as hans and hnms formed at low concentrations in chlorinated seawater display higher cyto and geno toxicity than those of regulated thms and haas muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 moreover the presence of high concentrations of bromide 50 80 mg l and iodide 21 60 μg l in seawater during chlorination promote the formation of brominated and iodinated dbps which have much higher cyto and geno toxicity than their chlorinated analogues agus et al 2009 le roux et al 2015 muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2008 therefore both the concentrations and toxicity of dbps should be considered to determine the contributions of various dbps to the overall toxicity of chlorinated seawater the dbp induced toxicity can be calculated and compared by weighting the measured concentrations of individual dbps according to their toxicity index values plewa et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 zeng et al 2016 these calculations suggested that unregulated dbps particularly hans may be more important cytotoxicity drivers of disinfected drinking water or groundwater than thm4 or haa5 however the major cyto and geno toxicity drivers of chlorinated seawater remain unknown over 50 of halogenated dbps remain unknown and unaccounted for in chlorinated drinking water hua and reckhow 2012a and can only be quantified by adsorbable organic halogen aox ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem should be evaluated as surrogates to quantify seawater nom reactivity and dbp formation because both parameters were used to predict dbp formation in chlorinated seawater under specific operating conditions fabbricino et al 2019 padhi et al 2019 they may serve as rapid cost effective indicators to monitor regulated and unregulated dbps and dbp induced toxicity in chlorinated seawater the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the impacts of different operating conditions on dbp formation in seawater chlorination 2 calculate the dbp induced cyto and geno toxicity in chlorinated seawater to identify major toxicity drivers in chlorinated seawater and 3 establish correlations between the changes in uv254 and feem of chlorinated seawater nom with dbp concentrations and dbp induced cyto and geno toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions all chemicals and solutions used in this study are described in si text s2 2 2 experimental

seawater of 2100 ml was dosed in a 2 1 l glass bottle and adjusted to the designated ph using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide the chlorination experiment was initiated by adding free chlorine at

dbnm figures 1 a 1 e show concentrations of all the detected dbps including the 5 thms 10 haas 1 hal and 2 hans respectively formed during chlorination of seawater under different testing conditions the sum of concentrations of the detected dbps is defined here as total dbps they were in the ranges from 124 5 10 1 to 271 1 13 2 nm or from 30 1 2 7 to 66 8 3 1 μg l details in si table s5 consistent with the reported data 23 150 μg l in seawater prechlorination in full scale seawater desalination plants using low chlorine dosages 0 5 2 mgcl2 l short contact times 0 5 2 h and low seawater nom concentrations 5 mgc l agus and sedlak 2010 kim et al 2015 le roux et al 2015 the thms and haas were the most abundant dbps the sums of their concentrations hereafter referred to as tthms and thaas contributed 45 6 65 0 and 30 5 45 3 respectively to total dbps details in si text s8 dbal was the only detected hal and its concentrations contributed 0 5 7 3 to total dbps details in si text s8 dban and bcan were the two detected hans the sum of their concentrations hereafter referred to as thans contributed 1 0 1 9 to total dbps details in si text s8 dbnm was only detected at the chlorine dosage of 10 mgcl2 l its concentration was much lower than those reported in seawater chlorination in the presence of ammonia shi et al 2013 because the source seawater in this study did not contain ammonia details in si table s1 despite the high iodide concentration in seawater 50 μg l only low concentrations of iodinated dbps 0 11 0 57 μg l including dcim biaa and diaa were detected in this study they were lower than those reported for chlorinated seawater during the pretreatment stage of a seawater ro desalination plant 2 57 μg l le roux et al 2015 and in chlorinated finished water in u s drinking water treatment plants up to 19 μg l krasner et al 2006 because the concentration of seawater nom 0 5 mgc l in this study was lower than those in the aforementioned studies 0 98 13 mgc l krasner et al 2006 le roux et al 2015 in addition the presence of ammonia in the previous studies also enhanced the formation of iodinated dbps krasner et al 2006 because ammonia transformed free chlorine to chloramines free chlorine rapidly oxidizes iodide to hypoiodous acid hoi k app 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 and then to iodate k app 21 m 1 s 1 dong et al 2019 chloramines also rapidly oxidize iodide to hoi k app 2 4 103 m 1 s 1 but are slow in oxidizing hoi to iodate k app 2 10 3 m 1 s 1 and therefore chloramination forms iodinated dbps as hoi reacts with nom k app 0 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 dong et al 2019 with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 total dbps remained unchanged but decreased by 18 3 as ph further increased to 10 from ph 6 5 to 8 the concentrations of haas hals and hans decreased since these dbps hydrolyzed to form thms with increasing ph as shown in figs 1 c 1 e their hydrolysis increased the concentrations of thms with increasing ph as shown in fig 1 b these trends were consistent with data obtained in chlorination of drinking water ph 9 5 hua and reckhow 2008 hua and reckhow 2012a as a result total dbps remained unchanged from ph 8 to 10 the hydrolysis of thms haas hans and hals became faster especially for the bromine containing dbps as shown in figs 1 b 1 e abusallout et al 2017 chen 2011 hua and reckhow 2008 hua and reckhow 2012b therefore total dbps decreased a similar trend was also observed in chlorination of drinking water in the presence of bromide at a chlorine dosage of 4 mgcl2 l liu et al 2018b however in the absence of bromide total dbps including thms haas hans and haloketones remained unchanged when ph increased from 7 to 10 in chlorination of drinking water at a chlorine dosage of 8 1 mgcl2 l hua and reckhow 2008 the unchanged total dbps from ph 7 to 10 in chlorination in the absence of bromide was mainly because of the hydrolysis of chlorine containing haas hans and haloketones to chlorine containing thms hua and reckhow 2012a whose hydrolysis rates are not as significant as that of bromine containing thms at ph 10 abusallout et al 2017 pan et al 2019 total dbps increased by 70 3 and 50 0 with increasing contact times from 0 5 to 3 h and increasing chlorine dosages from 2 to 10 mgcl2 l respectively because tthms thaas and thans contributed over 90 to the increase of total dbps with increasing contact times and chlorine dosages as shown in figs 1 b 1 c and 1 e respectively the specific yields of dbps in μg mgc were calculated by dividing dbp concentrations by the initial concentrations of seawater nom to facilitate the comparison between the concentrations of dbps in the current study with the reported values the specific yields of total dbps increased from 60 1 to 104 0 μg mgc with increasing contact times consistent with the specific yields of total dbps reported in seawater chlorination with increasing contact times from 0 5 to 200 h abdel wahab et al 2010 agus and sedlak 2010 padhi et al 2012 meanwhile the specific yields of total dbps increased from 88 7 to 133 6 μg mgc with increasing chlorine dosages consistent with the previous studies of total dbps formed in seawater chlorination with increasing chlorine dosages from 0 5 to 10 mgcl2 l abdel wahab et al 2010 agus and sedlak 2010 padhi et al 2012 the decrease in dbal concentrations with increasing contact times might be attributed to the rapid hydrolysis of dbal while the decreased dbal concentrations with increasing chlorine dosages from 5 to 10 mgcl2 l might be due to the hypochlorite catalyzed hydrolysis of dbal yin et al 2018 total dbps increased by 18 1 with increasing temperatures from 17 to 29 c as increasing temperatures may enhance both formation and decomposition rates of dbps zhang et al 2013 the results suggest that the formation rates of the detected dbps outcompeted their decomposition rates with increasing temperatures thereby leading to the increase in total dbps at higher temperatures 3 1 2 high molecular weight adsorbable organic halogen the high molecular weight mw adsorbable organic halogen aox hereafter referred to high mw aox i e aox with molecular weight cut off mwco higher than 320 500 daltons formed in seawater chlorination were measured to capture the formation of unknown dbps fig 2 shows concentrations of high mw aox in seawater chlorination varied from 0 3 0 1 to 3 3 0 2 μm under different operating conditions adsorbable organic chlorine aocl and adsorbable organic bromine aobr were the major components while adsorbable organic iodine was below its detection limit 0 079 μm equivalent to 10 μgi l with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 the concentrations of high mw aox decreased from 1 58 to 1 20 μm similar trends were reported for drinking water chlorination from ph 7 to 9 5 abusallout et al 2017 at higher ph aobr underwent base catalyzed degradation and resulted in dehalogenation of aobr abusallout et al 2017 hua and reckhow 2012a meanwhile the increasing ph transformed hobr to its lower oxidation potential form of bro which may promote the halogen substitution of nom hua and reckhow 2012b the decrease in high mw aobr with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 suggests that the base catalyzed degradation rates of aobr outcompeted the halogenation rates of seawater nom as ph further increased to 10 the base catalyzed degradation rates of high mw aobr still outcompeted their formation rates on the other hand the formation rates of high mw aocl increased therefore the concentrations of high mw aox remained the same as ph increased from 8 to 10 with increasing contact times from 0 5 to 3 h chlorine dosages from 2 to 10 mgcl2 l and temperatures from 17 to 29 c the concentrations of high mw aox increased significantly from 0 29 to 1 89 μm from 1 29 to 1 59 μm and from 0 32 to 3 12 μm respectively the increased high mw aox under these conditions were mainly because of the increase in high mw aobr and the changes in the concentrations of high mw aocl were insignificant p 0 05 small amounts of high mw aobr were formed 58 64 nm at the contact time of 0 5 h while large quantities of known low mw and brominated dbps were formed 123 71 nm shown in fig 1 a and table s5 bromine is more reactive towards low mw fractions of nom than high mw fractions hua and reckhow 2008 because low mw fractions of seawater nom has more aromatic precursors higher contents of tryptophan like and tyrosine like aromatic protein and fulvic acid than other mw fractions yang et al 2017 therefore low mw fractions of seawater nom were the main precursors of low mw dbps when bromine reacted with high mw fractions of seawater nom both low mw brominated dbps and high mw aobr were formed with increasing contact times fig 1 a and fig 2 while the high mw fractions of nom were the primary precursors of the unknown aobr hua and reckhow 2008 nevertheless most high mw aocl was formed within the first 0 5 h and remained stable with increasing contact times with increasing chlorine dosages from 2 to 10 mgcl2 l more free bromine was formed competed with free chlorine for the limited seawater nom and dominated the reaction with seawater nom to form larger amounts of high mw aobr and smaller amounts of high mw aocl equations relevant to these reactions are listed in si table s6 the increasing concentrations of high mw aox with increasing temperatures suggests that increasing temperatures accelerated the formation rates more significantly than the decomposition rates of high mw aobr 3 1 3 total organic halogen total organic halogen tox includes concentrations of high mw aox and total dbps measured by the modified gc ecd method which supplements the low mw dbps lost during measurement of high mw aox however tox excludes low mw dbps mwco less than 320 500 daltons that cannot be measured by the modified gc ecd method fig 3 shows tox obtained under different operating conditions tox ranged from 414 4 170 3 to 3 331 3 130 0 nm and the specific yields of tox ranged from 29 4 to 236 5 μgcl mgc the specific yields of tox were in the similar ranges of those of tox reported in chlorinated drinking water in the absence of bromide hua and reckhow 2008 and in chlorinated bromide containing drinking water liu et al 2018b and those of extractable organic halogen in chlorinated seawater in swimming pools manasfi et al 2017 the trends of tox as a function of each operating parameter were similar to those of high mw aox specifically total organic chlorine tocl remained stable under different operation conditions while total organic bromine tobr increased with increasing contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures but with decreasing ph such trends of tocl and tobr formation are much different from those reported in drinking water or groundwater chlorination where tocl increased with increasing chlorine dosages contact times and temperatures and with decreasing ph hua and reckhow 2008 liu et al 2018b szczuka et al 2017 and tobr was limited by insufficient bromide concentrations liu et al 2018b szczuka et al 2017 the unknown high mw aox to tox ratios 64 7 to 93 8 are comparable with that at 86 in chlorinated seawater in swimming pools manasfi et al 2017 however the ratios are substantially higher than the unknown tox to tox ratio at 50 in chlorinated drinking water krasner et al 2006 in addition the ratios increased with increasing contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures and showed trends opposite to those in chlorinated drinking water hua and reckhow 2008 hua and reckhow 2012b bromine incorporation into unknown high mw nom may account for the greater contribution of high mw aox to tox in seawater chlorination than drinking water chlorination this emphasizes the importance of understanding the composition and toxicity of brominated high mw aox to better control dbp formation during seawater chlorination 3 2 integrated cyto and geno toxicity of dbps 3 2 1 integrated cyto and geno toxicity fig 4 a shows the cytotoxicity of the 19 detected dbps in seawater chlorination at different ph contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures varying one parameter at a time from the baseline condition their cytotoxicity was calculated by multiplying the molar concentration of each dbp by its corresponding chinese hamster ovary cho cell cytotoxicity index value which was the inverse of its lethal concentrations at 50 lc50 wagner and plewa 2017 the cytotoxicity of individual dbps in mixture was additive lau et al 2020 the sum of their cytotoxicity hereafter referred to as integrated cytotoxicity under the experimental conditions were in the range of 1 48 10 3 5 02 10 3 dbal dban and mbaa dominated and together contributed approximately 80 to the integrated cytotoxicity even though they only accounted for less than 10 of total dbps these dbps contributed significantly to the integrated cytotoxicity at low concentrations because their cho cell cytotoxicity index values 1 04 105 3 51 105 m 1 were substantially higher than those of the other dbps 1 04 102 1 18 104 m 1 wagner and plewa 2017 therefore the changes of the integrated cytotoxicity under different operating conditions were mainly the result of the changes in dbal dban and mbaa concentrations hans hals and haas were also reported as the three main contributors to the integrated cytotoxicity in chlorination of drinking water and groundwater in the presence of bromide liu et al 2018b szczuka et al 2017 by contrast tbm tbaa and dbaa accounted for over 80 of total dbps but only contributed about 15 to the integrated cytotoxicity as their cho cell cytotoxicity index values 2 53 102 1 18 104 m 1 were 10 to 1 000 times lower than those of dbal dban and mbaa wagner and plewa 2017 therefore integrated cytotoxicity was not correlated with total dbps with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 and to 10 the integrated cytotoxicity decreased by 40 0 and 70 5 respectively the significant decrease in the integrated cytotoxicity at higher ph was mainly because of the faster hydrolysis of dbal at higher ph thereby leading to a decrease in cytotoxicity caused by dbal the decrease in the integrated cytotoxicity was also observed in chlorination of swimming pool water in the presence of 1 mg l of bromide with increasing ph from 6 to 8 but hans were the dominant contributors hansen et al 2012 with increasing contact time from 0 5 to 3 h the integrated cytotoxicity remained the same that was because the concentrations of the major integrated cytotoxicity contributor dbal significantly decreased with increasing contact times while those of the other two major cytotoxicity contributors i e dban and mbaa increased with increasing contact times as chlorine dosages increased from 2 to 5 and to 10 mgcl2 l the integrated cytotoxicity increased by 49 0 and 53 9 respectively with increasing chlorine dosages from 2 to 5 mgcl2 l the concentrations of all three dominant species i e dbal dban and mbaa increased significantly leading to the increased integrated cytotoxicity when chlorine dosages further increased from 5 to 10 mgcl2 l increases in dban and dbnm cytotoxicity compensated for the decrease in dbal cytotoxicity therefore slightly increasing the integrated cytotoxicity dbnm contributed 7 4 to the integrated cytotoxicity at the high chlorine dosages but was not detectable under other experimental conditions however in chlorination of drinking water containing a lower concentration of bromide 0 8 mg l integrated cytotoxicity significantly decreased with increasing chlorine dosages from 4 to 16 mgcl2 l at the doc concentration of 2 mgc l liu et al 2018b this contradiction between the current and previous studies was because higher levels of bromide in seawater led to the formation of higher concentrations of bromine containing hals which were more toxic than the chlorine containing hals formed mainly in drinking water chlorination liu et al 2018b as temperatures increased from 17 to 23 and to 29 c the integrated cytotoxicity decreased slightly by 4 8 and 12 8 respectively the decrease of the integrated cytotoxicity was mainly attributed to the significant decrease of the major integrated cytotoxicity contributor dbal with increasing temperatures despite the slight increases in concentrations of the other two major cytotoxicity contributors i e dban and mbaa with increasing temperatures the genotoxicity of the detected dbps was calculated by multiplying the molar concentrations of each dbp by their corresponding genotoxicity index values for cho cells the latter are the inverses of the cho cell 50 tail dna values fig 4 b shows the genotoxicity of the 19 detected dbps in seawater chlorination under different operating conditions the sum of their genotoxicity hereafter referred to as integrated genotoxicity under different experimental conditions were in the range of 3 98 10 4 9 21 10 4 mbaa dbal and dban were the three main contributors to the integrated genotoxicity as their genotoxicity index values 9 01 103 5 88 104 m 1 were 10 to 1 000 times higher than those of other dbps wagner and plewa 2017 the changes of the integrated genotoxicity followed similar trends to those of the integrated cytotoxicity under different ph and chlorine dosages but increased with increasing contact times and temperatures the trends of the changes of the integrated genotoxicity were mainly due to the concentration changes of the three main contributors 3 2 2 comparison of integrated cyto and geno toxicity both the integrated cyto and geno toxicity of the detected dbps were primarily determined by the three dbps i e dban dbal and mbaa but their contributions were different under different operating conditions dban dbal and mbaa contributed similarly to the integrated cytotoxicity whereas mbaa was the dominant contributor to the integrated genotoxicity an earlier study emphasized the toxicity of nitrogenous dbps muellner et al 2007 nevertheless we found that mbaa contributed more significantly to the integrated genotoxicity than nitrogenous dbps here the contributions of the detected iodine containing dbps i e dcim diaa and biaa to the integrated cyto and geno toxicity in seawater chlorination were negligible as they had relatively low concentrations and low cyto and geno toxicity index values although they were reported to be more cyto and geno toxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 these results suggest that we may need to prioritize the regulation of these toxicity drivers i e dban dbal and mbaa in real practice 3 3 changes in uv254 and feem and their correlations with dbp formation and integrated toxicity fig 5 a shows the changes in uv254 hereafter referred to as δuv254 during seawater chlorination which were calculated from subtracting the uv254 values of seawater after chlorination from the uv254 value of seawater before chlorination the uv254 value of the seawater before chlorination was 0 452 m 1 details in si table s7 which was in the range of those reported in raw seawater edzwald and haarhoff 2011 uv254 is mainly absorbed by electron rich sites in nom including aromatic sites and conjugated double bonds weishaar et al 2003 the positive δuv254 values under all experimental conditions indicate that the aromatic and humic fractions in seawater nom absorb less uv254 suggesting these moieties were destroyed during seawater chlorination the δuv254 values increased with increasing contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures and decreasing ph hence more aromatic and humic fractions in seawater nom were destroyed by longer contact times higher chlorine dosages and temperatures and lower ph the relationships between δuv254 and dbp concentrations or integrated toxicity were then investigated details in si table s8 the δuv254 values were strongly and positively correlated with the concentrations of high mw aobr r 0 92 p 0 01 high mw aox r 0 91 p 0 01 and tox r 0 91 p 0 01 therefore the aromatic and humic fractions in the seawater nom were the primary precursors of these dbps in seawater chlorination the δuv254 values were moderately and positively correlated with the concentrations of tbm r 0 63 p 0 05 dban r 0 59 p 0 05 tthms r 0 64 p 0 05 and thans r 0 59 p 0 05 therefore the aliphatic and non humic fractions of seawater nom also contributed to the formation of tbm dban thans and tthms the correlations between δuv254 and tthms were consistent with the data reported for chlorinated seawater at various contact times padhi et al 2019 correlations between δuv254 and integrated toxicity were not significant fig 5 b shows the changes of feem volumes hereafter referred to as δfeem in seawater chlorination under different operating conditions the δfeem values were calculated by subtracting the feem volumes in seawater after chlorination from those before chlorination feem represents the fluorophore sites in seawater nom including humic fulvic acids aromatic proteins and other soluble microbial byproducts such as protein or phenol like organics which are all major precursors of dbps wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 the feem volume in seawater before chlorination was 1 90 105 au nm2 details in si figure s1 and table s8 while all δfeem values were positive under different experimental conditions the positive δfeem values suggest that the fluorophores in seawater nom were destroyed during seawater chlorination as previously reported fabbricino et al 2019 the δfeem values at different contact times chlorine dosages temperatures and ph followed trends similar to those of the δuv254 values suggesting that more fluorophores in seawater nom were degraded at longer contact times higher chlorine dosages and temperatures and lower ph the δfeem values were strongly and positively correlated with the concentrations of high mw aobr r 0 93 p 0 01 high mw aox r 0 91 p 0 01 and tox r 0 91 p 0 01 and moderately and positively correlated with the concentrations of tbm r 0 74 p 0 01 bcan r 0 60 p 0 05 dban r 0 79 p 0 01 tthms r 0 73 p 0 01 thans r 0 86 p 0 01 and total dbps r 0 71 p 0 01 details in si table s8 these results suggest that fluorophores in seawater nom were the primary precursors of these dbps during seawater chlorination the correlations between δfeem and tthms and those between δfeem and thans were consistent with those reported by fabbricino et al 2019 in chlorinated coastal seawater under different reaction times correlations between δfeem and integrated toxicity were insignificant 4 conclusions this study is the first systematic investigation to quantify the impacts of different operation conditions e g ph chlorine dosages contact times and temperatures towards the dbp formation in seawater chlorination higher concentrations of total dbps were found under longer contact times higher chlorine dosages higher temperatures and lower ph results from our study fill in the gaps of understanding the dependency of the dbp formation towards various real world conditions and provide a multi dimensional operational guidance of seawater chlorination to reduce its dbp formation the formation of most dbp species detected in this study under different operation conditions show similar trends to other studies in drinking water and groundwater regulated brominated thms and haas were the main dbp species formed under different operating conditions in seawater chlorination however the formation of the most abundant dbp tbm was lower at ph 10 compared with those at ph 6 5 and 8 while the formation of thms was reported to be higher at higher ph in other studies unregulated hals hans and hnms were formed at low concentrations while only trace amounts of iodinated dbps were detected this study also demonstrates the significant impacts of mbaa a regulated dbp usually contributing less to total dbps in drinking water and groundwater on the integrated cyto and geno toxicity in seawater chlorination under different operating conditions dbal and dban two unregulated dbps also contribute significantly to the integrated cytotoxicity the results from the integrated toxicity suggest that monitoring and controlling dbps in seawater chlorination may need to be shifted from the most abundant dbps to those contributing the most to toxicity regardless they are regulated or nonregulated tocl remained stable under different operation conditions while tobr increased with increasing contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures but with decreasing ph such trends of tocl and tobr formation are much different from those reported in drinking water or groundwater chlorination the unique trends of tocl and tobr formation in seawater chlorination revealed in this study highlight the needs to compare the trends of toxicity in corresponding conditions with those reported in drinking water and groundwater moreover the δuv254 and δfeem values representing the change of the aromatic and humic fractions and fluorophores in seawater nom are strongly and positively correlated with the concentrations of tox and thus effectively predict the concentrations of tox declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

15819,this study systematically quantified the impacts of different operation conditions e g ph chlorine dosages contact times and temperatures towards the disinfection by product dbp formation integrated toxicity and structural changes in seawater natural organic matter during seawater chlorination higher concentrations of total dbps were found under longer contact times higher chlorine dosages higher temperatures and lower ph the concentration of tribromomethane the most abundant dbp was found lowest at ph 10 monobromoacetic acid dibromoacetonitrile and dibromoacetaldehyde were the three main contributors to integrated cyto and geno toxicity stressing the need to monitor dbps based on their contributions to integrated toxicity regardless they are regulated or nonregulated the concentrations of total organic chlorine remained stable under different conditions while those of total organic bromine increased with increasing contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures but with decreasing ph indicating the changes of toxicity in chlorinated seawater compared to drinking water or groundwater changes of ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm and fluorescence excitation emission

potential human health risks and cause ecological risks agus et al 2009 kim et al 2015 le roux et al 2015 rahman et al 2010 dbps formed in prechlorination stages of desalination plants if not rejected by ro membranes enter the ro permeate and drinking water supplies le roux et al 2015 the dbps rejected by ro membranes are concentrated in the ro brine and discharged to the marine environment chronic exposure to dbps in the vicinity of the discharging points of the ro brine and chlorinated seawater from cooling pipes were reported to have adverse effects on sensitive marine species agus et al 2009 allonier et al 1999 for example tribromomethane exposure at 50 μg l has chronic toxic effects on oyster larvae stewart et al 1979 low concentrations of monochloroacetic acid and monobromoacetic acid at 7 and 20 μg l respectively were found to inhibit the growth of green algae kühn and pattard 1990 swimmers in pools containing chlorinated seawater are exposed to dbps via dermal absorption inhalation and ingestion and are at increased risk of bladder cancer villanueva et al 2007 major dbps formed by seawater chlorination are trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas agus et al 2009 kim et al 2015 manasfi et al 2017 while other unregulated dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms haloacetamides hacams halophenols and iodinated dbps were also detected in chlorinated seawater but at relatively lower concentrations agus et al 2009 kim et al 2015 le roux et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 most previous studies focused on dbp formation potentials in chlorinated seawater under specific operating conditions rather than explored the dynamic changes in dbp speciation and concentrations under different operating conditions le roux et al 2015 shi et al 2013 yang et al 2017 however in practice operating conditions i e ph chlorine dosages contact times and temperatures change during pretreatment in seawater ro desalination plants badruzzaman et al 2019 saeed et al 2019 the ph may be adjusted from 8 in seawater to 6 to prevent scaling or be raised to 10 to remove boron edzwald and haarhoff 2011 chlorine dosages vary from 2 to 10 mgcl2 l and contact times vary from minutes to hours to inactivate bacteria and prevent biofouling in the intake seawater badruzzaman et al 2019 kim et al 2015 saeed et al 2019 seawater temperatures are normally in the range of 20 35 c because of seasonal variation saeed et al 2019 previous studies investigated dbp formation potentials in chlorinated seawater under different contact times or chlorine dosages abdel wahab et al 2010 agus and sedlak 2010 fabbricino and korshin 2005 but they only explored bromine containing thms haas and hans therefore it is necessary to assess dbp formation under various real world conditions to understand their dependency nonetheless concentrations of dbps formed in chlorinated seawater do not necessarily reflect their toxicities unregulated dbps such as hans and hnms formed at low concentrations in chlorinated seawater display higher cyto and geno toxicity than those of regulated thms and haas muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 moreover the presence of high concentrations of bromide 50 80 mg l and iodide 21 60 μg l in seawater during chlorination promote the formation of brominated and iodinated dbps which have much higher cyto and geno toxicity than their chlorinated analogues agus et al 2009 le roux et al 2015 muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2008 therefore both the concentrations and toxicity of dbps should be considered to determine the contributions of various dbps to the overall toxicity of chlorinated seawater the dbp induced toxicity can be calculated and compared by weighting the measured concentrations of individual dbps according to their toxicity index values plewa et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 zeng et al 2016 these calculations suggested that unregulated dbps particularly hans may be more important cytotoxicity drivers of disinfected drinking water or groundwater than thm4 or haa5 however the major cyto and geno toxicity drivers of chlorinated seawater remain unknown over 50 of halogenated dbps remain unknown and unaccounted for in chlorinated drinking water hua and reckhow 2012a and can only be quantified by adsorbable organic halogen aox ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem should be evaluated as surrogates to quantify seawater nom reactivity and dbp formation because both parameters were used to predict dbp formation in chlorinated seawater under specific operating conditions fabbricino et al 2019 padhi et al 2019 they may serve as rapid cost effective indicators to monitor regulated and unregulated dbps and dbp induced toxicity in chlorinated seawater the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the impacts of different operating conditions on dbp formation in seawater chlorination 2 calculate the dbp induced cyto and geno toxicity in chlorinated seawater to identify major toxicity drivers in chlorinated seawater and 3 establish correlations between the changes in uv254 and feem of chlorinated seawater nom with dbp concentrations and dbp induced cyto and geno toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions all chemicals and solutions used in this study are described in si text s2 2 2 experimental procedures raw seawater was pumped from the coastal marine laboratory of the hong kong university of science and technology where a pipeline was extended to a nearby port shelter 114 27 e 22 34 n

and concentrations of dissolved organic matter doc ammonia and halides cl br and i were measured within 24 h after collection details in si text s3 and table s1 in each experiment the collected seawater of 2100 ml was dosed in a 2 1 l glass bottle and adjusted to the designated ph using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide the chlorination experiment was initiated by adding free chlorine at the designated concentrations to the glass bottles with headspace free the bottles were then stored in a water bath in the dark at the designated temperature the operating conditions were based on typical chlorination conditions including oxidant dosages 2 5 and 10 mgcl2 l equivalent to 28 70 and 140 μm contact times 0 5 2 and 3 h reaction temperatures 17 23 and 29 c and ph 6 5 8 and 10 the

dbps measured by the modified gc ecd method 19 halogenated dbps were detected in the chlorinated seawater under various operating conditions the 19 halogenated dbps include 5 thm species i e tribromomethane tbm dibromochloromethane dbcm trichloromethane tcm dichlorobromomethane dcbm and dichloroidomethane dcim 10 haa species i e bromoacetic acid mbaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa dibromochloroacetic acid dbcaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa tribromoacetic acid tbaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa bromoiodoacetic acid biaa and

dbnm figures 1 a 1 e show concentrations of all the detected dbps including the 5 thms 10 haas 1 hal and 2 hans respectively formed during chlorination of seawater under different testing conditions the sum of concentrations of the detected dbps is defined here as total dbps they were in the ranges from 124 5 10 1 to 271 1 13 2 nm or from 30 1 2 7 to 66 8 3 1 μg l details in si table s5 consistent with the reported data 23 150 μg l in seawater prechlorination in full scale seawater desalination plants using low chlorine dosages 0 5 2 mgcl2 l short contact times 0 5 2 h and low seawater nom concentrations 5 mgc l agus and sedlak 2010 kim et al 2015 le roux et al 2015 the thms and haas were the most abundant dbps the sums of their concentrations hereafter referred to as tthms and thaas contributed 45 6 65 0 and 30 5 45 3 respectively to total dbps details in si text s8 dbal was the only detected hal and its concentrations contributed 0 5 7 3 to total dbps details in si text s8 dban and bcan were the two detected hans the sum of their concentrations hereafter referred to as thans contributed 1 0 1 9 to total dbps details in si text s8 dbnm was only detected at the chlorine dosage of 10 mgcl2 l its concentration was much lower than those reported in seawater chlorination in the presence of ammonia shi et al 2013 because the source seawater in this study did not contain ammonia details in si table s1 despite the high iodide concentration in seawater 50 μg l only low concentrations of iodinated dbps 0 11 0 57 μg l including dcim biaa and diaa were detected in this study they were lower than those reported for chlorinated seawater during the pretreatment stage of a seawater ro desalination plant 2 57 μg l le roux et al 2015 and in chlorinated finished water in u s drinking water treatment plants up to 19 μg l krasner et al 2006 because the concentration of seawater nom 0 5 mgc l in this study was lower than those in the aforementioned studies 0 98 13 mgc l krasner et al 2006 le roux et al 2015 in addition the presence of ammonia in the previous studies also enhanced the formation of iodinated dbps krasner et al 2006 because ammonia transformed free chlorine to chloramines free chlorine rapidly oxidizes iodide to hypoiodous acid hoi k app 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 and then to iodate k app 21 m 1 s 1 dong et al 2019 chloramines also rapidly oxidize iodide to hoi k app 2 4 103 m 1 s 1 but are slow in oxidizing hoi to iodate k app 2 10 3 m 1 s 1 and therefore chloramination forms iodinated dbps as hoi reacts with nom k app 0 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 dong et al 2019 with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 total dbps remained unchanged but decreased by 18 3 as ph further increased to 10 from ph 6 5 to 8 the concentrations of haas hals and hans decreased since these dbps hydrolyzed to form thms with increasing ph as shown in figs 1 c 1 e their hydrolysis increased the concentrations of thms with increasing ph as shown in fig 1 b these trends were consistent with data obtained in chlorination of drinking water ph 9 5 hua and reckhow 2008 hua and reckhow 2012a as a result total dbps remained unchanged from ph 8 to 10 the hydrolysis of thms haas hans and hals became faster especially for the bromine containing dbps as shown in figs 1 b 1 e abusallout et al 2017 chen 2011 hua and reckhow 2008 hua and reckhow 2012b therefore total dbps decreased a similar trend was also observed in chlorination of drinking water in the presence of bromide at a chlorine dosage of 4 mgcl2 l liu et al 2018b however in the absence of bromide total dbps including thms haas hans and haloketones remained unchanged when ph increased from 7 to 10 in chlorination of drinking water at a chlorine dosage of 8 1 mgcl2 l hua and reckhow 2008 the unchanged total dbps from ph 7 to 10 in chlorination in the absence of bromide was mainly because of the hydrolysis of chlorine containing haas hans and haloketones to chlorine containing thms hua and reckhow 2012a whose hydrolysis rates are not as significant as that of bromine containing thms at ph 10 abusallout et al 2017 pan et al 2019 total dbps increased by 70 3 and 50 0 with increasing contact times from 0 5 to 3 h and increasing chlorine dosages from 2 to 10 mgcl2 l respectively because tthms thaas and thans contributed over 90 to the increase of total dbps with increasing contact times and chlorine dosages as shown in figs 1 b 1 c and 1 e respectively the specific yields of dbps in μg mgc were calculated by dividing dbp concentrations by the initial concentrations of seawater nom to facilitate the comparison between the concentrations of dbps in the current study with the reported values the specific yields of total dbps increased from 60 1 to 104 0 μg mgc with increasing contact times consistent with the specific yields of total dbps reported in seawater chlorination with increasing contact times from 0 5 to 200 h abdel wahab et al 2010 agus and sedlak 2010 padhi et al 2012 meanwhile the specific yields of total dbps increased from 88 7 to 133 6 μg mgc with increasing chlorine dosages consistent with the previous studies of total dbps formed in seawater chlorination with increasing chlorine dosages from 0 5 to 10 mgcl2 l abdel wahab et al 2010 agus and sedlak 2010 padhi et al 2012 the decrease in dbal concentrations with increasing contact times might be attributed to the rapid hydrolysis of dbal while the decreased dbal concentrations with increasing chlorine dosages from 5 to 10 mgcl2 l might be due to the hypochlorite catalyzed hydrolysis of dbal yin et al 2018 total dbps increased by 18 1 with increasing temperatures from 17 to 29 c as increasing temperatures may enhance both formation and decomposition rates of dbps zhang et al 2013 the results suggest that the formation rates of the detected dbps outcompeted their decomposition rates with increasing temperatures thereby leading to the increase in total dbps at higher temperatures 3 1 2 high molecular weight adsorbable organic halogen the high molecular weight mw adsorbable organic halogen aox hereafter referred to high mw aox i e aox with molecular weight cut off mwco higher than 320 500 daltons formed in seawater chlorination were measured to capture the formation of unknown dbps fig 2 shows concentrations of high mw aox in seawater chlorination varied from 0 3 0 1 to 3 3 0 2 μm under different operating conditions adsorbable organic chlorine aocl and adsorbable organic bromine aobr were the major components while adsorbable organic iodine was below its detection limit 0 079 μm equivalent to 10 μgi l with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 the concentrations of high mw aox decreased from 1 58 to 1 20 μm similar trends were reported for drinking water chlorination from ph 7 to 9 5 abusallout et al 2017 at higher ph aobr underwent base catalyzed degradation and resulted in dehalogenation of aobr abusallout et al 2017 hua and reckhow 2012a meanwhile the increasing ph transformed hobr to its lower oxidation potential form of bro which may promote the halogen substitution of nom hua and reckhow 2012b the decrease in high mw aobr with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 suggests that the base catalyzed degradation rates of aobr outcompeted the halogenation rates of seawater nom as ph further increased to 10 the base catalyzed degradation rates of high mw aobr still outcompeted their formation rates on the other hand the formation rates of high mw aocl increased therefore the concentrations of high mw aox remained the same as ph increased from 8 to 10 with increasing contact times from 0 5 to 3 h chlorine dosages from 2 to 10 mgcl2 l and temperatures from 17 to 29 c the concentrations of high mw aox increased significantly from 0 29 to 1 89 μm from 1 29 to 1 59 μm and from 0 32 to 3 12 μm respectively the increased high mw aox under these conditions were mainly because of the increase in high mw aobr and the changes in the concentrations of high mw aocl were insignificant p 0 05 small amounts of high mw aobr were formed 58 64 nm at the contact time of 0 5 h while large quantities of known low mw and brominated dbps were formed 123 71 nm shown in fig 1 a and table s5 bromine is more reactive towards low mw fractions of nom than high mw fractions hua and reckhow 2008 because low mw fractions of seawater nom has more aromatic precursors higher contents of tryptophan like and tyrosine like aromatic protein and fulvic acid than other mw fractions yang et al 2017 therefore low mw fractions of seawater nom were the main precursors of low mw dbps when bromine reacted with high mw fractions of seawater nom both low mw brominated dbps and high mw aobr were formed with increasing contact times fig 1 a and fig 2 while the high mw fractions of nom were the primary precursors of the unknown aobr hua and reckhow 2008 nevertheless most high mw aocl was formed within the first 0 5 h and remained stable with increasing contact times with increasing chlorine dosages from 2 to 10 mgcl2 l more free bromine was formed competed with free chlorine for the limited seawater nom and dominated the reaction with seawater nom to form larger amounts of high mw aobr and smaller amounts of high mw aocl equations relevant to these reactions are listed in si table s6 the increasing concentrations of high mw aox with increasing temperatures suggests that increasing temperatures accelerated the formation rates more significantly than the decomposition rates of high mw aobr 3 1 3 total organic halogen total organic halogen tox includes concentrations of high mw aox and total dbps measured by the modified gc ecd method which supplements the low mw dbps lost during measurement of high mw aox however tox excludes low mw dbps mwco less than 320 500 daltons that cannot be measured by the modified gc ecd method fig 3 shows tox obtained under different operating conditions tox ranged from 414 4 170 3 to 3 331 3 130 0 nm and the specific yields of tox ranged from 29 4 to 236 5 μgcl mgc the specific yields of tox were in the similar ranges of those of tox reported in chlorinated drinking water in the absence of bromide hua and reckhow 2008 and in chlorinated bromide containing drinking water liu et al 2018b and those of extractable organic halogen in chlorinated seawater in swimming pools manasfi et al 2017 the trends of tox as a function of each operating parameter were similar to those of high mw aox specifically total organic chlorine tocl remained stable under different operation conditions while total organic bromine tobr increased with increasing contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures but with decreasing ph such trends of tocl and tobr formation are much different from those reported in drinking water or groundwater chlorination where tocl increased with increasing chlorine dosages contact times and temperatures and with decreasing ph hua and reckhow 2008 liu et al 2018b szczuka et al 2017 and tobr was limited by insufficient bromide concentrations liu et al 2018b szczuka et al 2017 the unknown high mw aox to tox ratios 64 7 to 93 8 are comparable with that at 86 in chlorinated seawater in swimming pools manasfi et al 2017 however the ratios are substantially higher than the unknown tox to tox ratio at 50 in chlorinated drinking water krasner et al 2006 in addition the ratios increased with increasing contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures and showed trends opposite to those in chlorinated drinking water hua and reckhow 2008 hua and reckhow 2012b bromine incorporation into unknown high mw nom may account for the greater contribution of high mw aox to tox in seawater chlorination than drinking water chlorination this emphasizes the importance of understanding the composition and toxicity of brominated high mw aox to better control dbp formation during seawater chlorination 3 2 integrated cyto and geno toxicity of dbps 3 2 1 integrated cyto and geno toxicity fig 4 a shows the cytotoxicity of the 19 detected dbps in seawater chlorination at different ph contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures varying one parameter at a time from the baseline condition their cytotoxicity was calculated by multiplying the molar concentration of each dbp by its corresponding chinese hamster ovary cho cell cytotoxicity index value which was the inverse of its lethal concentrations at 50 lc50 wagner and plewa 2017 the cytotoxicity of individual dbps in mixture was additive lau et al 2020 the sum of their cytotoxicity hereafter referred to as integrated cytotoxicity under the experimental conditions were in the range of 1 48 10 3 5 02 10 3 dbal dban and mbaa dominated and together contributed approximately 80 to the integrated cytotoxicity even though they only accounted for less than 10 of total dbps these dbps contributed significantly to the integrated cytotoxicity at low concentrations because their cho cell cytotoxicity index values 1 04 105 3 51 105 m 1 were substantially higher than those of the other dbps 1 04 102 1 18 104 m 1 wagner and plewa 2017 therefore the changes of the integrated cytotoxicity under different operating conditions were mainly the result of the changes in dbal dban and mbaa concentrations hans hals and haas were also reported as the three main contributors to the integrated cytotoxicity in chlorination of drinking water and groundwater in the presence of bromide liu et al 2018b szczuka et al 2017 by contrast tbm tbaa and dbaa accounted for over 80 of total dbps but only contributed about 15 to the integrated cytotoxicity as their cho cell cytotoxicity index values 2 53 102 1 18 104 m 1 were 10 to 1 000 times lower than those of dbal dban and mbaa wagner and plewa 2017 therefore integrated cytotoxicity was not correlated with total dbps with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 and to 10 the integrated cytotoxicity decreased by 40 0 and 70 5 respectively the significant decrease in the integrated cytotoxicity at higher ph was mainly because of the faster hydrolysis of dbal at higher ph thereby leading to a decrease in cytotoxicity caused by dbal the decrease in the integrated cytotoxicity was also observed in chlorination of swimming pool water in the presence of 1 mg l of bromide with increasing ph from 6 to 8 but hans were the dominant contributors hansen et al 2012 with increasing contact time from 0 5 to 3 h the integrated cytotoxicity remained the same that was because the concentrations of the major integrated cytotoxicity contributor dbal significantly decreased with increasing contact times while those of the other two major cytotoxicity contributors i e dban and mbaa increased with increasing contact times as chlorine dosages increased from 2 to 5 and to 10 mgcl2 l the integrated cytotoxicity increased by 49 0 and 53 9 respectively with increasing chlorine dosages from 2 to 5 mgcl2 l the concentrations of all three dominant species i e dbal dban and mbaa increased significantly leading to the increased integrated cytotoxicity when chlorine dosages further increased from 5 to 10 mgcl2 l increases in dban and dbnm cytotoxicity compensated for the decrease in dbal cytotoxicity therefore slightly increasing the integrated cytotoxicity dbnm contributed 7 4 to the integrated cytotoxicity at the high chlorine dosages but was not detectable under other experimental conditions however in chlorination of drinking water containing a lower concentration of bromide 0 8 mg l integrated cytotoxicity significantly decreased with increasing chlorine dosages from 4 to 16 mgcl2 l at the doc concentration of 2 mgc l liu et al 2018b this contradiction between the current and previous studies was because higher levels of bromide in seawater led to the formation of higher concentrations of bromine containing hals which were more toxic than the chlorine containing hals formed mainly in drinking water chlorination liu et al 2018b as temperatures increased from 17 to 23 and to 29 c the integrated cytotoxicity decreased slightly by 4 8 and 12 8 respectively the decrease of the integrated cytotoxicity was mainly attributed to the significant decrease of the major integrated cytotoxicity contributor dbal with increasing temperatures despite the slight increases in concentrations of the other two major cytotoxicity contributors i e dban and mbaa with increasing temperatures the genotoxicity of the detected dbps was calculated by multiplying the molar concentrations of each dbp by their corresponding genotoxicity index values for cho cells the latter are the inverses of the cho cell 50 tail dna values fig 4 b shows the genotoxicity of the 19 detected dbps in seawater chlorination under different operating conditions the sum of their genotoxicity hereafter referred to as integrated genotoxicity under different experimental conditions were in the range of 3 98 10 4 9 21 10 4 mbaa dbal and dban were the three main contributors to the integrated genotoxicity as their genotoxicity index values 9 01 103 5 88 104 m 1 were 10 to 1 000 times higher than those of other dbps wagner and plewa 2017 the changes of the integrated genotoxicity followed similar trends to those of the integrated cytotoxicity under different ph and chlorine dosages but increased with increasing contact times and temperatures the trends of the changes of the integrated genotoxicity were mainly due to the concentration changes of the three main contributors 3 2 2 comparison of integrated cyto and geno toxicity both the integrated cyto and geno toxicity of the detected dbps were primarily determined by the three dbps i e dban dbal and mbaa but their contributions were different under different operating conditions dban dbal and mbaa contributed similarly to the integrated cytotoxicity whereas mbaa was the dominant contributor to the integrated genotoxicity an earlier study emphasized the toxicity of nitrogenous dbps muellner et al 2007 nevertheless we found that mbaa contributed more significantly to the integrated genotoxicity than nitrogenous dbps here the contributions of the detected iodine containing dbps i e dcim diaa and biaa to the integrated cyto and geno toxicity in seawater chlorination were negligible as they had relatively low concentrations and low cyto and geno toxicity index values although they were reported to be more cyto and geno toxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 these results suggest that we may need to prioritize the regulation of these toxicity drivers i e dban dbal and mbaa in real practice 3 3 changes in uv254 and feem and their correlations with dbp formation and integrated toxicity fig 5 a shows the changes in uv254 hereafter referred to as δuv254 during seawater chlorination which were calculated from subtracting the uv254 values of seawater after chlorination from the uv254 value of seawater before chlorination the uv254 value of the seawater before chlorination was 0 452 m 1 details in si table s7 which was in the range of those reported in raw seawater edzwald and haarhoff 2011 uv254 is mainly absorbed by electron rich sites in nom including aromatic sites and conjugated double bonds weishaar et al 2003 the positive δuv254 values under all experimental conditions indicate that the aromatic and humic fractions in seawater nom absorb less uv254 suggesting these moieties were destroyed during seawater chlorination the δuv254 values increased with increasing contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures and decreasing ph hence more aromatic and humic fractions in seawater nom were destroyed by longer contact times higher chlorine dosages and temperatures and lower ph the relationships between δuv254 and dbp concentrations or integrated toxicity were then investigated details in si table s8 the δuv254 values were strongly and positively correlated with the concentrations of high mw aobr r 0 92 p 0 01 high mw aox r 0 91 p 0 01 and tox r 0 91 p 0 01 therefore the aromatic and humic fractions in the seawater nom were the primary precursors of these dbps in seawater chlorination the δuv254 values were moderately and positively correlated with the concentrations of tbm r 0 63 p 0 05 dban r 0 59 p 0 05 tthms r 0 64 p 0 05 and thans r 0 59 p 0 05 therefore the aliphatic and non humic fractions of seawater nom also contributed to the formation of tbm dban thans and tthms the correlations between δuv254 and tthms were consistent with the data reported for chlorinated seawater at various contact times padhi et al 2019 correlations between δuv254 and integrated toxicity were not significant fig 5 b shows the changes of feem volumes hereafter referred to as δfeem in seawater chlorination under different operating conditions the δfeem values were calculated by subtracting the feem volumes in seawater after chlorination from those before chlorination feem represents the fluorophore sites in seawater nom including humic fulvic acids aromatic proteins and other soluble microbial byproducts such as protein or phenol like organics which are all major precursors of dbps wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 the feem volume in seawater before chlorination was 1 90 105 au nm2 details in si figure s1 and table s8 while all δfeem values were positive under different experimental conditions the positive δfeem values suggest that the fluorophores in seawater nom were destroyed during seawater chlorination as previously reported fabbricino et al 2019 the δfeem values at different contact times chlorine dosages temperatures and ph followed trends similar to those of the δuv254 values suggesting that more fluorophores in seawater nom were degraded at longer contact times higher chlorine dosages and temperatures and lower ph the δfeem values were strongly and positively correlated with the concentrations of high mw aobr r 0 93 p 0 01 high mw aox r 0 91 p 0 01 and tox r 0 91 p 0 01 and moderately and positively correlated with the concentrations of tbm r 0 74 p 0 01 bcan r 0 60 p 0 05 dban r 0 79 p 0 01 tthms r 0 73 p 0 01 thans r 0 86 p 0 01 and total dbps r 0 71 p 0 01 details in si table s8 these results suggest that fluorophores in seawater nom were the primary precursors of these dbps during seawater chlorination the correlations between δfeem and tthms and those between δfeem and thans were consistent with those reported by fabbricino et al 2019 in chlorinated coastal seawater under different reaction times correlations between δfeem and integrated toxicity were insignificant 4 conclusions this study is the first systematic investigation to quantify the impacts of different operation conditions e g ph chlorine dosages contact times and temperatures towards the dbp formation in seawater chlorination higher concentrations of total dbps were found under longer contact times higher chlorine dosages higher temperatures and lower ph results from our study fill in the gaps of understanding the dependency of the dbp formation towards various real world conditions and provide a multi dimensional operational guidance of seawater chlorination to reduce its dbp formation the formation of most dbp species detected in this study under different operation conditions show similar trends to other studies in drinking water and groundwater regulated brominated thms and haas were the main dbp species formed under different operating conditions in seawater chlorination however the formation of the most abundant dbp tbm was lower at ph 10 compared with those at ph 6 5 and 8 while the formation of thms was reported to be higher at higher ph in other studies unregulated hals hans and hnms were formed at low concentrations while only trace amounts of iodinated dbps were detected this study also demonstrates the significant impacts of mbaa a regulated dbp usually contributing less to total dbps in drinking water and groundwater on the integrated cyto and geno toxicity in seawater chlorination under different operating conditions dbal and dban two unregulated dbps also contribute significantly to the integrated cytotoxicity the results from the integrated toxicity suggest that monitoring and controlling dbps in seawater chlorination may need to be shifted from the most abundant dbps to those contributing the most to toxicity regardless they are regulated or nonregulated tocl remained stable under different operation conditions while tobr increased with increasing contact times chlorine dosages and temperatures but with decreasing ph such trends of tocl and tobr formation are much different from those reported in drinking water or groundwater chlorination the unique trends of tocl and tobr formation in seawater chlorination revealed in this study highlight the needs to compare the trends of toxicity in corresponding conditions with those reported in drinking water and groundwater moreover the δuv254 and δfeem values representing the change of the aromatic and humic fractions and fluorophores in seawater nom are strongly and positively correlated with the concentrations of tox and thus effectively predict the concentrations of tox declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
