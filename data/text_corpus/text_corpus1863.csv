9315,straw derived n is an organic n source that plays an important role in agroecosystems however quantitatively tracing the release and fate of exogenous straw derived n in a rice soil system amended by irrigation regime and straw placement depth is poorly understood the objectives of this study were to determine the release and fate of straw derived n in the rice soil system under different irrigation regimes and straw placement depths 15n labeled rice straw was used for two consecutive years in a field experiment in northeast china and four treatments were established i controlled irrigation shallow straw return 5 cm depth csd1 ii controlled irrigation deep straw return 15 cm depth csd2 iii flooded irrigation shallow straw return 5 cm depth fsd1 and iv flooded irrigation deep straw return 15 cm depth fsd2 we found that the temporal patterns of straw n release were best described by the one pool model which was helpful to predict the straw derived n fluxes during straw decomposition under different irrigation regimes and straw placement depths controlled irrigation and shallow straw placement depth increased the straw n release rate which was consistent with their effects on straw mass loss especially in the first rice season showing a decreasing order of csd1 csd2 fsd1 fsd2 irrigation regime and straw placement depth significantly affected the fate of straw derived n in the rice soil system controlled irrigation will not only increase plant utilization rates of straw derived n at different straw placement depths but also promote soil sequestration of straw derived n and reduce the loss of straw derived n additionally we also found that placing straw at a shallower depth can also increase straw derived n utilization by plants coupling controlled irrigation and placing straw at a shallower depth csd1 resulted in the highest utilization of straw derived n by plants however it is worth noting that placing straw at a shallower depth also increases the loss of straw derived n which may increase the risk of environmental pollution in a soil rice system this study expanded the theory of straw n release and effective utilization in agroecosystems which is helpful to better predict gross n fluxes and fates of straw derived n in the agroecosystem to formulate a scientific and reasonable mode of field management with straw return keywords water saving irrigation 15n labeling straw decomposition straw nitrogen release straw placement depth data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice is one of the vital staple foods feeding over 50 of the global population as the largest rice producer in the world china produces 220 million tons of rice annually accounting for 27 9 of global rice production ban et al 2021 fao 2017 assuming a grain straw ratio of 1 0 97 approximately 213 4 million tons of rice straw was produced annually ai et al 2015 straw is rich in organic matter and various nutrient elements such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and can supply nutrients to crops when it is decomposed nitrogen in crop straw was estimated at 46 3 tg equivalent to 56 3 of fertilizer n consumption across the world in 2001 lal 2009 chopping and direct returning straw to the field could be a substitute for energy intensive and resource reliant inorganic fertilizers wang et al 2015 increasing the availability of soil nutrients and improving crop yield which has become a prevailing agricultural practice in china crop straw returned to the field exhibits a common decomposition pattern of first fast and then slow complete decomposition of straw is rather time consuming and usually requires years to decades yan et al 2019 however the vulnerable components of straw accounting for 50 90 of straw mass can be released into soils in a short period of 3 4 months by biochemical reactions wu et al 2022 straw derived n is released during this process and plays an essential role in maintaining soil fertility and enhancing agricultural productivity therefore it is vital to understand straw n release dynamics and the fate of straw derived n in the plant soil system to develop a scientific practice for straw return and a guide for reasonable fertilization the irrigation regime is known as common agricultural management that affects soil temperature moisture porosity and microbial activity chen et al 2019 han et al 2021 zhou et al 2020b all these soil properties trigger the nutrient release and mineralization of incorporated crop straw some recent studies have investigated the decomposition and nutrient release of straw under traditional flooded irrigation wang et al 2017 yan et al 2019 yao et al 2015 however the irrigation practices for paddy rice in china are changing water saving irrigation has been widely adopted by farmers to cope with the rapid increase in agricultural water consumption pan et al 2017 zhuang et al 2019 the transformation from flooded irrigation anaerobic conditions to water saving irrigation aerobic conditions can alter the processes of nutrient cycling mineralization of nutrients and microbial dynamics in rice paddies chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 which may finally affect the release and sequestration of straw derived n in soil additionally water saving irrigation also helps to improve the growth and development of roots and shoots in rice plants chu et al 2018 ishfaq et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 which may affect straw derived n uptake by crops however there is little information about straw n release and its derived n fate in rice soil systems under water saving irrigation crop straw is usually incorporated into different soil depths by using different powered machines or different methods such as plowing rotary and disc tillage curtin et al 2008 however soil temperature moisture porosity and microbial activity varied greatly among soils at different depths han et al 2020 all these soil properties not only affect straw decomposition but also trigger straw n release and mineralization latifmanesh et al 2020 lin et al 2017 lu and fei 2015 some recent studies have noted that straw placement depths influence the straw decomposition rate straw c release and sequestration in soil latifmanesh et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2017 however the potential of straw n release and its derived n fate under different incorporation depths are not well documented therefore it is essential to assess the effects of straw placement depths on the straw n release rate and its derived n fate in the rice soil system mollisols have high organic matter good structure and rich nutrients and is treated as one of the most important soil resources for crop production around the world sanford et al 2012 yu et al 2011 northeastern china is one of the three mollisols regions in the world with a total area of 1 18 105 km2 after years of development northeast china has become one of the most important bases for crop production liu et al 2006 2015 zhang et al 2007 however long term intensive cultivation and unreasonable field management have led to destroyed soil structure serious degradation of soil fertility and decreased organic matter content year by year liu et al 2010 straw return was treated as one of the most important methods for soil conservancy and soil reclamation in the mollisols region of northeast china guo et al 2019 in this region rice is one of the staple crops different irrigation regimes and straw placement depths may have different effects on straw n release and its derived n fate in the rice soil system which need to be understood to provide scientific support for crop residue management in this region in the present study 15n labeled rice straw was applied to a two years experiment and the straw n release and its derived n fate in a rice soil system under two typical irrigation regimes flooded irrigation and controlled irrigation and two different straw placement depths 5 cm and 15 cm were investigated the main objectives of this study were to i analyze the straw n release dynamics during the straw decomposition process and ii quantify the fate of straw derived n in a rice soil system under different irrigation and straw placement depths 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was conducted in the 2018 and 2019 rice seasons at the state key station for irrigation experiment the station 127 40 45 e 46 57 28 n is located in heping irrigation district heilongjiang province northeast china

the end of may and harvested at the end of september or early october with a winter fallow 2 2 preparation of 15n labeled straw the 15n enriched rice straw was prepared in 2017 by a plot experiment in an open air greenhouse with the same variety of rice 15n labeled urea 98 atom 15n atom excess was applied to the plots 1 m 1 m at a dosage of 10 55 g in three splits basal fertilizer tillering

portion of the rice straw samples was ground for analysis using a flash 2000ht elemental analyzer thermo fisher scientific interfaced to an isotope mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific ea irms the properties of 15n rice straw were 416 8 g kg 1 in total c 8 g kg 1 in total n and 8840 4 in Î´15n 2 3 experimental design the experiments were conducted from may 2018 to october 2019 and lasted for two rice seasons the daily maximum air temperature minimum temperature and precipitation during this period are shown in fig 2 this experiment was conducted using in situ independent plots each with dimensions of 0 8 m l 0 6 m w 0 5 m h these independent plots were constructed by inserting the steel wall vertically into the paddy field before transplanting the experiment consisted of two irrigation regimes and two straw placement depths in a full factorial design the experimental treatments were i controlled irrigation shallow straw return 5 cm depth csd1 ii controlled irrigation deep straw return 15 cm depth csd2 iii flooded irrigation shallow straw return 5 cm depth fsd1 and iv flooded irrigation deep straw return 15 cm depth fsd2 each treatment was repeated nine times for a total of 36 treatment plots the plots for each treatment replicate were divided equally into three groups groups a and b are tracer groups with 15n labeled straws to avoid the effect of straw sampling on rice growth and the fate of straw derived n group a was used to collect litterbags straw samples to reveal the dynamics of rice straw decomposition while group b was used to collect soil and rice plant samples to investigate the fate of straw derived n in the rice soil system group c consisted of control groups with unlabeled straw and was placed far away from groups a and b to measure the natural atom 15n of the straw and soil sample under different treatments straw decomposition was studied with the standardized litterbag method aerts 1997 xu et al 2017 according to the local practice of straw returning 6 t ha 1 18 g oven dried 15n labeled or unlabeled rice straw was mixed thoroughly with soil and placed in a litterbag 20 cm 15 cm nylon mesh bag with a mesh diameter of 48 Âµm so that water and soil microorganisms could exchange between inside and outside the litterbags yet debris of straw could be separated from the soil easily in each plot 16 litterbags were randomly placed at 5 cm or 15 cm on may 1 2018 and the marker was left on the soil surface to assist sampling after the rice harvest in october 2018 the labeled and unlabeled straw litterbags remained in the soil until the end of the second rice season october 2019 nitrogen in the form of urea was applied in three splits as basal 45 fertilizer n tillering 20 fertilizer n and panicle 35 fertilizer n fertilizers basal fertilizer was incorporated in the field at 1 d before transplanting tillering fertilizer was applied at the initiation of the tillering stage 24 d after transplanting and panicle fertilizer was applied at the panicle initiation stage 72 d after transplanting in addition phosphate fertilizer was applied as a basal fertilizer potassium fertilizer was applied in two splits 50 as basal fertilizer and 50 at panicle initiation the quantities of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers applied were the same across all treatments 110 kg n ha 1 45 kg p ha 1 and 80 kg k ha 1 in rice fields with controlled irrigation the water level was maintained at 5 25 mm in the regreening stage in other periods when the soil moisture or surface water level was close to or below the lower irrigation threshold manual irrigation with tap water was carried out until the upper irrigation threshold was reached the soil moisture content or surface water level was maintained between the upper and the lower irrigation threshold of the corresponding growth stage detailed information regarding the controlled irrigation regime can be found in reference by xu et al 2019 2012 for flooded treatments 3 5 cm of standing water was maintained until later season drainage at 7 days after the milk ripe stage fig 3 presents the standards of field water control under flooded irrigation and controlled irrigation in different stages of rice 2 4 straw plant and soil sampling litterbags were collected randomly every month during the rice season all the undecomposed 15n labeled and unlabeled rice straw residues in the litterbags were collected gently cleaned off the adhering soil with a brush and washed off with deionized water then these rice straw residues were oven dried at 60 to a constant mass and weighed for dry mass calculation and further analysis mature rice plants were harvested and soil samples 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm were collected at harvest in october 2018 and 2019 five soil cores from each layer in the same plot were randomly collected with an auger and then mixed thoroughly to obtain a composite sample per plot for each depth roots gravels and various new bodies and intrusions were carefully removed from the soil sample the soil samples were brought back to the laboratory air dried at room temperature and then ground for chemical analysis for rice plant sampling the stems leaves roots and panicles were collected and stored separately these samples were cleaned with deionized water placed in a 105 oven for 30 min dried at 60 to constant weight and then ground for analysis all dried samples of straw plants and soil were ground to a fine powder in a mixer mill and weighed into a tin capsule which was sent to equipment for analysis of the total n concentration and atom 15n and Î´15n signature using a flash 2000ht elemental analyzer thermo fisher scientific interfaced to an isotope mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific ea irms analysis results were expressed relative to the atmospheric n2 standard robinson 2001 the standard is atmospheric n2 0 366 atom 15n we run a standard every ten samples to check the stability and drift 2 5 calculations in previous studies straw n release was estimated as the net deduction of n in straw during its decomposition guan et al 2019a yan et al 2019 however the net n release underestimated the gross n release because net n immobilization was often reported during the early stage of straw decomposition in the straw especially under conditions with low n contents or high c n ratios miyamoto and hiura 2008 parton et al 2007 the straw n release based on the stable isotope technique offered a precise way to gain insight into the real straw n release during straw decomposition the amount of straw 15n was calculated as follows 1 at 15 n 15 n 14 n 15 n 100 2 n straw 15 at 15 n 15 at 15 n 15 1 at 15 n 14 n straw m straw where at 15 n is the atomic

parameters were estimated using origin 9 0 software origin lab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 straw n release after the straw was incorporated into the paddy soil the straw gradually decomposed and the residual straw mass decreased gradually during the first rice season approximately 35 28 56 17 of the straw mass decomposed under the different treatments and this value decreased to 17 16 19 16 during the second season fig 4a during the process of straw decomposition straw n is released gradually by using the 15n labeling method eq 3 the straw n release was estimated as 38 76 67 04 during the first rice season and summed to 63 61 84 71 at the end of the second rice season fig 4b among the treatments controlled irrigation resulted in a lower residual mass of straw than flooded irrigation and shallower straw placement was more conducive to straw decomposition than deep placement as a result more straw n was released under controlled irrigation and shallow straw placement conditions fig 4a we also found that the straw n release along with the time t was fitted the best with a one pool model y 100 a 1 e k 1 t fig 4b table 1 the straw n release rate k 1 0 11 month 1 0 32 month 1 during the first rice season was higher than that during the second season k 1 0 001 month 1 0 002 month 1 controlled irrigation and shallow straw placement increased the straw n release rate k 1 especially in the first rice season showing a decreasing order of csd1 csd2 fsd1 fsd2 3 2 retention of straw derived n in soil the nitrogen released by the straw first enters the soil the total residual amount of straw derived n in the soil was 2 71 mg kg 1 6 35 mg kg 1 under different treatments at the end of the first rice season and was slightly increased at the end of the second season table 2 during the two rice seasons controlled irrigation significantly increased the accumulation of straw derived n in the soil p 0 05 additionally shallow straw placement is more beneficial to the rapid accumulation of straw derived n in soil anova analysis showed that irrigation regime and straw placement depth significantly affected straw derived n in the soil and there was no interaction between irrigation regimes and straw placement depths 3 3 straw derived n uptake of rice plant 15n accumulation indicated that nitrogen derived from straw ranged from 2 12 kg ha 1 to 7 54 kg ha 1 during the first rice season while it ranged from 2 68 kg ha 1 to 5 29 kg ha 1 during the second rice season table 3 the straw derived n amount in different plant parts under different treatments was basically consistent and followed the order of grain stem leaf root during both rice seasons the grain s straw derived n accumulation was much greater than that of the leaf stem and root analysis of variance showed that straw derived n accumulation in different plant parts and whole plants was significantly affected by irrigation regime and straw placement depth p 0 05 coupling controlled irrigation and shallow straw placement significantly increased the straw derived n accumulation in rice plants showing that the csd1 treatment had a greater straw derived n accumulation in the whole plant during both rice seasons 3 4 the fate of straw derived n in the rice soil system in the present study the results of the 15n isotope tracer test indicated that approximately 63 62 84 71 of straw n was released into the rice soil system fig 5 within two rice seasons in mollisols with single rice winter fallow cultivation practices in northeast china after two consecutive years 10 05 26 79 of straw derived n was taken up by rice plants and 33 37 41 62 was retained in the soil under the different treatments anova analysis table 4 showed that irrigation regime and straw placement depth significantly affected the fate of straw derived n such as remaining in the soil uptake by rice plants and loss to the environment controlled irrigation can increase plant utilization rates of straw derived n at different straw placement depths especially in the first rice season the plant utilization rates of straw derived n under controlled irrigation increased by 147 64 171 22 during the first rice season and by 53 49 70 63 during the second rice season at the same straw placement depth compared to flooded irrigation controlled irrigation also promoted the residual rate of straw derived n in the soil and reduced the loss of straw derived n we also found that placing straw at a shallower depth can also increase straw derived n utilization by plants therefore greater plant utilization rates of straw derived n were observed in the csd1 treatment however it is worth noting that placing straw at a shallower depth also increases the loss of straw derived n 4 discussion 4 1 straw n release in previous studies straw n release was estimated as the net deduction of n in straw during its decomposition following this idea it was estimated that only 40 60 of straw n was released into the soil during one rice season chen et al 2007 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 in the present study it was observed by the 15n labeling technique that the straw n release can reach 38 76 67 04 or 63 62 84 71 after straw return after one or two rice seasons 120 or 450 days respectively which is higher than the results obtained by measuring the net deduction of n in straw in the same region han et al 2020 yan et al 2019 we believe the deduction of n in straw during its decomposition was termed the amount of n released from straw underestimated the real release of straw n guan et al 2019b zhou et al 2020a because a certain amount of exogenous n might be immobilized and incorporated into the straw during straw decomposition chen et al 2021 quassi de castro et al 2021 zeller et al 2000 the straw n release based on the stable isotope technique offered a precise way to gain insight into the real straw n release during straw decomposition this could provide very useful information for the decision making of straw return strategy e g time of straw decomposition validity time of straw n release annual amount of straw return in the present study the straw n release during straw decomposition was best described by the one pool model y 100 a 1 e k 1 x fig 4 table 1 the model played an important role in predicting the straw derived n fluxes during straw decomposition under different irrigation regimes and straw placement depths the rate of straw n release k 1 is an important parameter to assess straw n release in this study the rate of straw n release k 1 for the first rice season was 0 11 month 1 to 0 32 month 1 in the different treatments which was much higher than the results regarding the release of litter n in forest ecosystems under the natural conditions observed by pei et al 2019 zeller et al 2000 this phenomenon can be attributed to the specific properties of mollisols i e high organic matter content high microbial biomass with strong activity and rich microbial population with a complex structure addo danso et al 2021 liu et al 2014a meanwhile the present results demonstrated that shallow straw returns contribute to even higher rates of straw n release under controlled irrigation it means the aerobic condition and high soil redox potential in soil under controlled irrigation favored the straw decomposition and the straw n release schmidt et al 2016 when combined with shallow straw return controlled irrigation can maintain higher soil temperature microorganism activity and nitrogen mineralization rates and provide enough nitrogen for microbial nitrogen fixation in the initial stage of straw decomposition helgason et al 2014 under this condition the straw returned to the field can quickly reach an appropriate c n value increasing the crop residue decomposition process and resulting in a higher straw n release rate it should be noted that in this study the straw residues were separated manually from the soil which might underestimate the remaining mass of straw residues in the litterbag particularly at the late stage of the experiment because of the difficulty in recovering smaller straw residues or preventing the leaching of dissolved organic matter curtin et al 2008 however this is the only method available to estimate the litter decomposition rate within soil as well as to measure the release of nutrients from litter residues in addition underestimation is generally accepted when the remaining mass of residues is used to estimate the decomposition rate in combination with modeling han et al 2020 much attention has been given here to collecting the remaining straw as much as possible through cross checking by several persons 4 2 the fate of straw derived n in the rice plant system amended by irrigation regime and straw placement depth in the present study 10 05 26 79 of straw derived n was taken up by rice plants and 33 37 41 62 was retained in the soil under different treatments after two consecutive years fig 5 these results were slightly lower than those of previous studies in paddy yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 and upland fields in other regions xu et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 this finding can be attributed to the specific properties of the study region i e a high latitude which results in a cold climate condition with the freezing thawing period for soil lasting for five months from november to march of the following year and a longer period for decomposition of returned straw a positive effect of controlled irrigation on the plant utilization and residual rates of straw derived n was obtained compared to flooded irrigation which can reduce the loss of straw derived n the possible reasons for this observation are as follows i under flooded irrigation conditions the exchange of gases between the soil and atmosphere was almost blocked a large amount of oxygen was consumed to maintain the decomposition process of straw return vesterdal 1999 therefore the chemical oxygen demand cod of flooded irrigation fields with straw return was increased 1 3 fold compared with that of the no straw return fields and was thereby responsible for the reduction in redox potential and the production of many reductive substances fujii et al 2010 this treatment may easily contribute to the toxic action of rice roots and go against the utilization of straw derived n by rice in contrast controlled irrigation can effectively increase the mass fraction of oxygen in the soil thus supplementing the chemical oxygen consumed in the decomposition progress of straw yu et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 it can decrease the influence of straw decomposition on the redox potential of soil improve the root activity of rice and accelerate the decomposition of straw which can be conducive to the absorption and utilization of straw derived n by rice table 3 ii the negative effect of flooding on the formation of soil aggregates was avoided and the aerobic soil environment under controlled irrigation enhanced soil microbial activities favoring the formation of macroaggregates chen et al 2022 ishfaq et al 2020 mohamed et al 2021 which might promote straw derived n in organic form to sequestration in soil aggregates iii some studies have proven that straw derived n can be rapidly transferred to soil microbial biomass sanaullah et al 2011 wang et al 2021 water saving irrigation which maintains suitable soil moisture and aerobic conditions promotes the growth efficiency and turnover of microbes which is conducive to straw decomposition and straw derived n utilization by microbes promoted the formation of microbial biomass n and accumulated it in soil in the form of metabolites despite all this the loss of straw derived n in this experiment the loss of straw derived n was almost equal to or even higher than the total utilization of straw derived n by rice in two seasons is a nonnegligible part which worth paying attention to it can contribute to greenhouse gas emission n2o and groundwater pollution inorganic nitrogen leaching in the present study the loss of straw derived n increased with decreasing straw placement depth under different irrigation regimes this is consistent with the existing theory that placed straw at a deep depth can improve the stability of n and reduce the loss however according to the results of this study placing straw at a deep depth also limits the plant utilization rate of straw derived n so it is necessary to further effective options for creating a positive balance between utilization and loss for straw derived n it was also observed that flooded irrigation increased the loss of straw derived n at different straw placement depths after two rice seasons the loss of straw derived n was approximately 20 19 22 46 under flooded irrigation which was higher than that under controlled irrigation the reason may be that on the one hand water saving irrigation has been proven effective in reducing ammonia volatilization and nitrogen runoff loss peng et al 2011 xu et al 2012 thus reducing the loss of straw derived n however the soil stays flooded for a long period under this condition the soil exhibits lower microorganism activity and weaker mineralization capacity due to the lack of nutrient support in the straw decomposition process the straw decomposition rate is slow resulting in low nitrogen release from the straw lin et al 2018 liu et al 2009 then the straw n began to be released in large quantities in the late rice season at this time rice cannot utilize these straw derived n sufficiently because crops have missed the key nitrogen requirement season thus resulting in a loss in the environment based on the above contents further research should be performed on changing the straw placement depth and fertilization strategies in conjunction with irrigation regimes for flooded irrigation straw should be placed at a shallow depth to accelerate the release of straw n and make the release of straw n consistent with the nitrogen requirement of crops to increase the plant utilization rate of straw derived n in addition the rate of straw n release under controlled irrigation is higher than that under flooded irrigation so more straw n is released into the rice soil system faster when combined with nitrogen fertilizer the available nitrogen content in soil may be higher than the crop requirement and contribute to the excessive accumulation of exogenous n i e fertilizer derived n or straw derived n in soil which increases the risk of exogenous n loss liu et al 2014b 5 conclusions the straw n release dynamics and its derived n fate in a rice soil system based on the stable isotope technique offered a precise way to gain insight into the real straw n release during straw decomposition the straw n release can reach 38 76 67 04 or 63 62 84 71 after straw return after one or two rice seasons irrigation regime and straw placement depth significantly affected the fate of straw derived n controlled irrigation not only promoted straw decomposition and the straw n release rate but also increased the crop utilization and soil sequestration of straw derived n reducing the loss of straw derived n in the rice soil system our findings suggest that controlled irrigation represents good paddy management practices for effective straw derived n utilization in addition placing straw at a shallower depth can further promote straw decomposition and straw n release however it is worth noting that this may also enhance the loss of straw derived n it is necessary to further effective options for creating a positive balance between utilization and loss for straw derived n declaration of competing interest the authors

utilization in agroecosystems which is helpful to better predict gross n fluxes and fates of straw derived n in the agroecosystem to formulate a scientific and reasonable mode of field management with straw return keywords water saving irrigation 15n labeling straw decomposition straw nitrogen release straw placement depth data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice is one of the vital staple foods feeding over 50 of the global population as the largest rice producer in the world china produces 220 million tons of rice annually accounting for 27 9 of global rice production ban et al 2021 fao 2017 assuming a grain straw ratio of 1 0 97 approximately 213 4 million tons of rice straw was produced annually ai et al 2015 straw is rich in organic matter and various nutrient elements such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and can supply nutrients to crops when it is decomposed nitrogen in crop straw was estimated at 46 3 tg equivalent to 56 3 of fertilizer n consumption across the world in 2001 lal 2009 chopping and direct returning straw to the field could be a substitute for energy intensive and resource reliant inorganic fertilizers wang et al 2015 increasing the availability of soil nutrients and improving crop yield which has become a prevailing agricultural practice in china crop straw returned to the field exhibits a common decomposition pattern of first fast and then slow complete decomposition of straw is rather time consuming and usually requires years to decades yan et al 2019 however the vulnerable components of straw accounting for 50 90 of straw mass can be released into soils in a short period of 3 4 months by biochemical reactions wu et al 2022 straw derived n is released during this process and plays an essential role in maintaining soil fertility and enhancing agricultural productivity therefore it is vital to understand straw n release dynamics and the fate of straw derived n in the plant soil system to develop a scientific practice for straw return and a guide for reasonable fertilization the irrigation regime is known as common agricultural management that affects soil temperature moisture porosity and microbial activity chen et al 2019 han et al 2021 zhou et al 2020b all these soil properties trigger the nutrient release and mineralization of incorporated crop straw some recent studies have investigated the decomposition and nutrient release of straw under traditional flooded irrigation wang et al 2017 yan et al 2019 yao et al 2015 however the irrigation practices for paddy rice in china are changing water saving irrigation has been widely adopted by farmers to cope with the rapid increase in agricultural water consumption pan et al 2017 zhuang et al 2019 the transformation from flooded irrigation anaerobic conditions to water saving irrigation aerobic conditions can alter the processes of nutrient cycling mineralization of nutrients and microbial dynamics in rice paddies chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 which may finally affect the release and sequestration of straw derived n in soil additionally water saving irrigation also helps to improve the growth and development of roots and shoots in rice plants chu et al 2018 ishfaq et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 which may affect straw derived n uptake by crops however there is little information about straw n release and its derived n fate in rice soil systems under water saving irrigation crop straw is usually incorporated into different soil depths by using different powered machines or different methods such as plowing rotary and disc tillage curtin et al 2008 however soil temperature moisture porosity and microbial activity varied greatly among soils at different depths han et al 2020 all these soil properties not only affect straw decomposition but also trigger straw n release and mineralization latifmanesh et al 2020 lin et al 2017 lu and fei 2015 some recent studies have noted that straw placement depths influence the straw decomposition rate straw c release and sequestration in soil latifmanesh et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2017 however the potential of straw n release and its derived n fate under different incorporation depths are not well documented therefore it is essential to assess the effects of straw placement depths on the straw n release rate and its derived n fate in the rice soil system mollisols have high organic matter good structure and rich nutrients and is treated as one of the most important soil resources for crop production around the world sanford et al 2012 yu et al 2011 northeastern china is one of the three mollisols regions in the world with a total area of 1 18 105 km2 after years of development northeast china has become one of the most important bases for crop production liu et al 2006 2015 zhang et al 2007 however long term intensive cultivation and unreasonable field management have led to destroyed soil structure serious degradation of soil fertility and decreased organic matter content year by year liu et al 2010 straw return was treated as one of the most important methods for soil conservancy and soil reclamation in the mollisols region of northeast china guo et al 2019 in this region rice is one of the staple crops different irrigation regimes and straw placement depths may have different effects on straw n release and its derived n fate in the rice soil system which need to be understood to provide scientific support for crop residue management in this region in the present study 15n labeled rice straw was applied to a two years experiment and the straw n release and its derived n fate in a rice soil system under two typical irrigation regimes flooded irrigation and controlled irrigation and two different straw placement depths 5 cm and 15 cm were investigated the main objectives of this study were to i analyze the straw n release dynamics during the straw decomposition process and ii quantify the fate of straw derived n in a rice soil system under different irrigation and straw placement depths 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was conducted in the 2018 and 2019 rice seasons at the state key station for irrigation experiment the station 127 40 45 e 46 57 28 n is located in heping irrigation district heilongjiang province northeast china

2019 and lasted for two rice seasons the daily maximum air temperature minimum temperature and precipitation during this period are shown in fig 2 this experiment was conducted using in situ independent plots each with dimensions of 0 8 m l 0 6 m w 0 5 m h these independent plots were constructed by inserting the steel wall vertically into the paddy field before transplanting the experiment consisted of two irrigation regimes and two straw placement depths in a full factorial design the experimental treatments were i controlled irrigation shallow straw return 5 cm depth csd1 ii controlled irrigation deep straw return 15 cm depth csd2 iii flooded irrigation shallow straw return 5 cm depth fsd1 and iv flooded irrigation deep straw return 15 cm depth fsd2 each treatment was repeated nine times for a total of 36 treatment plots the plots for each treatment replicate were divided equally into three groups groups a and b are tracer groups with 15n labeled straws to avoid the effect of straw sampling on rice growth and the fate of straw derived n group a was used to collect litterbags straw samples to reveal the dynamics of rice straw decomposition while group b was used to collect soil and rice plant samples to investigate the fate of straw derived n in the rice soil system group c consisted of control groups with unlabeled straw and was placed far away from groups a and b to measure the natural atom 15n of the straw and soil sample under different treatments straw decomposition was studied with the standardized litterbag method aerts 1997 xu et al 2017 according to the local practice of straw returning 6 t ha 1 18 g oven dried 15n labeled or unlabeled rice straw was mixed thoroughly with soil and placed in a litterbag 20 cm 15 cm nylon mesh bag with a mesh diameter of 48 Âµm so that water and soil microorganisms could exchange between inside and outside the litterbags yet debris of straw could be separated from the soil easily in each plot 16 litterbags were randomly placed at 5 cm or 15 cm on may 1 2018 and the marker was left on the soil surface to assist sampling after the rice harvest in october 2018 the labeled and unlabeled straw litterbags remained in the soil until the end of the second rice season october 2019 nitrogen in the form of urea was applied in three splits as basal 45 fertilizer n tillering 20 fertilizer n and panicle 35 fertilizer n fertilizers basal fertilizer was incorporated in the field at 1 d before transplanting tillering fertilizer was applied at the initiation of the tillering stage 24 d after transplanting and panicle fertilizer was applied at the panicle initiation stage 72 d after transplanting in addition phosphate fertilizer was applied as a basal fertilizer potassium fertilizer was applied in two splits 50 as basal fertilizer and 50 at panicle initiation the quantities of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers applied were the same across all treatments 110 kg n ha 1 45 kg p ha 1 and 80 kg k ha 1 in rice fields with controlled irrigation the water level was maintained at 5 25 mm in the regreening stage in other periods when the soil moisture or surface water level was close to or below the lower irrigation threshold manual irrigation with tap water was carried out until the upper irrigation threshold was reached the soil moisture content or surface water level was maintained between the upper and the lower irrigation threshold of the corresponding growth stage detailed information regarding the controlled irrigation regime can be found in reference by xu et al 2019 2012 for flooded treatments 3 5 cm of standing water was maintained until later season drainage at 7 days after the milk ripe stage fig 3 presents the standards of field water control under flooded irrigation and controlled irrigation in different stages of rice 2 4 straw plant and soil sampling litterbags were collected randomly every month during the rice season all the undecomposed 15n labeled and unlabeled rice straw residues in the litterbags were collected gently cleaned off the adhering soil with a brush and washed off with deionized water then these rice straw residues were oven dried at 60 to a constant mass and weighed for dry mass calculation and further analysis mature rice plants were harvested and soil samples 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm were collected at harvest in october 2018 and 2019 five soil cores from each layer in the same plot were randomly collected with an auger and then mixed thoroughly to obtain a composite sample per plot for each depth roots gravels and various new bodies and intrusions were carefully removed from the soil sample the soil samples were brought back to the laboratory air dried at room temperature and then ground for chemical analysis for rice plant sampling the stems leaves roots and panicles were collected and stored separately these samples were cleaned with deionized water placed in a 105 oven for 30 min dried at 60 to constant weight and then ground for analysis all dried samples of straw plants and soil were ground to a fine powder in a mixer mill and weighed into a tin capsule which was sent to equipment for analysis of the total n concentration and atom 15n and Î´15n signature using a flash 2000ht elemental analyzer thermo fisher scientific interfaced to an isotope mass spectrometer delta v advantage

to check the stability and drift 2 5 calculations in previous studies straw n release was estimated as the net deduction of n in straw during its decomposition guan et al 2019a yan et al 2019 however the net n release underestimated the gross n release because net n immobilization was often reported during the early stage of straw decomposition in the straw especially under conditions with low n contents or high c n ratios miyamoto and hiura 2008 parton et al 2007 the straw n release based on the stable isotope technique offered a precise way to gain insight into the real straw n release during straw decomposition the amount of straw 15n was calculated as follows 1 at 15 n 15 n 14 n 15 n 100 2 n straw 15 at 15 n 15 at 15 n 15 1 at 15 n 14 n straw m straw where at 15 n is the atomic

parameters were estimated using origin 9 0 software origin lab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 straw n release after the straw was incorporated into the paddy soil the straw gradually decomposed and the residual straw mass decreased gradually during the first rice season approximately 35 28 56 17 of the straw mass decomposed under the different treatments and this value decreased to 17 16 19 16 during the second season fig 4a during the process of straw decomposition straw n is released gradually by using the 15n labeling method eq 3 the straw n release was estimated as 38 76 67 04 during the first rice season and summed to 63 61 84 71 at the end of the second rice season fig 4b among the treatments controlled irrigation resulted in a lower residual mass of straw than flooded irrigation and shallower straw placement was more conducive to straw decomposition than deep placement as a result more straw n was released under controlled irrigation and shallow straw placement conditions fig 4a we also found that the straw n release along with the time t was fitted the best with a one pool model y 100 a 1 e k 1 t fig 4b table 1 the straw n release rate k 1 0 11 month 1 0 32 month 1 during the first rice season was higher than that during the second season k 1 0 001 month 1 0 002 month 1 controlled irrigation and shallow straw placement increased the straw n release rate k 1 especially in the first rice season showing a decreasing order of csd1 csd2 fsd1 fsd2 3 2 retention of straw derived n in soil the nitrogen released by the straw first enters the soil the total residual amount of straw derived n in the soil was 2 71 mg kg 1 6 35 mg kg 1 under different treatments at the end of the first rice season and was slightly increased at the end of the second season table 2 during the two rice seasons controlled irrigation significantly increased the accumulation of straw derived n in the soil p 0 05 additionally shallow straw placement is more beneficial to the rapid accumulation of straw derived n in soil anova analysis showed that irrigation regime and straw placement depth significantly affected straw derived n in the soil and there was no interaction between irrigation regimes and straw placement depths 3 3 straw derived n uptake of rice plant 15n accumulation indicated that nitrogen derived from straw ranged from 2 12 kg ha 1 to 7 54 kg ha 1 during the first rice season while it ranged from 2 68 kg ha 1 to 5 29 kg ha 1 during the second rice season table 3 the straw derived n amount in different plant parts under different treatments was basically consistent and followed the order of grain stem leaf root during both rice seasons the grain s straw derived n accumulation was much greater than that of the leaf stem and root analysis of variance showed that straw derived n accumulation in different plant parts and whole plants was significantly affected by irrigation regime and straw placement depth p 0 05 coupling controlled irrigation and shallow straw placement significantly increased the straw derived n accumulation in rice plants showing that the csd1 treatment had a greater straw derived n accumulation in the whole plant during both rice seasons 3 4 the fate of straw derived n in the rice soil system in the present study the results of the 15n isotope tracer test indicated that approximately 63 62 84 71 of straw n was released into the rice soil system fig 5 within two rice seasons in mollisols with single rice winter fallow cultivation practices in northeast china after two consecutive years 10 05 26 79 of straw derived n was taken up by rice plants and 33 37 41 62 was retained in the soil under the different treatments anova analysis table 4 showed that irrigation regime and straw placement depth significantly affected the fate of straw derived n such as remaining in the soil uptake by rice plants and loss to the environment controlled irrigation can increase plant utilization rates of straw derived n at different straw placement depths especially in the first rice season the plant utilization rates of straw derived n under controlled irrigation increased by 147 64 171 22 during the first rice season and by 53 49 70 63 during the second rice season at the same straw placement depth compared to flooded irrigation controlled irrigation also promoted the residual rate of straw derived n in the soil and reduced the loss of straw derived n we also found that placing straw at a shallower depth can also increase straw derived n utilization by plants therefore greater plant utilization rates of straw derived n were observed in the csd1 treatment however it is worth noting that placing straw at a shallower depth also increases the loss of straw derived n 4 discussion 4 1 straw n release in previous studies straw n release was estimated as the net deduction of n in straw during its decomposition following this idea it was estimated that only 40 60 of straw n was released into the soil during one rice season chen et al 2007 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 in the present study it was observed by the 15n labeling technique that the straw n release can reach 38 76 67 04 or 63 62 84 71 after straw return after one or two rice seasons 120 or 450 days respectively which is higher than the results obtained by measuring the net deduction of n in straw in the same region han et al 2020 yan et al 2019 we believe the deduction of n in straw during its decomposition was termed the amount of n released from straw underestimated the real release of straw n guan et al 2019b zhou et al 2020a because a certain amount of exogenous n might be immobilized and incorporated into the straw during straw decomposition chen et al 2021 quassi de castro et al 2021 zeller et al 2000 the straw n release based on the stable isotope technique offered a precise way to gain insight into the real straw n release during straw decomposition this could provide very useful information for the decision making of straw return strategy e g time of straw decomposition validity time of straw n release annual amount of straw return in the present study the straw n release during straw decomposition was best described by the one pool model y 100 a 1 e k 1 x fig 4 table 1 the model played an important role in predicting the straw derived n fluxes during straw decomposition under different irrigation regimes and straw placement depths the rate of straw n release k 1 is an important parameter to assess straw n release in this study the rate of straw n release k 1 for the first rice season was 0 11 month 1 to 0 32 month 1 in the different treatments which was much higher than the results regarding the release of litter n in forest ecosystems under the natural conditions observed by pei et al 2019 zeller et al 2000 this phenomenon can be attributed to the specific properties of mollisols i e high organic matter content high microbial biomass with strong activity and rich microbial population with a complex structure addo danso et al 2021 liu et al 2014a meanwhile the present results demonstrated that shallow straw returns contribute to even higher rates of straw n release under controlled irrigation it means the aerobic condition and high soil redox potential in soil under controlled irrigation favored the straw decomposition and the straw n release schmidt et al 2016 when combined with shallow straw return controlled irrigation can maintain higher soil temperature microorganism activity and nitrogen mineralization rates and provide enough nitrogen for microbial nitrogen fixation in the initial stage of straw decomposition helgason et al 2014 under this condition the straw returned to the field can quickly reach an appropriate c n value increasing the crop residue decomposition process and resulting in a higher straw n release rate it should be noted that in this study the straw residues were separated manually from the soil which might underestimate the remaining mass of straw residues in the litterbag particularly at the late stage of the experiment because of the difficulty in recovering smaller straw residues or preventing the leaching of dissolved organic matter curtin et al 2008 however this is the only method available to estimate the litter decomposition rate within soil as well as to measure the release of nutrients from litter residues in addition underestimation is generally accepted when the remaining mass of residues is used to estimate the decomposition rate in combination with modeling han et al 2020 much attention has been given here to collecting the remaining straw as much as possible through cross checking by several persons 4 2 the fate of straw derived n in the rice plant system amended by irrigation regime and straw placement depth in the present study 10 05 26 79 of straw derived n was taken up by rice plants and 33 37 41 62 was retained in the soil under different treatments after two consecutive years fig 5 these results were slightly lower than those of previous studies in paddy yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 and upland fields in other regions xu et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 this finding can be attributed to the specific properties of the study region i e a high latitude which results in a cold climate condition with the freezing thawing period for soil lasting for five months from november to march of the following year and a longer period for decomposition of returned straw a positive effect of controlled irrigation on the plant utilization and residual rates of straw derived n was obtained compared to flooded irrigation which can reduce the loss of straw derived n the possible reasons for this observation are as follows i under flooded irrigation conditions the exchange of gases between the soil and atmosphere was almost blocked a large amount of oxygen was consumed to maintain the decomposition process of straw return vesterdal 1999 therefore the chemical oxygen demand cod of flooded irrigation fields with straw return was increased 1 3 fold compared with that of the no straw return fields and was thereby responsible for the reduction in redox potential and the production of many reductive substances fujii et al 2010 this treatment may easily contribute to the toxic action of rice roots and go against the utilization of straw derived n by rice in contrast controlled irrigation can effectively increase the mass fraction of oxygen in the soil thus supplementing the chemical oxygen consumed in the decomposition progress of straw yu et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 it can decrease the influence of straw decomposition on the redox potential of soil improve the root activity of rice and accelerate the decomposition of straw which can be conducive to the absorption and utilization of straw derived n by rice table 3 ii the negative effect of flooding on the formation of soil aggregates was avoided and the aerobic soil environment under controlled irrigation enhanced soil microbial activities favoring the formation of macroaggregates chen et al 2022 ishfaq et al 2020 mohamed et al 2021 which might promote straw derived n in organic form to sequestration in soil aggregates iii some studies have proven that straw derived n can be rapidly transferred to soil microbial biomass sanaullah et al 2011 wang et al 2021 water saving irrigation which maintains suitable soil moisture and aerobic conditions promotes the growth efficiency and turnover of microbes which is conducive to straw decomposition and straw derived n utilization by microbes promoted the formation of microbial biomass n and accumulated it in soil in the form of metabolites despite all this the loss of straw derived n in this experiment the loss of straw derived n was almost equal to or even higher than the total utilization of straw derived n by rice in two seasons is a nonnegligible part which worth paying attention to it can contribute to greenhouse gas emission n2o and groundwater pollution inorganic nitrogen leaching in the present study the loss of straw derived n increased with decreasing straw placement depth under different irrigation regimes this is consistent with the existing theory that placed straw at a deep depth can improve the stability of n and reduce the loss however according to the results of this study placing straw at a deep depth also limits the plant utilization rate of straw derived n so it is necessary to further effective options for creating a positive balance between utilization and loss for straw derived n it was also observed that flooded irrigation increased the loss of straw derived n at different straw placement depths after two rice seasons the loss of straw derived n was approximately 20 19 22 46 under flooded irrigation which was higher than that under controlled irrigation the reason may be that on the one hand water saving irrigation has been proven effective in reducing ammonia volatilization and nitrogen runoff loss peng et al 2011 xu et al 2012 thus reducing the loss of straw derived n however the soil stays flooded for a long period under this condition the soil exhibits lower microorganism activity and weaker mineralization capacity due to the lack of nutrient support in the straw decomposition process the straw decomposition rate is slow resulting in low nitrogen release from the straw lin et al 2018 liu et al 2009 then the straw n began to be released in large quantities in the late rice season at this time rice cannot utilize these straw derived n sufficiently because crops have missed the key nitrogen requirement season thus resulting in a loss in the environment based on the above contents further research should be performed on changing the straw placement depth and fertilization strategies in conjunction with irrigation regimes for flooded irrigation straw should be placed at a shallow depth to accelerate the release of straw n and make the release of straw n consistent with the nitrogen requirement of crops to increase the plant utilization rate of straw derived n in addition the rate of straw n release under controlled irrigation is higher than that under flooded irrigation so more straw n is released into the rice soil system faster when combined with nitrogen fertilizer the available nitrogen content in soil may be higher than the crop requirement and contribute to the excessive accumulation of exogenous n i e fertilizer derived n or straw derived n in soil which increases the risk of exogenous n loss liu et al 2014b 5 conclusions the straw n release dynamics and its derived n fate in a rice soil system based on the stable isotope technique offered a precise way to gain insight into the real straw n release during straw decomposition the straw n release can reach 38 76 67 04 or 63 62 84 71 after straw return after one or two rice seasons irrigation regime and straw placement depth significantly affected the fate of straw derived n controlled irrigation not only promoted straw decomposition and the straw n release rate but also increased the crop utilization and soil sequestration of straw derived n reducing the loss of straw derived n in the rice soil system our findings suggest that controlled irrigation represents good paddy management practices for effective straw derived n utilization in addition placing straw at a shallower depth can further promote straw decomposition and straw n release however it is worth noting that this may also enhance the loss of straw derived n it is necessary to further effective options for creating a positive balance between utilization and loss for straw derived n declaration of competing interest the authors

9316,nitrate no3 n loss by runoff from agricultural lands causes substantial soil fertility loss and water quality degradation in downstream aquatic systems rainfall fertilization and cultivation direction are key factors influencing no3 n loss in runoff from sloping croplands however these effects are still elusive the responses of runoff no3 n and total nitrogen tn losses to rainfall amount fertilization and cultivation direction were studied under more than 100 natural rainfall events occurring between 2008 and 2020 in sloping croplands five treatments three replications for each including ck no fertilizer downslope cultivation t1 combined manure and chemical fertilizers downslope cultivation t2 chemical fertilizer downslope cultivation t3 1 5 fold chemical fertilizer downslope cultivation and t4 chemical fertilizer contour cultivation were deployed on fifteen plots 8 m long 4 m wide for each the results showed that runoff depth was 83 9 318 higher in the large rainstorms than in the other rainfall events and 29 3 77 8 higher in the unfertilized plots i e ck than in the fertilized plots i e t1 t2 t3 and t4 the runoff no3 n concentration on average was significantly higher in the moderate and heavy rains than in the light rain and large rainstorms but did not differ in these five treatments conversely the average tn concentration was not affected by the rainfall amount category but was significantly higher in the unfertilized plots than in the fertilized plots significantly higher losses of no3 n and tn were found in the large rainstorms implying the dominant role of runoff rather than nutrient concentrations the unfertilized plots presented 50 100 and 66 7 150 higher no3 n and tn losses respectively than the fertilized plots the no3 n tn ratio differed markedly by rainfall amount category and was higher in the contour cultivation i e t4 than in the downslope cultivation i e t2 our results have great significance for understanding the dynamics of no3 n loss by runoff driven by changeable rainfall features and intense agricultural management practices in sloping croplands keywords nitrogen loss soil fertility non point source agricultural management climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen n loss in runoff from agricultural lands is regarded as an important environmental impairment because it can lead to the loss of soil fertility and the degradation of water quality gassman et al 2006 cade menun et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 nitrate no3 n is commonly the main fraction of inorganic nitrogen in soils and is easily lost through runoff because of its high solubility owens et al 1984 mccracken et al 1994 zanon et al 2020 which also means a considerable loss of total nitrogen tn in soils the high no3 n concentration in waters has several negative impacts on aquatic systems and human health such as eutrophication in waters and methemoglobinemia in infants mcisaac et al 2001 addiscott and benjamin 2004 therefore it is of great significance to deepen the understanding of the dynamic changes in no3 n loss from agricultural lands to promote water governance and human life considering the increasing frequency and intensity of human activities and the changing climate rainfall is the primary factor that drives no3 n loss by runoff edwards and daniel 1993 schlesinger et al 2000 previous studies have focused on the relationships between rainfall features e g rainfall timing and amount and the concentrations and losses of no3 n in runoff smith et al 2007 ruiz diaz et al 2020 while many of these results were controversial for instance sharpley 1997 found that runoff no3 n concentration was not affected by rainfall timing while eghball et al 2002 suggested that runoff no3 n concentration significantly increased when rainfall occurred after fertilization the dynamics of runoff no3 n loss are highly complex and affected by the variable natural rainfall events ramos and martÃ­nez casasnovas 2006 jia et al 2007 udawatta et al 2006 concluded that small rainfall events generated higher no3 n concentrations and lower losses than large rainfall events and the antecedent soil moisture rainfall amount and fertilization all jointly determined these no3 n dynamics although great efforts have been made on the changes in no3 n concentration and loss affected by rainfall runoff zhu et al 2009 cui et al 2020 these characteristics under natural rainfall events presenting changeable features such as the abovementioned rainfall timing and amount are still unclear and long term data are undoubtedly needed over the past decades chemical fertilizers have played a pivotal role in increasing soil fertility and crop production to satisfy rapid population growth abdelhafez et al 2012 however the excessive chemical fertilizers applied to the agricultural lands did not markedly increase fertilizer use efficiency but caused substantial losses of nutrients e g n wang and zhu 2011 manure application is identified as one more environmentally sustainable strategy than chemical fertilizers smith et al 2007 the application of manure alone and the combinations of manure and chemical fertilizers not only improved the soil physicochemical properties and crop productivity hati et al 2006 bandyopadhyay et al 2010 but also dramatically reduced the n losses relative to the application of chemical fertilizers alone zhao et al 2015 tomer et al 2016 nevertheless it is also suggested that long term use of manure may also increase the losses of nutrients due to the progressive saturation of soil element sorption capacities yan et al 2017 hence it is still necessary to identify the role of manure and chemical fertilizers in affecting runoff no3 n losses from agricultural lands additionally contour cultivation is commonly recommended to reduce runoff and soil loss by increasing surface roughness perpendicular to the slope quinton and catt 2004 however the mechanisms of contour cultivation on the reduction in runoff nutrient losses are still unclear stevens et al 2009 guo et al 2019 indeed it is urgently needed to interpret the dynamics of runoff no3 n loss under the integrated use of contour cultivation and fertilization to provide an effective strategy for controlling nutrient losses in agricultural lands in this study a long term dataset recording more than 100 natural rainfall events occurring between 2008 and 2020 was interpreted to disclose the changes in runoff no3 n and tn losses as affected by rainfall amount category and combinations of fertilization and cultivation direction in sloping croplands the specific objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the runoff depth concentrations and losses of no3 n and tn and the no3 n tn ratio under different rainfall amount categories and combinations of fertilization and cultivation direction and 2 identify the relationships between these n variables and rainfall amount as well as runoff depth 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at the soil and water conservation science park of southwest university 106 24 20 e 29 48 42 n beibei district chongqing municipality city southwest china fig 1 the study site has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1100 mm an annual average temperature of 18 3 c fig 2 average relative humidity of 80 5 sunshine of 1270 h and a frost free period of 334 days the overlying soil is classified as purple soil in terms of the chinese soil taxonomic classification equivalent to the entisols in usda taxonomy liu et al 2009 the soil physicochemical properties before the implementation of the study were as follows 5 08 g kg 1 organic carbon 0 76 g kg 1 total nitrogen 0 68 g kg 1 total phosphorus 24 19 mg kg 1 ammonium nitrogen 19 51 mg kg 1 nitrate nitrogen 18 29 mg kg 1 available phosphorus 71 39 mg kg 1 available potassium and a ph value of 8 16 in the top 0 20 cm soil depth the prevailing plant community is evergreen broadleaved forest and traditionally the dominant crops are winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l 2 2 experimental treatments to unravel the effects of rainfall amount category and combined fertilization and cultivation direction on the runoff no3 n loss five treatments three replications for each corresponding to fifteen plots 8 m in length 4 m in width were set on the 15 sloping cropland in the experimental site fig 1 and multiple rainfall and runoff events were recorded from 2008 to 2020 the treatments were ck no fertilizer downslope cultivation t1 combined manure and chemical fertilizers downslope cultivation t2 chemical fertilizer downslope cultivation t3 1 5 fold chemical fertilizer downslope cultivation and t4 chemical fertilizer contour cultivation for t4 the contour cultivation was characterized by 5 8 cm ridge height 40 50 cm width and 40 cm away from the ridge each plot was surrounded by cement brick walls that were 25 cm in width and extended 20 cm above ground and 30 cm below ground to avoid the exchange of water and nutrients between the plots runoff and sediment for each plot were collected using a cement brick tank with a volume of 1 8 m3 1 5 m in length 1 2 in width 1 m in height a v shaped collecting trough was used to drain the runoff and sediment from the plot to the collecting tank by a plastic pipe the winter wheat and summer maize rotations were adopted as the cropping system in each plot the winter wheat was planted in november and harvested in may of the following year the basal fertilizer for wheat was applied before sowing in november and the top dressing fertilizer was applied in late january or early february of the following year summer maize was first sown on flat farmland in march and then transplanted in early april and harvested in august the basal fertilizer for maize was applied before transplanting in early april and top dressing fertilizer was applied in early may the applied chemical fertilizers were urea 46 4 n calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and potassium chloride 60 k2o the swine manure containing 4 31 c 0 24 n 0 17 p2o5 and 0 21 k2o was applied as basal fertilizer for wheat and basal fertilizer and top dressing fertilizer for maize the rotation schemes and annual nutrient inputs of applied chemical fertilizers and manure were consistent over the experimental years and represented the local agricultural management practices table 1 additionally since rain fed farming is a local agricultural management practice wang and zhu 2011 irrigation management was not conducted during the whole period of winter wheat and summer maize rotation in the study plots 2 3 sampling and measurements after each runoff event the volume of runoff and sediment in each collection tank was measured then the mixture of runoff and sediment was sampled at different depths of the tank using two prewashed polyethylene bottles 500 ml after mixing thoroughly and the remaining sample was cleaned up the collected samples were immediately delivered to the laboratory and stored in the dark using a 4 c refrigerator within 2 h one bottle of the sample was allowed to settle to separate the sediment from the water and the runoff depth was determined by the measured runoff volume divided by the plot area the other bottle was divided into two portions one of those was unfiltered to assay for tn concentration and the other was filtered through 0 45 Âµm water filtration membranes to measure no3 n concentration the concentrations of tn and no3 n were determined using alkaline potassium persulfate digestion ultraviolet spectrophotometry and dual wavelength ultraviolet spectrophotometry 220 nm and 275 nm respectively on a uv 5100b spectrophotometer shanghai yuanxi instrument china all of these procedures including sampling storage filtration and chemical analysis were implemented within 24 h in terms of the standard chinese protocols sepac 1997 in addition the rainfall events producing runoff were categorized into light rain 9 9 mm moderate rain 10 24 9 mm heavy rain 25 49 9 mm rainstorms 50 99 9 mm and large rainstorms 100 mm according to china national standard gb t 28592 2012 gaqs and iqppc 2012 2 4 statistical analysis a kolmogorov smirnov k s test was used to test the normality of variables and the log10 transformation was conducted when the data were not normally distributed one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s hsd post hoc test was used to determine the effects of different treatments on runoff depth no3 n and tn concentrations and losses and no3 n tn regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between rainfall and runoff depth as well as those n variables the regression lines for above relationships excluding those related to no3 n tn were forced to pass through the origin as there would be no runoff and nutrient loss when there was no rainfall a probability level of 0 05 was employed to identify the statistically significant differences in this study the abovementioned statistical analyses were all performed using ibm spss statistics 22 0 for windows 3 results 3 1 rainfall and runoff events a total of 107 rainfall events producing runoff water in all plots were compiled in this study fig 3a the rainfall amount of these runoff events presented a weak normal distribution fig 3b varying from 6 mm july 12 2020 to 128 mm june 30 2015 with a median of 34 mm and a mean of 41 23 24 96 mm fig 3e additionally these rainfall events producing runoff could be categorized into 3 light rains 24 moderate rains 51 heavy rains 24 rainstorms and 5 large rainstorms accounting for 2 8 22 4 47 7 22 4 and 4 7 of the compiled runoff events respectively table 2 3 2 runoff depth characteristics the runoff depth was always significantly higher in the large rainstorms than in other rainfall amount categories p 0 000 of which overall there were no significant differences in runoff depth among each other for each treatment table 2 on average the runoff depth was the highest in the large rainstorms which was 144 318 213 and 83 9 higher than that in the light rain moderate rain heavy rain and rainstorms respectively p 0 000 table 2 meanwhile the runoff depth also varied significantly among the five treatments p 0 000 and was highest in ck 4 41 3 48 mm which was 44 1 34 5 29 3 and 77 8 higher than that in t1 3 06 2 43 mm t2 3 28 2 59 mm t3 3 41 2 68 mm and t4 2 48 2 39 mm respectively fig 4a 3 3 no3 n and tn concentrations in runoff the no3 n concentration in runoff was not significantly different among the rainfall amount categories for each treatment p 0 077 0 495 table 2 on average the moderate rain produced similar no3 n concentrations in runoff with the heavy rain and rainstorms and was 190 and 129 higher than that in the light rain and large rainstorms respectively p 0 000 moreover the no3 n concentration in runoff was also not significantly different among the five treatments p 0 194 fig 4b the tn concentration in runoff was not significantly affected by the rainfall amount categories across all treatments p 0 647 0 999 table 2 however it was significantly different in those five treatments p 0 000 and showed the highest 7 33 6 46 mg l 1 in ck which was 17 7 22 8 32 1 and 37 higher than that in t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively fig 4c 3 4 no3 n and tn losses and their stoichiometry the no3 n loss did not vary significantly among the rainfall amount categories in ck t1 t2 and t3 p 0 150 0 538 table 2 in contrast in t4 no3 n loss significantly differed by the rainfall amount category p 0 000 on average the no3 n loss in the large rainstorms did not differ from that in the rainstorms and heavy rain and was 226 and 113 higher than that in the light rain and moderate rain respectively p 0 000 table 2 additionally the no3 n loss in ck was consistently 50 higher than those in t1 t2 and t3 and 100 higher than that in t4 p 0 000 fig 4d the tn loss did not significantly differ among the rainfall amount categories in ck p 0 054 and t1 p 0 056 however for t2 t3 and t4 tn loss always presented higher values in the large rainstorms than those in other rainfall amount categories p 0 000 table 2 on average the tn loss in the large rainstorms was 265 387 330 and 97 higher than that in the light rain moderate rain heavy rain and rainstorms respectively p 0 000 in addition the tn loss displayed the highest value of 0 35 0 51 kg ha 1 in ck which was 75 66 7 75 and 150 higher than that in t1 t2 t3 and t4 p 0 000 respectively fig 4e the no3 n tn ratio was not significantly different among the rainfall amount categories in most treatments p 0 091 0 253 the exception was found in t1 showing that the no3 n tn ratio was higher in the heavy rain than in the light rain p 0 000 which was not significantly different from the moderate rain rainstorms and large rainstorms table 2 on average the no3 n tn ratio in the heavy rain did not differ from that in the moderate rain and rainstorms and was 222 and 93 3 higher than that in the light rain and large rainstorms respectively p 0 000 meanwhile the no3 n tn ratio varied significantly among the five treatments p 0 000 showing the highest value in t4 followed by t3 and the lowest value in ck t1 and t2 fig 4 f 3 5 relationships between rainfall amount and runoff no3 n and tn traits the rainfall amount showed significant linear relationships with runoff depth no3 n loss and tn loss p 0 000 0 03 for each treatment fig 5a d e the rainfall amount was not significantly correlated with the no3 n concentration tn concentration and no3 n tn ratio p 0 051 0 987 fig 5b c f the runoff depth was not significantly correlated with no3 n concentration and tn concentration p 0 051 0 887 fig 6a b but presented significant linear positive relationships with no3 n loss and tn loss fig 6c d and a negative relationship with the no3 n tn ratio p 0 000 0 034 for each treatment fig 6e 4 discussion the large rainstorms produced a significantly higher runoff depth relative to other rainfall amount categories table 2 generally soil saturation and sealing occur quickly because of the higher rainfall amount under large rainstorms resulting in higher runoff depth than other lower rainfall events jia et al 2007 however runoff depth did not vary markedly among light moderate heavy rain and rainstorms suggesting that a relatively lower rainfall amount could generate a similar runoff depth in comparison to a higher rainfall amount this result was in good agreement with the previous findings given by meng et al 2021 who reported that runoff depth was considerably higher in relatively lower rainfall amounts than in higher rainfall amounts under different land use types in southwestern hubei province china the data from ramos and martÃ­nez casasnovas 2006 also indicated that a low rainfall amount could produce a higher runoff depth than a high rainfall amount in mediterranean vineyards in northeast spain this was presumably due to the near saturated antecedent soil moisture that could lead to higher runoff depth under the low rainfall amount wei et al 2007 sarkar et al 2015 our results showed that higher runoff no3 n concentrations were found in the moderate and heavy rains and rainstorms than in the light rain and large rainstorms table 2 which likely resulted from changes in rainfall timing eghball et al 2002 smith et al 2007 the rainfall events occurring after fertilization could lead to significant increases in the concentrations of nutrients in runoff cui et al 2020 in this study high frequencies of moderate rain heavy rain and rainstorms after fertilization were recorded leading to relatively higher no3 n concentrations in runoff there were no significant differences in tn concentration across all rainfall amount categories this was possibly attributed to the dilution effects of more runoff under the high rainfall events edwards and daniel 1993 xue et al 2014 also suggested that flooded runoff water could lower the tn concentration in the wet season and narrow the difference from that in the dry season in a rice wheat rotation system the losses of no3 n and tn showed different responses to the rainfall amount category compared to the concentrations of no3 n and tn in runoff table 2 higher losses for no3 n and tn under high rainfall events were found suggesting that no3 n and tn losses were mostly dependent on runoff rather than their concentrations schlesinger et al 2000 this was in good agreement with the findings by udawatta et al 2006 who found that large runoff events caused substantial losses of no3 n and tn though the concentrations of no3 n and tn were relatively lower in these cases the change in the no3 n tn ratio affected by the rainfall amount category was similar to that of the no3 n concentration showing a higher no3 n tn ratio in the moderate rain heavy rain and rainstorms than in other rainfall events the rainfall timing and frequency were responsible for these changes tomer et al 2016 furthermore this result also implied that compared to the sporadic episodes of large rainstorms the high frequency rainfall events i e mediate rain heavy rain and rainstorms that jointly accounted for 92 5 of the total rainfall events producing runoff are possibly more detrimental to aquatic environments owens et al 1984 wang and zhu 2011 this was attributed to the no3 n which accounts for a high proportion of tn under these high frequency rainfall events had more potential to be transported into downstream aquatic ecosystems mccracken et al 1994 zhu et al 2009 the unfertilized plots showed significantly higher runoff depths than the fertilized plots which did not differ in runoff depths among the different fertilizer types and application rates fig 4 this finding suggested that fertilization could decrease runoff production which was probably ascribed to the improvement of soil physical properties such as porosity and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity under fertilization management hati et al 2006 dhiman et al 2019 causing an increase in runoff infiltration pittman et al 2020 fertilization also increased the crop biomass and expanded the vegetation coverage and thus caused increases in rainfall interception and dissipation of raindrop kinetic energy resulting in a decline in runoff production castillo et al 1997 tang et al 2021 it was noted that the combined use of manure and chemical fertilizers seemed to lower runoff depth more effectively than the application of chemical fertilizers alone fig 4 this was attributed to the more effective improvement of soil physical properties and crop biomass under the combination of manure and chemical fertilizers chakraborty et al 2010 guo et al 2016 this was also favored by the previous findings by bandyopadhyay et al 2010 who suggested that the integrated use of manure and chemical fertilizers was more conducive to improving soil physical properties and increasing soybean productivity in vertisols in addition contour cultivation significantly lowered runoff depth compared to downslope cultivation largely due to the increase in surface roughness under contour cultivation which reduced runoff velocity and prolonged the infiltration process quinton and catt 2004 stevens et al 2009 the no3 n concentration did not differ among the five treatments while no3 n loss was significantly higher in the unfertilized plots than in the fertilized plots the tn concentration and its loss varied consistently with the treatments presenting both values that were pronouncedly higher in the unfertilized plots than in the fertilized plots fig 4 these results were similar to the previous findings by jia et al 2007 who found that the application of nitrogen fertilizer did not differ the runoff no3 n concentration in the purple hillslope china zanon et al 2020 also found that the no3 n concentration and loss were not remarkably different between the treatments with and without liquid dairy manure application for twelve years and tn concentration showed the same trend while tn loss varied significantly the different responses of no3 n and tn concentrations and losses to these treatments were also reflected by the variations in the no3 n tn ratio in this study fig 4 the no3 n tn ratio did not vary significantly between plots with downslope cultivation at the same site as our study du et al 2021 calculated the annual average concentration and loss of no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and tn during 2008 2018 and showed the range of nh4 n tn 0 07 0 08 and no3 n tn 0 17 0 18 for these treatments this was further supported by the similar no3 n tn values 0 24 0 27 for these treatments based on multiple rainfall events in this study these results suggested that no3 n was the dominant inorganic form lost by runoff udawatta et al 2006 zhang et al 2021 manure and chemical fertilizers initially contain more nh4 n than no3 n ceretta et al 2010 while nh4 n is quickly converted to no3 n through nitrification zhang et al 2021 causing the predominant no3 n in runoff payet et al 2009 lourenzi et al 2021 higher no3 n tn was found in the contour cultivation than in the downslope cultivation indicating that contour cultivation increased the proportion of no3 n in runoff this result also suggested potential enhancement of nitrification desorption of negatively charged no3 and ammonia volatilization salazar et al 2012 zanon et al 2020 under the contour cultivation which requires further interpretation in the future our results showed that the mean no3 n concentration varied from 1 14 to 1 32 mg l 1 in the different treatments fig 4 which was far below the limit for drinking water in china however the mean tn concentration ranging between 5 36 and 7 33 mg l 1 was far above the limit according to the surface water environmental quality standards in china tan et al 2015 these findings increase concerns about the pollution of the downstream water body and indicate the need for effective measures to restrict soil n migration by runoff and thus avoid possible degradation of water quality in aquatic ecosystems additionally rainfall amount and runoff depth both presented significant relationships with no3 n and tn losses in different treatments figs 5 and 6 suggesting that the control and retention of runoff may contribute greatly to the reduction in n loads in waters udawatta et al 2006 lourenzi et al 2021 the negative relationship between runoff depth and no3 n tn in different treatments suggested the increased loss of particulate nitrogen under high rainfall events zanon et al 2020 overall our results suggested that the integrated use of manure and chemical fertilizers and contour cultivation had a greater benefit in decreasing runoff depth and no3 n and tn losses in the study area therefore based on the observed n losses in this study manure combined with chemical fertilizers and contour cultivation are recommended as effective agricultural management practices in rain fed sloping croplands meanwhile considering the potential of n loss increased in the first runoff after the application of different fertilizers including manure and chemical fertilizers owens et al 1984 eghball et al 2002 zanon et al 2020 the weather forecast in making decisions on when to apply fertilizer and preset applied fertilizer rate in terms of the nutrient levels in the soil are also recommended for eliminating the effects of irrational fertilization timing and rates on runoff n concentration cherobim et al 2017 lourenzi et al 2021 additionally cover residues or combinations of these methods are also recommended to be kept on the soil surface to increase the soil n content and diminish runoff n losses ceretta et al 2010 5 conclusion the long term dataset that recorded multiple rainfall and runoff events was interpreted to decipher the changes in runoff no3 n losses under the different rainfall amount categories and combinations of fertilization and cultivation direction in sloping croplands the runoff depth was significantly higher in the large rainstorms than in other rainfall events and lowest in the plots with combined manure and chemical fertilizers and the plots with contour cultivation large rainstorms did not generate the highest no3 n and tn concentrations but produced maximum losses suggesting that the losses of no3 n and tn were more sensitive to runoff than to their concentrations the fertilized plots showed significantly lower no3 n and tn losses than the unfertilized plots the no3 n tn ratio considerably differed by rainfall amount category and was higher in the contour cultivation than in the downslope cultivation the results indicated that long term combinations of manure and chemical fertilizers and contour cultivation may effectively reduce runoff production and thus decrease no3 n loss due to the improvement of soil properties and crop biomass our results will provide valuable information to control no3 n loss by runoff in sloping cropland experiencing heightened human activities and a changing climate declaration of competing

9316,nitrate no3 n loss by runoff from agricultural lands causes substantial soil fertility loss and water quality degradation in downstream aquatic systems rainfall fertilization and cultivation direction are key factors influencing no3 n loss in runoff from sloping croplands however these effects are still elusive the responses of runoff no3 n and total nitrogen tn losses to rainfall amount fertilization and cultivation direction were studied under more than 100 natural rainfall events occurring between 2008 and 2020 in sloping croplands five treatments three replications for each including ck no fertilizer downslope cultivation t1 combined manure and chemical fertilizers downslope cultivation t2 chemical fertilizer downslope cultivation t3 1 5 fold chemical fertilizer downslope cultivation and t4 chemical fertilizer contour cultivation were deployed on fifteen plots 8 m long 4 m wide for each the results showed that runoff depth was 83 9 318 higher in the large rainstorms than in the other rainfall events and 29 3 77 8 higher in the unfertilized plots i e ck than in the fertilized plots i e t1 t2 t3 and t4 the runoff no3 n concentration on average was significantly higher in the moderate and heavy rains than in the light rain and large rainstorms but did not differ in these five treatments conversely the average tn concentration was not affected by the rainfall amount category but was significantly higher in the unfertilized plots than in the fertilized plots significantly higher losses of no3 n and tn were found in the large rainstorms implying the dominant role of runoff rather than nutrient concentrations the unfertilized plots presented 50 100 and 66 7 150 higher no3 n and tn losses respectively than the fertilized plots the no3 n tn ratio differed markedly by rainfall amount category and was higher in the contour cultivation i e t4 than in the downslope cultivation i e t2 our results have great significance for understanding the dynamics of no3 n loss by runoff driven by changeable rainfall features and intense agricultural management practices in sloping croplands keywords nitrogen loss soil fertility non point source agricultural management climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen n loss in runoff from agricultural lands is regarded as an important environmental impairment because it can lead to the loss of soil fertility and the degradation of water quality gassman et al 2006 cade menun et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 nitrate no3 n is commonly the main fraction of inorganic nitrogen in soils and is easily lost through runoff because of its high solubility owens et al 1984 mccracken et al 1994 zanon et al 2020 which also means a considerable loss of total nitrogen tn in soils the high no3 n concentration in waters has several negative impacts on aquatic systems and human health such as eutrophication in waters and methemoglobinemia in infants mcisaac et al 2001 addiscott and benjamin 2004 therefore it is of great significance to deepen the understanding of the dynamic changes in no3 n loss from agricultural lands to promote water governance and human life considering the increasing frequency and intensity of human activities and the changing climate rainfall is the primary factor that drives no3 n loss by runoff edwards and

large rainfall events and the antecedent soil moisture rainfall amount and fertilization all jointly determined these no3 n dynamics although great efforts have been made on the changes in no3 n

plots runoff and sediment for each plot were collected using a cement brick tank with a volume of 1 8 m3 1 5 m in length 1 2 in width 1 m in height a v shaped collecting trough was used to drain the runoff and sediment from the plot to the collecting tank by a plastic pipe the winter wheat and summer maize rotations were adopted as the cropping system in each plot the winter wheat was planted in november and harvested in may of the following year the basal fertilizer for wheat was applied before sowing in november and the top dressing fertilizer was applied in late january or early february of the following year summer maize was first sown on flat farmland in march and then transplanted in early april and harvested in august the basal fertilizer for maize was applied before transplanting in early april and top dressing fertilizer was applied in early may the applied chemical fertilizers were urea 46 4 n calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and potassium chloride 60 k2o the swine manure containing 4 31 c 0 24 n 0 17 p2o5 and 0 21 k2o was applied as basal fertilizer for wheat and basal fertilizer and top dressing fertilizer for maize the rotation schemes and annual nutrient inputs of applied chemical fertilizers and manure were consistent over the experimental years and represented the local agricultural management practices table 1 additionally since rain fed farming is a local agricultural management practice wang and zhu 2011 irrigation management was not conducted during the whole period of winter wheat and summer maize rotation in the study plots 2 3 sampling and measurements after each runoff event the volume of runoff and sediment in each collection tank was measured then the mixture of runoff and sediment was sampled at different depths of the tank using two prewashed polyethylene bottles 500 ml after mixing thoroughly and the remaining sample was cleaned up the collected samples were immediately delivered to the laboratory and stored in the dark using a 4 c refrigerator within 2 h one bottle of the sample was allowed to settle to separate the sediment from the water and the runoff depth was determined by the measured runoff volume divided by the plot area the other bottle was divided into two portions one of those was unfiltered to assay for tn concentration and the other was filtered through 0 45 Âµm water filtration membranes to measure no3 n concentration the concentrations of tn and no3 n were determined using alkaline potassium persulfate digestion ultraviolet spectrophotometry and dual wavelength ultraviolet spectrophotometry 220 nm and 275 nm respectively on a uv 5100b spectrophotometer shanghai yuanxi instrument china all of these procedures including sampling storage filtration and chemical analysis were implemented within 24 h in terms of the standard chinese protocols sepac 1997 in addition the rainfall events producing runoff were categorized into light rain 9 9 mm moderate rain 10 24 9 mm heavy rain 25 49 9 mm rainstorms 50 99 9 mm and large rainstorms 100 mm according to china national standard gb t 28592 2012 gaqs and iqppc 2012 2 4 statistical analysis a kolmogorov smirnov k s test was used to test the normality of variables and the log10 transformation was conducted when the data were not normally distributed one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s hsd post hoc test was used to determine the effects of different treatments on runoff depth no3 n and tn concentrations and losses and no3 n tn regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between rainfall and runoff depth as well as those n variables the regression lines for above relationships excluding those related to no3 n tn were forced to pass through the origin as there would be no runoff and nutrient loss when there was no rainfall a probability level of 0 05 was employed to identify the statistically significant differences in this study the abovementioned statistical analyses were all performed using ibm spss statistics 22 0 for windows 3 results 3 1 rainfall and runoff events a total of 107 rainfall events producing runoff water in all plots were compiled in this study fig 3a the rainfall amount of these runoff events presented a weak normal distribution fig 3b varying from 6 mm july 12 2020 to 128 mm june 30 2015 with a median of 34 mm and a mean of 41 23 24 96 mm fig 3e additionally these rainfall events producing runoff could be categorized into 3 light rains 24 moderate rains 51 heavy rains 24 rainstorms and 5 large rainstorms accounting for 2 8 22 4 47 7 22 4 and 4 7 of the compiled runoff events respectively table 2 3 2 runoff depth characteristics the runoff depth was always significantly higher in the large rainstorms than in other rainfall amount categories p 0 000 of which overall there were no significant differences in runoff depth among each other for each treatment table 2 on average the runoff depth was the highest in the large rainstorms which was 144 318 213 and 83 9 higher than that in the light rain moderate rain heavy rain and rainstorms respectively p 0 000 table 2 meanwhile the runoff depth also varied significantly among the five treatments p 0 000 and was highest in ck 4 41 3 48 mm which was 44 1 34 5 29 3 and 77 8 higher than that in t1 3 06 2 43 mm t2 3 28 2 59 mm t3 3 41 2 68 mm and t4 2 48 2 39 mm respectively fig 4a 3 3 no3 n and tn concentrations in runoff the no3 n concentration in runoff was not significantly different among the rainfall amount categories for each treatment p 0 077 0 495 table 2 on average the moderate rain produced similar no3 n concentrations in runoff with the heavy rain and rainstorms and was 190 and 129 higher than that in the light rain and large rainstorms respectively p 0 000 moreover the no3 n concentration in runoff was also not significantly different among the five treatments p 0 194 fig 4b the tn concentration in runoff was not significantly affected by the rainfall amount categories across all treatments p 0 647 0 999 table 2 however it was significantly different in those five treatments p 0 000 and showed the highest 7 33 6 46 mg l 1 in ck which was 17 7 22 8 32 1 and 37 higher than that in t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively fig 4c 3 4 no3 n and tn losses and their stoichiometry the no3 n loss did not vary significantly among the rainfall amount categories in ck t1 t2 and t3 p 0 150 0 538 table 2 in contrast in t4 no3 n loss significantly differed by the rainfall amount category p 0 000 on average the no3 n loss in the large rainstorms did not differ from that in the rainstorms and heavy rain and was 226 and 113 higher than that in the light rain and moderate rain respectively p 0 000 table 2 additionally the no3 n loss in ck was consistently 50 higher than those in t1 t2 and t3 and 100 higher than that in t4 p 0 000 fig 4d the tn loss did not significantly differ among the rainfall amount categories in ck p 0 054 and t1 p 0 056 however for t2 t3 and t4 tn loss always presented higher values in the large rainstorms than those in other rainfall amount categories p 0 000 table 2 on average the tn loss in the large rainstorms was 265 387 330 and 97 higher than that in the light rain moderate rain heavy rain and rainstorms respectively p 0 000 in addition the tn loss displayed the highest value of 0 35 0 51 kg ha 1 in ck which was 75 66 7 75 and 150 higher than that in t1 t2 t3 and t4 p 0 000 respectively fig 4e the no3 n tn ratio was not significantly different among the rainfall amount categories in most treatments p 0 091 0 253 the exception was found in t1 showing that the no3 n tn ratio was higher in the heavy rain than in the light rain p 0 000 which was not significantly different from the moderate rain rainstorms and large rainstorms table 2 on average the no3 n tn ratio in the heavy rain did not differ from that in the moderate rain and rainstorms and was 222 and 93 3 higher than that in the light rain and large rainstorms respectively p 0 000 meanwhile the no3 n tn ratio varied significantly among the five treatments p 0 000 showing the highest value in t4 followed by t3 and the lowest value in ck t1 and t2 fig 4 f 3 5 relationships between rainfall amount and runoff no3 n and tn traits the rainfall amount showed significant linear relationships with runoff depth no3 n loss and tn loss p 0 000 0 03 for each treatment fig 5a d e the rainfall amount was not significantly correlated with the no3 n concentration tn concentration and no3 n tn ratio p 0 051 0 987 fig 5b c f the runoff depth was not significantly correlated with no3 n concentration and tn concentration p 0 051 0 887 fig 6a b but presented significant linear positive relationships with no3 n loss and tn loss fig 6c d and a negative relationship with the no3 n tn ratio p 0 000 0 034 for each treatment fig 6e 4 discussion the large rainstorms produced a significantly higher runoff depth relative to other rainfall amount categories table 2 generally soil saturation and sealing occur quickly because of the higher rainfall amount under large rainstorms resulting in higher runoff depth than other lower rainfall events jia et al 2007 however runoff depth did not vary markedly among light moderate heavy rain and rainstorms suggesting that a relatively lower rainfall amount could generate a similar runoff depth in comparison to a higher rainfall amount this result was in good agreement with the previous findings given by meng et al 2021 who reported that runoff depth was considerably higher in relatively lower rainfall amounts than in higher rainfall amounts under different land use types in southwestern hubei province china the data from ramos and martÃ­nez casasnovas 2006 also indicated that a low rainfall amount could produce a higher runoff depth than a high rainfall amount in mediterranean vineyards in northeast spain this was presumably due to the near saturated antecedent soil moisture that could lead to higher runoff depth under the low rainfall amount wei et al 2007 sarkar et al 2015 our results showed that higher runoff no3 n concentrations were found in the moderate and heavy rains and rainstorms than in the light rain and large rainstorms table 2 which likely resulted from changes in rainfall timing eghball et al 2002 smith et al 2007 the rainfall events occurring after fertilization could lead to significant increases in the concentrations of nutrients in runoff cui et al 2020 in this study high frequencies of moderate rain heavy rain and rainstorms after fertilization were recorded leading to relatively higher no3 n concentrations in runoff there were no significant differences in tn concentration across all rainfall amount categories this was possibly attributed to the dilution effects of more runoff under the high rainfall events edwards and daniel 1993 xue et al 2014 also suggested that flooded runoff water could lower the tn concentration in the wet season and narrow the difference from that in the dry season in a rice wheat rotation system the losses of no3 n and tn showed different responses to the rainfall amount category compared to the concentrations of no3 n and tn in runoff table 2 higher losses for no3 n and tn under high rainfall events were found suggesting that no3 n and tn losses were mostly dependent on runoff rather than their concentrations schlesinger et al 2000 this was in good agreement with the findings by udawatta et al 2006 who found that large runoff events caused substantial losses of no3 n and tn though the concentrations of no3 n and tn were relatively lower in these cases the change in the no3 n tn ratio affected by the rainfall amount category was similar to that of the no3 n concentration showing a higher no3 n tn ratio in the moderate rain heavy rain and rainstorms than in other rainfall events the rainfall timing and frequency were responsible for these changes tomer et al 2016 furthermore this result also implied that compared to the sporadic episodes of large rainstorms the high frequency rainfall events i e mediate rain heavy rain and rainstorms that jointly accounted for 92 5 of the total rainfall events producing runoff are possibly more detrimental to aquatic environments owens et al 1984 wang and zhu 2011 this was attributed to the no3 n which accounts for a high proportion of tn under these high frequency rainfall events had more potential to be transported into downstream aquatic ecosystems mccracken et al 1994 zhu et al 2009 the unfertilized plots showed significantly higher runoff depths than the fertilized plots which did not differ in runoff depths among the different fertilizer types and application rates fig 4 this finding suggested that fertilization could decrease runoff production which was probably ascribed to the improvement of soil physical properties such as porosity and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity under fertilization management hati et al 2006 dhiman et al 2019 causing an increase in runoff infiltration pittman et al 2020 fertilization also increased the crop biomass and expanded the vegetation coverage and thus caused increases in rainfall interception and dissipation of raindrop kinetic energy resulting in a decline in runoff production castillo et al 1997 tang et al 2021 it was noted that the combined use of manure and chemical fertilizers seemed to lower runoff depth more effectively than the application of chemical fertilizers alone fig 4 this was attributed to the more effective improvement of soil physical properties and crop biomass under the combination of manure and chemical fertilizers chakraborty et al 2010 guo et al 2016 this was also favored by the previous findings by bandyopadhyay et al 2010 who suggested that the integrated use of manure and chemical fertilizers was more conducive to improving soil physical properties and increasing soybean productivity in vertisols in addition contour cultivation significantly lowered runoff depth compared to downslope cultivation largely due to the increase in surface roughness under contour cultivation which reduced runoff velocity and prolonged the infiltration process quinton and catt 2004 stevens et al 2009 the no3 n concentration did not differ among the five treatments while no3 n loss was significantly higher in the unfertilized plots than in the fertilized plots the tn concentration and its loss varied consistently with the treatments presenting both values that were pronouncedly higher in the unfertilized plots than in the fertilized plots fig 4 these results were similar to the previous findings by jia et al 2007 who found that the application of nitrogen fertilizer did not differ the runoff no3 n concentration in the purple hillslope china zanon et al 2020 also found that the no3 n concentration and loss were not remarkably different between the treatments with and without liquid dairy manure application for twelve years and tn concentration showed the same trend while tn loss varied significantly the different responses of no3 n and tn concentrations and losses to these treatments were also reflected by the variations in the no3 n tn ratio in this study fig 4 the no3 n tn ratio did not vary significantly between plots with downslope cultivation at the same site as our study du et al 2021 calculated the annual average concentration and loss of no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and tn during 2008 2018 and showed the range of nh4 n tn 0 07 0 08 and no3 n tn 0 17 0 18 for these treatments this was further supported by the similar no3 n tn values 0 24 0 27 for these treatments based on multiple rainfall events in this study these results suggested that no3 n was the dominant inorganic form lost by runoff udawatta et al 2006 zhang et al 2021 manure and chemical fertilizers initially contain more nh4 n than no3 n ceretta et al 2010 while nh4 n is quickly converted to no3 n through nitrification zhang et al 2021 causing the predominant no3 n in runoff payet et al 2009 lourenzi et al 2021 higher no3 n tn was found in the contour cultivation than in the downslope cultivation indicating that contour cultivation increased the proportion of no3 n in runoff this result also suggested potential enhancement of nitrification desorption of negatively charged no3 and ammonia volatilization salazar et al 2012 zanon et al 2020 under the contour cultivation which requires further interpretation in the future our results showed that the mean no3 n concentration varied from 1 14 to 1 32 mg l 1 in the different treatments fig 4 which was far below the limit for drinking water in china however the mean tn concentration ranging between 5 36 and 7 33 mg l 1 was far above the limit according to the surface water environmental quality standards in china tan et al 2015 these findings increase concerns about the pollution of the downstream water body and indicate the need for effective measures to restrict soil n migration by runoff and thus avoid possible degradation of water quality in aquatic ecosystems additionally rainfall amount and runoff depth both presented significant relationships with no3 n and tn losses in different treatments figs 5 and 6 suggesting that the control and retention of runoff may contribute greatly to the reduction in n loads in waters udawatta et al 2006 lourenzi et al 2021 the negative relationship between runoff depth and no3 n tn in different treatments suggested the increased loss of particulate nitrogen under high rainfall events zanon et al 2020 overall our results suggested that the integrated use of manure and chemical fertilizers and contour cultivation had a greater benefit in decreasing runoff depth and no3 n and tn losses in the study area therefore based on the observed n losses in this study manure combined with chemical fertilizers and contour cultivation are recommended as effective agricultural management practices in rain fed sloping croplands meanwhile considering the potential of n loss increased in the first runoff after the application of different fertilizers including manure and chemical fertilizers owens et al 1984 eghball et al 2002 zanon et al 2020 the weather forecast in making decisions on when to apply fertilizer and preset applied fertilizer rate in terms of the nutrient levels in the soil are also recommended for eliminating the effects of irrational fertilization timing and rates on runoff n concentration cherobim et al 2017 lourenzi et al 2021 additionally cover residues or combinations of these methods are also recommended to be kept on the soil surface to increase the soil n content and diminish runoff n losses ceretta et al 2010 5 conclusion the long term dataset that recorded multiple rainfall and runoff events was interpreted to decipher the changes in runoff no3 n losses under the different rainfall amount categories and combinations of fertilization and cultivation direction in sloping croplands the runoff depth was significantly higher in the large rainstorms than in other rainfall events and lowest in the plots with combined manure and chemical fertilizers and the plots with contour cultivation large rainstorms did not generate the highest no3 n and tn concentrations but produced maximum losses suggesting that the losses of no3 n and tn were more sensitive to runoff than to their concentrations the fertilized plots showed significantly lower no3 n and tn losses than the unfertilized plots the no3 n tn ratio considerably differed by rainfall amount category and was higher in the contour cultivation than in the downslope cultivation the results indicated that long term combinations of manure and chemical fertilizers and contour cultivation may effectively reduce runoff production and thus decrease no3 n loss due to the improvement of soil properties and crop biomass our results will provide valuable information to control no3 n loss by runoff in sloping cropland experiencing heightened human activities and a changing climate declaration of competing

9317,in the hyper arid united arab emirates uae irrigation is needed for food crops because there is limited rainfall of less than100 mm y 1 in the crop growing parts of the uae groundwater is the main source of irrigation water yet it is a declining resource both in terms of quantity and quality as a result of rising salinity law 5 has been passed by the government of abu dhabi to manage groundwater extraction by limiting water takes to an amount that is considered to be sufficient to grow a given crop in order to allocate these water takes the environment agency abu dhabi sought experimental data and a model platform to calculate equitable allocations for each vegetable crop we designed simple weighing lysimeters to measure directly the water use lettuce capsicum tomato cucumber and zucchini grown in the field as well as in a shadehouse and a cooled greenhouse for capsicum cucumber and tomato total crop yields were measured via progressive harvests through to the end of the growing season the yields in the greenhouse were the highest the crop water use efficiency wuec kg crop per m3 crop evapotranspiration etc was three fold higher in the greenhouse 30 kg m 3 than in the shadehouse or field 10 kg m 3 however when the water used to cool evaporatively the greenhouse was accounted for in the water productivity wpi kg crop m 3 water for irrigation and cooling there were no differences between the field shadehouse and greenhouse so whereas the farmer benefits from higher yields in the greenhouse there is no advantage in terms of water productivity however use of alternative waters for greenhouse cooling such as treated sewage effluent could be used to protect groundwater our water use data were used to calculate the seasonal pattern of the fao56 crop coefficient kc through the piecewise linear phases of crop growth the initial kcini middle kcmid and the end kcend of the growing season these kc values were compared with recent reviews of fao56 for vegetables due to the various training systems for the crops in this study the kc values varied considerably with kcini ranging from 0 2 to 0 5 kcmid from 0 5 to 1 35 and kcend from 0 2 to 0 7 these kc values will be used in our crop calculator decision support tool dst to implement law 5 keywords irrigation vegetable water use crop factors shadehouse greenhouse data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the hyper arid united arab emirates uae irrigation is essential to support the growth of food crops amenity trees and green spaces groundwater is a major water source in the uae and supplies nearly two thirds of the gross irrigation water demand wada et al 2012 moew 2015 the country s extremely low level of annual rainfall bÃ¶er 1997 is insufficient to replenish the groundwater resource as a result the uae is experiencing a drop in water tables in many farmed locations and is accompanied by increasing salinity of the groundwater wada et al 2012 the current rate of water extraction is not sustainable moew 2015 the environment agency abu dhabi ead is mandated to oversee and regulate groundwater management in the emirate of abu dhabi the ead is committed to protecting this valuable resource and they drafted law 5 https www ead ae pages resources environmental law aspx in arabic which was passed in 2016 to regulate groundwater management in abu dhabi however accurate information on crop water use was needed to allow farmers to coordinate better the amount of irrigation water they use with the actual water needs of their crops al muaini et al 2019a 2019b directly measured the water use of date palm cultivars to assess the water requirements for irrigation as a function of groundwater salinity irrigation is used to sustain the many arid forests that were planted in a programme of greening the desert al yamani et al 2018 not only did al yamani et al 2019 determine the minimum groundwater irrigation requirements for three species of arid forest but also they quantified the value of using treated sewage effluent that could be used to irrigate the trees and therefore protect the groundwater resources irrigated open field crops are grown in the uae for food and fodder also the use of protected growing systems inside shadehouse and greenhouse structures is increasingly being used to extend the growing season and to improve food security by growing local crops for food hirich and choukr allah 2017 both tunnel house and greenhouses are being used the ead decided that there is the need for evidence based information to support application of law 5 for food crops grown both in the field and in protected growing systems fadel et al 2013 showed that greenhouses in the uae climate are high users of both energy and water they investigated the water and energy use efficiency in a typical double span greenhouse for organic tomato production measurements were taken of the energy consumed by the irrigation pump cooling pump and cooling fans along with the water volumes for the irrigation system and the cooling pads separately they concluded that cooling fans consumed about 90 of the electrical energy while the cooling system consumed about 58 of the water during the production season total water use during the season which excludes the summer period was about 5 5 m3 m 2 of the greenhouse floor under a contract with ead we have developed a prototype software tool called the crop calculator decision support tool dst to enable ead to define the irrigation allocation limits for a wide range of crops the tool combines a database of local climate variables and soil properties along with representative values of the crop coefficient kc that can be used to determine the irrigation allocations needed on a weekly monthly and annual basis the algorithms behind this dst have already been given in rosen et al 2004 and how they are used in a dst framework for the irrigation of grapes is described in green et al 2008 the crop coefficient kc is an empirical term that expresses the crop characteristics relative to the reference crop and its value can be derived from the relationship between actual crop water use etc and the prevailing weather pereira et al 2020 2021 the crop calculator dst parameters initially used default values for crop parameters based on standard fao56 guidelines allen et al 1998 however because these values are largely untested in the hyper arid uae we sought to establish parameters under local conditions for food crops this extends our work on date palms al muaini et al 2019a 2019b 2019c al muaini et al 2019d and arid forests al yamani et al 2018 al yamani et al 2019 1 1 objectives the objective of our study was to obtain new data on the water balance of vegetable crops grown in the uae under three separate growing conditions outdoors a shadehouse and a greenhouse we used weighing lysimeters to obtain a precise measure of crop water use and onsite meteorological data allowed for a local kc values to be derived to achieve the objective of better managing irrigation we also measured crop yields so as to calculate the crop water use efficiency wuec being the kg of crop per m3 of water evapotranspired by the crop etc fernÃ¡ndez et al 2020 the paper by fernÃ¡ndez et al 2020 provides a clear exposition of water use nomenclature and productivity definitions and not only were we interested in the wuec we were also interested in assessing the impact of the total use of irrigation water applied which includes that volume of water which is necessary for the salt leaching fraction and in the case of greenhouse crops the volume of water used for evaporative cooling to keep the greenhouse temperatures under 25 c to assess this we used the irrigation water productivity wpi being the crop yield in kg per m3 of water applied as irrigation and that used in the greenhouse for cooling molden 1997 rodrigues and pereira 2009 fernÃ¡ndez et al 2020 noted that a limitation of wpi using this formulation is that it does not take rainfall into account however it is apt here in this hyper arid environment as there is essentially no rainfall the crop water use efficiency and water productivity were calculated for each crop to give an indication of the value of irrigation along with the trade offs and impacts this would allow us to identify the water savings that might be achieved through good irrigation management and the impact these could have on water resources the general objective was to obtain high quality local data on the water use of a range of important vegetable crops growing under hyper arid conditions in the uae the specific objectives of this research were to quantify crop water use in the uae and provide the scientific rationale for water allocation procedures adopted in law 5 that regulates groundwater management to parameterise model inputs and to verify model outputs from the crop calculator dst software and assess its use as a regulatory support tool to calculate the crop water use efficiency and irrigation water productivity to assess the impacts and trade offs of irrigating a range of food crops under different growing conditions in the uae 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites field experiments were carried out at the research farm of abu dhabi food control authority adfca at al salamat near al ain 24 22 n 55 60 e 227 m a s l the soil type is classified as a typic torrisamment mixed hyperthermic soil ad158 ead 2009 this type of soil is a deep sandy soil with mixed mineralogy and it is widely distributed across abu dhabi abdelfattah and pain 2012 the water balances of the five main vegetable crops that are grown outdoors in the uae were quantified lettuce capsicum tomato cucumber and zucchini these crops were selected after consultation with adfca and the abu dhabi farmers service center peter ensor 2017 adfsc pers comm and they were grown outdoors over the winter period parallel indoor studies were conducted at the international center for biosaline agriculture icba 25 09 n 55 39 e 48 m a s l near dubai to determine water requirements for three vegetable crops of cucumber capsicum and tomato grown within two different protected environments namely a shadehouse and a greenhouse the greenhouse study examined both crop water use and the amount of water used to cool the greenhouse these three crops were selected for study after consultation with icba staff and adfsc the soil is described as a typic torriorthent sandy skeletal hyperthermic soil with a sand content of 90 and a bulk density range of 1 5 1 6 kg l soil ad151 ead 2009 2 2 lysimeter design actual crop water use etc act was measured using weighing lysimeters specifically designed and constructed for this project fig 1 a and 1b these devices directly measured water use from the change in pot weight taking into account irrigation volumes as measured by the flow meters drainage volumes were measured by individual tipping spoons at the outflow of each of the lysimeters the pot weight and drainage volumes were measured at hourly intervals using a data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific usa with a multiplexer model am25t campbell scientific usa the average irrigation volume delivered to each lysimeter pot was recorded at hourly intervals using a flow meter sensus model 620 which recorded the total volumes to each experimental plot that comprised 35 45 plants and the 4 lysimeter pots a schematic diagram of the lysimeters installed at the outdoor field site is shown in fig 1 a each lysimeter consisted of a 72 l inner pot that sat atop a single point load cell scaime model ag200 to produce a small mv signal that is proportional to the weight of the pot the maximum capacity of the load cell was 200 kg and the resolution was 2 g a 100 l outer pot was used to line the excavated hole that extended to a depth of 1 m and accommodated the instrumentation a single plant was set in the pot of each lysimeter fig 1b prior to planting the inner pot was first filled with native sand to a depth of 45 cm and then the top 15 cm was filled with a 1 2 mix of sand and organic compost an outlet port at the base of the lysimeter directed all drainage water through a tipping spoon rain gauge pronamic model 100 054 the drainage volume was then recorded as a series of pulses with 5 ml per tip the drainage water was then diverted into a small container located beside the main pot such that samples could be collected periodically to analyse for the nutrient composition these samples were collected at 1 to 2 week intervals to examine changes in leachate water quality the leachate results will be reported elsewhere as part of a study modelling the environmental impacts of irrigation and crop production the lysimeter design used for the indoor studies was the same as that used for the outdoor study except that the devices were free standing rather than being buried in the ground fig 1 c and 1d plant growth soon covered the exposed rim of the lysimeters furthermore these isolated lysimeters mimicked the plant growing conditions of commercial plantings and the advective clothesline effect would be real both in our experiments and under commercial growing conditions 2 3 outdoor study plan each crop was organised in a single plot of 5 12 m the plants were placed in 1 m rows at a spacing of 0 5 0 75 m to provide harvest data from 40 to 50 plants the irrigation lines were spaced 1 m apart and the four lysimeter pots were located down the centre row of each plot fig 1 c initially two seedlings were planted in each lysimeter pot after a period of two weeks the smallest seedling was removed leaving a single plant in each lysimeter thus the plant density inside the lysimeters was comparable to that in the surrounding field so that representative etc measurements could be made in the field plot the wetting pattern from the irrigation typically extended a distance of about 20 cm from drippers and was comparable to the surface area of the pots the crops were established on 12 december 2018 with three crops of lettuce pepper and tomato sown as seeds and the remaining two crops of cucumber and zucchini planted as very small seedlings it should be noted that because of experimental constraints the plant density for the outdoor crops was less than the recommended density for uae crops which is 20 000 plants per ha for capsicum cucumber tomato and zucchini and 40 000 plants per ha for lettuce field crops were grown for a period of between 12 and 18 weeks table 1 and harvested by farm staff when they appeared ready irrigation was supplied via a semi automatic system comprising 16 mm polyethylene tubing with a single pressure compensated dripper 4 l h 1 for each plant hourly volumes were recorded using a digital flow meter on each irrigation line daily volumes were also recorded manually by field staff a weekly irrigation schedule for each crop was established prior to the start of the experiments by assuming the fao56 guideline values for kc allen et al 1998 these were then adjusted in proportion to plant density these calculations used values of reference evapotranspiration eto computed using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and historical climate data abu dhabi national centre for seismology and climatology field staff manually turned on the irrigation once per day except for fridays based on the scheduled amount the average volume of irrigation to each lysimeter pot was calculated from the flowmeter data along the single irrigation line of 10 to 14 plants the irrigation water which was sourced from a 10 000 l tank had an electrical conductivity ec of approximately 1 0 ds m 1 a dosatron device supplied essential plant nutrients on a daily basis via the drip irrigation system a fertigation schedule for macro and micro nutrients was also calculated prior to the start of the study based on crop fertiliser guidelines from adfsc soil water contents were not directly measured under the outdoor crops due to unavailability of instrumentation instead lysimeter data were used to infer the soil water contents from hourly measurements of pot weight irrigation volumes were also adjusted accordingly when pot weights or drainage volumes indicated more or less water was needed to maintain adequate moisture levels a weather station was located next to the experimental plots and recorded hourly values of global shortwave radiation air temperature relative humidity wind speed and rainfall these data were used for computing daily values of eto using the fao56 reference et equation allen et al 1998 2 4 indoor studies setup 2 4 1 greenhouse for each crop of cucumber capsicum tomato a 3 5 m plot was prepared with irrigation lines spaced at 50 cm three lysimeter pots were placed on one side as noted above these pots would be affected by advective clothesline effects as indeed would be the plants under the commercial growing conditions that we have mimicked single seedlings were planted into each lysimeter and 45 seedlings were planted into the plot to yield data for all three crops seedlings were planted on 10 february 2019 plant density of the indoor crops was 4 plants m 2 40 000 plants ha 1 being twice that of the outdoor crops greenhouse crops were grown for a period of between 14 and 15 weeks table 1 the greenhouse was cooled using a combination of two extractor fans at one end to remove warm air and an evaporative pad at the other end to facilitate the entry of cooler moister air this is typical practice in the uae hirich and choukr allah 2017 a temperature sensor placed in the middle of the greenhouse at a height of 2 m provided feedback control to the fans in order to maintain a target temperature of less than 25 c cooling water was supplied from a 1000 l tank that was a closed system with an automatic refill valve a drainage channel at the base of the cooling pad returned any excess cooling water back into the tank the net volume of cooling water was recorded once per day using a manual flow meter the water use for cooling was calculated from the total water volume per unit floor area of the whole greenhouse 8 33 m2 divided by the plant density 4 plants m 2 2 4 2 shadehouse for each crop of cucumber capsicum tomato the set up of the shadehouse plot the irrigation and the lysimeter pots was identical to that for the greenhouse study the shadehouse 25 m x 25 m only differed from the greenhouse in that it was not cooled the shadehouse consisted of green netting 70 open weave fixed to the steel frame with a flat roof and vertical walls for all three crops seedlings were planted on 10 february 2019 and the plant density was 4 plants m 2 shadehouse crops were grown for a period of between 14 and 15 weeks table 1 2 4 3 irrigation and fertigation irrigation to the greenhouse and shadehouse was supplied with fresh water 1 ds m 1 once per day starting between 6 a m and 7 a m irrigation and fertigation followed a daily schedule that was set up before the study started as per the outdoor field site to provide enough water and macronutrients to satisfy plant requirements based on expected yields and crop nutrient contents peter ensor 2017 adfsc pers comm some adjustments were made to irrigation rates throughout the season to maintain adequate soil moisture contents in the lysimeter pots the average volume of irrigation to each lysimeter pot was also recorded using a digital flowmeter in the same way as in the field 2 4 4 time domain reflectometry soil water contents of the greenhouse and shadehouse plots were measured using time domain reflectometry tdr sensors six sets of three wire waveguides were installed vertically into the topsoil at a depth of 0 600 mm located close to the drip line the centre rod of each sensor was covered in a glue lined heat shrink tube made from polyolefin thermoplastic in order to reduce signal loss associated with conditions of high water content and elevated salinity levels water contents were measured hourly using a tdr100 device connected to a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific usa the logger also recorded the irrigation volumes via a sensus flow meter model 620 as well as the weights and drainage volumes from each lysimeter because the crops were irrigated to excess to ensure a salt leaching fraction through drainage soil moisture levels remained consistently high throughout the growing season with only small changes in daily averages nonetheless the tdr data were vital to confirm that enough water was being applied to each crop throughout the season the tdr data will be reported elsewhere as part of a modelling study of the environmental impacts of irrigation 2 4 5 weather station a data logger was set up in the middle of both the greenhouse and the shadehouse to measure the local microclimate by recording incoming solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and air flow these data were recorded at hourly intervals to quantify both the amount of shade and the cooling provided by the protected environments and the corresponding changes in the evaporative demands data from the indoor weather stations was used to quantify the atmospheric effects of the two protected environments 2 5 calculation of actual crop water use actual crop water use including soil evaporation was measured directly from the change in pot weight accounting for irrigation volumes and drainage volumes our analysis was complicated by the fact that the volume of irrigation applied to individual lysimeters was not measured directly rather it had to be calculated from the change in pot weight during an irrigation event the difference between plot averaged irrigation and volumes for each pot was quite large 0 25 l d 1 this would likely introduce similar sized errors into the calculations of daily crop water use from individual pots if we relied on using the flow meter records to analyse the changes in pot weights to overcome this irrigation volumes i l for individual lysimeter pots were calculated from the sum of the measured change in pot weight w kg following an irrigation event plus the volume of drainage d l during the same time interval for the purpose of calculation the following simple formulation was used 1 i i max w i w i 1 min w i 1 w i 2 d i di 1 where the subscript i refers to the time step and the functions max and min refer to maximum and minimum values respectively rainfall has been omitted from the calculation because there was no rain this calculation spans three time intervals because the value for w represents an average for each hour while the value for d represents the sum for the hour and sometimes the irrigation event ran past the hour mark the calculation in eq 1 also neglects any crop water use during the time period i which is likely to be small because irrigation was usually applied early in the morning between the hours of 6 am and 7 am soil water contents of the lysimeter pots were deduced directly from the lysimeter weights since the weight of the empty pot and the load cell plate had already been tared from the measurement the calculation proceeds as follows all pots were initially filled with 88 kg of air dry sand 2 g g 1 water content that was packed firmly into a volume of 70 l giving a dry bulk density of 1 23 kg l assuming a pot drainage threshold of for example 107 kg the volume of water is equal to 22 7 l 107 98 of 88 kg and the corresponding volumetric water content at pot capacity is about 29 7 22 7 70 0 l l 1 this calculation is approximate since it ignores the total weight of the crop which could be as much as 5 kg per plant by the end of the season nonetheless the error is relatively small when taken on a daily basis the shadehouse and greenhouse experiments were stopped at the beginning of june 2019 and the plants removed lysimeter measurements continued until the end of june 2019 and the extended data set provided a direct measure of direct evaporation from the bare soil in the lysimeter pots the daily crop water use including soil evaporation was calculated from the pot water balance as the daily change in pot weight calculated from the difference between the predawn 5 a m value on one day minus the pre dawn value the next day plus the daily volume of irrigation minus the daily volume of drainage the formula for this calculation given that rainfall was zero is 2 w d 1 w d i d d d etc d where w is the pre dawn pot weight kg i is the irrigation volume l d is the drainage volume and etc is the crop evapotranspiration which equals the sum of crop transpiration and soil evaporation and the subscript d is the day number eq 2 is inverted to generate a value for et c 2 6 calculation of crop coefficients the etc values measured by the lysimeters expressed as l per plant per day were multiplied by the plant density per m2 of ground area to express etc in terms of mm per day the indoor crops were planted at a typical density of 4 plants m 2 the outdoor crops were planted at a much lower density and so the estimates of etc have been rescaled assuming typical plant density values suggested by the adfsc guidelines for crop production the actual microclimates inside the shadehouse and green house are quite different to the outdoors because of various factors including reduced light modified temperature and humidity and much lower air flow the climate data measured inside and outside these structures were used to quantify the influence of the houses on the growing conditions such as the change in solar radiation the change in vapour pressure deficit and the change in temperature by understanding the influence of the structures on the protected environment and by deriving simple relationships with the outdoors it is possible to calculate the water demands for indoor growing based on regional climate data this will be implemented in the crop calculator dst and the operation and implementation of this dst will be reported elsewhere each actual crop coefficient kc act was computed from the ratio of the measured water use etc act and eto namely kc act etc act eto this ratio was calculated for each day of the growing season using lysimeter data for etc act and local climate data for eto then a 7 day time centred running mean was used to reduce the scatter the final step was to fit a boundary line to the relationship that encompasses the bulk of the values as discussed below a piecewise linear curve was then fitted by eye to the upper boundary lines for kc of each crop in order to model daily values of the potential crop etc 2 7 crop production and water use efficiency crop yields were calculated on a fresh weight basis in terms of total production per plot kg fresh weight per plot and the crop water use efficiency wuec and irrigation water productivity wpi were calculated as the average crop yield per m3 of etc or irrigation water applied and where appropriate the water used for cooling in terms of statistical analyses crop weights are reported as means and standard deviations while irrigation volumes were measured as litres for each plot furthermore the values from the lysimeter water balances were bulk averaged because of the experimental challenges associated with the field experimental conditions 3 results 3 1 crop yields the focus of this project is on understanding plant water use and irrigation requirements so detailed measurements of crop development were not carried out instead only the harvest weights were recorded all crops were progressively harvested throughout the growing season at times when they were visually assessed as ready to be picked in the outdoor study the lettuce crops grew rapidly and the final harvests were after just 12 weeks the final harvest of cucumber was after 14 weeks and the final harvest of the zucchini was after 15 weeks the capsicum and tomatoes had the longest growing period and were finally harvested after 18 weeks table 1 the harvest window for the indoor crops lasted for about 4 weeks with all capsicum cucumber and tomato plants being harvested some 14 15 weeks after planting table 1 3 2 crop water use based on lysimeter data 3 2 1 outdoor crops the seasonal patterns of water use representing both transpiration losses and soil evaporation by the five vegetable crops grown outdoors are shown in fig 2 the corresponding totals for the season are summarised in table 1 tomatoes had the highest evapotranspiration at 208 l per plant on average lettuce had the lowest at 57 l per plant capsicum and zucchini consumed about the same amount of water of about 122 124 l per plant on average by comparison the water consumption by cucumber was about 15 lower at 104 l per plant the irrigation schedule for each crop was established prior to planting the strategy was designed to provide enough water to meet the crops transpiration demands together with a small excess to promote a salt leaching fraction lf of around 25 as table 1 indicates the actual irrigation volumes applied over the season resulted in lfs closer to 40 albeit with two exceptions the zucchini plants drained about twice as much water as expected with a lf of 48 while the lettuce plants drained an even higher amount with a lf of 60 possible reasons for this excess drainage include an outbreak of leaf fungal or viral disease in the zucchini and cucumber plants from around mid february in addition the effects of fungicide spraying may have affected the growth and development of the plants and suppressed transpiration minor pest feeding damage was also observed in some of the lettuces in the lysimeters and this may also have impaired transpiration and thereby increasing drainage losses several other factors could also have contributed to more drainage from the field crops these include problems controlling the irrigation system at the early and late stages of the experiments with the system delivering more water than was scheduled plus while the irrigation schedule was designed for crops planted as seedlings three of the outdoor crops were sown directly as seeds and so received excess watering during the first few weeks after emergence the planned irrigation schedule used the fao56 approach with literature values of the kc values being used to generate an irrigation volume on the basis of l per m2 however the farm staff applied irrigation according to a schedule presented in terms of number of minutes of watering which may have introduced some small error finally irrigation volumes were scaled to individual plants for the lysimeters and so there could be some errors associated with scaling up from a single plant to a whole field and vice versa however we are confident these errors are not significant the data presented in table 1 and fig 2 are reliable and valuable for developing the kc values for field grown crops in a hyper arid environment 3 2 2 indoor crops the seasonal patterns of the daily water use are shown in fig 3 for the three vegetable crops grown in the greenhouse and in fig 4 for those grown in the shadehouse corresponding totals for the season are summarised in table 1 water consumption in the greenhouse was greater for cucumber at 156 l per plant than tomato 123 l per plant or capsicum 68 l per plant however water consumption was similar for all three crops in the shadehouse at around 142 147 l per plant capsicum and cucumber grown in the greenhouse and tomato grown in the shadehouse drained roughly twice as much water as anticipated with the lfs being 47 58 3 3 crop yields water use efficiency and irrigation water productivity final crop yields were calculated on a fresh weight basis and used to determine the water used by each crop table 2 for the field crops tomato showed the highest yield and the third highest wuec zucchini had the highest wuec overall and cucumber the lowest all three indoor crops had higher yields when grown in the greenhouse compared with the shadehouse the wuec of the greenhouse crops was three times that of the field and shadehouse in the greenhouse high crop yields of between 2 and 5 kg per plant were achieved with low etc values of just 70 150 l per plant there is a trade off between wuec and the total irrigation water productivity wpi which reflects the amount of water that is used to ensure these crop yields from a farmer s perspective the yields are greatest in the greenhouse and the efficiency in terms of crop transpiration etc is very high however this efficiency is offset by the impact of the need for evaporative cooling indeed the amount of water used for evaporative cooling is about twice the amount of water consumed by the plants as etc table 2 when the irrigation water productivities wpi are compared between crops and between the field shadehouse and greenhouse there are actually few differences the total water use generally produces about 2 and 8 kg of crop per m3 of irrigation water irrespective of crop or growing system table 2 as we discuss later in section 4 this is yet another example of the paradox where efficiency itself need not be a useful metric to assess the impact of irrigation on water resources grafton et al 2018 3 4 crop coefficients ground cover crop height and leaf area changed over the course of the growing season these result in differences in evapotranspiration and means that the kc act for individual crops also varies over the growing period for the purposes of the calculation of the crop coefficients the growing period for each crop was divided into four distinct growth stages initial crop development mid season and late season table 3 as per the fao56 guidelines for computing crop water requirements allen et al 1998 we fitted kc curves for the five crops grown outdoors in al ain and the three crops grown indoors near dubai these are shown in figs 5 6 and 7 respectively with these four growth stages overlaid in red the time averaged crop coefficients were determined for the vegetable crops in each growing environment and these for each growth stage are presented in table 3 3 5 microclimate in the greenhouse and shadehouse relative to the outdoor environment the greenhouse had 24 less solar radiation a 10 c reduction in daytime air temperatures plus on average a 67 reduction in the vapour pressure deficit of the air vpd there was a progressive reduction in the evaporative demand by factors of 10 44 over the eto range of 2 0 8 0 mm d 1 the microclimate in the shadehouse showed even greater reductions in solar radiation as well as elevated daytime air temperatures by up to 4 c there was a 22 reduction on average in vpd and progressive reductions in evaporative demand by factors of 35 50 over the eto range of 2 0 8 0 mm d 1 relative to the outdoor environment the greenhouse was cooled using an evaporative pad that consumes a large amount of water relative to the crops water use the volume of water for cooling l d 1 can be divided by the greenhouse floor area 8 33 m2 to represent an equivalent evaporation rate l m 2 d 1 or mm d 1 this was highly correlated determination coefficient r2 89 with the degree of cooling this allowed a simple empirical relationship to be developed to quantify the water requirements for evaporative cooling inside the greenhouse fig 8 4 discussion our study in the uae examined the water balance of five vegetable crops grown outdoors and three vegetable crops grown in a shadehouse and an evaporatively cooled greenhouse for the latter the water requirements for the evaporative cooling inside the greenhouse was also taken into account weighing lysimeters were considered an accurate means by which to measure crop evapotranspiration marek et al 2006 they were used here to provide precise measurements of the actual etc act irrigation and drainage from which local kc values were derived these data also provide useful information on the crop water use efficiency wuec of irrigation and the irrigation water productivity wpi for various crops grown in the hyper arid environment under different growing systems there have been very few studies on the wuec and wpi of crops grown in hyper arid regions in the field or even in shadehouses or cooled greenhouses the crops chosen for this study encompass some of the major vegetable crops grown in the uae where there are challenges of water scarcity and food security shahin and salem 2015 currently the uae ranks 35th out of 113 countries in terms of global food security the uae has a national strategy to enhance food security to improve its ranking whilst improving water security at the same time https foodsecurity gov ae en the uae has identified challenges that need addressing at the food water nexus vegetables are one of 18 food groups identified in this national strategy some vegetable crops from the uae are only grown in protected environments such as under shade or in a greenhouse here the dynamics of growing under cover provide for unique growth and water use characteristics which cannot be extrapolated or easily modelled from outdoor growth data we have found that the light environment and the temperature and humidity regimes indoors are quite different from the open field we have found that there was a 35 50 reduction in eto under protected growing systems the crop development can thus be expected to be delayed and extended with concomitant changes in the irrigation water demands and the impact of irrigation on efficiencies and productivities not surprisingly for this hyper arid and hot environment we have found that the yield of vegetables is greatest in the greenhouse followed by the shadehouse and the field with only small differences between the latter this higher greenhouse yield when combined with the reduction etc in the order of 2 8 mm d 1 in the cooler more humid environment of the greenhouse results in a three fold greater crop water use efficiency wuec as referenced to crop evapotranspiration etc table 2 certainly the farmers would value this increased yield which should lead to greater profitability although an economic analysis of the costs of infrastructure maintenance and cooling would need to be added in in terms of water security grafton et al 2018 asserted that increasing irrigation water use efficiency has rarely delivered the presumed public good benefits of increased water availability they reasoned that in order to improve global water security and reduce water scarcity that any consideration of water use efficiency must be accompanied by robust water accounting through understanding water inflows and outflows plus an evaluation of trade offs that is why we have included irrigation water productivity wpi as well as wuec in this analysis table 2 now when the water used in cooling is added in there is little difference in the wpi between crops and between growing systems our wpi values range from 2 5 to 8 kg crop m 3 of irrigation water applied and cooling water used where appropriate li et al 2016 presented results for the wpi of cereal crops growing in the arid hexi corridor in northwest china and they found agronomic practices dominated climatic considerations in determining the wpi they determined the wpi for cereals there to vary from 0 5 to 1 3 kg m 3 for melons capsicums tomatoes and cabbage growing in the hyper arid oman al said et al 2012 measured the wpi in the range from 2 2 to 11 9 kg m 3 al muaini et al 2019d found the wuec of three cultivars of dates grown in the field in the uae and irrigated with water of two salinities 5 and 10 ds m 1 to be 1 55 kg m 3 however they recommended that irrigation be at 1 5 etc to account for a factor of safety and to include a salt leaching fraction for their date palms then the wpi would be just 1 03 kg m 3 and this highlights the difference between wuec and wpi in arid environments where there is a salt leaching requirement our analysis here using these two metrics focuses attention on the cooling water used for temperature control in greenhouses yet there could well be a solution through the use of alternative water supplies namely treated sewage effluent tse al yamani et al 2019 showed how high quality municipal tse could be used to replace groundwater as a source for irrigating arid forests and amenity plants in the uae this alternative water supply originally drawn for potable usage via desalination from the arabian gulf could be used to protect groundwater by reducing extraction from aquifers high quality tse could well be used as the water for evaporative cooling in greenhouses jasim et al 2016 in this case the wpi if defined as just the irrigation water extracted from aquifers would then essentially be the wuec thereby retaining a three fold advantage over shadehouses and the outdoor fields table 2 these data and this suggestion merit a socio economic analysis to assess the value of irrigation in supporting the uae s strategy to improve food security whilst protecting groundwater another objective of this research was to establish local kc values that would be representative of the three separate growing environments of field greenhouse and shadehouse in the context of the hyper arid climate of the uae these parameters are needed for the crop calculator dst we have developed and this dst is needed to support the management of water allocation in this water scarce region through law 5 the inputs for the dst also need to include other factors such as planting density and percent crop cover as these ultimately determine the irrigation needs for each crop type when expressed on a planted area basis the 7 day running means of our measured kc values are presented in figs 5 6 and 7 for the open field crops greenhouse vegetable and those in the shadehouse piecewise fitted lines are shown in these graphs for the initial crop stage rising to the mid season plateau and then declining to the end of season the hinge points for these linear sections are the kcini kcmid and kcend and these values are presented in table 3 along with the length of the four growth stages we can compare these kc values with those presented by orgaz et al 2005 fernÃ¡ndez et al 2010 gallardo et al 2013 and incrocci et al 2020 for greenhouse vegetable crops in the mediterranean region as well as those published in a comprehensive recent review of fao56 by pereira et al 2021 who provided an update of crop coefficients for a wide range of vegetable crops incrocci et al 2020 found little variation in either kcin or kcmid for their range of 9 greenhouse crops which included those we have studied namely cucumber capsicum tomato and zucchini they found kcini all to be 0 2 and kcmid varied from just 1 1 up to 1 4 pereira et al 2021 reviewed a large number of vegetable studies and listed the range of kc values those experiments reported the range of kcmid for lettuce was 0 95 1 1 for capsicum it was 0 9 1 22 for cucumber 0 7 1 1 for tomato 1 02 1 15 and for zucchini 1 02 1 08 orgaz et al 2005 commented that the planting density and crop training systems have a large effect on the values of kc for vegetables qiu et al 2013 showed a linear effect of planting density on total evapotranspiration and yield of greenhouse tomatoes and that the actual crop coefficient is approximately linear with fractional ground cover our results reflect that variability and highlight the need for the use of local values in assessing crop water requirements for irrigation table 3 our kcini values range from 0 2 through to 0 5 the kcmid values we have found span from 0 5 through to 1 35 and the kcend values vary from 0 2 up to 0 7 in all cases crop irrigation was applied once daily at around 9 am to wet an area of about 30 40 cm diameter the single time averaged kc act curves presented in figs 5 and 6 incorporate wetting effects into the soil water evaporation component of etc act and an adjustment for partial wetting by irrigation has been made following allen et al 1998 it is worth noting that soil evaporation is likely to be very small outside of the wetted area the derived kc mid and kc end values are therefore relevant to the local microclimate further adjustments to these parameters are suggested to account for different humidity or wind speed such as would occur if the crops were planted earlier or later in the growing season allen et al 1998 we note there are large differences in the length of the growth stages when we compare the same crops growing in the indoor and outdoor environments we propose reasons to explain some of these differences firstly the field grown capsicum and tomatoes were planted as seeds and so the length of the initial growth stage related to kcini is 3 or 4 weeks longer than the corresponding indoor crops that were planted as seedlings table 3 these seeded crops were also quite slow to establish outdoors for capsicums the kc values did not start to increase until about 9 weeks after planting beyond that time the kc values of the capsicum crop increased rapidly until they were harvested and then the irrigation was turned off there is a general trend for the kcmid values of the outdoor crops to be slightly higher than the indoor crops we consider this to be due to an enhanced soil evaporation component for the field crops we see a rapid drop in kc after harvest and this reflects the fact that the plants became water stressed quickly they became desiccated and died in less than a week when they were not watered by comparison the indoor crops show a less rapid decline in kc near the end of the season the crops were progressively harvested over longer period indoors as compared to outdoors furthermore the indoor environment may also have led to a slower rate of wilting once the irrigation was turned off these locally measured kc values are now being used in our crop calculator dst for allocating irrigation water to vegetable crops growing in the field shadehouses and greenhouses 5 conclusions crop water use has been quantified for five major crops in the uae for both indoor and outdoor growing conditions we have compared the metrics of crop water use efficiency wuec and irrigation water productivity wpi to determine the trade offs and impacts of using greenhouses and shadehouses to grow irrigated vegetables relative to the field in a hyper arid environment if alternative water sources such as treated sewage effluent were used for the cooling of greenhouses the wuec would under such enclosed and cooled systems be three fold higher than that in shadehouses and the field in order to parameterise our crop calculator an irrigation decision support tool our locally derived values for the crop coefficients kc offer realistic values for vegetable crops growing under the hyper arid uae conditions rather than the original fao56 values or even those from a recent study incrocci et al 2020 and a new comprehensive review of fao56 by pereira et al 2021 these locally derived kc values can now be used to parameterise model inputs for our crop calculator dst to provide the scientific evidence base for irrigation water allocation to farmers under law 5 in the uae verifying the crop calculator dst against local field data collected from these field experiments will enable ead to have confidence in the water allocation limits predicted by the crop calculator especially in relation to salt leaching requirements for vegetable and the use of saline brines to irrigate halophytic crops this is the subject of ongoing research funding this research was funded by environment agency abu dhabi under the memorandum of understanding on environmental cooperation signed between the uae and new zealand governments in 2013 the project was originally managed by maven international and more recently by onlyfromnz ltd the abu dhabi food control authority and the abu dhabi farmers service centre have since this field project merged to become the abu dhabi agriculture and food safety authority adafsa declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9317,in the hyper arid united arab emirates uae irrigation is needed for food crops because there is limited rainfall of less than100 mm y 1 in the crop growing parts of the uae groundwater is the main source of irrigation water yet it is a declining resource both in terms of quantity and quality as a result of rising salinity law 5 has been passed by the government of abu dhabi to manage groundwater extraction by limiting water takes to an amount that is considered to be sufficient to grow a given crop in order to allocate these water takes the environment agency abu dhabi sought experimental data and a model platform to calculate equitable allocations for each vegetable crop we designed simple weighing lysimeters to measure directly the water use lettuce capsicum tomato cucumber and zucchini grown in the field as well as in a shadehouse and a cooled greenhouse for capsicum cucumber and tomato total crop yields were measured via progressive harvests through to the end of the growing season the yields in the greenhouse were the highest the crop water use efficiency wuec kg crop per m3 crop evapotranspiration etc was three fold higher in the greenhouse 30 kg m 3 than in the shadehouse or field 10 kg m 3 however when the water used to cool evaporatively the greenhouse was accounted for in the water productivity wpi kg crop m 3 water for irrigation and cooling there were no differences between the field shadehouse and greenhouse so whereas the farmer benefits from higher yields in the greenhouse there is no advantage in terms of water productivity however use of alternative waters for greenhouse cooling such as treated sewage effluent could be used to protect groundwater our water use data were used to calculate the seasonal pattern of the fao56 crop coefficient kc through the piecewise linear phases of crop growth the initial kcini middle kcmid and the end kcend of the growing season these kc values were compared with recent reviews of fao56 for vegetables due to the various training systems for the crops in this study the kc values varied considerably with kcini ranging from 0 2 to 0 5 kcmid from 0 5 to 1 35 and kcend from 0 2 to 0 7 these kc values will be used in our crop calculator decision support tool dst to implement law 5 keywords irrigation vegetable water use crop factors shadehouse greenhouse data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the hyper arid united arab emirates uae irrigation is essential to support the growth of food crops amenity trees and green spaces groundwater is a major water source in the uae and supplies nearly two thirds of the gross irrigation water demand wada et al 2012 moew 2015 the country s extremely low level of annual rainfall bÃ¶er 1997 is insufficient to replenish the groundwater resource as a result the uae is experiencing a drop in water tables in many farmed locations and is accompanied by increasing salinity of the groundwater wada et al 2012 the current rate of water extraction is not sustainable moew 2015 the environment agency abu dhabi ead is mandated to oversee and regulate groundwater management in the emirate of abu dhabi the ead is committed to protecting this valuable resource and they drafted law 5 https www ead ae pages resources environmental law aspx in arabic which was passed in 2016 to regulate groundwater management in abu dhabi however accurate information on crop water use was needed to allow farmers to coordinate better the amount of irrigation water they use with the actual water needs of their crops al muaini et al 2019a 2019b directly measured the water use of date palm cultivars to assess the water requirements for irrigation as a function of groundwater salinity irrigation is used to sustain the many arid forests that were planted in a programme of greening the desert al yamani et al 2018 not only did al yamani et al 2019 determine the minimum groundwater irrigation requirements for three species of arid forest but also they quantified the value of using treated sewage effluent that could be used to irrigate the trees and therefore protect the groundwater resources irrigated open field crops are grown in the uae for food and fodder also the use of protected growing systems inside shadehouse and greenhouse structures is increasingly being used to extend the growing season and to improve food security by growing local crops for food hirich and choukr allah 2017 both tunnel house and greenhouses are being used the ead decided that there is the need for evidence based information to support application of law 5 for food crops grown both in the field and in protected growing systems fadel et al 2013 showed that greenhouses in the uae climate are high users of both energy and water they investigated the water and energy use efficiency in a typical double span greenhouse for organic tomato production measurements were taken of the energy consumed by the irrigation pump cooling pump and cooling fans along with the water volumes for the irrigation system and the cooling pads separately they concluded that cooling fans consumed about 90 of the electrical energy while the cooling system consumed about 58 of the water during the production season total water use during the season which excludes the summer period was about 5 5 m3 m 2 of the greenhouse floor under a contract with ead we have developed a prototype software tool called the crop calculator decision support tool dst to enable ead to define the irrigation allocation limits for a wide range of crops the tool combines a database of local climate variables and soil properties along with representative values of the crop coefficient kc that can be used to determine the irrigation allocations needed on a weekly monthly and annual basis the algorithms behind this dst have already been given in rosen et al 2004 and how they are used in a dst framework for the irrigation of grapes is described in green et al 2008 the crop coefficient kc is an empirical term that expresses the crop characteristics relative to the reference crop and its value can be derived from the relationship between actual crop water use etc and the prevailing weather pereira et al 2020 2021 the crop calculator dst parameters initially used default values for crop parameters based on standard fao56 guidelines allen et al 1998 however because these values are largely untested in the hyper arid uae we sought to establish parameters under local conditions for food crops this extends our work on date palms al muaini et al 2019a 2019b 2019c al muaini et al 2019d and arid forests al yamani et al 2018 al yamani et al 2019 1 1 objectives the objective of our study was to obtain new data on the water balance of vegetable crops grown in the uae under three separate growing conditions outdoors a shadehouse and a greenhouse we used weighing lysimeters to obtain a precise measure of crop water use and onsite meteorological data allowed for a local kc values to be derived to achieve the objective of better managing irrigation we also measured crop yields so as to calculate the crop water use efficiency wuec being the kg of crop per m3 of water evapotranspired by the crop etc fernÃ¡ndez et al 2020 the paper by fernÃ¡ndez et al 2020 provides a clear exposition of water use nomenclature and productivity definitions and not only were we interested in the wuec we were also interested in assessing the impact of the total use of irrigation water applied which includes that volume of water which is necessary for the salt leaching fraction and in the case of greenhouse crops the volume of water used for evaporative cooling to keep the greenhouse temperatures under 25 c to assess this we used the irrigation water productivity wpi being the crop yield in kg per m3 of water applied as irrigation and that used in the greenhouse for cooling molden 1997 rodrigues and pereira 2009 fernÃ¡ndez et al 2020 noted that a limitation of wpi using this formulation is that it does not take rainfall into account however it is apt here in this hyper arid environment as there is essentially no rainfall the crop water use efficiency and water productivity were calculated for each crop to give an indication of the value of irrigation along with the trade offs and impacts this would allow us to identify the water savings that might be achieved through good irrigation management and the impact these could have on water resources the general objective was to obtain high quality local data on the water use of a range of important vegetable crops growing under hyper arid conditions in the uae the specific objectives of this research were to quantify crop water use in the uae and provide the scientific rationale for water allocation procedures adopted in law 5 that regulates groundwater management to parameterise model inputs and to verify model outputs from the crop calculator dst software and assess its use as a regulatory support tool to calculate the crop water use efficiency and irrigation water productivity to assess the impacts and trade offs of irrigating a range of food crops under different growing conditions in the uae 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites field experiments were carried out at the research farm of abu dhabi food control authority adfca at al salamat near al ain 24 22 n 55 60 e 227 m a s l the soil type is classified as a typic torrisamment mixed hyperthermic soil ad158 ead 2009 this type of soil is a deep sandy soil with mixed mineralogy and it is widely distributed across abu dhabi abdelfattah and pain 2012 the water balances of the five main vegetable crops that are grown outdoors in the uae were quantified lettuce capsicum tomato cucumber and zucchini these crops were selected after consultation with adfca and the abu dhabi farmers service center peter ensor 2017 adfsc pers comm and they were grown outdoors over the winter period parallel indoor studies were conducted at the international center for biosaline agriculture icba 25 09 n 55 39 e 48 m a s l near dubai to determine water requirements for three vegetable crops of cucumber capsicum and tomato grown within two different protected environments namely a shadehouse and a greenhouse the greenhouse study examined both crop water use and the amount of water used to cool the greenhouse these three crops were selected for study after consultation with icba staff and adfsc the soil is described as a typic torriorthent sandy skeletal hyperthermic soil with a sand content of 90 and a bulk density range of 1 5 1 6 kg l soil ad151 ead 2009 2 2 lysimeter design actual crop water use etc act was measured using weighing lysimeters specifically designed and constructed for this project fig 1 a and 1b these devices directly measured water use from the change in pot weight taking into account irrigation volumes as measured by the flow meters drainage volumes were measured by individual tipping spoons at the outflow of each of the lysimeters the pot weight and drainage volumes were measured at hourly intervals using a data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific usa with a multiplexer model am25t campbell scientific usa the average irrigation volume delivered to each lysimeter pot was recorded at hourly intervals using a flow meter sensus model 620 which recorded the total volumes to each experimental plot that comprised 35 45 plants and the 4 lysimeter pots a schematic diagram of the lysimeters installed at the outdoor field site is shown in fig 1 a each lysimeter consisted of a 72 l inner pot that sat atop a single point load cell scaime model ag200 to produce a small mv signal that is proportional to the weight of the pot the maximum capacity of the load cell was 200 kg and the resolution was 2 g a 100 l outer pot was used to line the excavated hole that extended to a depth of 1 m and accommodated the instrumentation a single plant was set in the pot of each lysimeter fig 1b prior to planting the inner pot was first filled with native sand to a depth of 45 cm and then the top 15 cm was filled with a 1 2 mix of sand and organic compost an outlet port at the base of the lysimeter directed all drainage water through a tipping spoon rain gauge pronamic model 100 054 the drainage volume was then recorded as a series of pulses with 5 ml per tip the drainage water was then diverted into a small container located beside the main pot such that samples could be collected periodically to analyse for the nutrient composition these samples were collected at 1 to 2 week intervals to examine changes in leachate water quality the leachate results will be reported elsewhere as part of a study modelling the environmental impacts of irrigation and crop production the lysimeter design used for the indoor studies was the same as that used for the outdoor study except that the devices were free standing rather than being buried in the ground fig 1 c and 1d plant growth soon covered the exposed rim of the lysimeters furthermore these isolated lysimeters mimicked the plant growing conditions of commercial plantings and the advective clothesline effect would be real both in our experiments and under commercial growing conditions 2 3 outdoor study plan each crop was organised in a single plot of 5 12 m the plants were placed in 1 m rows at a spacing of 0 5 0 75 m to provide harvest data from 40 to 50 plants the irrigation lines were spaced 1 m apart and the four lysimeter pots were located down the centre row of each plot fig 1 c initially two seedlings were planted in each lysimeter pot after a period of two weeks the smallest seedling was removed leaving a single plant in each lysimeter thus the plant density inside the lysimeters was comparable to that in the surrounding field so that representative etc measurements could be made in the field plot the wetting pattern from the irrigation typically extended a distance of about 20 cm from drippers and was comparable to the surface area of the pots the crops were established on 12 december 2018 with three crops of lettuce pepper and tomato sown as seeds and the remaining two crops of cucumber and zucchini planted as very small seedlings it should be noted that because of experimental constraints the plant density for the outdoor crops was less than the recommended density for uae crops which is 20 000 plants per ha for capsicum cucumber tomato and zucchini and 40 000 plants per ha for lettuce field crops were grown for a period of between 12 and 18 weeks table 1 and harvested by farm staff when they appeared ready irrigation was supplied via a semi automatic system comprising 16 mm polyethylene tubing with a single pressure compensated dripper 4 l h 1 for each plant hourly volumes were recorded using a digital flow meter on each irrigation line daily volumes were also recorded manually by field staff a weekly irrigation schedule for each crop was established prior to the start of the experiments by assuming the fao56 guideline values for kc allen et al 1998 these were then adjusted in proportion to plant density these calculations used values of reference evapotranspiration eto computed using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and historical climate data abu dhabi national centre for seismology and climatology field staff manually turned on the irrigation once per day except for fridays based on the scheduled amount the average volume of irrigation to each lysimeter pot was calculated from the flowmeter data along the single irrigation line of 10 to 14 plants the irrigation water which was sourced from a 10 000 l tank had an electrical conductivity ec of approximately 1 0 ds m 1 a dosatron device supplied essential plant nutrients on a daily basis via the drip irrigation system a fertigation schedule for macro and micro nutrients was also calculated prior to the start of the study based on crop fertiliser guidelines from adfsc soil water contents were not directly measured under the outdoor crops due to unavailability of instrumentation instead lysimeter data were used to infer the soil water contents from hourly measurements of pot weight irrigation volumes were also adjusted accordingly when pot weights or drainage volumes indicated more or less water was needed to maintain adequate moisture levels a weather station was located next to the experimental plots and recorded hourly values of global shortwave radiation air temperature relative humidity wind speed and rainfall these data were used for computing daily values of eto using the fao56 reference et equation allen et al 1998 2 4 indoor studies setup 2 4 1 greenhouse for each crop of cucumber capsicum tomato a 3 5 m plot was prepared with irrigation lines spaced at 50 cm three lysimeter pots were placed on one side as noted above these pots would be affected by advective clothesline effects as indeed would be the plants under the commercial growing conditions that we have mimicked single seedlings were planted into each lysimeter and 45 seedlings were planted into the plot to yield data for all three crops seedlings were planted on 10 february 2019 plant density of the indoor crops was 4 plants m 2 40 000 plants ha 1 being twice that of the outdoor crops greenhouse crops were grown for a period of between 14 and 15 weeks table 1 the greenhouse was cooled using a combination of two extractor fans at one end to remove warm air and an evaporative pad at the other end to facilitate the entry of cooler moister air this is typical practice in the uae hirich and choukr allah 2017 a temperature sensor placed in the middle of the greenhouse at a height of 2 m provided feedback control to the fans in order to maintain a target temperature of less than 25 c cooling water was supplied from a 1000 l tank that was a closed system with an automatic refill valve a drainage channel at the base of the cooling pad returned any excess cooling water back into the tank the net volume of cooling water was recorded once per day using a manual flow meter the water use for cooling was calculated from the total water volume per unit floor area of the whole greenhouse 8 33 m2 divided by the plant density 4 plants m 2 2 4 2 shadehouse for each crop of cucumber capsicum tomato the set up of the shadehouse plot the irrigation and the lysimeter pots was identical to that for the greenhouse study the shadehouse 25 m x 25 m only differed from the greenhouse in that it was not cooled the shadehouse consisted of green netting 70 open weave fixed to the steel frame with a flat roof and vertical walls for all three crops seedlings were planted on 10 february 2019 and the plant density was 4 plants m 2 shadehouse crops were grown for a period of between 14 and 15 weeks table 1 2 4 3 irrigation and fertigation irrigation to the greenhouse and shadehouse was supplied with fresh water 1 ds m 1 once per day starting between 6 a m and 7 a m irrigation and fertigation followed a daily schedule that was set up before the study started as per the outdoor field site to provide enough water and macronutrients to satisfy plant requirements based on expected yields and crop nutrient contents peter ensor 2017 adfsc pers comm some adjustments were made to irrigation rates throughout the season to maintain adequate soil moisture contents in the lysimeter pots the average volume of irrigation to each lysimeter pot was also recorded using a digital flowmeter in the same way as in the field 2 4 4 time domain reflectometry soil water contents of the greenhouse and shadehouse plots were measured using time domain reflectometry tdr sensors six sets of three wire waveguides were installed vertically into the topsoil at a depth of 0 600 mm located close to the drip line the centre rod of each sensor was covered in a glue lined heat shrink tube made from polyolefin thermoplastic in order to reduce signal loss associated with conditions of high water content and elevated salinity levels water contents were measured hourly using a tdr100 device connected to a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific usa the logger also recorded the irrigation volumes via a sensus flow meter model 620 as well as the weights and drainage volumes from each lysimeter because the crops were irrigated to excess to ensure a salt leaching fraction through drainage soil moisture levels remained consistently high throughout the growing season with only small changes in daily averages nonetheless the tdr data were vital to confirm that enough water was being applied to each crop throughout the season the tdr data will be reported elsewhere as part of a modelling study of the environmental impacts of irrigation 2 4 5 weather station a data logger was set up in the middle of both the greenhouse and the shadehouse to measure the local microclimate by recording incoming solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and air flow these data were recorded at hourly intervals to quantify both the amount of shade and the cooling provided by the protected environments and the corresponding changes in the evaporative demands data from the indoor weather stations was used to quantify the atmospheric effects of the two protected environments 2 5 calculation of actual crop water use actual crop water use including soil evaporation was measured directly from the change in pot weight accounting for irrigation volumes and drainage volumes our analysis was complicated by the fact that the volume of irrigation applied to individual lysimeters was not measured directly rather it had to be calculated from the change in pot weight during an irrigation event the difference between plot averaged irrigation and volumes for each pot was quite large 0 25 l d 1 this would likely introduce similar sized errors into the calculations of daily crop water use from individual pots if we relied on using the flow meter records to analyse the changes in pot weights to overcome this irrigation volumes i l for individual lysimeter pots were calculated from the sum of the measured change in pot weight w kg following an irrigation event plus the volume of drainage d l during the same time interval for the purpose of calculation the following simple formulation was used 1 i i max w i w i 1 min w i 1 w i 2 d i di 1 where the subscript i refers to the time step and the functions max and min refer to maximum and minimum values respectively rainfall has been omitted from the calculation because there was no rain this calculation spans three time intervals because the value for w represents an average for each hour while the value for d represents the sum for the hour and sometimes the irrigation event ran past the hour mark the calculation in eq 1 also neglects any crop water use during the time period i which is likely to be small because irrigation was usually applied early in the morning between the hours of 6 am and 7 am soil water contents of the lysimeter pots were deduced directly from the lysimeter weights since the weight of the empty pot and the load cell plate had already been tared from the measurement the calculation proceeds as follows all pots were initially filled with 88 kg of air dry sand 2 g g 1 water content that was packed firmly into a volume of 70 l giving a dry bulk density of 1 23 kg l assuming a pot drainage threshold of for example 107 kg the volume of water is equal to 22 7 l 107 98 of 88 kg and the corresponding volumetric water content at pot capacity is about 29 7 22 7 70 0 l l 1 this calculation is approximate since it ignores the total weight of the crop which could be as much as 5 kg per plant by the end of the season nonetheless the error is relatively small when taken on a daily basis the shadehouse and greenhouse experiments were stopped at the beginning of june 2019 and the plants removed lysimeter measurements continued until the end of june 2019 and the extended data set provided a direct measure of direct evaporation from the bare soil in the lysimeter pots the daily crop water use including soil evaporation was calculated from the pot water balance as the daily change in pot weight calculated from the difference between the predawn 5 a m value on one day minus the pre dawn value the next day plus the daily volume of irrigation minus the daily volume of drainage the formula for this calculation given that rainfall was zero is 2 w d 1 w d i d d d etc d where w is the pre dawn pot weight kg i is the irrigation volume l d is the drainage volume and etc is the crop evapotranspiration which equals the sum of crop transpiration and soil evaporation and the subscript d is the day number eq 2 is inverted to generate a value for et c 2 6 calculation of crop coefficients the etc values measured by the lysimeters expressed as l per plant per day were multiplied by the plant density per m2 of ground area to express etc in terms of mm per day the indoor crops were planted at a typical density of 4 plants m 2 the outdoor crops were planted at a much lower density and so the estimates of etc have been rescaled assuming typical plant density values suggested by the adfsc guidelines for crop production the actual microclimates inside the shadehouse and green house are quite different to the outdoors because of various factors including reduced light modified temperature and humidity and much lower air flow the climate data measured inside and outside these structures were used to quantify the influence of the houses on the growing conditions such as the change in solar radiation the change in vapour pressure deficit and the change in temperature by understanding the influence of the structures on the protected environment and by deriving simple relationships with the outdoors it is possible to calculate the water demands for indoor growing based on regional climate data this will be implemented in the crop calculator dst and the operation and implementation of this dst will be reported elsewhere each actual crop coefficient kc act was computed from the ratio of the measured water use etc act and eto namely kc act etc act eto this ratio was calculated for each day of the growing season using lysimeter data for etc act and local climate data for eto then a 7 day time centred running mean was used to reduce the scatter the final step was to fit a boundary line to the relationship that encompasses the bulk of the values as discussed below a piecewise linear curve was then fitted by eye to the upper boundary lines for kc of each crop in order to model daily values of the potential crop etc 2 7 crop production and water use efficiency crop yields were calculated on a fresh weight basis in terms of total production per plot kg fresh weight per plot and the crop water use efficiency wuec and irrigation water productivity wpi were calculated as the average crop yield per m3 of etc or irrigation water applied and where appropriate the water used for cooling in terms of statistical analyses crop weights are reported as means and standard deviations while irrigation volumes were measured as litres for each plot furthermore the values from the lysimeter water balances were bulk averaged because of the experimental challenges associated with the field experimental conditions 3 results 3 1 crop yields the focus of this project is on understanding plant water use and irrigation requirements so detailed measurements of crop development were not carried out instead only the harvest weights were recorded all crops were progressively harvested throughout the growing season at times when they were visually assessed as ready to be picked in the outdoor study the lettuce crops grew rapidly and the final harvests were after just 12 weeks the final harvest of cucumber was after 14 weeks and the final harvest of the zucchini was after 15 weeks the capsicum and tomatoes had the longest growing period and were finally harvested after 18 weeks table 1 the harvest window for the indoor crops lasted for about 4 weeks with all capsicum cucumber and tomato plants being harvested some 14 15 weeks after planting table 1 3 2 crop water use based on lysimeter data 3 2 1 outdoor crops the seasonal patterns of water use representing both transpiration losses and soil evaporation by the five vegetable crops grown outdoors are shown in fig 2 the corresponding totals for the season are summarised in table 1 tomatoes had the highest evapotranspiration at 208 l per plant on average lettuce had the lowest at 57 l per plant capsicum and zucchini consumed about the same amount of water of about 122 124 l per plant on average by comparison the water consumption by cucumber was about 15 lower at 104 l per plant the irrigation schedule for each crop was established prior to planting the strategy was designed to provide enough water to meet the crops transpiration demands together with a small excess to promote a salt leaching fraction lf of around 25 as table 1 indicates the actual irrigation volumes applied over the season resulted in lfs closer to 40 albeit with two exceptions the zucchini plants drained about twice as much water as expected with a lf of 48 while the lettuce plants drained an even higher amount with a lf of 60 possible reasons for this excess drainage include an outbreak of leaf fungal or viral disease in the zucchini and cucumber plants from around mid february in addition the effects of fungicide spraying may have affected the growth and development of the plants and suppressed transpiration minor pest feeding damage was also observed in some of the lettuces in the lysimeters and this may also have impaired transpiration and thereby increasing drainage losses several other factors could also have contributed to more drainage from the field crops these include problems controlling the irrigation system at the early and late stages of the experiments with the system delivering more water than was scheduled plus while the irrigation schedule was designed for crops planted as seedlings three of the outdoor crops were sown directly as seeds and so received excess watering during the first few weeks after emergence the planned irrigation schedule used the fao56 approach with literature values of the kc values being used to generate an irrigation volume on the basis of l per m2 however the farm staff applied irrigation according to a schedule presented in terms of number of minutes of watering which may have introduced some small error finally irrigation volumes were scaled to individual plants for the lysimeters and so there could be some errors associated with scaling up from a single plant to a whole field and vice versa however we are confident these errors are not significant the data presented in table 1 and fig 2 are reliable and valuable for developing the kc values for field grown crops in a hyper arid environment 3 2 2 indoor crops the seasonal patterns of the daily water use are shown in fig 3 for the three vegetable crops grown in the greenhouse and in fig 4 for those grown in the shadehouse corresponding totals for the season are summarised in table 1 water consumption in the greenhouse was greater for cucumber at 156 l per plant than tomato 123 l per plant or capsicum 68 l per plant however water consumption was similar for all three crops in the shadehouse at around 142 147 l per plant capsicum and cucumber grown in the greenhouse and tomato grown in the shadehouse drained roughly twice as much water as anticipated with the lfs being 47 58 3 3 crop yields water use efficiency and irrigation water productivity final crop yields were calculated on a fresh weight basis and used to determine the water used by each crop table 2 for the field crops tomato showed the highest yield and the third highest wuec zucchini had the highest wuec overall and cucumber the lowest all three indoor crops had higher yields when grown in the greenhouse compared with the shadehouse the wuec of the greenhouse crops was three times that of the field and shadehouse in the greenhouse high crop yields of between 2 and 5 kg per plant were achieved with low etc values of just 70 150 l per plant there is a trade off between wuec and the total irrigation water productivity wpi which reflects the amount of water that is used to ensure these crop yields from a farmer s perspective the yields are greatest in the greenhouse and the efficiency in terms of crop transpiration etc is very high however this efficiency is offset by the impact of the need for evaporative cooling indeed the amount of water used for evaporative cooling is about twice the amount of water consumed by the plants as etc table 2 when the irrigation water productivities wpi are compared between crops and between the field shadehouse and greenhouse there are actually few differences the total water use generally produces about 2 and 8 kg of crop per m3 of irrigation water irrespective of crop or growing system table 2 as we discuss later in section 4 this is yet another example of the paradox where efficiency itself need not be a useful metric to assess the impact of irrigation on water resources grafton et al 2018 3 4 crop coefficients ground cover crop height and leaf area changed over the course of the growing season these result in differences in evapotranspiration and means that the kc act for individual crops also varies over the growing period for the purposes of the calculation of the crop coefficients the growing period for each crop was divided into four distinct growth stages initial crop development mid season and late season table 3 as per the fao56 guidelines for computing crop water requirements allen et al 1998 we fitted kc curves for the five crops grown outdoors in al ain and the three crops grown indoors near dubai these are shown in figs 5 6 and 7 respectively with these four growth stages overlaid in red the time averaged crop coefficients were determined for the vegetable crops in each growing environment and these for each growth stage are presented in table 3 3 5 microclimate in the greenhouse and shadehouse relative to the outdoor environment the greenhouse had 24 less solar radiation a 10 c reduction in daytime air temperatures plus on average a 67 reduction in the vapour pressure deficit of the air vpd there was a progressive reduction in the evaporative demand by factors of 10 44 over the eto range of 2 0 8 0 mm d 1 the microclimate in the shadehouse showed even greater reductions in solar radiation as well as elevated daytime air temperatures by up to 4 c there was a 22 reduction on average in vpd and progressive reductions in evaporative demand by factors of 35 50 over the eto range of 2 0 8 0 mm d 1 relative to the outdoor environment the greenhouse was cooled using an evaporative pad that consumes a large amount of water relative to the crops water use the volume of water for cooling l d 1 can be divided by the greenhouse floor area 8 33 m2 to represent an equivalent evaporation rate l m 2 d 1 or mm d 1 this was highly correlated determination coefficient r2 89 with the degree of cooling this allowed a simple empirical relationship to be developed to quantify the water requirements for evaporative cooling inside the greenhouse fig 8 4 discussion our study in the uae examined the water balance of five vegetable crops grown outdoors and three vegetable crops grown in a shadehouse and an evaporatively cooled greenhouse for the latter the water requirements for the evaporative cooling inside the greenhouse was also taken into account weighing lysimeters were considered an accurate means by which to measure crop evapotranspiration marek et al 2006 they were used here to provide precise measurements of the actual etc act irrigation and drainage from which local kc values were derived these data also provide useful information on the crop water use efficiency wuec of irrigation and the irrigation water productivity wpi for various crops grown in the hyper arid environment under different growing systems there have been very few studies on the wuec and wpi of crops grown in hyper arid regions in the field or even in shadehouses or cooled greenhouses the crops chosen for this study encompass some of the major vegetable crops grown in the uae where there are challenges of water scarcity and food security shahin and salem 2015 currently the uae ranks 35th out of 113 countries in terms of global food security the uae has a national strategy to enhance food security to improve its ranking whilst improving water security at the same time https foodsecurity gov ae en the uae has identified challenges that need addressing at the food water nexus vegetables are one of 18 food groups identified in this national strategy some vegetable crops from the uae are only grown in protected environments such as under shade or in a greenhouse here the dynamics of growing under cover provide for unique growth and water use characteristics which cannot be extrapolated or easily modelled from outdoor growth data we have found that the light environment and the temperature and humidity regimes indoors are quite different from the open field we have found that there was a 35 50 reduction in eto under protected growing systems the crop development can thus be expected to be delayed and extended with concomitant changes in the irrigation water demands and the impact of irrigation on efficiencies and productivities not surprisingly for this hyper arid and hot environment we have found that the yield of vegetables is greatest in the greenhouse followed by the shadehouse and the field with only small differences between the latter this higher greenhouse yield when combined with the reduction etc in the order of 2 8 mm d 1 in the cooler more humid environment of the greenhouse results in a three fold greater crop water use efficiency wuec as referenced to crop evapotranspiration etc table 2 certainly the farmers would value this increased yield which should lead to greater profitability although an economic analysis of the costs of infrastructure maintenance and cooling would need to be added in in terms of water security grafton et al 2018 asserted that increasing irrigation water use efficiency has rarely delivered the presumed public good benefits of increased water availability they reasoned that in order to improve global water security and reduce water scarcity that any consideration of water use efficiency must be accompanied by robust water accounting through understanding water inflows and outflows plus an evaluation of trade offs that is why we have included irrigation water productivity wpi as well as wuec in this analysis table 2 now when the water used in cooling is added in there is little difference in the wpi between crops and between growing systems our wpi values range from 2 5 to 8 kg crop m 3 of irrigation water applied and cooling water used where appropriate li et al 2016 presented results for the wpi of cereal crops growing in the arid hexi corridor in northwest china and they found agronomic practices dominated climatic considerations in determining the wpi they determined the wpi for cereals there to vary from 0 5 to 1 3 kg m 3 for melons capsicums tomatoes and cabbage growing in the hyper arid oman al said et al 2012 measured the wpi in the range from 2 2 to 11 9 kg m 3 al muaini et al 2019d found the wuec of three cultivars of dates grown in the field in the uae and irrigated with water of two salinities 5 and 10 ds m 1 to be 1 55 kg m 3 however they recommended that irrigation be at 1 5 etc to account for a factor of safety and to include a salt leaching fraction for their date palms then the wpi would be just 1 03 kg m 3 and this highlights the difference between wuec and wpi in arid environments where there is a salt leaching requirement our analysis here using these two metrics focuses attention on the cooling water used for temperature control in greenhouses yet there could well be a solution through the use of alternative water supplies namely treated sewage effluent tse al yamani et al 2019 showed how high quality municipal tse could be used to replace groundwater as a source for irrigating arid forests and amenity plants in the uae this alternative water supply originally drawn for potable usage via desalination from the arabian gulf could be used to protect groundwater by reducing extraction from aquifers high quality tse could well be used as the water for evaporative cooling in greenhouses jasim et al 2016 in this case the wpi if defined as just the irrigation water extracted from aquifers would then essentially be the wuec thereby retaining a three fold advantage over shadehouses and the outdoor fields table 2 these data and this suggestion merit a socio economic analysis to assess the value of irrigation in supporting the uae s strategy to improve food security whilst protecting groundwater another objective of this research was to establish local kc values that would be representative of the three separate growing environments of field greenhouse and shadehouse in the context of the hyper arid climate of the uae these parameters are needed for the crop calculator dst we have developed and this dst is needed to support the management of water allocation in this water scarce region through law 5 the inputs for the dst also need to include other factors such as planting density and percent crop cover as these ultimately determine the irrigation needs for each crop type when expressed on a planted area basis the 7 day running means of our measured kc values are presented in figs 5 6 and 7 for the open field crops greenhouse vegetable and those in the shadehouse piecewise fitted lines are shown in these graphs for the initial crop stage rising to the mid season plateau and then declining to the end of season the hinge points for these linear sections are the kcini kcmid and kcend and these values are presented in table 3 along with the length of the four growth stages we can compare these kc values with those presented by orgaz et al 2005 fernÃ¡ndez et al 2010 gallardo et al 2013 and incrocci et al 2020 for greenhouse vegetable crops in the mediterranean region as well as those published in a comprehensive recent review of fao56 by pereira et al 2021 who provided an update of crop coefficients for a wide range of vegetable crops incrocci et al 2020 found little variation in either kcin or kcmid for their range of 9 greenhouse crops which included those we have studied namely cucumber capsicum tomato and zucchini they found kcini all to be 0 2 and kcmid varied from just 1 1 up to 1 4 pereira et al 2021 reviewed a large number of vegetable studies and listed the range of kc values those experiments reported the range of kcmid for lettuce was 0 95 1 1 for capsicum it was 0 9 1 22 for cucumber 0 7 1 1 for tomato 1 02 1 15 and for zucchini 1 02 1 08 orgaz et al 2005 commented that the planting density and crop training systems have a large effect on the values of kc for vegetables qiu et al 2013 showed a linear effect of planting density on total evapotranspiration and yield of greenhouse tomatoes and that the actual crop coefficient is approximately linear with fractional ground cover our results reflect that variability and highlight the need for the use of local values in assessing crop water requirements for irrigation table 3 our kcini values range from 0 2 through to 0 5 the kcmid values we have found span from 0 5 through to 1 35 and the kcend values vary from 0 2 up to 0 7 in all cases crop irrigation was applied once daily at around 9 am to wet an area of about 30 40 cm diameter the single time averaged kc act curves presented in figs 5 and 6 incorporate wetting effects into the soil water evaporation component of etc act and an adjustment for partial wetting by irrigation has been made following allen et al 1998 it is worth noting that soil evaporation is likely to be very small outside of the wetted area the derived kc mid and kc end values are therefore relevant to the local microclimate further adjustments to these parameters are suggested to account for different humidity or wind speed such as would occur if the crops were planted earlier or later in the growing season allen et al 1998 we note there are large differences in the length of the growth stages when we compare the same crops growing in the indoor and outdoor environments we propose reasons to explain some of these differences firstly the field grown capsicum and tomatoes were planted as seeds and so the length of the initial growth stage related to kcini is 3 or 4 weeks longer than the corresponding indoor crops that were planted as seedlings table 3 these seeded crops were also quite slow to establish outdoors for capsicums the kc values did not start to increase until about 9 weeks after planting beyond that time the kc values of the capsicum crop increased rapidly until they were harvested and then the irrigation was turned off there is a general trend for the kcmid values of the outdoor crops to be slightly higher than the indoor crops we consider this to be due to an enhanced soil evaporation component for the field crops we see a rapid drop in kc after harvest and this reflects the fact that the plants became water stressed quickly they became desiccated and died in less than a week when they were not watered by comparison the indoor crops show a less rapid decline in kc near the end of the season the crops were progressively harvested over longer period indoors as compared to outdoors furthermore the indoor environment may also have led to a slower rate of wilting once the irrigation was turned off these locally measured kc values are now being used in our crop calculator dst for allocating irrigation water to vegetable crops growing in the field shadehouses and greenhouses 5 conclusions crop water use has been quantified for five major crops in the uae for both indoor and outdoor growing conditions we have compared the metrics of crop water use efficiency wuec and irrigation water productivity wpi to determine the trade offs and impacts of using greenhouses and shadehouses to grow irrigated vegetables relative to the field in a hyper arid environment if alternative water sources such as treated sewage effluent were used for the cooling of greenhouses the wuec would under such enclosed and cooled systems be three fold higher than that in shadehouses and the field in order to parameterise our crop calculator an irrigation decision support tool our locally derived values for the crop coefficients kc offer realistic values for vegetable crops growing under the hyper arid uae conditions rather than the original fao56 values or even those from a recent study incrocci et al 2020 and a new comprehensive review of fao56 by pereira et al 2021 these locally derived kc values can now be used to parameterise model inputs for our crop calculator dst to provide the scientific evidence base for irrigation water allocation to farmers under law 5 in the uae verifying the crop calculator dst against local field data collected from these field experiments will enable ead to have confidence in the water allocation limits predicted by the crop calculator especially in relation to salt leaching requirements for vegetable and the use of saline brines to irrigate halophytic crops this is the subject of ongoing research funding this research was funded by environment agency abu dhabi under the memorandum of understanding on environmental cooperation signed between the uae

9318,although cotton is a drought tolerant crop irrigation is still needed to ensure productivity even in the humid southeastern united states irrigation must be carefully managed to limit unnecessary water use while ensuring maximum economic productivity to better understand the costs and net returns of irrigation and cultivar selection field experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2017 to compare cotton lint yield and fiber quality in dryland plots and plots irrigated using the university of georgia checkbook method uga checkbook at a field site near camilla georgia results showed cultivar differences in fiber quality parameters of micronaire and uniformity in 2016 but there was no cultivar difference in fiber quality in 2017 cultivar differences were not observed in yield or net returns for both years however stoplight chart analysis of net returns indicated differences in cultivar selection for irrigated or dryland production st 6182 glb2 would be a better option for a producer to minimize downside risk under dryland conditions and phy 333 wrf would be a better option under irrigated production results also indicated that broadly applying simplistic water balance approaches could decrease yield water productivity and net returns especially in environments where rainfall is sufficient yet unpredictable overirrigation affected some fiber quality parameters but did not impact the overall market price for cotton in 2016 irrigating according to the uga checkbook method negatively impacted yield and net returns in 2017 irrigation did not affect yield but negatively impacted net returns average losses in net returns associated with excessive irrigation in these two wet years were 336 per hectare for net return over irrigation variable costs and 645 per hectare for net return over irrigation total costs implementing robust efficient irrigation strategies is necessary to achieve high cotton yields reduce water usage and improve economic returns

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity has been a critical concern worldwide due to continued increases in demand by agriculture industry urban and natural habitats hanjra and qureshi 2010 among all water demands agriculture is the largest water user faramarzi et al 2010 singh 2014 irrigation is a vital risk management tool for agricultural producers enabling them to achieve higher and more consistent yields than without irrigation however water scarcity has put irrigation water use under greater scrutiny and has adversely impacted agricultural productivity hanjra and qureshi 2010 the southeastern united states has historically had enough surface and groundwater resources to meet water demand for all users the expansion of irrigated crop areas coupled with new demand driven by economic and population growth has put increasing pressure on the water resources of the region mullen et al 2009 the heavy usage of irrigation to meet crop demand has exacerbated stakeholder conflicts in the southeastern united states feldman 2008 missimer et al 2014 cotton is the third largest row crop in terms of the value of production 2 1 billion u s dollars and planted area 3 2 million acres in the southeastern united states in 2020 after soybeans and corn usda nass 2021 even though cotton is a drought tolerant crop irrigation is still needed to ensure productivity and manage production risks about 45 7 cm of water is required by cotton from planting to harvest to achieve maximum yield potential while there is typically enough rainfall in a given growing season to meet or exceed the season total requirement of 45 7 cm the frequency and distribution of rainfall in the southeast united states are not necessarily synchronized with crop water requirements bednarz et al 2002 uncertainty in the amount and timing of precipitation brings one of the most serious risks to cotton production vories et al 2021 the most critical period of water requirement for cotton is during flowering and boll development whereas excessive water from crop establishment to flowering can cause excessive vegetative growth papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 chastain et al 2016 in georgia documented lint yield reductions as large as 59 under dryland conditions relative to a well watered treatment when drought was experienced between first flower and peak bloom thus it is clear that irrigation is required to supplement rainfall to maintain cotton yield stability even in humid regions the university of georgia uga checkbook irrigation method uga checkbook is a simplified water balance approach that schedules irrigation according to expected phenological trends in total water use by the crop it serves as a guideline for farmers to determine when and how much to irrigate to keep the crop in a well watered state while this method generally maximizes yields during extreme dry growing seasons chastain et al 2016 yield suppression relative to dryland conditions is occasionally observed in high rainfall years ermanis et al 2021 hand et al 2021 during wet years unanticipated rainfall can occur after irrigation resulting in an excess amount of water available to the crop than needed bajwa and vories 2007 over irrigation can cause excessive vegetative growth delayed maturity and in some instances reductions in lint yield bange and milroy 2000 karam et al 2006 various studies have demonstrated the benefits of irrigation in increasing cotton yield and productivity compared to dryland production sui et al 2017 vories et al 2007 furthermore declines in yield and economic returns as a function of drought for cotton production have received substantial attention cammarano et al 2012 mcleman et al 2008 pasaribu et al 2021 in contrast the economic impacts of yield limiting irrigation excess for cotton production have received little attention this could be attributed to the fact that yield declines under drought are often much larger than those associated with excessive water as demonstrated by li et al 2019 for their study in maize yield loss under drought and excessive rainfall in addition to yield the amount of water available to the crop can also impact cotton fiber quality which plays a major role in determining cotton prices studies show that drought can decrease fiber quality by decreasing fiber length and fiber strength or increasing micronaire bauer et al 2009 gao et al 2020 hu et al 2018 snowden et al 2014 wang et al 2016 however limited research has investigated the impact on cotton yield and fiber quality due to excessive irrigation during wet years and the combined effects of cotton yield and fiber quality alterations on profitability the lack of economic studies on the impact of over irrigating leaves a critical knowledge gap which may hinder producer adoption of water saving technologies for irrigation this research is the first research conducted to close these research gaps by investigating the impact of over irrigation and cultivar selection on yield water productivity fiber quality and profitability for cotton production during wet years the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in southern georgia in the united states were characterized by total rainfall exceeding the 45 7 cm indicated by bednarz et al 2002 to maximize yield in cotton during these years an irrigation study was conducted with six commercially available cultivars marketed for production in georgia and to compare an established water balance approach to irrigation scheduling with dryland production at the stripling irrigation research park in camilla ga this research evaluated lint yield water productivity fiber quality economic profitability and risks in income volatility associated with cultivar selection for irrigated and dryland cotton production during high rainfall growing seasons this research is the first research to document the economic losses for cotton producers due to over irrigation with an average of 336 per hectare for net returns over irrigation variable costs and 645 per hectare for net returns over irrigation total costs it provides scientific support for the need to adopt advanced irrigation scheduling methods to reduce irrigation water usage which is imperative for improving irrigation water productivity and sustaining agricultural production in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and cultivar selection a two year field experiment was conducted at the c m stripling irrigation research park near camilla georgia 31 16 55 5 n 84 17 39 9 w to assess yield and fiber quality response to irrigation for six cultivars marketed for production in the southeastern united states the soil at the field site is a lucy loamy sand loamy kaolinitic thermic arenic kandiudults the experiment was arranged according to a split plot design irrigation represented the whole plot factor irrigated plots and dryland and cultivar was the sub plot factor six cultivars the number of replicates was six replicates per cultivar for both irrigated plots and dryland plots in 2016 and five replicates per cultivar for irrigated plots and four replicates per cultivar for dryland plots in 2017 each of these plots was 12 8 m long and 3 7 m wide adjacent irrigation zones were separated by a minimum of 8 buffer rows 7 3 m to prevent overlap between adjacent irrigation plots all crop management practices except irrigation were conducted uniformly for all experimental plots according to university of georgia cooperative extension service recommendations whitaker et al 2016 specifically the crop was grown under conventional tillage and weed management practices included a preemergence application of warrant reflex and two separate post emergence applications of roundup dual magnum approximately three weeks apart early season thrips control was achieved with a post emergence application of orthene at the one true leaf stage and stinkbug pests were managed with one application of bidrin at two weeks after flowering and a second application two weeks thereafter plant growth management practices were also standardized across all treatments where the crop received one application of mepiquat chloride 1 24 l ha of a 4 2 solution at the first flower stage of development and a second application two weeks later fertility was managed based on pre season soil tests and for a target yield goal of 1884 kg ha all p and k were applied at planting along with 25 of the total n requirement for the season thereafter the remaining n was applied at side dress between the first floral bud stage and the first flower stage as a 28 0 0 5 solution n p2o5 k2o s to also meet the sulfur requirements of the crop seeds of cotton gossypium hirsutum cv dp 1252 b2 rf and dp 1555 b2 rf monsanto company phy 333 wrf and phy 499 wrf phytogen seed company llc and st 6182 glt and st 4946 glb2 stoneville were planted on may 24 2016 and may 10 2017 at a target rate of 11 seeds per linear meter 121 000 seeds per hectare of row and a 2 cm planting depth these cultivars were selected because they had been tested in large scale on farm variety trials conducted by the university of georgia uga cooperative extension service under rainfed and irrigated production conditions http www ugacotton com cotton variety selection one replicate for st 6182 glt was removed from the analysis due to missing fiber quality data 2 2 uga checkbook irrigation scheduling method cotton plots were irrigated according to the uga checkbook irrigation scheduling method uga checkbook in fig 1 whitaker et al 2016 for well watered cotton and compared with rainfed plots dryland which received no supplemental irrigation after squaring uga checkbook irrigation was imposed beginning approximately five weeks after planting at the appearance of the first floral buds or squares in this study blanket irrigation amounts of 2 5 cm in 2016 and 4 4 cm in 2017 were applied to supplement naturally occurring rainfall to activate pre emergence herbicides and facilitate uniform stand establishment across the study before imposing additional irrigation for the uga checkbook method irrigation water was applied via a linear move variable rate sprinkler irrigation system in 2016 water was applied in two irrigation events between emergence and the first floral bud stage at a rate of 1 25 cm each in 2017 blanket applications of 1 25 1 25 and 1 9 cm were made between planting and squaring actual stand counts at three weeks after planting ranged from 7 5 to 10 2 plants m 1 across both years of the study which was sufficient to prevent any yield loss due to stand establishment limitations whitaker et al 2016 the uga checkbook method fig 1 is a relatively simplistic water balance approach for farmers to assess when and how much water to apply to prevent yield limiting stress the method assumes that the cotton crop requires approximately 1 9 cm of water each week before flowering 2 54 cm the first week of flowering and progressively more water until the maximum of 5 08 cm per week is reached at peak bloom the fourth and fifth week of flowering after that irrigation requirements decline until irrigation is eventually terminated at the first open boll stage the total amount of water needed is 45 7 cm during the growing season notably the uga checkbook method is a supplemental irrigation strategy only the amount of irrigation required to meet weekly targets is supplied after subtracting the amount of water provided via rainfall it also treats the rain for each week independently a high rainfall event exceeding the uga checkbook requirement in that week is not counted toward the irrigation requirement for the following week this is also due to the limited water holding capacity of the sandy soil type at the experimental station the current study applied irrigation water on a bi weekly schedule monday and thursday if needed using a linear move variable rate overhead sprinkler irrigation system variable rate systems are able to automatically cycle valves on and off depending on location in the field to ensure that certain zones remain rainfed while adjacent zones are kept irrigated 2 3 data collection at crop maturity when the percentage of open bolls 60 in the latest maturing treatment the cotton crop was defoliated to facilitate leaf drop and boll opening while also limiting regrowth harvest aids were applied at 129 days after sowing das in 2016 and 147 das in 2017 and included a three way mix of ethephon 1 7 l ha thidiazuron 0 25 l ha and folex 1 23 l ha approximately two weeks after defoliation the center two rows of each plot were harvested using a two row spindle picker with a bagging attachment on october 14 in 2016 and october 18 in 2017 seed cotton weight was recorded on site and samples were transported to the university of georgia micro gin to obtain a measure of gin turnout for each sample from these data average lint yields were extrapolated to kg ha 1 additionally cotton fiber samples were sent to the classing office of the u s department of agriculture usda in macon ga to obtain high volume instrumentation hvi analysis of fiber quality for each sample depending on differences in the fiber quality from the base quality 1 1 usda provides standard procedures to classify the quality of cotton based on physical attributes color staple length leaf extraneous matter micronaire length uniformity and strength of raw cotton fiber the base quality upland cotton was also determined by usda with the following characteristics color grade 41 leaf grade 4 staple 34 micronaire 35 36 and 43 49 strength readings of 27 0 28 9 g

yield kg ha 1 cm 1 of water applied was calculated by dividing lint yield with total water received via rainfall and irrigation combined during the production season chastain et al 2016 the water

georgia due to the relative simplicity with which eto is calculated only air temperature and solar radiation data are required and suitable performance of the model in humid regions suleiman and hoogenboom 2007 2 5 net return over irrigation variable cost economic analysis was conducted by using partial budgets to investigate the cost and benefits of each irrigation and cultivar treatment the partial budgeting method is widely used to compare the differences in profits between different production practices for farm businesses kay et al 2015 a partial budget calculates the impact on costs and revenues of alternative production practices in this study irrigation practices produced different revenues and costs for cotton production differences in revenue were due to yield and fiber quality and varying costs were for irrigation and harvesting to estimate the economic profitability of the uga checkbook and dryland methods data from the field trial were used which included seed cotton yield cotton lint yield fiber quality and irrigation input values net return was calculated by considering the cost of various inputs and market value of cotton fiber and cotton seed the net return per hectare was compared for each cultivar c and replication r among dryland or uga checkbook i for 2016 and 2017 t the gross revenue was calculated using the lint and cottonseed yields and their historical prices each year gross revenue c r i t lint price t lint yield c r i t cottonseed price t cottonseed yield c r i t cotton lint yield was obtained after seed cotton was ginned from the field experiment the cottonseed yield was estimated using a conversion ratio of 1 412 units of seed per unit of lint obtained from the upland cotton loan calculator program decision aid falconer and reeves 2017 the market price of the cotton lint was obtained from 2016 to 2017 and 2017 2018 cotton price statistics annual reports usda ams 2017 2018 these reports include the marketing year average price for the base quality upland cotton and the cotton price differentials also referred to as market price premiums and discounts depending on the fiber quality premiums were added and discounts were subtracted from the base quality price while calculating the market price of the cotton lint from the field trial thus the market price reflected the differences in prices producers receive for different fiber qualities national cottonseed prices for 2016 and 2017 were obtained from the usda national agricultural statistics service usda nass 2019 irrigation costs included irrigation variable cost and irrigation fixed cost irrigation variable cost changes with the amount of water applied and includes the costs for electricity or fuel labor and management and repair and maintenance the irrigation fixed cost is an annual overhead cost including depreciation intermediate interest tax and insurance costs for pipe and fittings pivot system pump power unit or gearhead system and well irrigation fixed costs do not change with the amount of water usage when farmers are making long term decisions about installing irrigation systems on their cropland they need to consider whether the yield improvements from irrigation can cover the variable costs and the fixed costs associated with the irrigation systems the irrigation total cost per hectare was calculated as the following irrigation total cost i t irrigation variable cos t i t irrigation fixed cos t i t in georgia producers only need to pay for the pumping and conveyance costs not water irrigation variable and fixed costs came from 2016 and 2017 university of georgia cotton enterprise budget shurley and smith 2016 2017 the economic analysis for the irrigation cost followed the production cost of cotton producers for dryland production there is no cost of irrigation for cotton producers thus in our analysis the irrigation costs for dryland plots were assumed to be zero and for the uga checkbook method only the costs of irrigation after squaring were considered the blanket irrigation amounts of 4 cm in 2016 and 2 5 cm in 2017 applied before squaring were not included in calculating the irrigation variable costs using the partial budget analysis in addition to irrigation costs harvesting and ginning costs were subtracted from gross revenue when calculating the net return to capture the cost differences due to cotton yield differences between uga checkbook and dryland plots the net return over irrigation total cost was calculated as follows net retun over i rrigation total cost c r i t gross revenue c r i t irrigation total cos t i t harvesting and ginning cost s c r i t the ginning cost for each unit of cotton lint came from the 2016 and 2017 uga cotton enterprise budget at 0 176 kg for 2016 and 2017 picking and moduling cost was obtained from the upland cotton loan calculator program decision aid at 0 063 kg of seed cotton falconer and reeves 2017 2 6 statistical analysis all the statistical analyses were conducted using sas jmp pro version 15 0 0 2019 sas institute inc to discern treatment effects on measured variables such as yield fiber quality market price and net return the effects of irrigation cultivar and their interactions on each parameter of interest were assessed using a mixed effects analysis of variance anova within each year where the block and whole plot were considered random effects and irrigation and cultivar were considered fixed effects where significant effects were observed p 0 05 differences between means were determined using fisher s protected lsd post hoc analysis stoplight chart analysis was conducted using the simulation and econometrics to analyze risk simetar software developed by richardson et al 2008 to better understand the distributions of the net returns over irrigation variable costs for the irrigation and cultivar treatments stoplight charts analysis uses graphical illustrations to demonstrate the probability distributions of net returns a lower target value and an upper target value were used in stoplight charts analysis the analysis showed the percentage of the distributions less than the lower target value and greater than the upper target value the lower and upper target values were defined as using the 25 and 75 percentiles of the net returns over irrigation total costs among all treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions and irrigation table 1 shows the rainfall and irrigation amount during the cotton growing season near camilla ga in 2016 and 2017 both 2016 and 2017 were considered wet years for cotton production as precipitation during the cotton growing season in these years exceeded the required amount of 45 7 cm bednarz et al 2002 in 2016 total rainfall from planting to defoliation was 59 4 cm which was 13 7 cm greater than the required amount in 2017 total rainfall was 61 7 cm which was 16 cm greater than the required amount the relatively wet weather in both seasons provided an opportunity to capture a practical field situation to investigate the effects of excessive water from irrigation and its impact on cotton production and profitability the daily evapotranspiration et0 for 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are shown in fig 2 values for et0 vary substantially from day to day irrespective of growing season however when averaged for the entire growing season et0 was 4 63 mm in 2016 and 4 09 mm in 2017 the dryland plots received 2 5 cm of irrigation in 2016 and 4 4 cm of irrigation in 2017 this was due to blanket irrigation applied to all plots before squaring to supplement naturally occurring rainfall activate pre emergence herbicides and facilitate uniform stand establishment after that no irrigation was applied to the dryland treatment because the uga checkbook approach treated the rainfall for each week independently additional irrigation was required for both years for the uga checkbook method following the uga checkbook method 21 6 cm of water was applied in 2016 and 26 2 cm of water was applied in 2017 additional variable costs and fixed costs were associated with irrigation for the uga checkbook method relative to the dryland plots because all treatments received the same blanket irrigation before squaring the blanket irrigation was excluded from calculating irrigation variable cost in our partial budget analysis following the cost structure of cotton producers for dryland production no additional irrigation fixed costs were added to the dryland plots the cost of irrigation for the uga checkbook method is shown in fig 3 the irrigation variable cost for the uga checkbook method was higher for 2017 than 2016 mainly due to a higher amount of irrigation applied in 2017 in addition to variable costs fixed costs associated with owning and maintaining the irrigation system occur every year producers need to generate enough revenue to cover both the variable and fixed costs to maintain long term economic sustainability for their operations 3 2 crop yield and water productivity index statistical analysis revealed significant difference in yield between the two years of this study thus analyses were conducted separately for each growing season overall yield was higher in 2017 than in 2016 table 2 no statistical difference was observed in average lint yield between cultivars or the interaction between irrigation and cultivar in either year table 3 thus in this section the discussion is only focused on comparing the results from irrigated plots and dryland plots in 2016 irrigation significantly affected lint yield p 0 003 the average yield for the dryland plots was 1279 kg ha 1 while the uga checkbook method reduced the average yield to 1096 kg ha 1 lint yield for the uga checkbook method was significantly lowered which showed the deleterious effect of irrigation during rainy growing seasons in 2017 there were no statistically significant differences 5 significance level in lint yield between the uga checkbook and the dryland plots the average value for cotton lint yield was 1582 kg ha 1 for the dryland plots and 1538 kg ha 1 for the uga checkbook method in 2017 as shown in fig 4 the water productivity index for the uga checkbook method was significantly lower than dryland plots for both years water productivity index was calculated by dividing lint yield with total water received via rainfall and irrigation combined by the crop during the production season and was expressed as kg ha 1 cm 1 chastain et al 2016 the mean value for the water productivity index for the uga checkbook method was 13 5 kg ha 1 cm 1 in 2016 and 17 5 kg ha 1 cm 1 in 2017 compared to the dryland at 20 7 kg ha 1 cm 1 in 2016 and 23 9 kg ha 1 cm 1 in 2017 the impact of irrigation on cotton yield relies heavily on the precipitation of the production region in semi arid areas or even in humid regions where episodic drought can sometimes occur during key growth stages increasing water supply from irrigation can increase cotton yield however in the southeast united states where water is abundant from precipitation additional irrigation during wet years can stimulate excess vegetative growth and reduce cotton productivity by decreasing fruit production ermanis et al 2021 our results align with bajwa and vories 2007 observations that excessive irrigation during wet years reduced cotton lint yield guinn et al 1981 attributed cotton yield reduction to increased competition between leaves and bolls due to over irrigation boll retention decreased with increased boll load in response to water supply guinn and mauney 1984 karam et al 2006 also found that cotton lint yield reductions due to irrigation were driven by a reduction in photosynthate availability to support the growth of lower bolls to maturity it has also been suggested that shading of lower leaves and fruit may be a contributor to fruit shed in response to excess water supply stockton et al 1961 3 3 effect of irrigation and cultivar on fiber quality and cotton market price the average values and analysis of variance for fiber quality and market price between the uga checkbook method and dryland plots for each of the cultivars planted are listed in table 3 our results showed that excessive irrigation decreased one fiber quality parameter by decreasing fiber length but improved another fiber quality parameter by decreasing micronaire measures this could be explained by the fact that excessive irrigation leads to delayed crop maturity sometimes leading to lower values for fiber length strength micronaire and uniformity feng et al 2014 this result is different from the impact of drought on fiber quality where drought decreases fiber quality by decreasing fiber length and fiber strength and increasing micronaire balkcom et al 2006 bauer et al 2009 snowden et al 2014 wang et al 2016 the changes in fiber quality due to irrigation were minimal in our study and did not result in a price reduction compared with the dryland plots however there were significant differences in fiber quality among cultivars and also cultivars under different irrigation treatments resulting in cultivar specific differences in market price in 2016 the dryland plots produced significantly longer fibers than irrigated plots specifically mean fiber length for dryland plots was 29 4 mm and mean fiber length for the uga checkbook approach was 29 1 mm in 2016 micronaire was significantly affected by irrigation and cultivar the response of micronaire values in our study was consistent with previous studies showing that micronaire value decreased as irrigation increased balkcom et al 2006 pettigrew 2004 zhang et al 2016 the micronaire level for irrigated plots was 4 65 whereas the micronaire for dryland was 4 75 st 4946 glt produced the highest micronaire at 4 95 and phy 333 wrf produced the lowest micronaire at 4 43 the uniformity index was only affected by cultivar in 2016 in 2016 phy 333 wrf phy 499 wrf and st 4946 glt produced a statistically higher uniformity index than dp 1555 b2 rf and st 6182 glb2 the market price reflects the price differences for different fiber qualities premiums were added and discounts were subtracted from the market price for base quality upland cotton the market price for base quality upland cotton was 1 56 kg 1 in 2016 and 1 67 kg 1 in 2017 usda ams 2017 2018 for both years the average market prices from the field trial were higher than base quality upland cotton which implies a premium in fiber quality from the field study table 3 the market price was not significantly affected by irrigation in either year however the market price was significantly affected by cultivar in 2016 and there was a significant cultivar by irrigation interaction in 2016 for market price fig 5 under dryland conditions dp 1252 b2 rf had a significantly higher average market price than phy 499 wrf which indicated a higher quality premium for dp 1252 b2 rf than phy 499 wrf under the uga checkbook method dp 1555 b2 rf had a significantly higher average market price than st 4946 glt under both the dryland and uga checkbook methods dp 1252 b2 rf and dp 1555 b2 rf had significantly higher market price than phy 499 wrf and st 4946 glt also phy 333 wrf and st 6182 glb2 had significantly higher market price than st 4946 glt 3 4 effect of irrigation on net return profitability is vital to the success and economic sustainability of agricultural businesses table 4 shows the results of net return over irrigation costs between dryland and the uga checkbook method for both net return over irrigation variable costs and irrigation total costs for both years the net returns over irrigation costs for dryland production were significantly higher than the uga checkbook method the decrease in net returns for the uga checkbook was largely a function of lower cotton yields and increased irrigation costs as the impacts of fiber quality on market prices were minimal results indicated that the checkbook method utilized was overly simplistic and could decrease net returns if broadly applied especially in environments where rainfall is sufficient or excessive in 2016 when there was adequate rainfall irrigating according to the uga checkbook approach negatively impacted yields and the additional irrigation applied incurred extra costs which further reduced net returns the comparison between net return over irrigation variable costs among dryland and checkbook treatment explained the situation when a grower with irrigation already installed irrigates when irrigation was not needed for that season it explained the amount of loss in profitability for excessive irrigation in 2016 excessive irrigation costed growers on average 463 per hectare and in 2017 excessive irrigation costed on average 233 per hectare when comparing net return over variable costs the average loss due to excessive irrigation was 336 per hectare in these two years the net return over irrigation total cost provided some further details about the total loss in economic profitability for irrigated land using the uga checkbook when compared with dryland production during these two wet years using the checkbook method cotton producers lost on average 772 ha 1 in 2016 and 542 ha 1 in 2017 with an average of 645 ha 1 loss in total profit during these wet two years the comparison of net return over irritation total costs between dryland and irrigated land provided insight for producers who were considering installing irrigation on their land however as a long term investment other factors to consider in installing irrigation include weather variation impacts on water usage the reduction in yield variation among dry years and wet years and revenue changes in additional to the variable and fixed costs of the irrigation systems irrigation will be beneficial and increase profitability if the increase in yield would be able to cover the total irrigation costs and also reduce the yield variation especially during dry years for a more stable profit for producers these findings however should not be taken to mean that irrigation is not necessary in the southeastern united states research conducted at this same location has documented significant lint yield reductions in rainfed cotton when compared to irrigated cotton in fact in the past 10 growing seasons at this site there have been significant drought induced yield losses of 35 in 2012 chastain et al 2014 and from 59 to 75 in 2014 chastain et al 2016 meeks et al 2017 by comparison the yield loss from over irrigation in the current study was 14 3 in 2016 and recently published work has shown lint yield reductions of 20 from irrigation at this same site ermanis et al 2021 thus having access to supplemental irrigation is an important component of a sustainable cotton production system even in the humid southeastern united states what this study highlights is the need for improvements in recommended irrigation scheduling strategies so that irrigation water is not being applied unnecessarily this research shows that unnecessary irrigation events occasionally limit yield consistently decrease water productivity and negatively impact producer profits 3 5 stoplight chart analysis for cultivar selection the stoplight chart analysis in fig 6 further investigated the distribution of net returns for each cultivar and irrigation the stoplight chart analysis showed he risks in income volatility associated with each cultivar and irrigation treatment which illustrates the probabilities of net returns over irrigation total costs exceeding the upper target less than the lower target and between the targets the target values for stoplight chart analysis can be changed to accommodate different decision goals richardson et al 2008 our analysis selected the most commonly used targets of the 25 and 75 percentiles of the net returns over irrigation total costs among all cultivars the upper target value was 2367 ha 1 and the lower target value was 1628 ha 1 the net return distribution varied among different cultivars for irrigated land and dryland fig 6 the preference for which cultivar to select depends on a producers risk tolerance level to minimize the downside risk producers would want to select the variety which has less of the undesirable red areas as the net return falls below the bottom 25 percentiles and maximize the desirable green areas as the net return locates above the top 25 percentiles in fig 6 for dryland fig 6a st 6182 glb2 would be the best option for a producer to minimize downside risk which had the highest probability of net returns exceeding 2367 ha 1 at 56 and the highest probability for net returns to exceed 1628 ha 1 at 100 for irrigated land under the uga checkbook method fig 6b phy 333 wrf outperformed the other varieties even though there is no net return exceeding the level of 2367 ha 1 for phy 333 wrf this variety had the highest probability for net returns exceeding 1628 ha 1 at 73 this implies that phy 333 wrf had the lowest income risks among all the other varieties under the uga checkbook method for both irrigated land and dryland fig 6c phy 333 wrf had the highest probability for net returns exceeding 1628 ha 1 at 86 but it had the lowest probability for net returns higher than 2367 ha 1 at 14 most of the net income for the phy 333 wrf variety was located in the middle category between 1628 to 2367 ha 1 this demonstrated that if producers planted the phy 333 wrf variety on both their irrigated land and dryland they would experience less income volatility with more stable income flow and faced fewer chances of experiencing extremely low or extremely high net returns this could be due to greater yield stability for phy 333 wrf than the other varieties the st 4946 glt variety demonstrated higher risks of income variability for producers as it had a higher probability for income exceeding 2367 ha 1 at 38 and a higher probability for income below 1628 ha 1 at 24 the st 4946 glt variety might be preferred by less risk averse producers as it had the highest average net return value under dryland and irrigated land at 2099 ha 1 due to the effect of irrigation on net returns in this study the probability for net returns exceeding 1628 ha 1 was notably higher for dryland than the uga checkbook method fig 6c 95 of the net returns for the dryland were higher than 1628 ha 1 compared with only 56 for the uga checkbook method also the probability for net returns exceeding 2367 ha 1 was higher for the dryland treatment 42 compared with the uga checkbook method 11 this implied that during wet years irrigating according to the uga checkbook method not only reduced profitability for cotton producers but the additional costs associated with irrigation also increased the risk of income volatility uga checkbook method kept the crop in a well watered state which could improve yield and profitability during dry years however this study showed yield suppression relative to dryland conditions in high rainfall years which demonstrated the need for cotton producers to implement robust efficient irrigation strategies to reduce the production and income risks associated with irrigation especially during high rainfall years more advanced irrigation scheduling methods are continually being developed and made available for adoption by cotton producers to guide irrigation scheduling decisions during the production season for example a relatively new smartphone application was developed for cotton producers in the southeastern united states that estimates crop evapotranspiration for specific crop growth stages and environmental conditions vellidis et al 2014 other more advanced approaches utilize direct measurements of plant water status or estimate crop water status using remote sensing for example previous research has shown that yield and water productivity can be maximized in cotton with the use of leaf water potential measurements or a canopy temperature based crop water stress index chastain et al 2016 snider et al 2016 while not widely adopted by producers these approaches have been shown to maximize yield fiber quality and net returns chastain et al 2016 shurley et al 2014 4 conclusion this research evaluated the economic efficiency of cultivar selection and irrigation for cotton production by comparing the university of georgia checkbook method uga checkbook with a rainfed production dryland this research is the first research conducted to investigate the impact of over irrigation and cultivar selection on profitability for cotton production during wet years that are common in the southeastern united states our results showed that higher precipitation during the growing season accompanied by excessive irrigation with the uga checkbook irrigation reduced the yield reduced water productivity impacted fiber quality and decreased profitability excessive irrigation decreased one fiber quality parameter by decreasing fiber length but improved another fiber quality parameter by decreasing micronaire measures these changes in fiber quality did not impact the market price for cotton between irrigated land and dryland results also showed cultivar differences in fiber quality parameters even though the mean values for lint yield were unaffected stoplight chart analysis of net returns indicated preference differences for cultivars among dryland and irrigated land production selecting the appropriate cultivar that performed well under irrigated or dryland production is critical for producers st 6182 glb2 would be a better option for a producer to minimize downside risk under dryland condition and phy 333 wrf would be a better option under irrigated land production average losses in net returns associated with excessive irrigating in these two wet years were 336 per hectare for net return over irrigation variable costs and 645 per hectare for net return over irrigation total costs by identifying variation in economic returns among different cultivars between dryland and irrigated production cotton growers can make more informed decisions on irrigation and cultivar selection that consider growing season conditions implementing robust efficient irrigation strategies is necessary to achieve high cotton yields improve water productivity reduce water usage and improve economic returns relative to

9318,although cotton is a drought tolerant crop irrigation is still needed to ensure productivity even in the humid southeastern united states irrigation must be carefully managed to limit unnecessary water use while ensuring maximum economic productivity to better understand the costs and net returns of irrigation and cultivar selection field experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2017 to compare cotton lint yield and fiber quality in dryland plots and plots irrigated using the university of georgia checkbook method uga checkbook at a field site near camilla georgia results showed cultivar differences in fiber quality parameters of micronaire and uniformity in 2016 but there was no cultivar difference in fiber quality in 2017 cultivar differences were not observed in yield or net returns for both years however stoplight chart analysis of net returns indicated differences in cultivar selection for irrigated or dryland production st 6182 glb2 would be a better option for a producer to minimize downside risk under dryland conditions and phy 333 wrf would be a better option under irrigated production results also indicated that broadly applying simplistic water balance approaches could decrease yield water productivity and net returns especially in environments where rainfall is sufficient yet unpredictable overirrigation affected some fiber quality parameters but did not impact the overall market price for cotton in 2016 irrigating according to the uga checkbook method negatively impacted yield and net returns in 2017 irrigation did not affect yield but negatively impacted net returns average losses in net returns associated with excessive irrigation in these two wet years were 336 per hectare for net return over irrigation variable costs and 645 per hectare for net return over irrigation total costs implementing robust efficient irrigation strategies is necessary to achieve high cotton yields reduce water usage and improve economic returns

habitats hanjra and qureshi 2010 among all water demands agriculture is the largest water user faramarzi et al 2010 singh 2014 irrigation is a vital risk management tool for agricultural producers enabling them to achieve higher and more consistent yields than without irrigation however water scarcity has put irrigation water use under greater scrutiny and has adversely impacted agricultural productivity hanjra and qureshi 2010 the southeastern united states has historically had enough surface and groundwater resources to meet water demand for all users the expansion of irrigated crop areas coupled with new demand driven by economic and population growth has put increasing pressure on the water resources of the region mullen et al 2009 the heavy usage of irrigation to meet crop demand has exacerbated stakeholder conflicts in the southeastern united states feldman 2008 missimer et al 2014 cotton is the third largest row crop in terms of the value of production 2 1 billion u s dollars and planted area 3 2 million acres in the southeastern united states in 2020 after soybeans and corn usda nass 2021 even though cotton is a drought tolerant crop irrigation is still needed to ensure productivity and manage production risks about 45 7 cm of water is required by cotton from planting to harvest to achieve maximum yield potential while there is typically enough rainfall in a given growing season to meet or exceed the season total requirement of 45 7 cm the frequency and distribution of rainfall in the southeast united states are not necessarily synchronized with crop water requirements bednarz et al 2002 uncertainty in the amount and timing of precipitation brings one of the most serious risks to cotton production vories et al 2021 the most critical period of water requirement for cotton is during flowering and boll development whereas excessive water from crop establishment to flowering can cause excessive vegetative growth papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 chastain et al 2016 in georgia documented lint yield reductions as large as 59 under dryland conditions relative to a well watered treatment when drought was experienced between first flower and peak bloom thus it is clear that irrigation is required to supplement rainfall to maintain cotton yield stability even in humid regions the university of georgia uga checkbook irrigation method uga checkbook is a simplified water balance approach that schedules irrigation according to expected phenological trends in total water use by the crop it serves as a guideline for farmers to determine when and how much to irrigate to keep the crop in a well watered state while this method generally maximizes yields during extreme dry growing seasons chastain et al 2016 yield suppression relative to dryland conditions is occasionally observed in high rainfall years ermanis et al 2021 hand et al 2021 during wet years unanticipated rainfall can occur after irrigation resulting in an excess amount of water available to the crop than needed bajwa and vories 2007 over irrigation can cause excessive vegetative growth delayed maturity and in some instances reductions in lint yield bange and milroy 2000 karam et al 2006 various studies have demonstrated the benefits of irrigation in increasing cotton yield and productivity compared to dryland production sui et al 2017 vories et al 2007 furthermore declines in yield and economic returns as a function of drought for cotton production have received substantial attention cammarano et al 2012 mcleman et al 2008 pasaribu et al 2021 in contrast the economic impacts of yield limiting irrigation excess for cotton production have received little attention this could be attributed to the fact that yield declines under drought are often much larger than those associated with excessive water as demonstrated by li et al 2019 for their study in maize yield loss under drought and excessive rainfall in addition to yield the amount of water available to the crop can also impact cotton fiber quality which plays a major role in determining cotton prices studies show that drought can decrease fiber quality by decreasing fiber length and fiber strength or increasing micronaire bauer et al 2009 gao et al 2020 hu et al 2018 snowden et al 2014 wang et al 2016 however limited research has investigated the impact on cotton yield and fiber quality due to excessive irrigation during wet years and the combined effects of cotton yield and fiber quality alterations on profitability the lack of economic studies on the impact of over irrigating leaves a critical knowledge gap which may hinder producer adoption of water saving technologies for irrigation this research is the first research conducted to close these research gaps by investigating the impact of over irrigation and cultivar selection on yield water productivity fiber quality and profitability for cotton production during wet years the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in southern georgia in the united states were characterized by total rainfall exceeding the 45 7 cm indicated by bednarz et al 2002 to maximize yield in cotton during these years an irrigation study was conducted with six commercially available cultivars marketed for production in georgia and to compare an established water balance approach to irrigation scheduling with dryland production at the stripling irrigation research park in camilla ga this research evaluated lint yield water productivity fiber quality economic profitability and risks in income volatility associated with cultivar selection for irrigated and dryland cotton production during high rainfall growing seasons this research is the first research to document the economic losses for cotton producers due to over irrigation with an average of 336 per hectare for net returns over irrigation variable costs and 645 per hectare for net returns over irrigation total costs it provides scientific support for the need to adopt advanced irrigation scheduling methods to reduce irrigation water usage which is imperative for improving irrigation water productivity and sustaining agricultural production in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and cultivar selection a two year field experiment was conducted at the c m stripling irrigation research park near camilla georgia 31 16 55 5 n 84 17 39 9 w to assess yield and fiber quality response to irrigation for six cultivars marketed for production in the southeastern united states the soil at the field site is a lucy loamy sand loamy kaolinitic thermic arenic kandiudults the experiment was arranged according to a split plot design irrigation represented the whole plot factor irrigated plots and dryland and cultivar was the sub plot factor six cultivars the number of replicates was six replicates per cultivar for both irrigated plots and dryland plots in 2016 and five replicates per cultivar for irrigated plots and four replicates per cultivar for dryland plots in 2017 each of these plots was 12 8 m long and 3 7 m wide adjacent irrigation zones were separated by a minimum of 8 buffer rows 7 3 m to prevent overlap between adjacent irrigation plots all crop management practices except irrigation were conducted uniformly for all experimental plots according to university of georgia cooperative extension service recommendations whitaker et al 2016 specifically the crop was grown under conventional tillage and weed management practices included a preemergence application of warrant reflex and two separate post emergence applications of roundup dual magnum approximately three weeks apart early season thrips control was achieved with a post emergence application of orthene at the one true leaf stage and stinkbug pests were managed with one application of bidrin at two weeks after flowering and a second application two weeks thereafter plant growth management practices were also standardized across all treatments where the crop received one application of mepiquat chloride 1 24 l ha of a 4 2 solution at the first flower stage of development and a second application two weeks later fertility was managed based on pre season soil tests and for a target yield goal of 1884 kg ha all p and k were applied at planting along with 25 of the total n requirement for the season thereafter the remaining n was applied at side dress between the first floral bud stage and the first flower stage as a 28 0 0 5 solution n p2o5 k2o s to also meet the sulfur requirements of the crop seeds of cotton gossypium hirsutum cv dp 1252 b2 rf and dp 1555 b2 rf monsanto company phy 333 wrf and phy 499 wrf phytogen seed company llc and st 6182 glt and st 4946 glb2 stoneville were planted on may 24 2016 and may 10 2017 at a target rate of 11 seeds per linear meter 121 000 seeds per hectare of row and a 2 cm planting depth these cultivars were selected because they had been tested in large scale on farm variety trials conducted by the university of georgia uga cooperative extension service under rainfed and irrigated production conditions http www ugacotton com cotton variety selection one replicate for st 6182 glt was removed from the analysis due to missing fiber quality data 2 2 uga checkbook irrigation scheduling method cotton plots were irrigated according to the uga checkbook irrigation scheduling method uga checkbook in fig 1 whitaker et al 2016 for well watered cotton and compared with rainfed plots dryland which received no supplemental irrigation after squaring uga checkbook irrigation was imposed beginning approximately five weeks after planting at the appearance of the first floral buds or squares in this study blanket irrigation amounts of 2 5 cm in 2016 and 4 4 cm in 2017 were applied to supplement naturally occurring rainfall to activate pre emergence herbicides and facilitate uniform stand establishment across the study before imposing additional irrigation for the uga checkbook method irrigation water was applied via a linear move variable rate sprinkler irrigation system in 2016 water was applied in two irrigation events between emergence and the first floral bud stage at a rate of 1 25 cm each in 2017 blanket applications of 1 25 1 25 and 1 9 cm were made between planting and squaring actual stand counts at three weeks after planting ranged from 7 5 to 10 2 plants m 1 across both years of the study which was sufficient to prevent any yield loss due to stand establishment limitations whitaker et al 2016 the uga checkbook method fig 1 is a relatively simplistic water balance approach for farmers to assess when and how much water to apply to prevent yield limiting stress the method assumes that the cotton crop requires approximately 1 9 cm of water each week before flowering 2 54 cm the first week of flowering and progressively more water until the maximum of 5 08 cm per week is reached at peak bloom the fourth and fifth week of flowering after that irrigation requirements decline until irrigation is eventually terminated at the first open boll stage the total amount of water needed is 45 7 cm during the growing season notably the uga checkbook method is a supplemental irrigation strategy only the amount of irrigation required to meet weekly targets is supplied after subtracting the amount of water provided via rainfall it also treats the rain for each week independently a high rainfall event exceeding the uga checkbook requirement in that week is not counted toward the irrigation requirement for the following week this is also due to the limited water holding capacity of the sandy soil type at the experimental station the current study applied irrigation water on a bi weekly schedule monday and thursday if needed using a linear move variable rate overhead sprinkler irrigation system variable rate systems are able to automatically cycle valves on and off depending on location in the field to ensure that certain zones remain rainfed while adjacent zones are kept irrigated 2 3 data collection at crop maturity when the percentage of open bolls 60 in the latest maturing treatment the cotton crop was defoliated to facilitate leaf drop and boll opening while also limiting regrowth harvest aids were applied at 129 days after sowing das in 2016 and 147 das in 2017 and included a three way mix of ethephon 1 7 l ha thidiazuron 0 25 l ha and folex 1 23 l ha approximately two weeks after defoliation the center two rows of each plot were harvested using a two row spindle picker with a bagging attachment on october 14 in 2016 and october 18 in 2017 seed cotton weight was recorded on site and samples were transported to the university of georgia micro gin to obtain a measure of gin turnout for each sample from these data average lint yields were extrapolated to kg ha 1 additionally cotton fiber samples were sent to the classing office of the u s department of agriculture usda in macon ga to obtain high volume instrumentation hvi analysis of fiber quality for each sample depending on differences in the fiber quality from the base quality 1 1 usda provides standard procedures to classify the quality of cotton based on physical attributes color staple length leaf extraneous matter micronaire length uniformity and strength of raw cotton fiber the base quality upland cotton was also determined by usda with the following characteristics color grade 41 leaf grade 4 staple 34 micronaire 35 36 and 43 49 strength readings of 27 0 28 9 g

yield kg ha 1 cm 1 of water applied was calculated by dividing lint yield with total water received via rainfall and irrigation combined during the production season chastain et al 2016 the water

georgia due to the relative simplicity with which eto is calculated only air temperature and solar radiation data are required and suitable performance of the model in humid regions suleiman and hoogenboom 2007 2 5 net return over irrigation variable cost economic analysis was conducted by using partial budgets to investigate the cost and benefits of each irrigation and cultivar treatment the partial budgeting method is widely used to compare the differences in profits between different production practices for farm businesses kay et al 2015 a partial budget calculates the impact on costs and revenues of alternative production practices in this study irrigation practices produced different revenues and costs for cotton production differences in revenue were due to yield and fiber quality and varying costs were for irrigation and harvesting to estimate the economic profitability of the uga checkbook and dryland methods data from the field trial were used which included seed cotton yield cotton lint yield fiber quality and irrigation input values net return was calculated by considering the cost of various inputs and market value of cotton fiber and cotton seed the net return per hectare was compared for each cultivar c and replication r among dryland or uga checkbook i for 2016 and 2017 t the gross revenue was calculated using the lint and cottonseed yields and their historical prices each year gross revenue c r i t lint price t lint yield c r i t cottonseed price t cottonseed yield c r i t cotton lint yield was obtained after seed cotton was ginned from the field experiment the cottonseed yield was estimated using a conversion ratio of 1 412 units of seed per unit of lint obtained from the upland cotton loan calculator program decision aid falconer and reeves 2017 the market price of the cotton lint was obtained from 2016 to 2017 and 2017 2018 cotton price statistics annual reports usda ams 2017 2018 these reports include the marketing year average price for the base quality upland cotton and the cotton price differentials also referred to as market price premiums and discounts depending on the fiber quality premiums were added and discounts were subtracted from the base quality price while calculating the market price of the cotton lint from the field trial thus the market price reflected the differences in prices producers receive for different fiber qualities national cottonseed prices for 2016 and 2017 were obtained from the usda national agricultural statistics service usda nass 2019 irrigation costs included irrigation variable cost and irrigation fixed cost irrigation variable cost changes with the amount of water applied and includes the costs for electricity or fuel labor and management and repair and maintenance the irrigation fixed cost is an annual overhead cost including depreciation intermediate interest tax and insurance costs for pipe and fittings pivot system pump power unit or gearhead system and well irrigation fixed costs do not change with the amount of water usage when farmers are making long term decisions about installing irrigation systems on their cropland they need to consider whether the yield improvements from irrigation can cover the variable costs and the fixed costs associated with the irrigation systems the irrigation total cost per hectare was calculated as the following irrigation total cost i t irrigation variable cos t i t irrigation fixed cos t i t in georgia producers only need to pay for the pumping and conveyance costs not water irrigation variable and fixed costs came from 2016 and 2017 university of georgia cotton enterprise budget shurley and smith 2016 2017 the economic analysis for the irrigation cost followed the production cost of cotton producers for dryland production there is no cost of irrigation for cotton producers thus in our analysis the irrigation costs for dryland plots were assumed to be zero and for the uga checkbook method only the costs of irrigation after squaring were considered the blanket irrigation amounts of 4 cm in 2016 and 2 5 cm in 2017 applied before squaring were not included in calculating the irrigation variable costs using the partial budget analysis in addition to irrigation costs harvesting and ginning costs were subtracted from gross revenue when calculating the net return to capture the cost differences due to cotton yield differences between uga checkbook and dryland plots the net return over irrigation total cost was calculated as follows net retun over i rrigation total cost c r i t gross revenue c r i t irrigation total cos t i t harvesting and ginning cost s c r i t the ginning cost for each unit of cotton lint came from the 2016 and 2017 uga cotton enterprise budget at 0 176 kg for 2016 and 2017 picking and moduling cost was obtained from the upland cotton loan calculator program decision aid at 0 063 kg of seed cotton falconer and reeves 2017 2 6 statistical analysis all the statistical analyses were conducted using sas jmp pro version 15 0 0 2019 sas institute inc to discern treatment effects on measured variables such as yield fiber quality market price and net return the effects of irrigation cultivar and their interactions on each parameter of interest were assessed using a mixed effects analysis of variance anova within each year where the block and whole plot were considered random effects and irrigation and cultivar were considered fixed effects where significant effects were observed p 0 05 differences between means were determined using fisher s protected lsd post hoc analysis stoplight chart analysis was conducted using the simulation and econometrics to analyze risk simetar software developed by richardson et al 2008 to better understand the distributions of the net returns over irrigation variable costs for the irrigation and cultivar treatments stoplight charts analysis uses graphical illustrations to demonstrate the probability distributions of net returns a lower target value and an upper target value were used in stoplight charts analysis the analysis showed the percentage of the distributions less than the lower target value and greater than the upper target value the lower and upper target values were defined as using the 25 and 75 percentiles of the net returns over irrigation total costs among all treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions and irrigation table 1 shows the rainfall and irrigation amount during the cotton growing season near camilla ga in 2016 and 2017 both 2016 and 2017 were considered wet years for cotton production as precipitation during the cotton growing season in these years exceeded the required amount of 45 7 cm bednarz et al 2002 in 2016 total rainfall from planting to defoliation was 59 4 cm which was 13 7 cm greater than the required amount in 2017 total rainfall was 61 7 cm which was 16 cm greater than the required amount the relatively wet weather in both seasons provided an opportunity to capture a practical field situation to investigate the effects of excessive water from irrigation and its impact on cotton production and profitability the daily evapotranspiration et0 for 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are shown in fig 2 values for et0 vary substantially from day to day irrespective of growing season however when averaged for the entire growing season et0 was 4 63 mm in 2016 and 4 09 mm in 2017 the dryland plots received 2 5 cm of irrigation in 2016 and 4 4 cm of irrigation in 2017 this was due to blanket irrigation applied to all plots before squaring to supplement naturally occurring rainfall activate pre emergence herbicides and facilitate uniform stand establishment after that no irrigation was applied to the dryland treatment because the uga checkbook approach treated the rainfall for each week independently additional irrigation was required for both years for the uga checkbook method following the uga checkbook method 21 6 cm of water was applied in 2016 and 26 2 cm of water was applied in 2017 additional variable costs and fixed costs were associated with irrigation for the uga checkbook method relative to the dryland plots because all treatments received the same blanket irrigation before squaring the blanket irrigation was excluded from calculating irrigation variable cost in our partial budget analysis following the cost structure of cotton producers for dryland production no additional irrigation fixed costs were added to the dryland plots the cost of irrigation for the uga checkbook method is shown in fig 3 the irrigation variable cost for the uga checkbook method was higher for 2017 than 2016 mainly due to a higher amount of irrigation applied in 2017 in addition to variable costs fixed costs associated with owning and maintaining the irrigation system occur every year producers need to generate enough revenue to cover both the variable and fixed costs to maintain long term economic sustainability for their operations 3 2 crop yield and water productivity index statistical analysis revealed significant difference in yield between the two years of this study thus analyses were conducted separately for each growing season overall yield was higher in 2017 than in 2016 table 2 no statistical difference was observed in average lint yield between cultivars or the interaction between irrigation and cultivar in either year table 3 thus in this section the discussion is only focused on comparing the results from irrigated plots and dryland plots in 2016 irrigation significantly affected lint yield p 0 003 the average yield for the dryland plots was 1279 kg ha 1 while the uga checkbook method reduced the average yield to 1096 kg ha 1 lint yield for the uga checkbook method was significantly lowered which showed the deleterious effect of irrigation during rainy growing seasons in 2017 there were no statistically significant differences 5 significance level in lint yield between the uga checkbook and the dryland plots the average value for cotton lint yield was 1582 kg ha 1 for the dryland plots and 1538 kg ha 1 for the uga checkbook method in 2017 as shown in fig 4 the water productivity index for the uga checkbook method was significantly lower than dryland plots for both years water productivity index was calculated by dividing lint yield with total water received via rainfall and irrigation combined by the crop during the production season and was expressed as kg ha 1 cm 1 chastain et al 2016 the mean value for the water productivity index for the uga checkbook method was 13 5 kg ha 1 cm 1 in 2016 and 17 5 kg ha 1 cm 1 in 2017 compared to the dryland at 20 7 kg ha 1 cm 1 in 2016 and 23 9 kg ha 1 cm 1 in 2017 the impact of irrigation on cotton yield relies heavily on the precipitation of the production region in semi arid areas or even in humid regions where episodic drought can sometimes occur during key growth stages increasing water supply from irrigation can increase cotton yield however in the southeast united states where water is abundant from precipitation additional irrigation during wet years can stimulate excess vegetative growth and reduce cotton productivity by decreasing fruit production ermanis et al 2021 our results align with bajwa and vories 2007 observations that excessive irrigation during wet years reduced cotton lint yield guinn et al 1981 attributed cotton yield reduction to increased competition between leaves and bolls due to over irrigation boll retention decreased with increased boll load in response to water supply guinn and mauney 1984 karam et al 2006 also found that cotton lint yield reductions due to irrigation were driven by a reduction in photosynthate availability to support the growth of lower bolls to maturity it has also been suggested that shading of lower leaves and fruit may be a contributor to fruit shed in response to excess water supply stockton et al 1961 3 3 effect of irrigation and cultivar on fiber quality and cotton market price the average values and analysis of variance for fiber quality and market price between the uga checkbook method and dryland plots for each of the cultivars planted are listed in table 3 our results showed that excessive irrigation decreased one fiber quality parameter by decreasing fiber length but improved another fiber quality parameter by decreasing micronaire measures this could be explained by the fact that excessive irrigation leads to delayed crop maturity sometimes leading to lower values for fiber length strength micronaire and uniformity feng et al 2014 this result is different from the impact of drought on fiber quality where drought decreases fiber quality by decreasing fiber length and fiber strength and increasing micronaire balkcom et al 2006 bauer et al 2009 snowden et al 2014 wang et al 2016 the changes in fiber quality due to irrigation were minimal in our study and did not result in a price reduction compared with the dryland plots however there were significant differences in fiber quality among cultivars and also cultivars under different irrigation treatments resulting in cultivar specific differences in market price in 2016 the dryland plots produced significantly longer fibers than irrigated plots specifically mean fiber length for dryland plots was 29 4 mm and mean fiber length for the uga checkbook approach was 29 1 mm in 2016 micronaire was significantly affected by irrigation and cultivar the response of micronaire values in our study was consistent with previous studies showing that micronaire value decreased as irrigation increased balkcom et al 2006 pettigrew 2004 zhang et al 2016 the micronaire level for irrigated plots was 4 65 whereas the micronaire for dryland was 4 75 st 4946 glt produced the highest micronaire at 4 95 and phy 333 wrf produced the lowest micronaire at 4 43 the uniformity index was only affected by cultivar in 2016 in 2016 phy 333 wrf phy 499 wrf and st 4946 glt produced a statistically higher uniformity index than dp 1555 b2 rf and st 6182 glb2 the market price reflects the price differences for different fiber qualities premiums were added and discounts were subtracted from the market price for base quality upland cotton the market price for base quality upland cotton was 1 56 kg 1 in 2016 and 1 67 kg 1 in 2017 usda ams 2017 2018 for both years the average market prices from the field trial were higher than base quality upland cotton which implies a premium in fiber quality from the field study table 3 the market price was not significantly affected by irrigation in either year however the market price was significantly affected by cultivar in 2016 and there was a significant cultivar by irrigation interaction in 2016 for market price fig 5 under dryland conditions dp 1252 b2 rf had a significantly higher average market price than phy 499 wrf which indicated a higher quality premium for dp 1252 b2 rf than phy 499 wrf under the uga checkbook method dp 1555 b2 rf had a significantly higher average market price than st 4946 glt under both the dryland and uga checkbook methods dp 1252 b2 rf and dp 1555 b2 rf had significantly higher market price than phy 499 wrf and st 4946 glt also phy 333 wrf and st 6182 glb2 had significantly higher market price than st 4946 glt 3 4 effect of irrigation on net return profitability is vital to the success and economic sustainability of agricultural businesses table 4 shows the results of net return over irrigation costs between dryland and the uga checkbook method for both net return over irrigation variable costs and irrigation total costs for both years the net returns over irrigation costs for dryland production were significantly higher than the uga checkbook method the decrease in net returns for the uga checkbook was largely a function of lower cotton yields and increased irrigation costs as the impacts of fiber quality on market prices were minimal results indicated that the checkbook method utilized was overly simplistic and could decrease net returns if broadly applied especially in environments where rainfall is sufficient or excessive in 2016 when there was adequate rainfall irrigating according to the uga checkbook approach negatively impacted yields and the additional irrigation applied incurred extra costs which further reduced net returns the comparison between net return over irrigation variable costs among dryland and checkbook treatment explained the situation when a grower with irrigation already installed irrigates when irrigation was not needed for that season it explained the amount of loss in profitability for excessive irrigation in 2016 excessive irrigation costed growers on average 463 per hectare and in 2017 excessive irrigation costed on average 233 per hectare when comparing net return over variable costs the average loss due to excessive irrigation was 336 per hectare in these two years the net return over irrigation total cost provided some further details about the total loss in economic profitability for irrigated land using the uga checkbook when compared with dryland production during these two wet years using the checkbook method cotton producers lost on average 772 ha 1 in 2016 and 542 ha 1 in 2017 with an average of 645 ha 1 loss in total profit during these wet two years the comparison of net return over irritation total costs between dryland and irrigated land provided insight for producers who were considering installing irrigation on their land however as a long term investment other factors to consider in installing irrigation include weather variation impacts on water usage the reduction in yield variation among dry years and wet years and revenue changes in additional to the variable and fixed costs of the irrigation systems irrigation will be beneficial and increase profitability if the increase in yield would be able to cover the total irrigation costs and also reduce the yield variation especially during dry years for a more stable profit for producers these findings however should not be taken to mean that irrigation is not necessary in the southeastern united states research conducted at this same location has documented significant lint yield reductions in rainfed cotton when compared to irrigated cotton in fact in the past 10 growing seasons at this site there have been significant drought induced yield losses of 35 in 2012 chastain et al 2014 and from 59 to 75 in 2014 chastain et al 2016 meeks et al 2017 by comparison the yield loss from over irrigation in the current study was 14 3 in 2016 and recently published work has shown lint yield reductions of 20 from irrigation at this same site ermanis et al 2021 thus having access to supplemental irrigation is an important component of a sustainable cotton production system even in the humid southeastern united states what this study highlights is the need for improvements in recommended irrigation scheduling strategies so that irrigation water is not being applied unnecessarily this research shows that unnecessary irrigation events occasionally limit yield consistently decrease water productivity and negatively impact producer profits 3 5 stoplight chart analysis for cultivar selection the stoplight chart analysis in fig 6 further investigated the distribution of net returns for each cultivar and irrigation the stoplight chart analysis showed he risks in income volatility associated with each cultivar and irrigation treatment which illustrates the probabilities of net returns over irrigation total costs exceeding the upper target less than the lower target and between the targets the target values for stoplight chart analysis can be changed to accommodate different decision goals richardson et al 2008 our analysis selected the most commonly used targets of the 25 and 75 percentiles of the net returns over irrigation total costs among all cultivars the upper target value was 2367 ha 1 and the lower target value was 1628 ha 1 the net return distribution varied among different cultivars for irrigated land and dryland fig 6 the preference for which cultivar to select depends on a producers risk tolerance level to minimize the downside risk producers would want to select the variety which has less of the undesirable red areas as the net return falls below the bottom 25 percentiles and maximize the desirable green areas as the net return locates above the top 25 percentiles in fig 6 for dryland fig 6a st 6182 glb2 would be the best option for a producer to minimize downside risk which had the highest probability of net returns exceeding 2367 ha 1 at 56 and the highest probability for net returns to exceed 1628 ha 1 at 100 for irrigated land under the uga checkbook method fig 6b phy 333 wrf outperformed the other varieties even though there is no net return exceeding the level of 2367 ha 1 for phy 333 wrf this variety had the highest probability for net returns exceeding 1628 ha 1 at 73 this implies that phy 333 wrf had the lowest income risks among all the other varieties under the uga checkbook method for both irrigated land and dryland fig 6c phy 333 wrf had the highest probability for net returns exceeding 1628 ha 1 at 86 but it had the lowest probability for net returns higher than 2367 ha 1 at 14 most of the net income for the phy 333 wrf variety was located in the middle category between 1628 to 2367 ha 1 this demonstrated that if producers planted the phy 333 wrf variety on both their irrigated land and dryland they would experience less income volatility with more stable income flow and faced fewer chances of experiencing extremely low or extremely high net returns this could be due to greater yield stability for phy 333 wrf than the other varieties the st 4946 glt variety demonstrated higher risks of income variability for producers as it had a higher probability for income exceeding 2367 ha 1 at 38 and a higher probability for income below 1628 ha 1 at 24 the st 4946 glt variety might be preferred by less risk averse producers as it had the highest average net return value under dryland and irrigated land at 2099 ha 1 due to the effect of irrigation on net returns in this study the probability for net returns exceeding 1628 ha 1 was notably higher for dryland than the uga checkbook method fig 6c 95 of the net returns for the dryland were higher than 1628 ha 1 compared with only 56 for the uga checkbook method also the probability for net returns exceeding 2367 ha 1 was higher for the dryland treatment 42 compared with the uga checkbook method 11 this implied that during wet years irrigating according to the uga checkbook method not only reduced profitability for cotton producers but the additional costs associated with irrigation also increased the risk of income volatility uga checkbook method kept the crop in a well watered state which could improve yield and profitability during dry years however this study showed yield suppression relative to dryland conditions in high rainfall years which demonstrated the need for cotton producers to implement robust efficient irrigation strategies to reduce the production and income risks associated with irrigation especially during high rainfall years more advanced irrigation scheduling methods are continually being developed and made available for adoption by cotton producers to guide irrigation scheduling decisions during the production season for example a relatively new smartphone application was developed for cotton producers in the southeastern united states that estimates crop evapotranspiration for specific crop growth stages and environmental conditions vellidis et al 2014 other more advanced approaches utilize direct measurements of plant water status or estimate crop water status using remote sensing for example previous research has shown that yield and water productivity can be maximized in cotton with the use of leaf water potential measurements or a canopy temperature based crop water stress index chastain et al 2016 snider et al 2016 while not widely adopted by producers these approaches have been shown to maximize yield fiber quality and net returns chastain et al 2016 shurley et al 2014 4 conclusion this research evaluated the economic efficiency of cultivar selection and irrigation for cotton production by comparing the university of georgia checkbook method uga checkbook with a rainfed production dryland this research is the first research conducted to investigate the impact of over irrigation and cultivar selection on profitability for cotton production during wet years that are common in the southeastern united states our results showed that higher precipitation during the growing season accompanied by excessive irrigation with the uga checkbook irrigation reduced the yield reduced water productivity impacted fiber quality and decreased profitability excessive irrigation decreased one fiber quality parameter by decreasing fiber length but improved another fiber quality parameter by decreasing micronaire measures these changes in fiber quality did not impact the market price for cotton between irrigated land and dryland results also showed cultivar differences in fiber quality parameters even though the mean values for lint yield were unaffected stoplight chart analysis of net returns indicated preference differences for cultivars among dryland and irrigated land production selecting the appropriate cultivar that performed well under irrigated or dryland production is critical for producers st 6182 glb2 would be a better option for a producer to minimize downside risk under dryland condition and phy 333 wrf would be a better option under irrigated land production average losses in net returns associated with excessive irrigating in these two wet years were 336 per hectare for net return over irrigation variable costs and 645 per hectare for net return over irrigation total costs by identifying variation in economic returns among different cultivars between dryland and irrigated production cotton growers can make more informed decisions on irrigation and cultivar selection that consider growing season conditions implementing robust efficient irrigation strategies is necessary to achieve high cotton yields improve water productivity reduce water usage and improve economic returns relative to

9319,pearl millet is a valuable alternative crop to biomass and forage production however water productivity wp in this crop under limited water conditions remains unclear in literature in addition rapid and reliable techniques to detect water stress spatial variability under field conditions are necessary the objective of this study was to verify the yield and canopy thermal responses of pearl millet subjected to different water replacement levels wrl a rain shelter experiment was conducted using a randomized block design with four replications at university of sÃ£o paulo in piracicaba sÃ£o paulo brazil pearl millet cultivar brs 1501 was subjected to four wrl treatments wrl40 wrl70 wrl100 and wrl130 the reference wrl treatment wrl100 was irrigated to maintain soil moisture at field capacity level whereas the other treatments were a fraction of the irrigation depth applied in wrl100 treatment the highest dry biomass yield obtained was 12 1 mg ha 1 under wrl130 treatment and this value diminished as wrl decreased on the contrary wp increased as the wrl decreased recording the highest wp in wrl40 9 0 kg m 3 pear millet canopy showed different thermal responses as a function of wrl treatments imposed being an alternative tool to detect water stress zones in the field by remote sensing technologies keywords crop water stress index infrared thermography water replacement levels leaf water potential data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l is a valuable forage plant in arid and semi arid regions yadav and bhatnagar 2001 bhattarai et al 2020 and water stress is considered one of the main factors limiting yield in these regions diouf et al 2004 zegada lizarazu and iijima 2005 however pearl millet performs well in very hot and dry environments when compared to other c4 crops such as maize singh and singh 1995 and is adapted to saline acidic and aluminum toxic soils yadav and rai 2013 for these reasons this forage crop is important to ensure food security in dry and marginal agricultural areas the largest areas of pearl millet cultivation are india and western and central africa it is estimated that more than 90 million people in the semiarid tropics depend on pearl millet for food and income taylor 2016 in brazil pearl millet is grown as a forage cover and grain crop moreover in recent years there has been an increasing interest in including pearl millet for ethanol production since this crop achieves high yields of biomass with readily soluble sugars assis et al 2018 in this country pearl millet is cultivated under different conditions for example in southern brazil under well watered conditions whereas in the northeast and other brazilian semi arid regions under soil and water stress santos et al 2016 it was reported that there are biomass yield reductions by up to 60 under water stress conditions assis et al 2011 despite these problems pearl millet is widely used in the brazilian modern agriculture as an initial crop in succession to degraded pastures that are being transformed into agricultural land for soybeans and corn and after that as a prime rotation option in areas irrigated and rainfed agriculture in savanna areas since there is evidence that it promotes the take up of nutrients from infertile soils promoting high yields of subsequent crops boer et al 2008 therefore it is urgent to develop reliable and rapid tools to assess plant water status under field conditions especially focused on the thermal response of millet canopy since as a starter crop it serves as a reference crop for biomass spatial variability detection in new areas for establishing variable rate recommendations on soybean crop under precision agriculture techniques adopted by successful farmers in south america different methods for crop water stress monitoring are available and can be classified as soil plant and atmosphere based measurements schultz et al 2012 meron et al 2013 rud et al 2014 for example soil moisture sensors pressure chambers and leaf diffusion porometers have been widely used for detecting water stress in crops duarte galvan et al 2014 however opposed to infrared thermometry these methods are labor intensive techniques difficult to be carried out under field conditions santesteban et al 2017 therefore assessing the canopy thermal response of pearl millet based on thermal remote sensing tools can contribute to managing water resources in irrigated fields as well as monitoring the spatial distribution of water stress under rainfed conditions currently infrared thermography is a non destructive consolidated tool lu et al 2016 mangus et al 2016 garcÃ­a tejero et al 2017 the use of this technique contributes to multidisciplinary problem solving and when applied to the irrigation engineering allows the use of thermal cameras to obtain the spatial responses of crops to water stress liu et al 2016 lima et al 2016 in addition infrared thermography is used to develop indices that reflect crop water status such as the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 the use of thermography for monitoring plant water status has been studied in crops such as cotton cohen et al 2015 eggplant Ã§olak et al 2015 coffee craparo et al 2017 costa et al 2020a sugarcane castro nava et al 2016 citrus gonzalez dugo et al 2014 common bean asemanrafat and honar 2017 quiloango chimarro et al 2021 tomato ramÃ­rez et al 2015 silva et al 2018 grape bellvert et al 2014 quinoa Ã§olak et al 2021 and several other crops studies on thermography measurements in pearl millet are scarce and mainly focused on selecting drought tolerant varieties yadav and bhatnagar 2001 bello et al 2019 bhattarai et al 2020 but there is no research on the relationship between cwsi and leaf water potential lwp in contrast in other c4 crops such as maize the thermal responses and water relations have been extensively studied dejonge et al 2015 han et al 2016 however there is evidence that maize and pearl millet have very contrasting strategies physiological and morphological to water stress choudhary et al 2020 therefore elucidating the cwsi lwp relationship in pearl millet could facilitate water management through a rapid tool thermography water shortages due to climate change han et al 2022 pizarro et al 2022 and the importance of the pearl millet as a promising bioenergy crop taylor 2016 requires adopting water deficit strategies for evaluating these strategies is used the term water productivity wp bello et al 2019 it is known that the pearl millet has high water productivity under drought stress conditions in brazil assis et al 2018 however there is a lack of information about the wp response to different water replacement levels wrl at which pearl millet significantly decreases biomass yield singh and singh 1995 therefore different water replacement levels could help to elucidate an adequate water management strategy in pearl millet according to the water resources of each region the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the effects of wrl treatments on total biomass yield 2 verify wp lwp and cwsi dynamics of pearl millet as a function of reduction of wrl and 3 define the relationship between lwp and cwsi derived from thermal images 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental area characterization the experiment was carried out under rain shelter conditions at the biosystems engineering department university of sÃ£o paulo usp esalq in piracicaba sÃ£o paulo brazil the climate of the region is considered a humid subtropical zone cwa according to the koppen climate classification with a hot and rainy summer a cool and dry winter average temperature 21 6 c average relative humidity of 73 and annual precipitation of 1280 mm it was necessary to conduct this experiment under strict controlled conditions because symptoms of water stress in plants are greatly influenced by plant root depth and by rainfall conditions being necessary to keep control of these variables during all growing cycle in order to have a response of canopy temperature to the treatments imposed in this experiment the cover structure consisted of a ceiling height of 5 2 m a transparent plastic cover diffuser film and a black screen on the sides that intercepted 30 of the incident radiation in a useful area of 160 m2 96 plots were used fiber cement boxes each with a volume of 0 1 m3 and dimensions of 0 60 0 45 0 40 m length width and depth selected plot depth was linked to the common root system depth reported for several brazilian pearl millet cultivars which have root growth to a depth of between 0 40 and 0 60 m bordin et al 2008 plots were distributed in four lines spacing 0 80 m among them and 0 50 m within lines the soil selected for filling the plots was a yellow red latosol with a sandy loam texture boxes were filled with a layer of crushed stone on the bottom and a layer of soil on the top 0 40 m separated by a nonwoven geotextile 2 2 experiment conduction pearl millet was sown in one furrow at 0 01 m depth on november 27 2016 thinning was done five days after emergence to maintain six plants per plot 10 plants per meter the spacing adopted in this trial is commonly used for this crop when included in cover or forage systems soil chemical analysis was carried out before the beginning of the experiment for which soil was collected from two layers 0 0 0 2 and 0 2 0 4 m soil acidity correction and nutritional management were conducted according to van raij 1997 recommendations for pearl millet based on soil analysis results soil acidity correction was conducted three months before sowing whereas nutritional management n and k fertilizers was divided into three soil surface applications via fertigation table 1 weed control was conducted manually throughout the 60 day growing cycle and agro chemicals were applied to diseases and pests when necessary ensuring the correct condition of the plants 2 3 irrigation and micrometeorology the irrigation system consisted of a reservoir 500 l polyethylene piping an irrigation pump ksb 500 n a ring filter and four irrigation heads with eight outputs to control the system flow rate two emitters with a flow rate of 8 l h 1 were installed in each plot for a homogeneous distribution of water on the plot a two way splitter was installed on each emitter the irrigation system was controlled by using an arduino mega microcontroller which was used to control 32 solenoid valves moreover the arduino platform controlled two relays for activation of the irrigation pump and the reservoir output solenoid the irrigation system was evaluated to verify the flow rate of emitters before the beginning of the experiment for this purpose christiansen s uniformity coefficient cuc distribution uniformity duc and the total system flow rate were used cuc and duc values were 95 5 and 86 1 respectively whereas the total system flow rate was 1 5 mÂ³ h 1 therefore the system performance was considered excellent non deformed soil samples were collected for hydro physical characterization of the soil at the beginning of the experiment samples were acquired at three depths 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 m corresponding to three layers 0 0 20 0 20 0 30 and 0 30 0 40 m respectively the physical water retention characteristic curves of the soil and parameters for the van genutchen model are given in table 2 irrigation was managed according to soil water matric potential therefore tensiometers were installed at three depths 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 m in all replications of the reference treatment wrl100 water replacement at 100 of the field capacity the matric potential was measured with a digital portable tensimeter calibrated against a mercury column vacuum meter irrigation for the wrl100 level was computed by adding the water necessary to increase the soil water to field capacity level for the soil profile the amount of soil water in each layer before irrigation was estimated from the matric potential using the van genuchten soil water retention equation van genuchten 1980 the irrigation frequency was set at three days which allowed maintaining the soil water potential at 0 20 m depth with maximum values of 26 kpa in the reference treatment wrl100 the depth of applied water to wrl130 wrl70 and wrl40 was a fraction of the depth of water applied to the reference treatment wrl100 the irrigation calculation was performed on a spreadsheet developed in microsoft excel and previously used by costa et al 2020b irrigation treatments were introduced after thinning when seedlings were well established micrometeorological data were monitored inside the shelter through an automatic weather station installed in the center of the experimental area the solar radiation flux density qg was recorded with a silicon pyranometer sensor li200x campbell scientific logan utah usa photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd Î» 400 700 nm was acquired with a quantic sensor li190sb campbell scientific logan utah usa net radiation was recorded with a net radiometer nrlite campbell scientific logan utah usa air temperature and relative air humidity were recorded with a vaissala sensor hmp45c campbell scientific logan utah usa and atmospheric pressure was acquired with a vaissala barometer cs 106 campbell scientific logan utah usa the data were integrated every 15 min average values through a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific logan utah usa 2 4 experimental design and statistical analysis the experiment was based on a randomized block design with four replications and four treatments wrl130 wrl100 wrl70 and wrl40 water replacement levels irrigation depths were based on a fraction of the depth of water applied to the reference treatment wrl100 irrigated at the field capacity in this way wrl130 wrl70 and wrl40 received 130 70 and 40 of the depth of water applied to the wrl100 plots all the statistical analyses were performed at r software http www r project org the analysis of variance was done after verification of the normality and homogeneity of the residuals when f values of the analysis of variance were statistically significant the means were compared by the tukey test at the 5 probability level the graphs were generated using the r package ggplot2 2 5 leaf water potential lwp leaf water potential was measured with a pressure chamber model 3005 soil moisture santa barbara california usa for this purpose leaves were collected before dawn these samples were placed in styrofoam box with ice for transportation to the laboratory to be processed in the chamber as soon as possible according to the methodology proposed by melo et al 2007 during the growing cycle three lwp evaluations were conducted at 23 38 and 55 das on the days prior to the irrigation reposition 2 6 canopy temperature and crop water stress index cwsi canopy temperature was measured by using a flir t640 thermal camera with emissivity Îµ set at 0 95 the device has a thermal sensitivity of 0 04 Âºc and a pixel pitch of 25 Âµm the operational temperature range is from 40 2000 Âºc the waveband used is long wave infrared of spectral range is from 7 5 to 13 Âµm the accuracy is 2 c or 2 of reading whichever is greater at 25 c nominal each pixel corresponded to an effective temperature reading the images were obtained in the sunlit side of the plants at a distance of 2 m of the crop canopy around 11 00 a m on the same dates as lwp evaluations thermal images were analyzed with the software program flir tools fig 1 analysis within the program was conducted by selecting an image area of 100 100 pixels from the leaves that were fully exposed to the light of the sun and with an insertion angle similar to the vertical plane average plot temperatures were obtained using the same software based on the temperature values of the selected pixels canopy temperature acquired from thermal images and meteorological data were used to calculate the cwsi the cwsi was computed using the formula proposed by jackson 1988 as in eq 1 1 cwsi t c t air t c t a ll t c t a ul t c t a ll where tc is canopy temperature c tair is air temperature c tc tair ll represents the non water stressed baseline temperature of fully transpiring leaves with open stomata and tc tair ul represents the non transpiring upper baseline temperature of non transpiring leaves with closed stomata in this study cwsi was calculated with observed data in this way the temperature baselines upper and lower were obtained through the minimum and maximum difference found between tc and tair as proposed by idso et al 1981 temperature outliers were eliminated following the methodology of meron et al 2013 which suggested removing tc tair values with differences above 7 Âºc and below 10 Âºc 2 7 biomass yield and water productivity pearl millet was harvested at 60 das aerial biomass was collected for all plots and then weighted to obtain wet matter to obtain dry aerial matter samples were dried at 65 c in an oven with forced air circulation for 72 h and then weighted in a precision balance the wet and dry biomass of plots were scaled to mg ha 1 as in eq 2 2 bp bpp a where bp is aerial biomass yield bpp is plot aerial biomass and a is plot area 0 26 m2 water productivity kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of dry aerial biomass to the amount of total water input eq 3 3 wp bp iwa where wp is the water productivity kg m 3 for aerial biomass yield bp is the biomass yield mg ha 1 and iwa is the irrigation water applied m3 3 results and discussion 3 1 micrometeorological data and irrigation water applied fig 2 shows the micrometeorological data along the growing cycle of pearl millet december 2016 to january 2017 the mean minimum average and maximum temperatures inside the rain shelter were 21 4 27 3 and 38 4 Âºc respectively the minimum temperature ranged between 17 4 Âºc in period 5 and 23 4 Âºc in period 1 the average temperature varied between 22 8 Âºc in period 3 and 31 2 Âºc in period 5 and the maximum temperature ranged between 29 5 Âºc in period 2 and 43 6 Âºc in period 4 fig 2a according to pereira filho et al 2003 night temperature requirements for pearl millet range between 15 and 28 c thus this plant could be used for coverage in autumn and winter despite the season recommendation being summer this crop requires more heat during the germination process to uniform stablishing when compared with maize and sorghum in addition maman et al 1999 reported that the basal temperature for pearl millet is 12 Âºc and below this temperature plant development is almost null relative humidity along the growing cycle was 77 4 and oscillated between 62 5 in period 5 and 97 4 in period 3 fig 2 b while average solar radiation was 100 w m Â² fig 2 c in the daytime higher solar radiation values were concentrated at noon in all phenological periods of the crop total irrigation water applied in treatments wrl40 wrl70 wrl100 and wrl130 was 80 140 200 and 260 mm respectively which is consistent with the water consumption reported for a brazilian pearl millet cultivar subjected to drought stress lira et al 2020 twenty one irrigation events were carried out during the growing cycle since the irrigation interval was three days the average irrigation depths were 3 8 6 7 9 5 and 12 4 mm for treatments wrl40 wrl70 wrl100 and wrl130 respectively drainage was observed visually only in treatment wrl130 but was not technically quantified so it was assumed to be around 60 mm the difference in water consumption between wrl130 and wrl100 3 2 canopy temperature cwsi and lwp canopy temperature increased as wrl treatments decreased fig 3a thus the higher canopy temperature was 36 3 Âºc in wrl40 and the lower value was 31 8 Âºc in wrl130 costa et al 2018 observed similar canopy temperature behavior for coffea arabica at the same experimental site with temperatures oscillating between 33 7 and 31 7 Âºc for irrigation levels wrl40 and wrl130 respectively cwsi values had similar behavior when compared to canopy temperature values it was expected since cwsi is an index derived from canopy temperature fig 3b cwsi increased as wrl treatments decreased thus the cwsi value was 0 74 in wrl40 showing high water stress and the lower value was 0 24 in wrl130 these results show that cwsi reflected the wrl treatments used in this trial previous studies showed similar cwsi responses evaluating drought stress in coffee plants under rain shelter conditions costa et al 2019 2020a in addition singh 2003 evaluating drought responses in pearl millet agroforest systems concluded that higher values of cwsi resulted in low crop evapotranspiration therefore cwsi could be used as a reliable tool to evaluate water stress in pearl millet lwp values varied from 0 36 to 0 92 mpa in wrl130 and wrl40 respectively fig 3c in addition lwp in wrl100 can be considered as a reference level to indicate non stress conditions thus values below 0 50 mpa could suggest water stress plants subjected to wrl40 showed a huge difference from treatments wrl130 wrl100 and wrl70 kusaka et al 2005 observed that lwp was reduced under water stress conditions independent of the genetic constitution of the pearl millet cultivars in addition radhouane 2013 evaluating different levels of salinity and water stress in pearl millet observed that lwp diminished as stress levels increased thus in the same way as cwsi lwp could be considered as an indicator of abiotic stress in pearl millet 3 3 relationship between thermal responses and lwp in this study correlation between cwsi derived of canopy temperature and lwp showed that the linear adjustment was the most suitable model and presented a coefficient of determination rÂ² of 0 61 fig 4a cohen et al 2005 veysi et al 2017 and costa et al 2020a in cotton sugarcane and coffee plants respectively reported strong correlations between lwp and cwsi under liner adjustments thus the model developed in this study for pearl millet could be used as an indicator of plant water status correlation between canopy temperature depression tc tair and lwp was also included since there is evidence of a strong correlation between these variables models between lwp and tc tair were used for irrigation scheduling and as an indicator of water stress veysi et al 2017 for this relationship the linear adjustment was also the most suitable model and presented rÂ² of 0 83 fig 4b for the model derived from cwsi and lwp the linear correlation between observed lwp and estimated lwp was strong r 0 78 but presented medium precision and accuracy according to the index values d c ema and rÂ² fig 5a in contrast the model performed for tc tair and lwp was the most reliable indicator of water stress for pearl millet r 0 91 which is corroborated by the high precision and accuracy of this model according to the calculated index values of d c ema and rÂ² fig 5b the strong correlation between these variables could be explained by the sensitivity of tair tc to changes in plant water status for example trentin et al 2011 in sugarcane reported a significant difference 1 9 Âºc of tair tc when comparing plants subjected to moderate stress and severe stress moreover in tomatoes differences of 6 7 Âºc were found when comparing well irrigated and stressed plants further research is necessary for the relationship between cwsi and lwp due to different methods that could be used to acquire temperature baselines for the calculation of cwsi 3 4 biomass yield and water productivity the results revealed that wrl100 and wrl130 presented the highest dry biomass yield with values of 11 52 and 11 95 mg ha 1 respectively fig 6 a the results differed from those found by pires et al 2007 who reported an average yield of 8 12 mg ha 1 using a similar cultivar under rainfed conditions in central brazil these differences show that irrigated agriculture presents advantages in terms of dry biomass yield of pearl millet the highest wet biomass yield was found in wrl100 and wrl130 with an average of 59 2 and 55 6 mg ha 1 respectively fig 6 b the largest reduction was found in wrl40 with a decrease of 36 15 when compared with wrl100 treatment similar wet biomass yield was reported by pires et al 2007 with an average of 54 mg ha 1 evaluating three pearl millet cultivars under rainfed conditions the highest wp was observed under the most restrictive water replacement wrl40 with an average of 9 11 kg m 3 fig 7 on the contrary wrl130 presented the lowest wp with an average of 4 58 kg m 3 in addition all irrigation treatments were significantly different the results showed that wp decreased as wrl increased water productivity values found in literature for pearl millet are lower than observed in this trial payne et al 1992 and zegada lizarazu and iijima 2005 reported values ranging between 3 9 and 5 8 kg m Â³ under well watered conditions and 4 2 and 7 0 kg m Â³ under water stress conditions differences could be explained by the irrigation system used in this experiment since drip irrigation reduces water loses caused by leaf retention and evaporation in addition wp was higher than that achieved for eight sugarcane varieties under similar growing conditions in an experiment conducted by the same research group santos et al 2019 in this way pearl millet could be a feasible option for bioenergy production in water limited environments such as northeast brazil results in this study show that long term irrigation withholding could be used as a strategy to improve water productivity in pearl millet cropping for example the wp gain under severe water stress wrl40 was around 52 when compared with wrl100 however dry biomass reductions under wrl40 and wrl70 were significant with decreases of 35 5 and 14 4 respectively according to araya et al 2011 wp can be used to determine adequate levels of irrigation deficit strategies for plant production without significant losses in addition ali and talukder 2008 concluded that irrigation deficit strategies could be adopted when available water is less than the crop water demand the goal of deficit irrigation is to improve wp however to apply these strategies is also necessary considering economic factors such as the value of water production costs and growers income lima junior et al 2011 therefore economic considerations could be another topic of interest since each production system or region has different approaches to maximize efficiency 4 conclusions water productivity of pearl millet under drip irrigation increased as the water replacement levels decreased wp varied between 4 5 and 9 0 kg of dry biomass yield per m3 of water applied dry biomass yield varied between 7 2 and 12 mg ha 1 for the wrl40 and wrl130 treatments respectively the higher irrigation amount resulted on a higher biomass yield the wrl studied in this trial reflected significant changes in canopy temperature canopy temperature difference between contrasting treatments wrl130 and wrl40 was around 6 c moreover cwsi showed a higher correlation with lwp thus the results suggest that cwsi can be used as a spatial reliable indicator of water stress in this crop based on thermal

9319,pearl millet is a valuable alternative crop to biomass and forage production however water productivity wp in this crop under limited water conditions remains unclear in literature in addition rapid and reliable techniques to detect water stress spatial variability under field conditions are necessary the objective of this study was to verify the yield and canopy thermal responses of pearl millet subjected to different water replacement levels wrl a rain shelter experiment was conducted using a randomized block design with four replications at university of sÃ£o paulo in piracicaba sÃ£o paulo brazil pearl millet cultivar brs 1501 was subjected to four wrl treatments wrl40 wrl70 wrl100 and wrl130 the reference wrl treatment wrl100 was irrigated to maintain soil moisture at field capacity level whereas the other treatments were a fraction of the irrigation depth applied in wrl100 treatment the highest dry biomass yield obtained was 12 1 mg ha 1 under wrl130 treatment and this value diminished as wrl decreased on the contrary wp increased as the wrl decreased recording the highest wp in wrl40 9 0 kg m 3 pear millet canopy showed different thermal responses as a function of wrl treatments imposed being an alternative tool to detect water stress zones in the field by remote sensing technologies keywords crop water stress index infrared thermography water replacement levels leaf water potential data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l is a valuable forage plant in arid and semi arid regions yadav and bhatnagar 2001 bhattarai et al 2020 and water stress is considered one of the main factors limiting yield in these regions diouf et al 2004 zegada lizarazu and iijima 2005 however pearl millet performs well in very hot and dry environments when compared to other c4 crops such as maize singh and singh 1995 and is adapted to saline acidic and aluminum toxic soils yadav and rai 2013 for these reasons this forage crop is important to ensure food security in dry and marginal agricultural areas the largest areas of pearl millet cultivation are india and western and central africa it is estimated that more than 90 million people in the semiarid tropics depend on pearl millet for food and income taylor 2016 in brazil pearl millet is grown as a forage cover and grain crop moreover in recent years there has been an increasing interest in including pearl millet for ethanol production since this crop achieves high yields of biomass with readily soluble sugars assis et al 2018 in this country pearl millet is cultivated under different conditions for example in southern brazil under well watered conditions whereas in the northeast and other brazilian semi arid regions under soil and water stress santos et al 2016 it was reported that there are biomass yield reductions by up to 60 under water stress conditions assis et al 2011 despite these problems pearl millet is widely used in the brazilian modern agriculture as an initial crop in succession to degraded pastures that are being transformed into agricultural land for soybeans and corn and after that as a prime rotation option in areas irrigated and rainfed agriculture in savanna areas since there is evidence that it promotes the take up of nutrients from infertile soils promoting high yields of subsequent crops boer et al 2008 therefore it is urgent to develop reliable and rapid tools to assess plant water status under field conditions especially focused on the thermal response of millet canopy since as a starter crop it serves as a reference crop for biomass spatial variability detection in new areas for establishing variable rate recommendations on soybean crop under precision agriculture techniques adopted by successful farmers in south america different methods for crop water stress monitoring are available and can be classified as soil plant and atmosphere based measurements schultz et al 2012 meron et al 2013 rud et al 2014 for example soil moisture sensors pressure chambers and leaf diffusion porometers have been widely used for detecting water stress in crops duarte galvan et al 2014 however opposed to infrared thermometry these methods are labor intensive techniques difficult to be carried out under field conditions santesteban et al 2017 therefore assessing the canopy thermal response of pearl millet based on thermal remote sensing tools can contribute to managing water resources in irrigated fields as well as monitoring the spatial distribution of water stress under rainfed conditions currently infrared thermography is a non destructive consolidated tool lu et al 2016 mangus et al 2016 garcÃ­a tejero et al 2017 the use of this technique contributes to multidisciplinary problem solving and when applied to the irrigation engineering allows the use of thermal cameras to obtain the spatial responses of crops to water stress liu et al 2016 lima et al 2016 in addition infrared thermography is used to develop indices that reflect crop water status such as the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 the use of thermography for monitoring plant water status has been studied in crops such as cotton cohen et al 2015 eggplant Ã§olak et al 2015 coffee craparo et al 2017 costa et al 2020a sugarcane castro nava et al 2016 citrus gonzalez dugo et al 2014 common bean asemanrafat and honar 2017 quiloango chimarro et al 2021 tomato ramÃ­rez et al 2015 silva et al 2018 grape bellvert et al 2014 quinoa Ã§olak et al 2021 and several other crops studies on thermography measurements in pearl millet are scarce and mainly focused on selecting drought tolerant varieties yadav and bhatnagar 2001 bello et al 2019 bhattarai et al 2020 but there is no research on the relationship between cwsi and leaf water potential lwp in contrast in other c4 crops such as maize the thermal responses and water relations have been extensively studied dejonge et al 2015 han et al 2016 however there is evidence that maize and pearl millet have very contrasting strategies physiological and morphological to water stress choudhary et al 2020 therefore elucidating the cwsi lwp relationship in pearl millet could facilitate water management through a rapid tool thermography water shortages due to climate change han et al 2022 pizarro et al 2022 and the importance of the pearl millet as a promising bioenergy crop taylor 2016 requires adopting water deficit strategies for evaluating these strategies is used the term water productivity wp bello et al 2019 it is known that the pearl millet has high water productivity under drought stress conditions in brazil assis et al 2018 however there is a lack of information about the wp response to different water replacement levels wrl at which pearl millet significantly decreases biomass yield singh and singh 1995 therefore different water replacement levels could help to elucidate an adequate water management strategy in pearl millet according to the water resources of each region the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the effects of wrl treatments on total biomass yield 2 verify wp lwp and cwsi dynamics of pearl millet as a function of reduction of wrl and 3 define the relationship between lwp and cwsi derived from thermal images 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental area characterization the experiment was carried out under rain shelter conditions at the biosystems engineering department university of sÃ£o paulo usp esalq in piracicaba sÃ£o paulo brazil the climate of the region is considered a humid subtropical zone cwa according to the koppen climate classification with a hot and rainy summer a cool and dry winter average temperature 21 6 c average relative humidity of 73 and annual precipitation of 1280 mm it was necessary to conduct this experiment under strict controlled conditions because symptoms of water stress in plants are greatly influenced by plant root depth and by rainfall conditions being necessary to keep control of these variables during all growing cycle in order to have a response of canopy temperature to the treatments imposed in this experiment the cover structure consisted of a ceiling height of 5 2 m a transparent plastic cover diffuser film and a black screen on the sides that intercepted 30 of the incident radiation in a useful area of 160 m2 96 plots were used fiber cement boxes each with a volume of 0 1 m3 and dimensions of 0 60 0 45 0 40 m length width and depth selected plot depth was linked to the common root system depth reported for several brazilian pearl millet cultivars which have root growth to a depth of between 0 40 and 0 60 m bordin et al 2008 plots were distributed in four lines spacing 0 80 m among them and 0 50 m within lines the soil selected for filling the plots was a yellow red latosol with a sandy loam texture boxes were filled with a layer of crushed stone on the bottom and a layer of soil on the top 0 40 m separated by a nonwoven geotextile 2 2 experiment conduction pearl millet was sown in one furrow at 0 01 m depth on november 27 2016 thinning was done five days after emergence to maintain six plants per plot 10 plants per meter the spacing adopted in this trial is commonly used for this crop when included in cover or forage systems soil chemical analysis was carried out before the beginning of the experiment for which soil was collected from two layers 0 0 0 2 and 0 2 0 4 m soil acidity correction and nutritional management were conducted according to van raij 1997 recommendations for pearl millet based on soil analysis results soil acidity correction was conducted three months before sowing whereas nutritional management n and k fertilizers was divided into three soil surface applications via fertigation table 1 weed control was conducted manually throughout the 60 day growing cycle and agro chemicals were applied to diseases and pests when necessary ensuring the correct condition of the plants 2 3 irrigation and micrometeorology the irrigation system consisted of a reservoir 500 l polyethylene piping an irrigation pump ksb 500 n a ring filter and four irrigation heads with eight outputs to control the system flow rate two emitters with a flow rate of 8 l h 1 were installed in each plot for a homogeneous distribution of water on the plot a two way splitter was installed on each emitter the irrigation system was controlled by using an arduino mega microcontroller which was used to control 32 solenoid valves moreover the arduino platform controlled two relays for activation of the irrigation pump and the reservoir output solenoid the irrigation system was evaluated to verify the flow rate of emitters before the beginning of the experiment for this purpose christiansen s uniformity coefficient cuc distribution uniformity duc and the total system flow rate were used cuc and duc values were 95 5 and 86 1 respectively whereas the total system flow rate was 1 5 mÂ³ h 1 therefore the system performance was considered excellent non deformed soil samples were collected for hydro physical characterization of the soil at the beginning of the experiment samples were acquired at three depths 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 m corresponding to three layers 0 0 20 0 20 0 30 and 0 30 0 40 m respectively the physical water retention characteristic curves of the soil and parameters for the van genutchen model are given in table 2 irrigation was managed according to soil water matric potential therefore tensiometers were installed at three depths 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 m in all replications of the reference treatment wrl100 water replacement at 100 of the field capacity the matric potential was measured with a digital portable tensimeter calibrated against a mercury column vacuum meter irrigation for the wrl100 level was computed by adding the water necessary to increase the soil water to field capacity level for the soil profile the amount of soil water in each layer before irrigation was estimated from the matric potential using the van genuchten soil water retention equation van genuchten 1980 the irrigation frequency was set at three days which allowed maintaining the soil water potential at 0 20 m depth with maximum values of 26 kpa in the reference treatment wrl100 the depth of applied water to wrl130 wrl70 and wrl40 was a fraction of the depth of water applied to the reference treatment wrl100 the irrigation calculation was performed on a spreadsheet developed in microsoft excel and previously used by costa et al 2020b irrigation treatments were introduced after thinning when seedlings were well established micrometeorological data were monitored inside the shelter through an automatic weather station installed in the center of the experimental area the solar radiation flux density qg was recorded with a silicon pyranometer sensor li200x campbell scientific logan utah usa photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd Î» 400 700 nm was acquired with a quantic sensor li190sb campbell scientific logan utah usa net radiation was recorded with a net radiometer nrlite campbell scientific logan utah usa air temperature and relative air humidity were recorded with a vaissala sensor hmp45c campbell scientific logan utah usa and atmospheric pressure was acquired with a vaissala barometer cs 106 campbell scientific logan utah usa the data were integrated every 15 min average values through a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific logan utah usa 2 4 experimental design and statistical analysis the experiment was based on a randomized block design with four replications and four treatments wrl130 wrl100 wrl70 and wrl40 water replacement levels irrigation depths were based on a fraction of the depth of water applied to the reference treatment wrl100 irrigated at the field capacity in this way wrl130 wrl70 and wrl40 received 130 70 and 40 of the depth of water applied to the wrl100 plots all the statistical analyses were performed at r software http www r project org the analysis of variance was done after verification of the normality and homogeneity of the residuals when f values of the analysis of variance were statistically significant the means were compared by the tukey test at the 5 probability level the graphs were generated using the r package ggplot2 2 5 leaf water potential lwp leaf water potential was measured with a pressure chamber model 3005 soil moisture santa barbara california usa for this purpose leaves were collected before dawn these samples were placed in styrofoam box with ice for transportation to the laboratory to be processed in the chamber as soon as possible according to the methodology proposed by melo et al 2007 during the growing cycle three lwp evaluations were conducted at 23 38 and 55 das on the days prior to the irrigation reposition 2 6 canopy temperature and crop water stress index cwsi canopy temperature was measured by using a flir t640 thermal camera with emissivity Îµ set at 0 95 the device has a thermal sensitivity of 0 04 Âºc and a pixel pitch of 25 Âµm the operational temperature range is from 40 2000 Âºc the waveband used is long wave infrared of spectral range is from 7 5 to 13 Âµm the accuracy is 2 c or 2 of reading whichever is greater at 25 c nominal each pixel corresponded to an effective temperature reading the images were obtained in the sunlit side of the plants at a distance of 2 m of the crop canopy around 11 00 a m on the same dates as lwp evaluations thermal images were analyzed with the software program flir tools fig 1 analysis within the program was conducted by selecting an image area of 100 100 pixels from the leaves that were fully exposed to the light of the sun and with an insertion angle similar to the vertical plane average plot temperatures were obtained using the same software based on the temperature values of the selected pixels canopy temperature acquired from thermal images and meteorological data were used to calculate the cwsi the cwsi was computed using the formula proposed by jackson 1988 as in eq 1 1 cwsi t c t air t c t a ll t c t a ul t c t a ll where tc is canopy temperature c tair is air temperature c tc tair ll represents the non water stressed baseline temperature of fully transpiring leaves with open stomata and tc tair ul represents the non transpiring upper baseline temperature of non transpiring leaves with closed stomata in this study cwsi was calculated with observed data in this way the temperature baselines upper and lower were obtained through the minimum and maximum difference found between tc and tair as proposed by idso et al 1981 temperature outliers were eliminated following the methodology of meron et al 2013 which suggested removing tc tair values with differences above 7 Âºc and below 10 Âºc 2 7 biomass yield and water productivity pearl millet was harvested at 60 das aerial biomass was collected for all plots and then weighted to obtain wet matter to obtain dry aerial matter samples were dried at 65 c in an oven with forced air circulation for 72 h and then weighted in a precision balance the wet and dry biomass of plots were scaled to mg ha 1 as in eq 2 2 bp bpp a where bp is aerial biomass yield bpp is plot aerial biomass and a is plot area 0 26 m2 water productivity kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of dry aerial biomass to the amount of total water input eq 3 3 wp bp iwa where wp is the water productivity kg m 3 for aerial biomass yield bp is the biomass yield mg ha 1 and iwa is the irrigation water applied m3 3 results and discussion 3 1 micrometeorological data and irrigation water applied fig 2 shows the micrometeorological data along the growing cycle of pearl millet december 2016 to january 2017 the mean minimum average and maximum temperatures inside the rain shelter were 21 4 27 3 and 38 4 Âºc respectively the minimum temperature ranged between 17 4 Âºc in period 5 and 23 4 Âºc in period 1 the average temperature varied between 22 8 Âºc in period 3 and 31 2 Âºc in period 5 and the maximum temperature ranged between 29 5 Âºc in period 2 and 43 6 Âºc in period 4 fig 2a according to pereira filho et al 2003 night temperature requirements for pearl millet range between 15 and 28 c thus this plant could be used for coverage in autumn and winter despite the season recommendation being summer this crop requires more heat during the germination process to uniform stablishing when compared with maize and sorghum in addition maman et al 1999 reported that the basal temperature for pearl millet is 12 Âºc and below this temperature plant development is almost null relative humidity along the growing cycle was 77 4 and oscillated between 62 5 in period 5 and 97 4 in period 3 fig 2 b while average solar radiation was 100 w m Â² fig 2 c in the daytime higher solar radiation values were concentrated at noon in all phenological periods of the crop total irrigation water applied in treatments wrl40 wrl70 wrl100 and wrl130 was 80 140 200 and 260 mm respectively which is consistent with the water consumption reported for a brazilian pearl millet cultivar subjected to drought stress lira et al 2020 twenty one irrigation events were carried out during the growing cycle since the irrigation interval was three days the average irrigation depths were 3 8 6 7 9 5 and 12 4 mm for treatments wrl40 wrl70 wrl100 and wrl130 respectively drainage was observed visually only in treatment wrl130 but was not technically quantified so it was assumed to be around 60 mm the difference in water consumption between wrl130 and wrl100 3 2 canopy temperature cwsi and lwp canopy temperature increased as wrl treatments decreased fig 3a thus the higher canopy temperature was 36 3 Âºc in wrl40 and the lower value was 31 8 Âºc in wrl130 costa et al 2018 observed similar canopy temperature behavior for coffea arabica at the same experimental site with temperatures oscillating between 33 7 and 31 7 Âºc for irrigation levels wrl40 and wrl130 respectively cwsi values had similar behavior when compared to canopy temperature values it was expected since cwsi is an index derived from canopy temperature fig 3b cwsi increased as wrl treatments decreased thus the cwsi value was 0 74 in wrl40 showing high water stress and the lower value was 0 24 in wrl130 these results show that cwsi reflected the wrl treatments used in this trial previous studies showed similar cwsi responses evaluating drought stress in coffee plants under rain shelter conditions costa et al 2019 2020a in addition singh 2003 evaluating drought responses in pearl millet agroforest systems concluded that higher values of cwsi resulted in low crop evapotranspiration therefore cwsi could be used as a reliable tool to evaluate water stress in pearl millet lwp values varied from 0 36 to 0 92 mpa in wrl130 and wrl40 respectively fig 3c in addition lwp in wrl100 can be considered as a reference level to indicate non stress conditions thus values below 0 50 mpa could suggest water stress plants subjected to wrl40 showed a huge difference from treatments wrl130 wrl100 and wrl70 kusaka et al 2005 observed that lwp was reduced under water stress conditions independent of the genetic constitution of the pearl millet cultivars in addition radhouane 2013 evaluating different levels of salinity and water stress in pearl millet observed that lwp diminished as stress levels increased thus in the same way as cwsi lwp could be considered as an indicator of abiotic stress in pearl millet 3 3 relationship between thermal responses and lwp in this study correlation between cwsi derived of canopy temperature and lwp showed that the linear adjustment was the most suitable model and presented a coefficient of determination rÂ² of 0 61 fig 4a cohen et al 2005 veysi et al 2017 and costa et al 2020a in cotton sugarcane and coffee plants respectively reported strong correlations between lwp and cwsi under liner adjustments thus the model developed in this study for pearl millet could be used as an indicator of plant water status correlation between canopy temperature depression tc tair and lwp was also included since there is evidence of a strong correlation between these variables models between lwp and tc tair were used for irrigation scheduling and as an indicator of water stress veysi et al 2017 for this relationship the linear adjustment was also the most suitable model and presented rÂ² of 0 83

tomatoes differences of 6 7 Âºc were found when comparing well irrigated and stressed plants further research is necessary for the relationship between cwsi and lwp due to different methods that could be used to acquire temperature baselines for the calculation of cwsi 3 4 biomass yield and water productivity the results revealed that wrl100 and wrl130 presented the highest dry biomass yield with
