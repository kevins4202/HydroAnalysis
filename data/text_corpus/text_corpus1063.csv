5315,in recent years ensemble precipitation forecasting has been able to provide more uncertainty information and plays an increasingly important role in basin scale hydrologic predictions the global ensemble forecast system gefs reforecast data released by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep has a long term data archive and relatively stable systematic error which shows great potential in hydrologic applications this paper aims to bias correct the gefs reforecast precipitation forecasts and analyze the impact of bias corrected ensemble precipitation forecasts on the improvement of summer streamflow prediction skill driven by the gefs reforecast ensemble precipitation forecasts the variable infiltration capacity vic distributed hydrological model is applied to simulate the 2000 2010 summer streamflow over the huaihe river basin the results show that the gefs reforecast data generally underestimates the precipitation amount with the increasing leadtime and the streamflow simulation tends to underestimate the peak due to the spatial precipitation error in this study both the frequency matching method fmm and the analog method are applied to calibrate the gefs reforecast ensemble precipitation forecasts the searching criteria of the analog method has been improved based on the basin scale areal precipitation after bias correction the fmm method mainly improves the forecast skill of light rain and moderate rain for the 1 8 d leadtime by contrast the analog method improves probabilistic precipitation forecasts and increases ensemble spread to alleviate the underdispersion of raw ensemble forecasts for the 1 8 d leadtime the analog method can also improve spatial distributions with the downscaling information from the observed precipitation producing better probabilistic precipitation forecasts the streamflow prediction using bias corrected precipitation forecasts better resembles the observed streamflow the analog corrected precipitation forecasts can effectively improve the streamflow simulations for the 1 5 d leadtime with the maximum improvements at the 2 3 d leadtime the fmm method only improves the streamflow predictions for the 2 d leadtime for the heavy flood events caused by extreme rainstorms in the summer of 2003 the ensemble mean forecasts have limited forecast skill but probabilistic precipitation forecasts show great potential in predicting the magnitude of extreme rainfall events meanwhile the ensemble streamflow predictions using the analog corrected precipitation forecasts have larger ensemble spread and a higher nash coefficient of extreme streamflow the encouraging results suggest that the reforecast ensemble dataset exhibits a great value to improve hydrometeorological predictions for operational applications keywords huaihe river basin uncertainty ensemble forecast precipitation bias correction frequency matching method fmm analog 1 introduction as quantitative precipitation forecasts qpfs are significant to disaster weather alarm fritsch and coauthors 1998 qpfs play a vital role in streamflow forecasts as critical forcing input of hydrologic models brown et al 2012 demargne and coauthors 2013 meaurio and coauthors 2017 alfieri et al 2012 as a result for improving hydrologic prediction it is an important process to generate accurate qpfs and reliable probabilistic qpfs pqpfs and to reduce the uncertainty of hydrologic input with extended leadtimes liu et al 2017 ajami et al 2007 since numerical weather prediction nwp model is incapable of describing real atmosphere motion perfectly all forecast systems have systematic deviations buizza et al 2005 hamill 2012 hamill and coauthors 2013 su et al 2014 in particular qpfs and pqpfs have increased errors for extreme events brown et al 2012 hamill and whitaker 2006 hamill et al 2008 additionally the resolution of nwp products commonly is relatively low compared with the hydrologic model klein et al 1959 in spatial and temporal scales especially when weather forecast products are used as forcing input data in a high resolution distributed hydrologic model georgakakos et al 2014 voisin et al 2010 luo and coauthors 2018 fang et al 2015 therefore postprocessing precipitation forecasts in ensemble weather forecasts i e preprocessing for hydrologic ensemble forecasts needs to be implemented to correct forecast systematic bias aiming to improve hydrologic forecast performance the precipitation bias correction may provide better streamflow forecasting results especially by improving the limitations of precipitation bias in the mean and insufficient spread in ensemble forecasts khajehei and moradkhani 2017 robertson et al 2013 tao et al 2014 wu et al 2011 previously postprocessing methods of precipitation ensemble forecasts are mainly logistic regression roulin and vannitsem 2012 wilks 2009 model output statistic method mos bayesian model average bma method sloughter et al 2007 ma and coauthors 2018 neural network method yuan et al 2007 and so on while every method has its advantages and shortcomings there is no perfect method for instance the bma and neural network methods require huge computation resource zhu and luo 2015 introduced the frequency matching method fmm which is developed at national centers for environmental prediction ncep the fmm method can not only adapt to quick version updates and changes of model or ensemble forecast system but also require less computational resource it has been implemented to bias correct qpfs and pqpfs for the ncep global forecast system gfs and global ensemble forecast system gefs in the continental united states conus since may 2004 it is of great interest to investigate whether bias correction of precipitation ensemble forecasts can improve streamflow simulation most of the above methods focus on the bias removal of precipitation amount in ensemble forecasts while the displacement errors and information loss due to coarse resolution ensemble prediction systems have been less corrected hamill and whitaker 2006 proposed a statistical postprocessing method based on historical forecast similarity which is an analog correction method comprised with corresponding fine resolution observations the analog method can work on precipitation downscaling and bias correction at the same time leading to wide application in weather and hydrologic researches diomede et al 2010 rajagopalan et al 2002 stefanova and krishnamurti 2002 vitart 2004 for instance tian et al 2016 improved short term urban water demand forecasts with reforecast analog ensembles rebecca et al 2013 integrated climate forecasts and reforecast products into reservoir operations management with the analog method to make a better decision however poor streamflow simulation results were generated in the west coast of the united states when moore et al 2015 applied the rank analog technique to precipitation bias correction which indicates streamflow simulation through the analog method still needs further improvements even though many precipitation correction methods have been developed to obtain more accurate forecasts the use of ensemble weather forecasts in hydrologic forecasts is still challenging firstly ensemble weather forecasts at coarse resolutions have relatively low accuracy and lack detailed precipitation distributions compared with satellite and observation data as the parametrization schemes in large scale global nwp models cannot resolve subgrid physical processes for smaller scales precipitation forecasts from the global nwp models need to be downscaled to finer resolution for hydrologic applications nevertheless various statistical downscaling techniques applied to the large scale global model forecasts can generate different variability in precipitation and temperature causing diverse hydrologic impact in hydrological models e g dibike and coulibaly 2005 in addition the operational nwp model is updated frequently resulting in the difficulty for system bias correction and parameter calibration of hydrology models although precipitation forecast errors can be partially corrected poor streamflow simulations may still be produced because of complicated error propagation from precipitation to streamflow habets et al 2004 liu and coauthors 2013 rayner et al 2005 tao et al 2014 addor et al 2011 shen et al 2018 the selection of precipitation forecasts in streamflow prediction is very important to better analyze the role of precipitation bias correction i e hydrologic preprocessing in streamflow simulation long term reforecast ensemble data hamill and whitaker 2006 is selected in this study which has been less applied in streamflow simulations the reforecast ensemble rerun historical forecasts using the same nwp model as the ongoing production of real time operational forecasts hamill and whitaker 2006 additionally different time scales short range medium range and seasonal and the upper limit of leadtime of valuable ensemble forecasts have been studied in the previous research which showed varied effective leadtimes for different time scales roulin and vannitsem 2005 adams and ostrowski 2010 shukla et al 2012 shah and mishra 2016 siddique and mejia 2017 xhang et al 2017 kim et al 2018 this study focuses on the potential of short term and medium term streamflow ensemble forecasts 1 8 d leadtime this research applies the fmm and improved analog methods to improve precipitation forecasts based on reforecast ensemble with the focus of streamflow simulation in a distributed hydrologic model the huaihe river basin is featured with frequent flood events and has relatively dense observation stations which provides long term precipitation and streamflow data for scientific study the precipitation ensemble forecasts during 2000 to 2010 are corrected over the upper huaihe river basin it is of interest to assess whether the reforecast ensemble at a coarse resolution 1 can help the basin scale streamflow simulation the objective of this study is to evaluate the skill of qpfs and pqpfs in the gefs reforecast data and the ability of streamflow simulations using precipitation reforecast ensemble over the upper huaihe river basin in addition the strength and weakness of the selected bias correction methods and the simulation capability of extreme flood events are investigated which may provide guidance for future hydrometeorological warning and disaster prevention this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study area and data section 3 describes precipitation bias correction methods verification methods and the calibration procedures for the distributed hydrologic model sections 4 evaluates precipitation reforecast ensemble forecasts and bias correction results sections 5 and 6 present the results of long term streamflow simulations and extreme flood events respectively followed by summary and discussions in section 7 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the huaihe river basin is around 270 000 square kilometers located in the east china 30 55 36 36 n 111 55 121 15 e between the yellow river basin and yangtze river basin the huaihe river basin is characterized by the warmtemperatesemi humidmonsoonclimate region which has sharp temperature and precipitation changes multiyear mean precipitation over the basin is about 888 mm of which 50 to 75 occurs from june to september sun et al 2016 there are many dams and reservoir in this area for flood control and fresh water supply to reduce the impact of human activities the upper huaihe river basin is used for our study with a drainage area of 121 300 km2 fig 1 most area of the upper huaihe river basin is the relatively flat plain and hilly areas locate in the northwest west and south of the basin the mainstream of huaihe river approximately flows from west to east and eventually drains water into the bengbu hydrologic station of the watershed outlet 2 2 data the gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa 00 utc 00 utc is selected as precipitation validation data it is jointly developed by china meteorological administration cma shen et al 2010 and climate prediction center cpc at national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa based on 2419 observation stations in china climatological optimal interpolation oi is used to generate precipitation fields at the 0 25 0 25 grid prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model monthly climate data correction is also applied into cgdpa it has relatively high accuracy and stability due to intensive stations and strict quality control the 24 hour precipitation 00 utc 00 utc ensemble forecasts are generated from the ncep gefs 2nd generation forecast data hamill and coauthors 2013 constituted by one control forecast and ten perturbed members the ensemble mean and probabilities are based on ten perturbed members the reforecast model has the resolution of t254l42 50 km for the 1 8 d leadtime and t190l42 70 km for the 9 16 d leadtime while the data is archived at the 1 1 resolution thus only the first 8 d forecasts are used over the upper huaihe river basin when running the variable infiltration capacity vic model daily highest and lowest temperatures and average wind speed are necessary climate data which are from cma weather observation stations in this research sun et al 2016 observed streamflow data in bengbu station is used to verify the vic model streamflow output results ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2000 2010 3 methodology 3 1 verification methods both ensemble mean and probabilistic forecasts of precipitation and streamflow prediction are verified before and after bias correction deterministic verification metrics include systematic bias relative error re and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsec the positive nsec means skillful forecasts referenced to the actual observed mean and it has the perfect value of 1 two dichotomous metrics for deterministic validation i e equitable threat score ets and frequency bias perfect value of 1 are applied to evaluate the gefs reforecast data based on the threshold exceedance the ets ranges from 1 3 to 1 perfect score while ets 0 indicates skillful forecasts for probabilistic verification the spread skill relationship is examined by the ratio between the spread i e the standard deviation among the ensemble members and root mean square error rmse which is calculated for ensemble mean forecasts in this study the ratio of 1 indicates the perfect spread skill relationship while the value greater less than 1 denotes overdispersion underdispersion brier score bs measures the errors of binary events at a given threshold and is defined as 1 b s 1 n j 1 n p j o j 2 where n is the number of the total samples p j is the forecast probability and o j is the observed probability o j 1 if the event occurs otherwise o j 0 bs can be decomposed into reliability resolution and uncertainty terms 2 b s 1 n j 1 n p j o j 2 1 n i 1 k n i p i o i 2 1 n i 1 k n i o

frequency brier skill score bss is the relative skill of forecast compared to the reference forecast the bss has a perfect value of 1 bss 0 denotes skillful forecasts if the sample climatology frequency is used as the references the bss can be expressed as 3 b s s 1 bs bs ref resolution r e l i a b i l i t y uncertainty see previous studies sun et al 2016 sun et al 2018 for details about the above metrics in addition the reliability curve plots the observed frequencies for the forecast probability intervals of ensemble forecasts the reliability curve lying under above the diagonal i e 1 1 perfect reliability curve indicates overestimation underestimation also the area under the relative operating characteristic roc curve is used to evaluate the discrimination capability of binary events the roc curve plots hit rates and false alarm rates using a set of increasing probability thresholds the roc area ranges from 0 to 1 perfect and a value of 0 5 indicates no skill 3 2 hydrologic model and calibration methods the vic model liang et al 1994 is a large scale distributed hydrologic model based on spatial distribution gridding and soil vegetation atmospheric transfer scheme svat accounting for the spatial heterogeneities the vic model also considers the soil moisture dynamic change process and moisture diffusion process among three vertical soil layers the vic model can handle calculations of both water and energy balance at the same time in this study the vic model is implemented at the 0 25 spatial resolution for daily streamflow production over the upper huaihe river basin the precipitation ensemble forecasts are bilinearly interpolated to the 0 25 0 25 grid from the gefs reforecast data at the 1 1 resolution many parameters in the vic model are related to the vegetation type and soil texture in this study the calibrated parameters and the detail calibration procedure are based on the previous study sun et al 2016 model calibration process has been carried out on the exponent of variable infiltration capacity curve b the maximum velocity of base flow dsmax the fraction of maximum base flow ds the fraction of maximum soil moisture content of the third layer ws and the second and the third soil layer thicknesses d2 and d3 for optimization these six parameters in the vic model are calibrated with differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm vrugt et al 2008 which absorbs the advantages of shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua algorithm and adaptive markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm the dream approach maintains detailed balance and shows excellent performance on complex highly nonlinear and multimodal search problems vrugt et al 2008 for the application of dream algorithm over the upper huaihe river basin the targeted functions include nsce relative error and absolute error during the summertime of 1985 1999 using relative error the largest ncse is achieved during the validation period for the summertime of 2000 2010 therefore six parameters are calibrated in the function of relative error using cgdpa or precipitation reforecast ensemble mean as the forcing data the period of previous five months is used as the model spin up time which is january may 1985 for the calibration period and january may 2000 for the validation period respectively 3 3 precipitation correction methods two statistical postprocessing methods are applied to improve precipitation forecasts including the analog and fmm methods the analog method is a unique technique of bias correction which possibly improves the downscaling information using the historical observation analysis data the reforecast data has a comparatively low resolution of 1 while the forcing input is required at the 0 25 0 25 grid by the vic model the analog method has the potential to downscale and correct systematic errors in ensemble forecasts producing skillful probabilistic forecasts at a high resolution as the observed data there are mainly two steps of the analog method the first step is to find the closest local forecast analogs to the current ensemble mean forecast in the same region and at the same forecast leadtime in historical archives but better to search within a time window such as 45 day centered on the date of the forecast the second step is the collection of the observed precipitation on the dates of the closest n analogs n 10 in this study for example on 11 july 2013 the obvious spatial error can be seen from the observed precipitation cgdpa and ensemble mean of raw ensembles fig 2 a the four most similar ensemble mean precipitation from historical raw ensemble forecasts fig 2b and the observed precipitation analog members fig 2c on the selected day corresponding to the historical forecasts are collected to construct new ensemble data probabilistic forecasts are then generated using the ensemble relative frequency at different thresholds fig 2d based on 4 analog members at the fine resolution of observations this research improves the basic analog method hamill and whitaker 2006 by considering the characteristics of a distributed hydrological model the original basic analog uses minimum rmse as the similarity standard to find n closet analogs hamill and whitaker 2006 the distributed hydrological model is sensitive to spatial distribution and area mean precipitation and the skill of streamflow prediction is highly associated with the simulation of extreme flood events in summer therefore two conditions have been added for the analog selection in this research the similarity searching combines the criteria of the spatial correlation over 0 7 and the relative error of area mean precipitation over 0 2 and thus removing the forecasts with poor spatial distribution or extremely low area mean precipitation the searching criteria of higher spatial correlation and lower forecast error could be used if long term reforecast data is available to ensure enough analog members in the following results the improved analog method is applied the frequency matching method fmm zhu and luo 2015 is developed by ncep to conduct precipitation bias correction for the ncep gfs and gefs forecasts since 2004 the fmm method is based on the comparison of the frequency distributions of observed and forecast precipitation amounts over a domain of interest aiming to eliminate the systematic error between the observed and forecast precipitation first a cumulative distribution function cdf is computed for long term historical observations and the corresponding forecasts the cdf values of both observations and forecasts are updated by decaying weight on the daily basis at ncep in this study to guarantee the accuracy of forecast targeting observation in both spatial and temporal scales the cdf distributions of observations and forecasts are generated during the training period of 14 years 1986 1999 with the window length of 45 days centered on a given day next the calibrated forecast is provided based on the new raw forecast and the two cdf distributions 4 bias correction of precipitation reforecast ensemble in this study precipitation ensemble forecasts of the gefs reforecast data without bias correction and that corrected by the fmm and analog methods are referred as the raw fmm and analog ensembles respectively all the forecast data are interpolated to the 0 25 0 25 grid and verified by cgdpa at the same resolution in practice the operational gefs data at 1 d leadtime can be accessed at the operational centers in china with a 12 h latency time and hence the following evaluation of the forecast data mainly focuses on the 2 d leadtime the time series of cumulative rainfall fig 3 is used to evaluate the systematic error and the cover rate of ensemble forecasts the dispersion the range between the maximum member and the minimum member is similar for the raw and fmm forecasts but the analog ensemble has obviously larger dispersion the analog ensemble shows little variation of dispersion with the increasing leadtime covering the cgdpa well within the 5 d leadtime while the dispersion of the raw and fmm ensembles slightly increases since the 3 d leadtime at the leadtimes of 3 d and 8 d the raw ensemble mean is closer to cgdpa than that of the analog and fmm ensembles with the increasing leadtime the trend of cumulative rainfall error changes from overestimation to underestimation also the fmm ensemble underestimates cumulative rainfall compared with the raw forecasts except for the 2 d leadtime as the improved analog method searches the analogs with the spatial correlation and the forecast error re 0 2 of area precipitation which may better correct negative bias compared with the raw forecasts at all leadtimes generally the analog ensemble outperforms the raw and fmm ensembles especially within the 5 d leadtime the observed precipitation spatial distribution fig 4 a over the upper huaihe river basin shows the increasing intensity gradient from north to south at the same time more precipitation centers locate over the south basin because of orographic enhancement effect in the dabie mountain based on the mean error distribution of summer precipitation fig 4b the analog ensemble is slightly overestimated over the entire upper huaihe river basin especially in the east region the raw and fmm ensembles overestimate the precipitation over the east basin and underestimate the precipitation centers which have greater absolute errors and relatively poor representation of spatial distribution the fmm ensemble mean is slightly underestimated compared to the raw one the fmm ensemble mainly is bias corrected with the rainfall magnitude other than the spatial distribution while the analog ensemble gains more fine resolution information and is superior to the raw and fmm forecasts at the spatial distribution fig 5 indicates the bss of light rain 0 1 mm day moderate rain 10 mm day heavy rain 25 mm day and torrential rain 50 mm day referenced to the summer climatology of 1985 1999 the analog ensemble shows the highest bss for all precipitation thresholds and leadtimes followed by the fmm ensemble the raw ensemble performs the worst and is unskillful for light rain at all leadtimes the bss generally declines with the increasing precipitation threshold and lead times compared to the raw ensemble evident improvement can be found in the analog and fmm forecasts across all leadtimes for light rain and moderate rain while the fmm ensemble has limited improvement over the raw ensemble in heavy and torrential rain which has no skill beyond the 2 d lead time for torrential rain the analog ensemble is skillful to the leadtime of 7 d for light rain and moderate rain 6 d for heavy rain and 4 d for torrential rain as the bss is partially influenced by the dispersion and cover rate fig 3 of the ensemble members the enlarged analog ensemble spread may increase probabilistic forecast skill by contract the raw ensemble is underdispersive at all leadtimes the reliability curves fig 6 at the 2 d leadtime show that the raw ensemble is severely overestimated especially larger wet bias at higher probability bins in general the reliability is improved with bias corrected ensembles fmm and analog but the improvement is reduced in torrential rain owing to fewer samples at higher probability bins compared to the raw ensemble in light rain evident improvement can be seen with the analog ensemble while the fmm ensemble shows underestimation at lower probability bins such as obvious dry bias at the 5 15 forecast probabilities the underdispersion in the raw ensemble overestimation at lower and higher forecast probabilities is improved by bias correction in particular the analog ensemble has shifted more samples at the extreme probabilities to the moderate probabilities than the fmm ensemble but enlarging the overdispersion as shown in eqs 2 and 3 the resolution term of the bs is the weighted by the normalized number of the samples at each probability bin distance between the reliability curve and the sample climatological frequency while the reliability term is the weighted distance between the reliability curve and the diagonal line when the resolution term is greater than the reliability term the bss is skillful at the selected threshold fig 5 at the 2 d leadtime the analog ensemble shows improved bss over the fmm and raw ensembles fig 5 mainly due to the reduced reliability term in light rain and the increased resolution term for higher precipitation thresholds fig 6 the roc area of the three ensemble forecasts at the 2 d lead time fig 7 is generally the highest for moderate rain and torrential rain except for the roc area of the fmm ensemble in moderate rain the overall performance of the two calibrated ensembles is better than the raw one the roc area of the analog ensemble is superior to the raw and fmm ensembles at different thresholds which is over 0 75 an indicator of good probabilistic forecasts especially in heavy rain and torrential rain both the analog and fmm ensembles show the improved discrimination ability of probabilistic forecasts because the raw ensemble has insufficient spread of ensemble members note that the better skill in the discrimination ability for the analog ensemble takes advantage from the downscaling information of the observations fig 2 and the overdispersion of ensemble members 5 streamflow ensemble the capability of the raw fmm and analog precipitation ensembles in streamflow simulation is evaluated individual ensemble members are applied as the precipitation input of the vic model to generate streamflow ensemble which is used to calculate the ensemble mean of streamflow prediction the skill of long term streamflow simulations is examined with deterministic and probabilistic verification metrics fig 8 shows the nsec and bias of ensemble mean streamflow with different leadtimes the ensemble streamflow skill is highly associated with the ensemble rainfall quality the fmm ensemble suffers from more severe underestimation in precipitation than the raw ones fig 3 except for that both ensembles share similar underestimation at the 2 d leadtime therefore fmm does not produce better hydrologic predictions than the raw ensemble in terms of nsce in almost all leadtimes except for the 2 d leadtime fig 8a compared to the raw and fmm ensembles the analog ensemble members show improvements in both rainfall fig 3 and streamflow prediction fig 8a up to the 5 d leadtime due to better rainfall runoff process at the 2 d leadtime the streamflow ensemble mean fig 8a forced by the analog ensemble has the best nsce of 0 57 followed by the fmm 0 46 and raw 0 38 ensembles by contrast the cgdpa forced streamflow prediction has the nsec of 0 65 indicating that the streamflow prediction has high uncertainties in the vic model even driven by the observed precipitation analysis the negative discharge bias fig 8b of the streamflow ensemble mean by three ensembles further demonstrates that the streamflow by the fmm ensemble is severely underestimated which only has less bias than the raw ensemble at the 2 d leadtime similar to the nsec skill the analog ensemble shows reduced bias within the 6 d leadtime generally the streamflow skill decreases with the forecast length till the 5 d leadtime and tends to increase slightly afterwards which is perhaps related to the slightly increased bss in torrential rain fig 5 at the 1 d leadtime the analog ensemble only shows marginal improvement over the raw ensemble which might be associated with the spin up time in the reforecast data fig 9 shows the spread skill relationship by the spread and rmse with different leadtimes as the spread is less than the rmse all the streamflow ensemble by the three precipitation ensembles is underdispersive at all leadtimes compared to the raw and fmm streamflow ensembles the spread skill relationship of the analog ensemble has better performance with lower rmse and enlarged spread for the 1 7 d leadtime especially larger improvement for the 1 3 d leadtime the rmse generally increases with the increasing leadtime till five days and becomes stable afterwards consistent with the nsec fig 8a the fmm ensemble has improved rmse at the 2 d leadtime compared with the raw ensemble in general the spread of the fmm and raw ensembles increases at the 1 3 d leadtime and slightly varies at the 3 7 d leadtime and greatly increases at the 8 d leadtime by contrast the spread of the analog ensemble changes less than the raw and fmm ones at the 1 8 d leadtime with the highest value at the 3 d leadtime because the analog members are constructed by the observations and the dispersion is less associated with the leadtime the frequency bias and the ets of streamflow ensemble mean at the 2 d leadtime fig 10 are evaluated at the selected thresholds 193 1250 and 3310 m3 s corresponding to the 25 50 and 75 quantiles of the observed streamflow in the validation period the fmm and raw ensembles overestimate the low flow but underestimate moderate and high flows especially the larger dry bias of the high flow the analog ensemble improves the bias in moderate and high flows but with slight overestimation of low streamflow resulting in lower ets at the low flow and improved ets compared with the raw one at moderate and high flows the fmm ensemble shows the improvement over the raw ensemble in all streamflow thresholds especially for the extreme streamflow leading to the better ets in low moderate and high flows the roc areas of streamflow ensembles fig 11 are computed for different thresholds at the 2 d leadtime all three streamflow ensembles have the skillful discrimination ability roc areas 0 5 in the selected thresholds with the lowest skill in the low flow and the highest skill in the moderate flow for the low flow the fmm ensemble outperforms the others while the analog ensemble is the best for moderate and high flows similar to the precipitation forecast performance measured by roc areas fig 7 the fmm ensemble mainly improves the extreme events in light and high flows while the analog ensemble is superior to the raw and fmm ones in moderate and highflows 6 simulations of extreme flood events as the huaihe river basin suffers from frequent floods this section evaluates the capability of the reforecast precipitation ensemble data in predicting severe flood events before and after bias correction in late june 2003 the main rain belt of china shifted northward from the south yangtze river basin to the huaihe river basin and sustained up to 30 days the everlasting torrential rainfall caused the second most severe flood event over the huaihe river basin since 1949 since the torrential precipitation concentrated in the area of the huaihe mainstream three major floods happened continuously in july with the heaviest one in mid july ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 the spatial distribution of observed monthly precipitation mean fig 12 a shows two concentrated regions during june 20 july 21 2003 located in the central and south parts of the basin however the raw ensemble mean only captures the south concentrated precipitation region but misses the precipitation center over the central basin after precipitation bias correction the monthly systematic bias is reduced by both the fmm and analog ensembles the analog ensemble improves the precipitation over the two precipitation concentration regions with the best spatial distribution while the fmm ensemble only improves the precipitation amount especially for heavy rainfall the time series of area mean precipitation fig 12b includes six main precipitation events in 30 days with the highest peak during the third event based on the relative error not shown of the monthly mean precipitation slight overestimation slight underestimation and severe underestimation can be seen in the analog fmm and raw ensembles respectively all the ensemble mean precipitation forecasts underestimate the third peak june 30th and overestimate the fifth peak july 9th the maximum analog ensemble member could well cover the rainfall observation especially for the third peak justifying the add value of using probabilistic forecasts compared to deterministic realizations while the fmm and raw ensembles evidently underestimate the third heavy rainfall event june 30th july 2nd overall both the fmm and analog ensembles show an improvement in precipitation magnitude while the analog ensemble also improves the spatial distribution the time series of daily streamflow simulations at the 2 d leadtime fig 13 shows that the cgdpa forced streamflow simulation has the best performance with the highest nsec of 0 67 while the ensemble mean of the analog fmm and raw ensembles underestimates the first streamflow peak around july 6th which is probably resulted from the underestimated precipitation forecasts during the flood period fig 12 streamflow suddenly increases during june 30th to july 2nd which can only be simulated by the maximum analog ensemble member consistent with the precipitation forecasts fig 12 in addition a spurious second streamflow peak around july 12th generated in all three ensembles is probably associated with the overestimation of the corresponding precipitation the situation may be caused by the uncertainty of model parameters and physical processes especially the failure of simulating the slow recession in the observed streamflow after precipitation bias correction the skill nsce 0 46 of the analog ensemble mean shows a significant improvement in streamflow simulations compared with the raw ensemble mean nsce 0 12 indicating the potential ability of the analog method in predicting severe flood however evident error still could be observed even though streamflow simulation of extreme events has been improved the few cases of torrential rain and extreme floods such as the 2003 flood events in historical data especially in the training dataset may limit the performance of precipitation correction method the accuracy of the calibration process and the final outcome of streamflow prediction 7 summary and discussions as the reforecast data is generated by a fixed nwpmodel after long time running it has a stable systematic error which could be used for bias correction with long term training data besides the reforecast ensemble can provide more useful information for hydrological predictions which require historical forecasts and observations over decades to calibrate hydrological models aiming at the improvements of the reforecast ensemble in simulating daily streamflow over the upper huaihe river basin precipitation bias correction using the fmm and analog methods were examined during the 2000 2010 summer both precipitation forecasts and streamflow simulations were comprehensively assessed before and after bias correction in general the precipitation reforecast ensemble showed the spatial distribution errors and underestimated the precipitation amount even though the streamflow simulations forced by precipitation ensemble forecasts showed skill for the 1 3 d leadtime they severely underestimated the observed peak discharge which are very critical for hydrometeorological decision making systems also the streamflow ensemble driven by the raw ensemble precipitation was underdispersive resulting in low performance of probabilistic streamflow simulations thus it is necessary to conduct bias correction in the reforecast ensemble precipitation forecasts to better the application of the reforecast ensemble in the hydrological simulations the role of precipitation bias correction on the hydrological modeling highly depends on the methodology of bias correction the fmm method mainly improved the forecast precipitation magnitude and the precipitation occurrence at light rain and heavy rain thresholds the improved analog method enhanced the spatial patterns favoring the characteristics of distributed hydrological model the probabilistic forecasts for both bias correction methods were improved especially for heavy and torrential rain for a relatively high resolution distributed hydrological model small scale information is more important the improvement in the spatial distribution of precipitation greatly enhanced the forecast skill of bias corrected precipitation forecasts for the analog method the spatial downscaling the 0 25 0 25 grid of cgdpa improved the forecast discriminating ability of the raw reforecast ensemble at the 1 1 resolution in particular for heavy events the effective forecast length of ensemble precipitation forecasts in hydrological application varies with the precipitation bias correction methods the improvement of the fmm method on streamflow simulation was limited within the 2 d leadtime thus the application of the fmm method in streamflow simulations still needs further improvements especially for heavy flood events for the improved analog method the construction of analog members was adjusted based on the spatial correlation and the forecast error over the specified basin while the improvement of precipitation forecasts by the basic analog method was limited although the 1 1 resolution of the reforecast data was much coarser than that of hydrological model 0 25 0 25 the analog method could improve precipitation ensemble forecasts to the 5 d leadtime by using the high resolution observation data to better the spatial representation of precipitation distributions in the distributed hydrological model therefore the careful selection of bias correction methods and the refinement of bias correction procedure are very important to obtain improved streamflow outputs in the distributed hydrological models different precipitation bias correction methods contribute to various results in streamflow simulation indicating the significant impact of original precipitation forecasts and bias correction methods on the rainfall runoff process for postprocessing low resolution gefs reforecast data in this study the analog method outperforms the fmm method by providing downscaling information at a finer scale which is extremely important for better representation of spatial precipitation distributions in distributed hydrological models overall the reforecast ensemble has great potential in hydrologic applications which could be applied to other hydrologic models and regions for the future work other post processing methods could be implemented on precipitation forecasts and streamflow simulations for better simulation results besides the temperature and wind speed data of the reforecast ensemble could be used as the input forcing instead of the observed data in the streamflow simulation by the vic model credit authorship contribution statement chunlei yang methodology resources data curation formal analysis visualization investigation

5315,in recent years ensemble precipitation forecasting has been able to provide more uncertainty information and plays an increasingly important role in basin scale hydrologic predictions the global ensemble forecast system gefs reforecast data released by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep has a long term data archive and relatively stable systematic error which shows great potential in hydrologic applications this paper aims to bias correct the gefs reforecast precipitation forecasts and analyze the impact of bias corrected ensemble precipitation forecasts on the improvement of summer streamflow prediction skill driven by the gefs reforecast ensemble precipitation forecasts the variable infiltration capacity vic distributed hydrological model is applied to simulate the 2000 2010 summer streamflow over the huaihe river basin the results show that the gefs reforecast data generally underestimates the precipitation amount with the increasing leadtime and the streamflow simulation tends to underestimate the peak due to the spatial precipitation error in this study both the frequency matching method fmm and the analog method are applied to calibrate the gefs reforecast ensemble precipitation forecasts the searching criteria of the analog method has been improved based on the basin scale areal precipitation after bias correction the fmm method mainly improves the forecast skill of light rain and moderate rain for the 1 8 d leadtime by contrast the analog method improves probabilistic precipitation forecasts and increases ensemble spread to alleviate the underdispersion of raw ensemble forecasts for the 1 8 d leadtime the analog method can also improve spatial distributions with the downscaling information from the observed precipitation producing better probabilistic precipitation forecasts the streamflow prediction using bias corrected precipitation forecasts better resembles the observed streamflow the analog corrected precipitation forecasts can effectively improve the streamflow simulations for the 1 5 d leadtime with the maximum improvements at the 2 3 d leadtime the fmm method only improves the streamflow predictions for the 2 d leadtime for the heavy flood events caused by extreme rainstorms in the summer of 2003 the ensemble mean forecasts have limited forecast skill but probabilistic precipitation forecasts show great potential in predicting the magnitude of extreme rainfall events meanwhile the ensemble streamflow predictions using the analog corrected precipitation forecasts have larger ensemble spread and a higher nash coefficient of extreme streamflow the encouraging results suggest that the reforecast ensemble dataset exhibits a great value to improve hydrometeorological predictions for operational applications keywords huaihe river basin uncertainty ensemble forecast precipitation bias correction frequency matching method fmm analog 1 introduction as quantitative precipitation forecasts qpfs are significant to disaster weather alarm fritsch and coauthors 1998 qpfs play a vital role in streamflow forecasts as critical forcing input of hydrologic models brown et al 2012 demargne and coauthors 2013 meaurio and coauthors 2017 alfieri et al 2012 as a result for improving hydrologic prediction it is an important process to generate accurate qpfs and reliable probabilistic qpfs pqpfs and to reduce the uncertainty of hydrologic input with extended leadtimes liu et al 2017 ajami et al 2007 since numerical weather prediction nwp model is incapable of describing real atmosphere motion perfectly all forecast systems have systematic deviations buizza et al 2005 hamill 2012 hamill and coauthors 2013 su et al 2014 in particular qpfs and pqpfs have increased errors for extreme events brown et al 2012 hamill and whitaker 2006 hamill et al 2008 additionally the resolution of nwp products commonly is relatively low compared with the hydrologic model klein et al 1959 in spatial and temporal scales especially when weather forecast products are used as forcing input data in a high resolution distributed hydrologic model georgakakos et al 2014 voisin et al 2010 luo and coauthors 2018 fang et al 2015 therefore postprocessing precipitation forecasts in ensemble weather forecasts i e preprocessing for hydrologic ensemble forecasts needs to be implemented to correct forecast systematic bias aiming to improve hydrologic forecast performance the precipitation bias correction may provide better streamflow forecasting results especially by improving the limitations of precipitation bias in the mean and insufficient spread in ensemble forecasts khajehei and moradkhani 2017 robertson et al 2013 tao et al 2014 wu et al 2011 previously postprocessing methods of precipitation ensemble forecasts are mainly logistic regression roulin and vannitsem 2012 wilks 2009 model output statistic method mos bayesian model average bma method sloughter et al 2007 ma and coauthors 2018 neural network method yuan et al 2007 and so on while every method has its advantages and shortcomings there is no perfect method for instance the bma and neural network methods require huge computation resource zhu and luo 2015 introduced the frequency matching method fmm which is developed at national centers for environmental prediction ncep the fmm method can not only adapt to quick version updates and changes of model or ensemble forecast system but also require less computational resource it has been implemented to bias correct qpfs and pqpfs for the ncep global forecast system gfs and global ensemble forecast system gefs in the continental united states conus since may 2004 it is of great interest to investigate whether bias correction of precipitation ensemble forecasts can improve streamflow simulation most of the above methods focus on the bias removal of precipitation amount in ensemble forecasts while the displacement errors and information loss due to coarse resolution ensemble prediction systems have been less corrected hamill and whitaker 2006 proposed a statistical postprocessing method based on historical forecast similarity which is an analog correction method comprised with corresponding fine resolution observations the analog method can work on precipitation downscaling and bias correction at the same time leading to wide application in weather and hydrologic researches diomede et al 2010 rajagopalan et al 2002 stefanova and krishnamurti 2002 vitart 2004 for instance tian et al 2016 improved short term urban water demand forecasts with reforecast analog ensembles rebecca et al 2013 integrated climate forecasts and reforecast products into reservoir operations management with the analog method to make a better decision however poor streamflow simulation results were generated in the west coast of the united states when moore et al 2015 applied the rank analog technique to precipitation bias correction which indicates streamflow simulation through the analog method still needs further improvements even though many precipitation correction methods have been developed to obtain more accurate forecasts the use of ensemble weather forecasts in hydrologic forecasts is still challenging firstly ensemble weather forecasts at coarse resolutions have relatively low accuracy and lack detailed precipitation distributions compared with satellite and observation data as the parametrization schemes in large scale global nwp models cannot resolve subgrid physical processes for smaller scales precipitation forecasts from the global nwp models need to be downscaled to finer resolution for hydrologic applications nevertheless various statistical downscaling techniques applied to the large scale global model forecasts can generate different variability in precipitation and temperature causing diverse hydrologic impact in hydrological models e g dibike and coulibaly 2005 in addition the operational nwp model is updated frequently resulting in the difficulty for system bias correction and parameter calibration of hydrology models although precipitation forecast errors can be partially corrected poor streamflow simulations may still be produced because of complicated error propagation from precipitation to streamflow habets et al 2004 liu and coauthors 2013 rayner et al 2005 tao et al 2014 addor et al 2011 shen et al 2018 the selection of precipitation forecasts in streamflow prediction is very important to better analyze the role of precipitation bias correction i e hydrologic preprocessing in streamflow simulation long term reforecast ensemble data hamill and whitaker 2006 is selected in this study which has been less applied in streamflow simulations the reforecast ensemble rerun historical forecasts using the same nwp model as the ongoing production of real time operational forecasts hamill and whitaker 2006 additionally different time scales short range medium range and seasonal and the upper limit of leadtime of valuable ensemble forecasts have been studied in the previous research which showed varied effective leadtimes for different time scales roulin and vannitsem 2005 adams and ostrowski 2010 shukla et al 2012 shah and mishra 2016 siddique and mejia 2017 xhang et al 2017 kim et al 2018 this study focuses on the potential of short term and medium term streamflow ensemble forecasts 1 8 d leadtime this research applies the fmm and improved analog methods to improve precipitation forecasts based on reforecast ensemble with the focus of streamflow simulation in a distributed hydrologic model the huaihe river basin is featured with frequent flood events and has relatively dense observation stations which provides long term precipitation and streamflow data for scientific study the precipitation ensemble forecasts during 2000 to 2010 are corrected over the upper huaihe river basin it is of interest to assess whether the reforecast ensemble at a coarse resolution 1 can help the basin scale streamflow simulation the objective of this study is to evaluate the skill of qpfs and pqpfs in the gefs reforecast data and the ability of streamflow simulations using precipitation reforecast ensemble over the upper huaihe river basin in addition the strength and weakness of the selected bias correction methods and the simulation capability of extreme flood events are investigated which may provide guidance for future hydrometeorological warning and disaster prevention this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study area and data section 3 describes precipitation bias correction methods verification methods and the calibration procedures for the distributed hydrologic model sections 4 evaluates precipitation reforecast ensemble forecasts and bias correction results sections 5 and 6 present the results of long term streamflow simulations and extreme flood events respectively followed by summary and discussions in section 7 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the huaihe river basin is around 270 000 square kilometers located in the east china 30 55 36 36 n 111 55 121 15 e between the yellow river basin and yangtze river basin the huaihe river basin is characterized by the warmtemperatesemi humidmonsoonclimate region which has sharp temperature and precipitation changes multiyear mean precipitation over the basin is about 888 mm of which 50 to 75 occurs from june to september sun et al 2016 there are many dams and reservoir in this area for flood control and fresh water supply to reduce the impact of human activities the upper huaihe river basin is used for our study with a drainage area of 121 300 km2 fig 1 most area of the upper huaihe river basin is the relatively flat plain and hilly areas locate in the northwest west and south of the basin the mainstream of huaihe river approximately flows from west to east and eventually drains water into the bengbu hydrologic station of the watershed outlet 2 2 data the gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa 00 utc 00 utc is selected as precipitation validation data it is jointly developed by china meteorological administration cma shen et al 2010 and climate prediction center cpc at national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa based on 2419 observation stations in china climatological optimal interpolation oi is used to generate precipitation fields at the 0 25 0 25 grid prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model monthly climate data correction is also applied into cgdpa it has relatively high accuracy and stability due to intensive stations and strict quality control the 24 hour precipitation 00 utc 00 utc ensemble forecasts are generated from the ncep gefs 2nd generation forecast data hamill and coauthors 2013 constituted by one control forecast and ten perturbed members the ensemble mean and probabilities are based on ten perturbed members the reforecast model has the resolution of t254l42 50 km for the 1 8 d leadtime and t190l42 70 km for the 9 16 d leadtime while the data is archived at the 1 1 resolution thus only the first 8 d forecasts are used over the upper huaihe river basin when running the variable infiltration capacity vic model daily highest and lowest temperatures and average wind speed are necessary climate data which are from cma weather observation stations in this research sun et al 2016 observed streamflow data in bengbu station is used to verify the vic model streamflow output results ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2000 2010 3 methodology 3 1 verification methods both ensemble mean and probabilistic forecasts of precipitation and streamflow prediction are verified before and after bias correction deterministic verification metrics include systematic bias relative error re and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsec the positive nsec means skillful forecasts referenced to the actual observed mean and it has the perfect value of 1 two dichotomous metrics for deterministic validation i e equitable threat score ets and frequency bias perfect value of 1 are applied to evaluate the gefs reforecast data based on the threshold exceedance the ets ranges from 1 3 to 1 perfect score while ets 0 indicates skillful forecasts for probabilistic verification the spread skill relationship is examined by the ratio between the spread i e the standard deviation among the ensemble members and root mean square error rmse which is calculated for ensemble mean forecasts in this study the ratio of 1 indicates the perfect spread skill relationship while the value greater less than 1 denotes overdispersion underdispersion brier score bs measures the errors of binary events at a given threshold and is defined as 1 b s 1 n j 1 n p j o j 2 where n is the number of the total samples p j is the forecast probability and o j is the observed probability o j 1 if the event occurs otherwise o j 0 bs can be decomposed into reliability resolution and uncertainty terms 2 b s 1 n j 1 n p j o j 2 1 n i 1 k n i p i o i 2 1 n i 1 k n i o

frequency brier skill score bss is the relative skill of forecast compared to the reference forecast the bss has a perfect value of 1 bss 0 denotes skillful forecasts if the sample climatology frequency is used as the references the bss can be expressed as 3 b s s 1 bs bs ref resolution r e l i a b i l i t y uncertainty see previous studies sun et al 2016 sun et al 2018 for details about the above metrics in addition the reliability curve plots the observed frequencies for the forecast probability intervals of ensemble forecasts the reliability curve lying under above the diagonal i e 1 1 perfect reliability curve indicates overestimation underestimation also the area under the relative operating characteristic roc curve is used to evaluate the discrimination capability of binary events the roc curve plots hit rates and false alarm rates using a set of increasing probability thresholds the roc area ranges from 0 to 1 perfect and a value of 0 5 indicates no skill 3 2 hydrologic model and calibration methods the vic model liang et al 1994 is a large scale distributed hydrologic model based on spatial distribution gridding and soil vegetation atmospheric transfer scheme svat accounting for the spatial heterogeneities the vic model also considers the soil moisture dynamic change process and moisture diffusion process among three vertical soil layers the vic model can handle calculations of both water and energy balance at the same time in this study the vic model is implemented at the 0 25 spatial resolution for daily streamflow production over the upper huaihe river basin the precipitation ensemble forecasts are bilinearly interpolated to the 0 25 0 25 grid from the gefs reforecast data at the 1 1 resolution many parameters in the vic model are related to the vegetation type and soil texture in this study the calibrated parameters and the detail calibration procedure are based on the previous study sun et al 2016 model calibration process has been carried out on the exponent of variable infiltration capacity curve b the maximum velocity of base flow dsmax the fraction of maximum base flow ds the fraction of maximum soil moisture content of the third layer ws and the second and the third soil layer thicknesses d2 and d3 for optimization these six parameters in the vic model are calibrated with differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm vrugt et al 2008 which absorbs the advantages of shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua algorithm and adaptive markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm the dream approach maintains detailed balance and shows excellent performance on complex highly nonlinear and multimodal search problems vrugt et al 2008 for the application of dream algorithm over the upper huaihe river basin the targeted functions include nsce relative error and absolute error during the summertime of 1985 1999 using relative error the largest ncse is achieved during the validation period for the summertime of 2000 2010 therefore six parameters are calibrated in the function of relative error using cgdpa or precipitation reforecast ensemble mean as the forcing data the period of previous five months is used as the model spin up time which is january may 1985 for the calibration period and january may 2000 for the validation period respectively 3 3 precipitation correction methods two statistical postprocessing methods are applied to improve precipitation forecasts including the analog and fmm methods the analog method is a unique technique of bias correction which possibly improves the downscaling information using the historical observation analysis data the reforecast data has a comparatively low resolution of 1 while the forcing input is required at the 0 25 0 25 grid by the vic model the analog method has the potential to downscale and correct systematic errors in ensemble forecasts producing skillful probabilistic forecasts at a high resolution as the observed data there are mainly two steps of the analog method the first step is to find the closest local forecast analogs to the current ensemble mean forecast in the same region and at the same forecast leadtime in historical archives but better to search within a time window such as 45 day centered on the date of the forecast the second step is the collection of the observed precipitation on the dates of the closest n analogs n 10 in this study for example on 11 july 2013 the obvious spatial error can be seen from the observed precipitation cgdpa and ensemble mean of raw ensembles fig 2 a the four most similar ensemble mean precipitation from historical raw ensemble forecasts fig 2b and the observed precipitation analog members fig 2c on the selected day corresponding to the historical forecasts are collected to construct new ensemble data probabilistic forecasts are then generated using the ensemble relative frequency at different thresholds fig 2d based on 4 analog members at the fine resolution of observations this research improves the basic analog method hamill and whitaker 2006 by considering the characteristics of a distributed hydrological model the original basic analog uses minimum rmse as the similarity standard to find n closet analogs hamill and whitaker 2006 the distributed hydrological model is sensitive to spatial distribution and area mean precipitation and the skill of streamflow prediction is highly associated with the simulation of extreme flood events in summer therefore two conditions have been added for the analog selection in this research the similarity searching combines the criteria of the spatial correlation over 0 7 and the relative error of area mean precipitation over 0 2 and thus removing the forecasts with poor spatial distribution or extremely low area mean precipitation the searching criteria of higher spatial correlation and lower forecast error could be used if long term reforecast data is available to ensure enough analog members in the following results the improved analog method is applied the frequency matching method fmm zhu and luo 2015 is developed by ncep to conduct precipitation bias correction for the ncep gfs and gefs forecasts since 2004 the fmm method is based on the comparison of the frequency distributions of observed and forecast precipitation amounts over a domain of interest aiming to eliminate the systematic error between the observed and forecast precipitation first a cumulative distribution function cdf is computed for long term historical observations and the corresponding forecasts the cdf values of both observations and forecasts are updated by decaying weight on the daily basis at ncep in this study to guarantee the accuracy of forecast targeting observation in both spatial and temporal scales the cdf distributions of observations and forecasts are generated during the training period of 14 years 1986 1999 with the window length of 45 days centered on a given day next the calibrated forecast is provided based on the new raw forecast and the two cdf distributions 4 bias correction of precipitation reforecast ensemble in this study precipitation ensemble forecasts of the gefs reforecast data without bias correction and that corrected by the fmm and analog methods are referred as the raw fmm and analog ensembles respectively all the forecast data are interpolated to the 0 25 0 25 grid and verified by cgdpa at the same resolution in practice the operational gefs data at 1 d leadtime can be accessed at the operational centers in china with a 12 h latency time and hence the following evaluation of the forecast data mainly focuses on the 2 d leadtime the time series of cumulative rainfall fig 3 is used to evaluate the systematic error and the cover rate of ensemble forecasts the dispersion the range between the maximum member and the minimum member is similar for the raw and fmm forecasts but the analog ensemble has obviously larger dispersion the analog ensemble shows little variation of dispersion with the increasing leadtime covering the cgdpa well within the 5 d leadtime while the dispersion of the raw and fmm ensembles slightly increases since the 3 d leadtime at the leadtimes of 3 d and 8 d the raw ensemble mean is closer to cgdpa than that of the analog and fmm ensembles with the increasing leadtime the trend of cumulative rainfall error changes from overestimation to underestimation also the fmm ensemble underestimates cumulative rainfall compared with the raw forecasts except for the 2 d leadtime as the improved analog method searches the analogs with the spatial correlation and the forecast error re 0 2 of area precipitation which may better correct negative bias compared with the raw forecasts at all leadtimes generally the analog ensemble outperforms the raw and fmm ensembles especially within the 5 d leadtime the observed precipitation spatial distribution fig 4 a over the upper huaihe river basin shows the increasing intensity gradient from north to south at the same time more precipitation centers locate over the south basin because of orographic enhancement effect in the dabie mountain based on the mean error distribution of summer precipitation fig 4b the analog ensemble is slightly overestimated over the entire upper huaihe river basin especially in the east region the raw and fmm ensembles overestimate the precipitation over the east basin and underestimate the precipitation centers which have greater absolute errors and relatively poor representation of spatial distribution the fmm ensemble mean is slightly underestimated compared to the raw one the fmm ensemble mainly is bias corrected with the rainfall magnitude other than the spatial distribution while the analog ensemble gains more fine resolution information and is superior to the raw and fmm forecasts at the spatial distribution fig 5 indicates the bss of light rain 0 1 mm day moderate rain 10 mm day heavy rain 25 mm day and torrential rain 50 mm day referenced to the summer climatology of 1985 1999 the analog ensemble shows the highest bss for all precipitation thresholds and leadtimes followed by the fmm ensemble the raw ensemble performs the worst and is unskillful for light rain at all leadtimes the bss generally declines with the increasing precipitation threshold and lead times compared to the raw ensemble evident improvement can be found in the analog and fmm forecasts across all leadtimes for light rain and moderate rain while the fmm ensemble has limited improvement over the raw ensemble in heavy and torrential rain which has no skill beyond the 2 d lead time for torrential rain the analog ensemble is skillful to the leadtime of 7 d for light rain and moderate rain 6 d for heavy rain and 4 d for torrential rain as the bss is partially influenced by the dispersion and cover rate fig 3 of the ensemble members the enlarged analog ensemble spread may increase probabilistic forecast skill by contract the raw ensemble is underdispersive at all leadtimes the reliability curves fig 6 at the 2 d leadtime show that the raw ensemble is severely overestimated especially larger wet bias at higher probability bins in general the reliability is improved with bias corrected ensembles fmm and analog but the improvement is reduced in torrential rain owing to fewer samples at higher probability bins compared to the raw ensemble in light rain evident improvement can be seen with the analog ensemble while the fmm ensemble shows underestimation at lower probability bins such as obvious dry bias at the 5 15 forecast probabilities the underdispersion in the raw ensemble overestimation at lower and higher forecast probabilities is improved by bias correction in particular the analog ensemble has shifted more samples at the extreme probabilities to the moderate probabilities than the fmm ensemble but enlarging the overdispersion as shown in eqs 2 and 3 the resolution term of the bs is the weighted by the normalized number of the samples at each probability bin distance between the reliability curve and the sample climatological frequency while the reliability term is the weighted distance between the reliability curve and the diagonal line when the resolution term is greater than the reliability term the bss is skillful at the selected threshold fig 5 at the 2 d leadtime the analog ensemble shows improved bss over the fmm and raw ensembles fig 5 mainly due to the reduced reliability term in light rain and the increased resolution term for higher precipitation thresholds fig 6 the roc area of the three ensemble forecasts at the 2 d lead time fig 7 is generally the highest for moderate rain and torrential rain except for the roc area of the fmm ensemble in moderate rain the overall performance of the two calibrated ensembles is better than the raw one the roc area of the analog ensemble is superior to the raw and fmm ensembles at different thresholds which is over 0 75 an indicator of good probabilistic forecasts especially in heavy rain and torrential rain both the analog and fmm ensembles show the improved discrimination ability of probabilistic forecasts because the raw ensemble has insufficient spread of ensemble members note that the better skill in the discrimination ability for the analog ensemble takes advantage from the downscaling information of the observations fig 2 and the overdispersion of ensemble members 5 streamflow ensemble the capability of the raw fmm and analog precipitation ensembles in streamflow simulation is evaluated individual ensemble members are applied as the precipitation input of the vic model to generate streamflow ensemble which is used to calculate the ensemble mean of streamflow prediction the skill of long term streamflow simulations is examined with deterministic and probabilistic verification metrics fig 8 shows the nsec and bias of ensemble mean streamflow with different leadtimes the ensemble streamflow skill is highly associated with the ensemble rainfall quality the fmm ensemble suffers from more severe underestimation in precipitation than the raw ones fig 3 except for that both ensembles share similar underestimation at the 2 d leadtime therefore fmm does not produce better hydrologic predictions than the raw ensemble in terms of nsce in almost all leadtimes except for the 2 d leadtime fig 8a compared to the raw and fmm ensembles the analog ensemble members show improvements in both rainfall fig 3 and streamflow prediction fig 8a up to the 5 d leadtime due to better rainfall runoff process at the 2 d leadtime the streamflow ensemble mean fig 8a forced by the analog ensemble has the best nsce of 0 57 followed by the fmm 0 46 and raw 0 38 ensembles by contrast the cgdpa forced streamflow prediction has the nsec of 0 65 indicating that the streamflow prediction has high uncertainties in the vic model even driven by the observed precipitation analysis the negative discharge bias fig 8b of the streamflow ensemble mean by three ensembles further demonstrates that the streamflow by the fmm ensemble is severely underestimated which only has less bias than the raw ensemble at the 2 d leadtime similar to the nsec skill the analog ensemble shows reduced bias within the 6 d leadtime generally the streamflow skill decreases with the forecast length till the 5 d leadtime and tends to increase slightly afterwards which is perhaps related to the slightly increased bss in torrential rain fig 5 at the 1 d leadtime the analog ensemble only shows marginal improvement over the raw ensemble which might be associated with the spin up time in the reforecast data fig 9 shows the spread skill relationship by the spread and rmse with different leadtimes as the spread is less than the rmse all the streamflow ensemble by the three precipitation ensembles is underdispersive at all leadtimes compared to the raw and fmm streamflow ensembles the spread skill relationship of the analog ensemble has better performance with lower rmse and enlarged spread for the 1 7 d leadtime especially larger improvement for the 1 3 d leadtime the rmse generally increases with the increasing leadtime till five days and becomes stable afterwards consistent with the nsec fig 8a the fmm ensemble has improved rmse at the 2 d leadtime compared with the raw ensemble in general the spread of the fmm and raw ensembles increases at the 1 3 d leadtime and slightly varies at the 3 7 d leadtime and greatly increases at the 8 d leadtime by contrast the spread of the analog ensemble changes less than the raw and fmm ones at the 1 8 d leadtime with the highest value at the 3 d leadtime because the analog members are constructed by the observations and the dispersion is less associated with the leadtime the frequency bias and the ets of streamflow ensemble mean at the 2 d leadtime fig 10 are evaluated at the selected thresholds 193 1250 and 3310 m3 s corresponding to the 25 50 and 75 quantiles of the observed streamflow in the validation period the fmm and raw ensembles overestimate the low flow but underestimate moderate and high flows especially the larger dry bias of the high flow the analog ensemble improves the bias in moderate and high flows but with slight overestimation of low streamflow resulting in lower ets at the low flow and improved ets compared with the raw one at moderate and high flows the fmm ensemble shows the improvement over the raw ensemble in all streamflow thresholds especially for the extreme streamflow leading to the better ets in low moderate and high flows the roc areas of streamflow ensembles fig 11 are computed for different thresholds at the 2 d leadtime all three streamflow ensembles have the skillful discrimination ability roc areas 0 5 in the selected thresholds with the lowest skill in the low flow and the highest skill in the moderate flow for the low flow the fmm ensemble outperforms the others while the analog ensemble is the best for moderate and high flows similar to the precipitation forecast performance measured by roc areas fig 7 the fmm ensemble mainly improves the extreme events in light and high flows while the analog ensemble is superior to the raw and fmm ones in moderate and highflows 6 simulations of extreme flood events as the huaihe river basin suffers from frequent floods this section evaluates the capability of the reforecast precipitation ensemble data in predicting severe flood events before and after bias correction in late june 2003 the main rain belt of china shifted northward from the south yangtze river basin to the huaihe river basin and sustained up to 30 days the everlasting torrential rainfall caused the second most severe flood event over the huaihe river basin since 1949 since the torrential precipitation concentrated in the area of the huaihe mainstream three major floods happened continuously in july with the heaviest one in mid july ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 the spatial distribution of observed monthly precipitation mean fig 12 a shows two concentrated regions during june 20 july 21 2003 located in the central and south parts of the basin however the raw ensemble mean only captures the south concentrated precipitation region but misses the precipitation center over the central basin after precipitation bias correction the monthly systematic bias is reduced by both the fmm and analog ensembles the analog ensemble improves the precipitation over the two precipitation concentration regions with the best spatial distribution while the fmm ensemble only improves the precipitation amount especially for heavy rainfall the time series of area mean precipitation fig 12b includes six main precipitation events in 30 days with the highest peak during the third event based on the relative error not shown of the monthly mean precipitation slight overestimation slight underestimation and severe underestimation can be seen in the analog fmm and raw ensembles respectively all the ensemble mean precipitation forecasts underestimate the third peak june 30th and overestimate the fifth peak july 9th the maximum analog ensemble member could well cover the rainfall observation especially for the third peak justifying the add value of using probabilistic forecasts compared to deterministic realizations while the fmm and raw ensembles evidently underestimate the third heavy rainfall event june 30th july 2nd overall both the fmm and analog ensembles show an improvement in precipitation magnitude while the analog ensemble also improves the spatial distribution the time series of daily streamflow simulations at the 2 d leadtime fig 13 shows that the cgdpa forced streamflow simulation has the best performance with the highest nsec of 0 67 while the ensemble mean of the analog fmm and raw ensembles underestimates the first streamflow peak around july 6th which is probably resulted from the underestimated precipitation forecasts during the flood period fig 12 streamflow suddenly increases during june 30th to july 2nd which can only be simulated by the maximum analog ensemble member consistent with the precipitation forecasts fig 12 in addition a spurious second streamflow peak around july 12th generated in all three ensembles is probably associated with the overestimation of the corresponding precipitation the situation may be caused by the uncertainty of model parameters and physical processes especially the failure of simulating the slow recession in the observed streamflow after precipitation bias correction the skill nsce 0 46 of the analog ensemble mean shows a significant improvement in streamflow simulations compared with the raw ensemble mean nsce 0 12 indicating the potential ability of the analog method in predicting severe flood however evident error still could be observed even though streamflow simulation of extreme events has been improved the few cases of torrential rain and extreme floods such as the 2003 flood events in historical data especially in the training dataset may limit the performance of precipitation correction method the accuracy of the calibration process and the final outcome of streamflow prediction 7 summary and discussions as the reforecast data is generated by a fixed nwpmodel after long time running it has a stable systematic error which could be used for bias correction with long term training data besides the reforecast ensemble can provide more useful information for hydrological predictions which require historical forecasts and observations over decades to calibrate hydrological models aiming at the improvements of the reforecast ensemble in simulating daily streamflow over the upper huaihe river basin precipitation bias correction using the fmm and analog methods were examined during the 2000 2010 summer both precipitation forecasts and streamflow simulations were comprehensively assessed before and after bias correction in general the precipitation reforecast ensemble showed the spatial distribution errors and underestimated the precipitation amount even though the streamflow simulations forced by precipitation ensemble forecasts showed skill for the 1 3 d leadtime they severely underestimated the observed peak discharge which are very critical for hydrometeorological decision making systems also the streamflow ensemble driven by the raw ensemble precipitation was underdispersive resulting in low performance of probabilistic streamflow simulations thus it is necessary to conduct bias correction in the reforecast ensemble precipitation forecasts to better the application of the reforecast ensemble in the hydrological simulations the role of precipitation bias correction on the hydrological modeling highly depends on the methodology of bias correction the fmm method mainly improved the forecast precipitation magnitude and the precipitation occurrence at light rain and heavy rain thresholds the improved analog method enhanced the spatial patterns favoring the characteristics of distributed hydrological model the probabilistic forecasts for both bias correction methods were improved especially for heavy and torrential rain for a relatively high resolution distributed hydrological model small scale information is more important the improvement in the spatial distribution of precipitation greatly enhanced the forecast skill of bias corrected precipitation forecasts for the analog method the spatial downscaling the 0 25 0 25 grid of cgdpa improved the forecast discriminating ability of the raw reforecast ensemble at the 1 1 resolution in particular for heavy events the effective forecast length of ensemble precipitation forecasts in hydrological application varies with the precipitation bias correction methods the improvement of the fmm method on streamflow simulation was limited within the 2 d leadtime thus the application of the fmm method in streamflow simulations still needs further improvements especially for heavy flood events for the improved analog method the construction of analog members was adjusted based on the spatial correlation and the forecast error over the specified basin while the improvement of precipitation forecasts by the basic analog method was limited although the 1 1 resolution of the reforecast data was much coarser than that of hydrological model 0 25 0 25 the analog method could improve precipitation ensemble forecasts to the 5 d leadtime by using the high resolution observation data to better the spatial representation of precipitation distributions in the distributed hydrological model therefore the careful selection of bias correction methods and the refinement of bias correction procedure are very important to obtain improved streamflow outputs in the distributed hydrological models different precipitation bias correction methods contribute to various results in streamflow simulation indicating the significant impact of original precipitation forecasts and bias correction methods on the rainfall runoff process for postprocessing low resolution gefs reforecast data in this study the analog method outperforms the fmm method by providing downscaling information at a finer scale which is extremely important for better representation of spatial precipitation distributions in distributed hydrological models overall the reforecast ensemble has great potential in hydrologic applications which could be applied to other hydrologic models and regions for the future work other post processing methods could be implemented on precipitation forecasts and streamflow simulations for better simulation results besides the temperature and wind speed data of the reforecast ensemble could be used as the input forcing instead of the observed data in the streamflow simulation by the vic model credit authorship contribution statement chunlei yang methodology resources data curation formal analysis visualization investigation

5316,tracer injection is a common technique in the studies of chemical transport in streams and channels one of its limitations is the requirement of frequent sampling for representative tracer breakthrough data frequent collection and analysis of water samples are normally expensive and time consuming the measurement of electrical conductivity ec is a potential alternative to sample collection and analyses because of its ease of data acquisition but whether the ec value can characterize the injected solute concentration requires further evaluation this article assesses the ability of ec to predict solute concentrations in tracer injections two injection studies were conducted in two separate flumes an instantaneous injection of phosphorus p and bromide br in a 20 m flume and a constant injection of p in a 10 m flume water samples were collected intensively at multiple locations and ec was automatically and continuously recorded using a linear model a solute breakthrough was calculated based on recorded ec and compared to the measured solute concentrations the results showed that the ec solute relationship can reduce the number of water samples needed for an accurate solute breakthrough a small sample of paired recorded ec and solute concentrations can be used to build a model for each tracer study by collecting at least 9 water samples at specific times i e at shoulder peak and tail of a breakthrough curve a simple regression model can efficiently predict p concentrations the correlation is 80 or greater between predicted and observed concentrations confirming that ec successfully traced p presence in water and can be used to facilitate tracer injection studies keywords solute transport tracer study tracer injection electrical conductivity phosphorus linear model 1 introduction in stream simulations of solute transport are an effective approach to characterize the fate and transport of contaminants in surface and subsurface waters chiogna et al 2011 these simulations are usually performed through instantaneous or constant tracer injections using either conservative tracers to assess advective dispersive processes or reactive tracers in order to evaluate chemical and biological in stream processes e g photolysis and sorption keefe et al 2004 during tracer injection experiments solute or tracer concentration in water is frequently the observed parameter it is quantified through the collection and subsequent analyses of water samples at multiple locations along the stream the changes in concentration in space and over time are indicative of the solute transport exchange and transformation processes wagner and harvey 1997 to properly portray those changes tracer experiments require a large number of measurements detailed solute breakthrough curves btcs are also critical for characterizing residence time and transient storage in streams gooseff et al 2008b more frequent data collection is then always preferable in tracer injection experiments which coupled with an accurate analytical process can reduce the uncertainty of solute behavior in flowing waters wagner and harvey 1997 however the collection and analyses of water samples in tracer studies rarely allow for the desired accuracy because of the limited temporal resolution moreover they are normally expensive and time consuming which limit the usefulness of this technique the purpose of this study was to evaluate an alternative methodology to characterize solute transport in tracer injection experiments electrical conductivity ec is being suggested as a potential surrogate for the collection and analysis of water samples because it is a direct and easily obtainable measurement because ec represents the ionic content in water united states geological survey 2015 ec fluctuations reflect the changes in solute concentrations serving as a proxy to evaluate the movement of contaminants and solutes of interest downstream the ease of ec measurements increases data resolution of the btc enhancing the level of details provided by tracer injection experiments gooseff and mcglynn 2005 the increasing interest in mitigating the effects of pollutants in aquatic environments requires a comprehensive understanding of solute transport transformations and storage for which tracer injections are an effective technique because of the described limitations of tracer injections alternative criteria for assessing transport characteristics are critical for the further development and broader application of tracer studies ec has the potential for being the evaluated parameter in in stream nutrient dynamics studies because 1 it is a natural tracer allowing the examination of long term data seasonally or annually 2 it provides distinct information on short term variations of dissolved solute and 3 it can be a direct indication of contaminants cox et al 2007 1 1 existing tracers in injection studies both in stream instantaneous or constant injections use natural or artificial tracers compounds and isotopes cox et al 2007 the specific type of tracer used in a tracer injection experiment will primarily depend on the purpose of the study for instance conservative tracers are normally used to estimate residence time or to improve the understanding of flow paths schemel et al 2006 reactive tracers can be used for example to estimate residence time or uptake length payn et al 2005 of a nutrient or contaminant of interest the most common natural tracer used in tracer studies in streams is temperature vogt et al 2010 heat transport is considered a useful technique to investigate streambed water exchanges cox et al 2007 constantz 2008 however vogt et al 2010 argued that the temperature variation is a sub optimal parameter because heat transport can be delayed according to the porosity and thermal properties of the streambed other researchers tested a myriad of tracers including dyes such as fluorescin and resazurin lemke et al 2013 bencala et al 1983 despite providing a rapid estimate of travel time in streams a limitation of this technique is the fact that these substances are photo degrading lemke et al 2013 stream solute workshop 1990 nevertheless the use of dyes is a convenient alternative whenever great background concentrations are present runkel 2015 another example is rhodamine wt a nonconservative tracer traditionally used to estimate travel times bencala et al 1983 runkel 2015 cited errors in the investigation of residence time and transient storage because rhodamine wt is affected by sorption the author indicated that rhodamine wt should not be used in studies of small systems natural solutes such as calcium ca 2 chloride cl magnesium mg 2 manganese mn 2 silicon si 4 strontium sr2 phosphate po4 3 and sulfate so4 2 have also been used as tracers schemel et al 2006 generally it is convenient to apply both a conservative and a reactive tracer smith 2009 gooseff and mcglynn 2005 keefe et al 2004 lemke et al 2013 e g cl and ca 2 or br and po4 3 aiming to properly describe nutrient dynamics in flowing waters i e the physical chemical and biological processes once again the difficulties attributed to the timely collection of samples costs and labor associated with their analysis can hinder the thorough understanding of nutrient dynamics instead of collecting water samples some of the studies use ion selective sensors zhang et al 2019 sobotkova and snehota 2014 however richards et al 2015 argued that because of large analytical errors in some applications ion selective electrodes can only be used to optimize sample collection or to provide gross estimates of contamination a more recent approach uses natural isotopes as tracers without the introduction of artificial compounds isotopic in stream tracer studies are advantageous in comparison to the stable compounds because they provide information about the nutrient observed in natural concentrations this information is not normally obtained in nutrient injections because the elevated concentrations of the injected solute might induce a larger uptake not representing naturally occurring conditions payn et al 2005 however the costs associated with isotope analysis limit the use of this technique the tracers able to provide the most detailed and temporally precise information are often preferred the most used tracers such as the ones discussed above are all associated with an intrinsic limitation which can restrain the use and evolution of the tracer injection technique ec can be an alternative to these tracers as it has an immediate response to ion fluctuations in water for example in the great miami river ec was highly correlated with chloride cl in the river and in the aquifer r2 0 94 sheets et al 2002 the authors concluded that ec is a representative and valuable parameter in measuring travel times from a river to a production well in another tracer study schemel et al 2006 observed a large correlation of the elements ca 2 mg 2 si 4 mn 2 cl and so4 2 with ec in all samples reporting an r 0 994 except for mn 2 for which r 0 977 gooseff and mcglynn 2005 were also interested in the extent to which ec reflected ion concentrations in streams after injecting a solution of libr in a catchment followed by the collection of water samples and ec measurements the authors established an ion concentration electrical conductivity relationship by using the results from the i br ec relationship and ii the br concentrations in water samples separately the authors evaluated the difference in parameters generated by a solute transport simulation one dimensional transport with inflow and storage otis gooseff and mcglynn 2005 concluded that the br ec data produced the best results in the simulations attributing that to the refined representation of the shoulder and tail of the breakthrough curve produced by the br ec data however difficulties can also emerge from the exclusive use of ec for example ec is prone to diurnal variations which are especially noticeable at low river water levels and warmer temperature environments vogt et al 2010 although vogt et al 2010 argued that seasonal fluctuations dominate the diurnal ones the latter must be considered when collecting ec measurements additionally specifically in tracer injection experiments we hypothesize that ec will not always indicate the injected nutrient evolution along the stream for example when the existent nutrient mixture in solution is pronounced these natural components may mask the injected solute variations this can occur for example in catchments with amended soils or in those with a greater interaction with hyporheic zones and groundwater systems in the latter case subsurface hydrology can influence the extent to which ec reflects solute concentrations serving as source and sink flowpaths for these solutes negative and positive hydraulic gradients drainage and seepage respectively influence solute transport in streams by driving stream water into the bed or allowing subsurface water into the channel gooseff et al 2008a the net effect of these exchange patterns will dictate solute concentrations in the stream altering their preeminence in water and hence influencing the ec solute relationship 1 2 aims of this study it was the aim of this study to establish a relationship between ec and dissolved phosphorus p concentrations i e the fraction of the total phosphorus in solution measured from water samples collected in tracer injection experiments we intended to develop a methodology to decrease the number of samples to be collected and at the same time to increase the precision in studying nutrient dynamics based on an easily obtainable parameter specifically the hypotheses for this work were ec measurements can effectively predict p concentrations instantaneous and constant injections will not significantly differ in terms of the ability of ec to predict p concentrations the efficiency of the model will depend on the subsurface hydrology with decreased model efficiency for seepage conditions under the same subsurface hydrology a greater injected concentration of p will produce a better fit of the model and streams with active ionic sources introduce an additional limitation for estimating the model 2 methods the conducted tracer injection experiments are described in fig 1 where each treatment is represented by one horizontal sequence in the figure these experiments produced the data that were used for developing the ec solute methodology and are further discussed in sections 2 1 and 2 2 2 1 study 1 bromide br and phosphorus p instantaneous injection study sediment clay loam loamy sand and sand collected from an agricultural ditch matson ditch northeast indiana was added to a 20 m flume fig 2 separated into four 5 m sections major soil types surrounding the sampling site are blount and glynwood soils ph ranged from 5 6 to 7 3 ditch sediment samples were collected by removing 5 cm of benthic sediment from the ditch bottom a mechanism of water table control was added to the flume to simulate different subsurface hydrological conditions during the tracer injections the stream bed was either set to drainage at a rate of 440 ml min 1 or 880 ml min 1 per 5 m flume segment saturation or seepage at a rate of 440 ml min 1 or 880 ml min 1 per 5 m flume segment representing a losing stream a disconnected stream and a gaining stream respectively the rates of vertical flow addition or subtraction were chosen as being approximately 10 or 20 of the total incoming flow rates a sufficient amount to maintain constant horizontal and vertical flows throughout the experiment a solution of 100 mg of p as kh2po4 and 200 mg of br as nabr in deionized water was instantaneously added to the flume input for each of the tested hydrological conditions two replicates were performed the total run time for the drainage treatments was approximately 75 min under seepage and saturation the duration of the injection experiments was around 40 min 1 1 durations were previously defined according to the time a dye was transported through the flume under the respective subsurface hydrological condition surface water samples were automatically collected at 5 10 15 and 20 meters every one minute and ec was measured through handheld ec meters reed instruments model sd 4307 installed at the same locations and at the flume input the ec meters were configured to log real time conductivity data every 5 s soluble p concentrations in filtered 0 45 μ m filter and acidified samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes br concentrations were analyzed colorimetrically using lachat quikchem 8500 series 2 also after filtering 0 45 μ m and acidifying the samples 2 2 study 2 phosphorus p constant injection study a series of constant p injections was conducted in a four segment 10 m flume fig 3 the flume was initially filled with the same ditch sediment as the one used in study 1 5 cm deep and in the second and third segments sections 2 and 3 steel slag was added above the sediment layer 2 2 steel slag is a residue of steel production with a chemical affinity for p penn et al 2017 the original purpose of the experiments was to test the effectiveness of steel slag in pollutant p removal the produced data is being further explored in this current research with a different objective the results regarding p sorption efficacy of steel slag can be reviewed in chagas 2015 that way sections 1 and 4 are simulating a situation before and after a strong chemical interaction with alien media while sections 2 and 3 represent regions where an active ionic source is present similarly to the instantaneous injections subsurface hydrology varied in this study as well as nutrient load two hydrological conditions of stream channels were simulated in this study drainage and saturation representing a losing and a disconnected stream respectively two p concentrations were constantly injected 1 and 5 mg l 1 in deionized water for each condition defined by the subsurface hydrology and p concentration combined two replicates were performed along the flume four locations 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 m were monitored by collecting water samples and measuring ec in the 240 min experiments water samples were collected every 6 min while ec was measured every 5 s ec data were also collected at the inflow location the water samples were processed through 0 45 μ m filtration following acidification 0 1 ml of 50 hcl and then analyzed for p content using icp oes 2 3 data analysis and model development ec versus solute concentration fig 4 summarizes the operations that were conducted in this part of the study the model development is detailed below because two tracers were simultaneously added in study 1 br and p as po3 4 we first needed to evaluate whether br and p were significantly correlated step 1 in fig 4 such correlation would indicate whether br and p breakthrough curves behaved similarly and therefore whether ec fluctuations could explain the behavior of either solute that way if correlation was significant only one of the solutes could be used to build the ec solute models although br and p are respectively a conservative and a reactive tracer the analyses of the water samples provided evidence of similar behavior of both tracers therefore a linear association between them was expected a simple pearson s correlation test proved that p and br were significantly linearly correlated in all experimental conditions data not shown sample sizes varied between 20 and 40 depending on experimental condition ec versus concentration models could then be developed based on either br or p because both solutes behaved similarly along the flume as confirmed by their significant correlation p was chosen for two reasons i it is a solute of great interest in nutrient transport process studies and ii it would allow for direct comparisons between the instantaneous and constant injection experiments studies 1 and 2 respectively because only p was injected in the latter a linear regression model with p concentrations and ec as the dependent and independent variables respectively was developed for each sampling location in studies 1 and 2 all linear models have the form shown in eq 1 with β 0 representing the background interference and β 1 as the slope of the relationship between p concentration and ec measurements ε is the statistical error term 1 p concentration mg l 1 β 0 β 1 ec μ s ε subsets with different numbers of paired p and ec data points were selected as the model inputs step 2 in fig 4 the intention was to choose a subset representative of the breakthrough curve but at the same time to find the least amount of data points necessary to build a robust model specifically shoulder peak and tail are essential for the characterization of a breakthrough curve hence we focused on selecting data points located in these regions we produced models with n 5 7 9 and 15 observations aiming to define the marginal gains in model fitting we chose the minimal number of observations n 5 for the reduced dataset as being between 12 5 and 25 of the total number of observations the total number of water samples collected in each experiment varied between 20 in study 1 and 40 in study 2 in a tracer injection this would mean at least 75 fewer water samples to be collected in studies that employ the ec p methodology then n 7 9 and 15 were chosen as gradual increases from the reduced subset as they represent 40 80 and 200 more samples to be collected respectively for the evaluation of the optimal sample size only data from samplers 1 and 4 from both studies 1 and 2 were used once the optimal number of data points was established the models for the remaining sections sections 2 and 3 were developed the models were then validated using the replicates conducted under the same experimental conditions hence four models per experiment one per each sampling station were developed for one replicate using the optimal sample size of the coupled ec p dataset after developing the models the residuals were examined for possible violations associated with autocorrelation particularly because the dataset is a time series prone to show data tendencies and sequence pattern the existence of heteroscedasticity i e inconstant variance in the error terms was also examined because of the possible increasing influence that previous sections or adjacent data might have had on the individual data points residuals were also investigated in terms of normality for all performed tests an α level of 0 05 was employed kolmogorov smirnov test was used to verify normality of residuals no issues were identified and the overall conclusion was that the residuals from all models came from normal distributions and no transformations were necessary the existence of autocorrelation was evaluated through the durbin watson test α 0 05 h0 true autocorrelation is 0 when appropriate cochrane orcutt was the methodology used for correcting autocorrelation in the residuals this is a standard procedure in case of first order autocorrelation which was proven to be the case for the residuals where autocorrelation was identified in this work once the models were corrected for anomalies they were applied to the complete ec dataset of the respective experiment and its replicate step 3 in fig 4 by applying the model to the complete ec dataset we obtained the calculated p concentrations a more detailed breakthrough dataset step 4 in fig 4 through the validation procedure we were able to evaluate the replicability of the ec p relationship and whether the same model could be used in other experiments conducted under similar experimental conditions the calculated p datasets were then compared to the observed p in water samples step 5 in fig 4 furthermore we also developed general models using all data collected from the same sampling location regardless of hydrological conditions e g all data collected on autosampler 1 in all experiments with this analysis we aimed to evaluate the possibility of building one single model for any tracer addition experiment that way one same model developed for a particular station could be used for these and future tracer injections without the need to collect any water samples for p concentration analysis 3 results throughout this section we reported the results obtained from the first and last sampling stations i e the injection point and the most distant location specifically looking into the possible solute dilution and legacy effect on the ec p relationship sections 3 1 and 3 2 describe the results obtained through the methodology shown in fig 4 in sections 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 we compared the ec p models efficacy according to the type of tracer injection sampling location and subsurface hydrology respectively we then evaluated the effects of adding the alien media to the channel section 3 6 and finally we discussed the results obtained from the general models in section 3 7 3 1 identifying the optimal sample size for model development by comparing the models built with different dataset sizes n 5 7 9 and 15 data points the objective was to determine the marginal gain of adding more data points and how that gain would vary according to i the hydrological condition and ii sampling location fig 5 shows a visual example of the calculations the graphs depict the results for both instantaneous and constant injections under saturation and saturation 1 mg l 1 conditions i e study 1 experiment 3 and study 2 experiment 2 3 3 the results for the other hydrological conditions can be found in appendix a respectively in the first sampling location sampler 1 there was no considerable difference among the models in terms of fit however in the last sampling location the larger variation among the different models is clear possibly caused by the legacy effects developed as the injected solute traveled throughout the flume visually the models built with larger datasets n 9 n 15 were able to best capture the variability and values of observed p concentrations these observations were also true for the remaining hydrological conditions although the data variability in the last sampling location was more pronounced under saturation despite the impression given by fig 5 of better fits when using the larger sample sizes there was no unique tendency in model improvement by increasing the number of data points as measured by r2 table 1 shows the models produced with reduced datasets as described in step 2 of fig 4 the coefficient of determination and significance for each experimental condition from a total of 18 different models 11 showed little or no marginal gain on the fit of the model when increasing the number of data points 4 showed a continuous improvement when adding more data points and in 3 of them this improvement was limited to n 9 as measured by r2 in developing the models we also observed a more frequent occurrence of autocorrelation in the residuals as we increased the number of data points such behavior was expected because by increasing the number of data points we increased the number of adjacent values in the time series in these types of sequential data the assumption of independence of residuals is often not guaranteed bence 1995 on the other hand when derived from the smaller dataset n 5 some of the models were not significant as measured by the f test for overall significance hence there is a notable trade off in selecting the number of data points to build the model using a small set of data e g n 5 may suggest a lack of representativity of the breakthrough curve and possibly lack of normality while a larger dataset e g n 15 may introduce serious model inadequacies such as serial correlation in the residuals the resolution to this trade off was to choose between the intermediate dataset sizes n 7 and n 9 between the intermediate sample sizes evaluated in this study n 7 and n 9 n 9 was deemed the most appropriate for two main reasons i the majority of the models showed an increase in fit as the number of data points increased from n 7 to n 9 and ii some models showed inferior fit once n 9 suggesting that n 9 was the optimal size for these models additionally for future applications of the ec p methodology collecting 9 samples for p concentration analysis instead of 7 improves the chances of getting precise information about the points of interest in a breakthrough curve 3 2 studies 1 2 evaluating replicability of models after defining a standard sample size n 9 as described in section 3 1 we conducted a validation procedure using the second replicate of each hydrological condition and sampling location the validation consisted of applying the model that was developed for replicate 1 to the ec data of replicate 2 resulting in a calculated p concentration dataset in table 1 the column labeled ρ indicates the pearson s correlation coefficient between the observed p concentrations and the p concentrations calculated in the validation procedure ρ was significantly large in the majority of the experimental conditions and no tendency was identified when comparing sampling locations or experiments we initially expected that ρ would decrease with increasing distance from the injection point because of tracer dilution and contribution of the existent media soil and slag with dissolved solids to the solution the reasoning for this expectation of decrease in correlation levels is described next in instantaneous injections influent water dilutes the concentrations of the injected solute wlostowski et al 2017 as the bulk of the injected solute travels farther from the injection location the effect of dilution increasingly influences the solute concentrations in the system total mass of solute is unaltered by dilution when the solute is diluted to similar levels as natural ions in solution ec is not able to capture the signal of the solute of interest and correlation between observed and predicted p is penalized a decrease in correlation levels was also expected as influent water interacted with the soil and the slag media because of the exchange of ions between the existent media and water as water traveled through the flume we expected a lesser predominance of the injected solute hindering ec solute coupling both in instantaneous and constant injections however when comparing the first and last sampling locations in the 18 evaluated models the correlation coefficient increased in 6 and decreased in only 2 table 1 this suggests that distance from the injection location did not have the expected effect on calculated p concentrations in fact for both autosamplers 1 and 4 the large values of ρ indicate the models ability to successfully predict p concentrations the comparison between sampling stations in terms of model fit is further discussed in section 3 4 the validation procedure elucidates aspects of reliability and replicability of the models which in practice translates to whether that model can be used in similar injection experiments conducted under the same experimental conditions overall the models were replicable when used for similar experimental conditions as measured by ρ this result confirms the ability of ec to predict p concentrations and illustrates the possibility of using the same model developed under certain conditions in future tracer injection experiments conducted under the same conditions 3 3 studies 1 2 comparison between constant and instantaneous injections figs 6 8 show a comparison between the calculated and the observed p concentrations for all injections they suggest that the ec p methodology was able to adequately predict p concentrations throughout both constant and instantaneous injections nevertheless because of the minor fluctuations in p concentrations in study 2 the level of details added through using the more frequent ec data may not be as relevant as in study 1 still the possibility of collecting significantly fewer water samples and still be able to produce a detailed dataset is an advantage in any tracer study the figures also show the results for the general model s estimation which will be discussed in later sections despite the visually equivalent fits when measured by r2 the models based on the instantaneous injection data study 1 in general display a better fit when compared to the models developed for the constant injections study 2 as shown in table 1 this response was expected because of the stronger signal produced when p is introduced at once i e during the instantaneous injections in these tracer experiments ec fluctuations more accurately reflected p concentrations as p became the most prominent element in solution in comparison to background concentrations it is also notable that when the signal is stronger in study 2 i e greater level of p concentration model performance is similar to that seen for study 1 for instance in table 1 the model fit for saturation 5 mg l 1 study 2 experiment 1 is superior to the model fit found for saturation 1 mg l 1 study 2 experiment 2 and similar improvement is evident when we compare drainage 1 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 experiments 3 and 4 of study 2 therefore the success of the ec solute technique depends on the preeminence of the tracer in comparison to ambient solution composition rather than on the type of injection regarding the slopes of the models β 1 they were positive in all instantaneous injections study 1 meaning that p concentrations and ec were positively correlated such behavior was expected because by increasing any ion concentrations in solution ec is expected to respond in the same direction however in the constant additions five out of eight models had a negative slope a plausible reason is the fact that the fluctuations in p concentrations were not strong enough to be precisely captured by ec once a condition of quasi steady state is attained in the constant additions in contrast in the instantaneous injections the p signal was strong enough to explain most of the ec variations in the flume another unique characteristic of the constant additions was the presence of alien media in sections 2 and 3 that contributed to a considerable increase in ec values because of dissolved elements from the media without a concurrent increase in p concentrations the influence of the added media to the ec p relationship is discussed in section 3 6 we observed an overestimation of the peak on the first sampling location of the instantaneous saturation and seepage study 1 experiments 1 2 and 3 conditions and a slight underestimation of peak p concentrations in the last sampler of instantaneous seepage 880 ml min 1 study 1 experiment 1 as seen in figs 6 8 although the differences were less than 2 mg l 1 in all cases these deviations from the true observed p concentrations may interfere with the understanding of in stream uptake or nutrient adsorption to filtering media for example covino et al 2010 discussed that nutrient uptake i e biological retention efficiency has been shown to decrease with elevated concentrations that way because of the overestimation of the peaks in some of the ec p models the ec solute technique may be not as recommendable for tasks such as nutrient spiraling metrics in such tasks the predicted elevated concentrations would potentially generate misled results indicating lower uptake rates in comparison to the real uptake rates instantaneous and constant additions are normally difficult to be directly compared although some critical differences regarding transient storage and flushing patterns have been reported in the literature payn et al 2008 gooseff et al 2008b when defining the type of tracer addition to perform constant or instantaneous the decision must be based on the type of information expected from the experiments rather than how they behave in model fitting payn et al 2008 our study however showed that both methodologies may provide satisfactory data for the ec p technique as long as the injected solute is preeminent in comparison to the background ionic content 3 4 studies 1 2 comparison between sampling locations 3 4 1 effect of distance from injection location the effect of distance from injection location on the efficacy of the ec p models was evaluated as the difference in model fit according to the sampling station we observed a decrease in goodness of fit from the first to the last sampling locations in 7 of the 9 simulations study 1 experiments 2 and 5 were the two hydrological conditions in which this reduction was not observed this observation implies that the model fit is affected by the distance from the injection point which can be explained threefold i background solution composition ii legacy effects of existent media and existent solution and iii p dilution these three aspects impact the p signal relative to the other ions in solution again we come back to the finding that the injected solute must be the predominant ion for building a successful ec solute coupling as the solute travels downstream its levels are confounded with other ionic species in solution so it is more difficult for the model to predict p concentrations when farther from the injection location it is notable however that the observed decrease in fit in more distant locations was not accompanied by a significant decrease in correlation between observed and predicted solute concentrations when the model was applied to the replicate experiments section 3 2 this implies that the loss in goodness of fit caused by distance did not significantly affect the ability to predict p concentrations for future application of the ec solute methodology we suggest that the farther the sampling location is in comparison to the injection location the more influence the background concentrations the legacy effects of the existent media and solute dilution will have on the ec solute model fit despite the worse fit we showed that models developed for farther stations performed well when predicting p concentrations 3 4 2 modified models zero intercepts as we compared the models built for autosampler 1 and models for autosampler 4 we could see clear trends regarding the intercept of the models intercepts were always smaller in the first sampling location when compared to the last one in study 2 in contrast in study 1 intercepts were larger in the first sampling location in comparison to the last the intercept can be interpreted as the expected mean value of p concentrations conditional to an ec value in cases when ec is 0 4 4 ec in water is virtually 0 exclusively when there are no salts in solution i e distilled water p concentrations should also be 0 which is a plausible reason for forcing the intercept to 0 and obtain a physical meaning for this parameter to check this rationale we estimated models with zero intercepts using the same datasets 5 5 figures are shown in appendix b however the new models showed a marked decrease in fitting particularly in the constant injections we discussed in section 3 3 that in instantaneous injections the p signal was strong enough to be precisely captured by the ec fluctuations we believe that this is also the reason why the zero intercept models show a better fit in study 1 in comparison to study 2 in all cases the models with non zero intercept were more descriptive of the observed data this is the reason why we decided to maintain the original models non zero intercept however by using the original models we observed negative values of p concentrations in the calculated datasets in two of the constant injections saturation 5 mg l 1 autosampler 4 and saturation 1 mg l 1 autosampler 4 in the validation procedure the constant injections drainage 1 mg l 1 autosampler 4 and saturation 5 mg l 1 as well as the instantaneous injection drainage 440 ml min 1 also had negative calculated p concentrations in general negative values of concentration are a common issue in collected water samples analysis because of possible errors of instrumentation or mistakes in sampling the same approaches to deal with these issues can be replicated when using the ec p technique in tracer injections 3 5 studies 1 2 effects of subsurface hydrology in general the effects of subsurface hydrology were not evident in the models saturation drainage and seepage exhibited equivalent results in terms of model adequacy we expected that the ec p relationship would be affected by the vertical flow rate because of the contribution from the media especially in the seepage condition as mentioned in section 2 1 under seepage the flow is supplemented by a vertical flow that travels upward through the stream bed and actively contributes with dissolved solutes from the media to the surface water our hypothesis was that this addition of dissolved solutes by the upward flow would increase ec without a concurrent increase in p concentrations resulting in a worse fit of the model in comparison to the other subsurface hydrological conditions yet no clear trend could be identified to corroborate that hypothesis nonetheless within the subsurface hydrological conditions the difference between levels of p concentration was noticeable in fact the smallest values of r2 were produced in the experiments that used the smallest level of p concentration constant saturation and drainage 1 mg l 1 study 2 experiments 2 and 4 in comparison to their counterparts 5 mg l 1 the r2 was considerably less in both sampling locations this observation substantiates the hypothesis that a stronger signal can indicate a greater capability of ec to respond to p concentrations in practice these findings show that ec p models can be successfully developed regardless of the subsurface hydrological condition facilitating their use in most streams and flumes 3 6 study 2 effects of an active source of solutes because steel slag was added to sections 2 and 3 of the experimental flume in study 2 the p dynamics and ec measurement scale in these sections differed in comparison to the remaining sections and to the instantaneous injections steel slag noticeably added dissolved solids to the nutrient mixture because of the presence of soluble minerals in its composition at the same time that it was able to reduce dissolved p content in water chagas 2015 hence it was expected that the bulk of the solutes in water would be derived from the slag dissolution rather than p fluctuations this would result in a weak correlation between ec and p concentrations after section 2 of the constant injection experiments as established in section 3 3 the fit of the models for section 4 autosampler 4 did differ in comparison to section 1 autosampler 1 we hypothesized that steel slag presence contributed to the reduction of the fit of the models however the extension of slag interference in that reduction i e the legacy effect of steel slag on the following sections was unclear as an active source of solutes slag contributes mainly with ca 2 and oh to water systems increasing ph the calcium content of solution and consequently ec the ca 2 forms precipitates with po4 3 the soluble form of p then p concentrations decrease despite an increase in ec derived from the additions from the soluble minerals we suggest that this reduction in dissolved p was in part responsible for the reduced fit in the last sampling location in figs 6 and 7 that p concentration reduction may have produced for example the underestimation of the initial concentrations extreme negative values in sampler 4 the models developed for sections 2 and 3 in the constant injections are shown in table 3 it is clear that ec was not able to explain the p variations as it did in sections 1 and 4 the most satisfactory model fittings occurred when a greater concentration of p was injected mainly in the drainage condition this suggests that the downward drainage flow was able to carry dissolved solids out of the ambient solution unmasking p variations in water after the slag sections the relationship between ec p recovered in all experiments which suggested that the interference of the artificial media was rapidly attenuated in conclusion the existence of artificial media acting as an active source of solutes hinders the ec solute relationship as it contributes to dissolved solids in the solution as a result ec responds to their presence rather than to the injected solute 3 7 general models up to this point we have developed site specific models according to the sampling locations and experimental treatments however in a practical sense it would be useful to develop a general model able to predict p concentrations in any tracer injection to occur in the same stream or flume reach 6 6 we emphasize the preference for a model per stream or flume instead of a general model for any reach because of the inherent variability along a reach and the ambient nutrient levels characteristic of a specific experimental location payn et al 2005 that way water samples for p concentration analysis would be collected only once and ec would be the exclusive measured parameter in future tracer injections in that pursuit we built models for sampling locations 1 and 4 regardless of hydrological condition two models were developed per type of injection using the same datasets from the individual models but this time compiled per sampling station after developing the models we applied them to the entire ec dataset of each condition and compared to the site specific models the results are shown in table 4 and in figs 6 8 along with the site specific models and the observed p concentrations because the estimated coefficients shown in table 1 varied among hydrological conditions and also among the different sampling locations we expected a reduction in model fit especially for constant injections great variability in intercept and slope of the lines in figs 6 8 a clear dislocation from the observed data can be visualized in the new breakthrough curves particularly in samplers 4 based on our findings we saw enough reasons for building site specific models by collecting fewer water samples in every tracer addition instead of using a general model with no collected samples this confirmed that it is not adequate to have ec being used as the sole parameter in a tracer injection i e as a true surrogate but rather to be used as an instrument to build robust models with the main parameter of interest the concentration of the injected solute 4 conclusions this research evaluated the performance of ec in predicting p concentrations in tracer injection experiments models developed for each sampling location using a few water samples n 9 as input data were able to accurately describe p behavior along the flumes the ec solute technique was able to i diminish the number of water samples to be collected facilitating the operations in tracer addition studies and ii improve the resolution of btc curves potentially enhancing the characterization of tracer dynamics through more detailed datasets our findings suggested that the primary condition for building efficient models between ec and solute concentrations is the preeminence of these concentrations in comparison to other solutes that way the solute of interest will respond to the bulk of the ec variations resulting in a well correlated relationship the results from this work indicated that ec and p in tracer injections are highly correlated under natural circumstances their relationship can satisfactorily be used for building more precise and detailed breakthrough curves we suggest that the proposed methodology of collecting fewer water samples and relying on the ec tracer correlation is an inexpensive useful and efficient technique to characterize reactive transport and biogeochemical cycling in streams and flumes from this study we found that the ec p relationship is not significantly affected by subsurface hydrology although the interactions between the channel bed and flowing water can be significantly influenced by the subsurface hydrological conditions of the stream we did not observe a consistent variability in model fit when comparing the different subsurface hydrological conditions lack of perfect fit of the ec solute models as measured by r2 were mainly caused by a weaker signal of the injected solute because of i the distance to the injection point with more distant sampling stations showing a decrease in the fit of the models and ii active sources of solutes in the flume the main implication of the proposed methodology is that it facilitates the conduction of tracer injection experiments in terms of labor and costs the trade off is that samples must be collected at specific times and locations along the btc curve that way a representative ec p relationship can be built according to the dominant transport processes occurring in the stream future research includes the application of the ec solute technique in other types of water bodies such as aquifers wetlands and larger systems the use of ec solute models in great background concentrations or in injections in which the trace signal is not preeminent are the main limitations of this technique overall the main conclusions of this work were i ec could effectively predict p concentrations in p injection experiments ii ec p models showed a better fit in instantaneous injections in comparison to constant injections which was explained by the stronger signal that p exerts on solution composition in the former type of injection iii the fit of the model was not influenced by the subsurface hydrological condition meaning that saturation seepage and drainage showed overall similar fit iv under the same subsurface hydrology greater injected concentrations resulted in a better fit of the models and v in the presence of an active source of solute i e steel slag the ability of ec to predict p concentrations was substantially weaker 5 recommendations below we list a methodology to facilitate the application of the ec solute technique and to support data quality for building the models in future tracer injections the ec p technique is recommended to be used in short stream reach distances that do not contain active sources of solutes first to obtain a clear ec solute relationship it is important to add an appreciable amount of solute able to protrude in comparison to ambient concentrations that amount will depend on the reach and on the natural levels of dissolved elements in solution second 9 samples should be collected across the entirety of the btc i e at shoulder peak and tail regions this demands a preceding understanding of streamflow at both injection location and the last sampling location 7 7 covino et al 2010 argued that conservative tracers released at the head of the reach cannot be used to calculate flow at the base of the reach because of tracer mass loss along the stream both locations should be measured that way researchers can estimate specific sampling time for the 9 water samples to be collected also throughout the injection experiment ec must be measured frequently which will contribute to a greater resolution of the curve finally select the ec values measured at the same time and location as the p concentrations for a paired ec solute subset this will be the training data used for building the ec p models the models can then be applied to the entire ec dataset to obtain calculated concentrations at the same frequency as ec was measured credit authorship contribution statement isis s p c scott conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft

5316,tracer injection is a common technique in the studies of chemical transport in streams and channels one of its limitations is the requirement of frequent sampling for representative tracer breakthrough data frequent collection and analysis of water samples are normally expensive and time consuming the measurement of electrical conductivity ec is a potential alternative to sample collection and analyses because of its ease of data acquisition but whether the ec value can characterize the injected solute concentration requires further evaluation this article assesses the ability of ec to predict solute concentrations in tracer injections two injection studies were conducted in two separate flumes an instantaneous injection of phosphorus p and bromide br in a 20 m flume and a constant injection of p in a 10 m flume water samples were collected intensively at multiple locations and ec was automatically and continuously recorded using a linear model a solute breakthrough was calculated based on recorded ec and compared to the measured solute concentrations the results showed that the ec solute relationship can reduce the number of water samples needed for an accurate solute breakthrough a small sample of paired recorded ec and solute concentrations can be used to build a model for each tracer study by collecting at least 9 water samples at specific times i e at shoulder peak and tail of a breakthrough curve a simple regression model can efficiently predict p concentrations the correlation is 80 or greater between predicted and observed concentrations confirming that ec successfully traced p presence in water and can be used to facilitate tracer injection studies keywords solute transport tracer study tracer injection electrical conductivity phosphorus linear model 1 introduction in stream simulations of solute transport are an effective approach to characterize the fate and transport of contaminants in surface and subsurface waters chiogna et al 2011 these simulations are usually performed through instantaneous or constant tracer injections using either conservative tracers to assess advective dispersive processes or reactive tracers in order to evaluate chemical and biological in stream processes e g photolysis and sorption keefe et al 2004 during tracer injection experiments solute or tracer concentration in water is frequently the observed parameter it is quantified through the collection and subsequent analyses of water samples at multiple locations along the stream the changes in concentration in space and over time are indicative of the solute transport exchange and transformation processes wagner and harvey 1997 to properly portray those changes tracer experiments require a large number of measurements detailed solute breakthrough curves btcs are also critical for characterizing residence time and transient storage in streams gooseff et al 2008b more frequent data collection is then always preferable in tracer injection experiments which coupled with an accurate analytical process can reduce the uncertainty of solute behavior in flowing waters wagner and harvey 1997 however the collection and analyses of water samples in tracer studies rarely allow for the desired accuracy because of the limited temporal resolution moreover they are normally expensive and time consuming which limit the usefulness of this technique the purpose of this study was to evaluate an alternative methodology to characterize solute transport in tracer injection experiments electrical conductivity ec is being suggested as a potential surrogate for the collection and analysis of water samples because it is a direct and easily obtainable measurement because ec represents the ionic content in water united states geological survey 2015 ec fluctuations reflect the changes in solute concentrations serving as a proxy to evaluate the movement of contaminants and solutes of interest downstream the ease of ec measurements increases data resolution of the btc enhancing the level of details provided by tracer injection experiments gooseff and mcglynn 2005 the increasing interest in mitigating the effects of pollutants in aquatic environments requires a comprehensive understanding of solute transport transformations and storage for which tracer injections are an effective technique because of the described limitations of tracer injections alternative criteria for assessing transport characteristics are critical for the further development and broader application of tracer studies ec has the potential for being the evaluated parameter in in stream nutrient dynamics studies because 1 it is a natural tracer allowing the examination of long term data seasonally or annually 2 it provides distinct information on short term variations of dissolved solute and 3 it can be a direct indication of contaminants cox et al 2007 1 1 existing tracers in injection studies both in stream instantaneous or constant injections use natural or artificial tracers compounds and isotopes cox et al 2007 the specific type of tracer used in a tracer injection experiment will primarily depend on the purpose of the study for instance conservative tracers are normally used to estimate residence time or to improve the understanding of flow paths schemel et al 2006 reactive tracers can be used for example to estimate residence time or uptake length payn et al 2005 of a nutrient or contaminant of interest the most common natural tracer used in tracer studies in streams is temperature vogt et al 2010 heat transport is considered a useful technique to investigate streambed water exchanges cox et al 2007 constantz 2008 however vogt et al 2010 argued that the temperature variation is a sub optimal parameter because heat transport can be delayed according to the porosity and thermal properties of the streambed other researchers tested a myriad of tracers including dyes such as fluorescin and resazurin lemke et al 2013 bencala et al 1983 despite providing a rapid estimate of travel time in streams a limitation of this technique is the fact that these substances are photo degrading lemke et al 2013 stream solute workshop 1990 nevertheless the use of dyes is a convenient alternative whenever great background concentrations are present runkel 2015 another example is rhodamine wt a nonconservative tracer traditionally used to estimate travel times bencala et al 1983 runkel 2015 cited errors in the investigation of residence time and transient storage because rhodamine wt is affected by sorption the author indicated that rhodamine wt should not be used in studies of small systems natural solutes such as calcium ca 2 chloride cl magnesium mg 2 manganese mn 2 silicon si 4 strontium sr2 phosphate po4 3 and sulfate so4 2 have also been used as tracers schemel et al 2006 generally it is convenient to apply both a conservative and a reactive tracer smith 2009 gooseff and mcglynn 2005 keefe et al 2004 lemke et al 2013 e g cl and ca 2 or br and po4 3 aiming to properly describe nutrient dynamics in flowing waters i e the physical chemical and biological processes once again the difficulties attributed to the timely collection of samples costs and labor associated with their analysis can hinder the thorough understanding of nutrient dynamics instead of collecting water samples some of the studies use ion selective sensors zhang et al 2019 sobotkova and snehota 2014 however richards et al 2015 argued that because of large analytical errors in some applications ion selective electrodes can only be used to optimize sample collection or to provide gross estimates of contamination a more recent approach uses natural isotopes as tracers without the introduction of artificial compounds isotopic in stream tracer studies are advantageous in comparison to the stable compounds because they provide information about the nutrient observed in natural concentrations this information is not normally obtained in nutrient injections because the elevated concentrations of the injected solute might induce a larger uptake not representing naturally occurring conditions payn et al 2005 however the costs associated with isotope analysis limit the use of this technique the tracers able to provide the most detailed and temporally precise information are often preferred the most used tracers such as the ones discussed above are all associated with an intrinsic limitation which can restrain the use and evolution of the tracer injection technique ec can be an alternative to these tracers as it has an immediate response to ion fluctuations in water for example in the great miami river ec was highly correlated with chloride cl in the river and in the aquifer r2 0 94 sheets et al 2002 the authors concluded that ec is a representative and valuable parameter in measuring travel times from a river to a production well in another tracer study schemel et al 2006 observed a large correlation of the elements ca 2 mg 2 si 4 mn 2 cl and so4 2 with ec in all samples reporting an r 0 994 except for mn 2 for which r 0 977 gooseff and mcglynn 2005 were also interested in the extent to which ec reflected ion concentrations in streams after injecting a solution of libr in a catchment followed by the collection of water samples and ec measurements the authors established an ion concentration electrical conductivity relationship by using the results from the i br ec relationship and ii the br concentrations in water samples separately the authors evaluated the difference in parameters generated by a solute transport simulation one dimensional transport with inflow and storage otis gooseff and mcglynn 2005 concluded that the br ec data produced the best results in the simulations attributing that to the refined representation of the shoulder and tail of the breakthrough curve produced by the br ec data however difficulties can also emerge from the exclusive use of ec for example ec is prone to diurnal variations which are especially noticeable at low river water levels and warmer temperature environments vogt et al 2010 although vogt et al 2010 argued that seasonal fluctuations dominate the diurnal ones the latter must be considered when collecting ec measurements additionally specifically in tracer injection experiments we hypothesize that ec will not always indicate the injected nutrient evolution along the stream for example when the existent nutrient mixture in solution is pronounced these natural components may mask the injected solute variations this can occur for example in catchments with amended soils or in those with a greater interaction with hyporheic zones and groundwater systems in the latter case subsurface hydrology can influence the extent to which ec reflects solute concentrations serving as source and sink flowpaths for these solutes negative and positive hydraulic gradients drainage and seepage respectively influence solute transport in streams by driving stream water into the bed or allowing subsurface water into the channel gooseff et al 2008a the net effect of these exchange patterns will dictate solute concentrations in the stream altering their preeminence in water and hence influencing the ec solute relationship 1 2 aims of this study it was the aim of this study to establish a relationship between ec and dissolved phosphorus p concentrations i e the fraction of the total phosphorus in solution measured from water samples collected in tracer injection experiments we intended to develop a methodology to decrease the number of samples to be collected and at the same time to increase the precision in studying nutrient dynamics based on an easily obtainable parameter specifically the hypotheses for this work were ec measurements can effectively predict p concentrations instantaneous and constant injections will not significantly differ in terms of the ability of ec to predict p concentrations the efficiency of the model will depend on the subsurface hydrology with decreased model efficiency for seepage conditions under the same subsurface hydrology a greater injected concentration of p will produce a better fit of the model and streams with active ionic sources introduce an additional limitation for estimating the model 2 methods the conducted tracer injection experiments are described in fig 1 where each treatment is represented by one horizontal sequence in the figure these experiments produced the data that were used for developing the ec solute methodology and are further discussed in sections 2 1 and 2 2 2 1 study 1 bromide br and phosphorus p instantaneous injection study sediment clay loam loamy sand and sand collected from an agricultural ditch matson ditch northeast indiana was added to a 20 m flume fig 2 separated into four 5 m sections major soil types surrounding the sampling site are blount and glynwood soils ph ranged from 5 6 to 7 3 ditch sediment samples were collected by removing 5 cm of benthic sediment from the ditch bottom a mechanism of water table control was added to the flume to simulate different subsurface hydrological conditions during the tracer injections the stream bed was either set to drainage at a rate of 440 ml min 1 or 880 ml min 1 per 5 m flume segment saturation or seepage at a rate of 440 ml min 1 or 880 ml min 1 per 5 m flume segment representing a losing stream a disconnected stream and a gaining stream respectively the rates of vertical flow addition or subtraction were chosen as being approximately 10 or 20 of the total incoming flow rates a sufficient amount to maintain constant horizontal and vertical flows throughout the experiment a solution of 100 mg of p as kh2po4 and 200 mg of br as nabr in deionized water was instantaneously added to the flume input for each of the tested hydrological conditions two replicates were performed the total run time for the drainage treatments was approximately 75 min under seepage and saturation the duration of the injection experiments was around 40 min 1 1 durations were previously defined according to the time a dye was transported through the flume under the respective subsurface hydrological condition surface water samples were automatically collected at 5 10 15 and 20 meters every one minute and ec was measured through handheld ec meters reed instruments model sd 4307 installed at the same locations and at the flume input the ec meters were configured to log real time conductivity data every 5 s soluble p concentrations in filtered 0 45 μ m filter and acidified samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes br concentrations were analyzed colorimetrically using lachat quikchem 8500 series 2 also after filtering 0 45 μ m and acidifying the samples 2 2 study 2 phosphorus p constant injection study a series of constant p injections was conducted in a four segment 10 m flume fig 3 the flume was initially filled with the same ditch sediment as the one used in study 1 5 cm deep and in the second and third segments sections 2 and 3 steel slag was added above the sediment layer 2 2 steel slag is a residue of steel production with a chemical affinity for p penn et al 2017 the original purpose of the experiments was to test the effectiveness of steel slag in pollutant p removal the produced data is being further explored in this current research with a different objective the results regarding p sorption efficacy of steel slag can be reviewed in chagas 2015 that way sections 1 and 4 are simulating a situation before and after a strong chemical interaction with alien media while sections 2 and 3 represent regions where an active ionic source is present similarly to the instantaneous injections subsurface hydrology varied in this study as well as nutrient load two hydrological conditions of stream channels were simulated in this study drainage and saturation representing a losing and a disconnected stream respectively two p concentrations were constantly injected 1 and 5 mg l 1 in deionized water for each condition defined by the subsurface hydrology and p concentration combined two replicates were performed along the flume four locations 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 m were monitored by collecting water samples and measuring ec in the 240 min experiments water samples were collected every 6 min while ec was measured every 5 s ec data were also collected at the inflow location the water samples were processed through 0 45 μ m filtration following acidification 0 1 ml of 50 hcl and then analyzed for p content using icp oes 2 3 data analysis and model development ec versus solute concentration fig 4 summarizes the operations that were conducted in this part of the study the model development is detailed below because two tracers were simultaneously added in study 1 br and p as po3 4 we first needed to evaluate whether br and p were significantly correlated step 1 in fig 4 such correlation would indicate whether br and p breakthrough curves behaved similarly and therefore whether ec fluctuations could explain the behavior of either solute that way if correlation was significant only one of the solutes could be used to build the ec solute models although br and p are respectively a conservative and a reactive tracer the analyses of the water samples provided evidence of similar behavior of both tracers therefore a linear association between them was expected a simple pearson s correlation test proved that p and br were significantly linearly correlated in all experimental conditions data not shown sample sizes varied between 20 and 40 depending on experimental condition ec versus concentration models could then be developed based on either br or p because both solutes behaved similarly along the flume as confirmed by their significant correlation p was chosen for two reasons i it is a solute of great interest in nutrient transport process studies and ii it would allow for direct comparisons between the instantaneous and constant injection experiments studies 1 and 2 respectively because only p was injected in the latter a linear regression model with p concentrations and ec as the dependent and independent variables respectively was developed for each sampling location in studies 1 and 2 all linear models have the form shown in eq 1 with β 0 representing the background interference and β 1 as the slope of the relationship between p concentration and ec measurements ε is the statistical error term 1 p concentration mg l 1 β 0 β 1 ec μ s ε subsets with different numbers of paired p and ec data points were selected as the model inputs step 2 in fig 4 the intention was to choose a subset representative of the breakthrough curve but at the same time to find the least amount of data points necessary to build a robust model specifically shoulder peak and tail are essential for the characterization of a breakthrough curve hence we focused on selecting data points located in these regions we produced models with n 5 7 9 and 15 observations aiming to define the marginal gains in model fitting we chose the minimal number of observations n 5 for the reduced dataset as being between 12 5 and 25 of the total number of observations the total number of water samples collected in each experiment varied between 20 in study 1 and 40 in study 2 in a tracer injection this would mean at least 75 fewer water samples to be collected in studies that employ the ec p methodology then n 7 9 and 15 were chosen as gradual increases from the reduced subset as they represent 40 80 and 200 more samples to be collected respectively for the evaluation of the optimal sample size only data from samplers 1 and 4 from both studies 1 and 2 were used once the optimal number of data points was established the models for the remaining sections sections 2 and 3 were developed the models were then validated using the replicates conducted under the same experimental conditions hence four models per experiment one per each sampling station were developed for one replicate using the optimal sample size of the coupled ec p dataset after developing the models the residuals were examined for possible violations associated with autocorrelation particularly because the dataset is a time series prone to show data tendencies and sequence pattern the existence of heteroscedasticity i e inconstant variance in the error terms was also examined because of the possible increasing influence that previous sections or adjacent data might have had on the individual data points residuals were also investigated in terms of normality for all performed tests an α level of 0 05 was employed kolmogorov smirnov test was used to verify normality of residuals no issues were identified and the overall conclusion was that the residuals from all models came from normal distributions and no transformations were necessary the existence of autocorrelation was evaluated through the durbin watson test α 0 05 h0 true autocorrelation is 0 when appropriate cochrane orcutt was the methodology used for correcting autocorrelation in the residuals this is a standard procedure in case of first order autocorrelation which was proven to be the case for the residuals where autocorrelation was identified in this work once the models were corrected for anomalies they were applied to the complete ec dataset of the respective experiment and its replicate step 3 in fig 4 by applying the model to the complete ec dataset we obtained the calculated p concentrations a more detailed breakthrough dataset step 4 in fig 4 through the validation procedure we were able to evaluate the replicability of the ec p relationship and whether the same model could be used in other experiments conducted under similar experimental conditions the calculated p datasets were then compared to the observed p in water samples step 5 in fig 4 furthermore we also developed general models using all data collected from the same sampling location regardless of hydrological conditions e g all data collected on autosampler 1 in all experiments with this analysis we aimed to evaluate the possibility of building one single model for any tracer addition experiment that way one same model developed for a particular station could be used for these and future tracer injections without the need to collect any water samples for p concentration analysis 3 results throughout this section we reported the results obtained from the first and last sampling stations i e the injection point and the most distant location specifically looking into the possible solute dilution and legacy effect on the ec p relationship sections 3 1 and 3 2 describe the results obtained through the methodology shown in fig 4 in sections 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 we compared the ec p models efficacy according to the type of tracer injection sampling location and subsurface hydrology respectively we then evaluated the effects of adding the alien media to the channel section 3 6 and finally we discussed the results obtained from the general models in section 3 7 3 1 identifying the optimal sample size for model development by comparing the models built with different dataset sizes n 5 7 9 and 15 data points the objective was to determine the marginal gain of adding more data points and how that gain would vary according to i the hydrological condition and ii sampling location fig 5 shows a visual example of the calculations the graphs depict the results for both instantaneous and constant injections under saturation and saturation 1 mg l 1 conditions i e study 1 experiment 3 and study 2 experiment 2 3 3 the results for the other hydrological conditions can be found in appendix a respectively in the first sampling location sampler 1 there was no considerable difference among the models in terms of fit however in the last sampling location the larger variation among the different models is clear possibly caused by the legacy effects developed as the injected solute traveled throughout the flume visually the models built with larger datasets n 9 n 15 were able to best capture the variability and values of observed p concentrations these observations were also true for the remaining hydrological conditions although the data variability in the last sampling location was more pronounced under saturation despite the impression given by fig 5 of better fits when using the larger sample sizes there was no unique tendency in model improvement by increasing the number of data points as measured by r2 table 1 shows the models produced with reduced datasets as described in step 2 of fig 4 the coefficient of determination and significance for each experimental condition from a total of 18 different models 11 showed little or no marginal gain on the fit of the model when increasing the number of data points 4 showed a continuous improvement when adding more data points and in 3 of them this improvement was limited to n 9 as measured by r2 in developing the models we also observed a more frequent occurrence of autocorrelation in the residuals as we increased the number of data points such behavior was expected because by increasing the number of data points we increased the number of adjacent values in the time series in these types of sequential data the assumption of independence of residuals is often not guaranteed bence 1995 on the other hand when derived from the smaller dataset n 5 some of the models were not significant as measured by the f test for overall significance hence there is a notable trade off in selecting the number of data points to build the model using a small set of data e g n 5 may suggest a lack of representativity of the breakthrough curve and possibly lack of normality while a larger dataset e g n 15 may introduce serious model inadequacies such as serial correlation in the residuals the resolution to this trade off was to choose between the intermediate dataset sizes n 7 and n 9 between the intermediate sample sizes evaluated in this study n 7 and n 9 n 9 was deemed the most appropriate for two main reasons i the majority of the models showed an increase in fit as the number of data points increased from n 7 to n 9 and ii some models showed inferior fit once n 9 suggesting that n 9 was the optimal size for these models additionally for future applications of the ec p methodology collecting 9 samples for p concentration analysis instead of 7 improves the chances of getting precise information about the points of interest in a breakthrough curve 3 2 studies 1 2 evaluating replicability of models after defining a standard sample size n 9 as described in section 3 1 we conducted a validation procedure using the second replicate of each hydrological condition and sampling location the validation consisted of applying the model that was developed for replicate 1 to the ec data of replicate 2 resulting in a calculated p concentration dataset in table 1 the column labeled ρ indicates the pearson s correlation coefficient between the observed p concentrations and the p concentrations calculated in the validation procedure ρ was significantly large in the majority of the experimental conditions and no tendency was identified when comparing sampling locations or experiments we initially expected that ρ would decrease with increasing distance from the injection point because of tracer dilution and contribution of the existent media soil and slag with dissolved solids to the solution the reasoning for this expectation of decrease in correlation levels is described next in instantaneous injections influent water dilutes the concentrations of the injected solute wlostowski et al 2017 as the bulk of the injected solute travels farther from the injection location the effect of dilution increasingly influences the solute concentrations in the system total mass of solute is unaltered by dilution when the solute is diluted to similar levels as natural ions in solution ec is not able to capture the signal of the solute of interest and correlation between observed and predicted p is penalized a decrease in correlation levels was also expected as influent water interacted with the soil and the slag media because of the exchange of ions between the existent media and water as water traveled through the flume we expected a lesser predominance of the injected solute hindering ec solute coupling both in instantaneous and constant injections however when comparing the first and last sampling locations in the 18 evaluated models the correlation coefficient increased in 6 and decreased in only 2 table 1 this suggests that distance from the injection location did not have the expected effect on calculated p concentrations in fact for both autosamplers 1 and 4 the large values of ρ indicate the models ability to successfully predict p concentrations the comparison between sampling stations in terms of model fit is further discussed in section 3 4 the validation procedure elucidates aspects of reliability and replicability of the models which in practice translates to whether that model can be used in similar injection experiments conducted under the same experimental conditions overall the models were replicable when used for similar experimental conditions as measured by ρ this result confirms the ability of ec to predict p concentrations and illustrates the possibility of using the same model developed under certain conditions in future tracer injection experiments conducted under the same conditions 3 3 studies 1 2 comparison between constant and instantaneous injections figs 6 8 show a comparison between the calculated and the observed p concentrations for all injections they suggest that the ec p methodology was able to adequately predict p concentrations throughout both constant and instantaneous injections nevertheless because of the minor fluctuations in p concentrations in study 2 the level of details added through using the more frequent ec data may not be as relevant as in study 1 still the possibility of collecting significantly fewer water samples and still be able to produce a detailed dataset is an advantage in any tracer study the figures also show the results for the general model s estimation which will be discussed in later sections despite the visually equivalent fits when measured by r2 the models based on the instantaneous injection data study 1 in general display a better fit when compared to the models developed for the constant injections study 2 as shown in table 1 this response was expected because of the stronger signal produced when p is introduced at once i e during the instantaneous injections in these tracer experiments ec fluctuations more accurately reflected p concentrations as p became the most prominent element in solution in comparison to background concentrations it is also notable that when the signal is stronger in study 2 i e greater level of p concentration model performance is similar to that seen for study 1 for instance in table 1 the model fit for saturation 5 mg l 1 study 2 experiment 1 is superior to the model fit found for saturation 1 mg l 1 study 2 experiment 2 and similar improvement is evident when we compare drainage 1 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 experiments 3 and 4 of study 2 therefore the success of the ec solute technique depends on the preeminence of the tracer in comparison to ambient solution composition rather than on the type of injection regarding the slopes of the models β 1 they were positive in all instantaneous injections study 1 meaning that p concentrations and ec were positively correlated such behavior was expected because by increasing any ion concentrations in solution ec is expected to respond in the same direction however in the constant additions five out of eight models had a negative slope a plausible reason is the fact that the fluctuations in p concentrations were not strong enough to be precisely captured by ec once a condition of quasi steady state is attained in the constant additions in contrast in the instantaneous injections the p signal was strong enough to explain most of the ec variations in the flume another unique characteristic of the constant additions was the presence of alien media in sections 2 and 3 that contributed to a considerable increase in ec values because of dissolved elements from the media without a concurrent increase in p concentrations the influence of the added media to the ec p relationship is discussed in section 3 6 we observed an overestimation of the peak on the first sampling location of the instantaneous saturation and seepage study 1 experiments 1 2 and 3 conditions and a slight underestimation of peak p concentrations in the last sampler of instantaneous seepage 880 ml min 1 study 1 experiment 1 as seen in figs 6 8 although the differences were less than 2 mg l 1 in all cases these deviations from the true observed p concentrations may interfere with the understanding of in stream uptake or nutrient adsorption to filtering media for example covino et al 2010 discussed that nutrient uptake i e biological retention efficiency has been shown to decrease with elevated concentrations that way because of the overestimation of the peaks in some of the ec p models the ec solute technique may be not as recommendable for tasks such as nutrient spiraling metrics in such tasks the predicted elevated concentrations would potentially generate misled results indicating lower uptake rates in comparison to the real uptake rates instantaneous and constant additions are normally difficult to be directly compared although some critical differences regarding transient storage and flushing patterns have been reported in the literature payn et al 2008 gooseff et al 2008b when defining the type of tracer addition to perform constant or instantaneous the decision must be based on the type of information expected from the experiments rather than how they behave in model fitting payn et al 2008 our study however showed that both methodologies may provide satisfactory data for the ec p technique as long as the injected solute is preeminent in comparison to the background ionic content 3 4 studies 1 2 comparison between sampling locations 3 4 1 effect of distance from injection location the effect of distance from injection location on the efficacy of the ec p models was evaluated as the difference in model fit according to the sampling station we observed a decrease in goodness of fit from the first to the last sampling locations in 7 of the 9 simulations study 1 experiments 2 and 5 were the two hydrological conditions in which this reduction was not observed this observation implies that the model fit is affected by the distance from the injection point which can be explained threefold i background solution composition ii legacy effects of existent media and existent solution and iii p dilution these three aspects impact the p signal relative to the other ions in solution again we come back to the finding that the injected solute must be the predominant ion for building a successful ec solute coupling as the solute travels downstream its levels are confounded with other ionic species in solution so it is more difficult for the model to predict p concentrations when farther from the injection location it is notable however that the observed decrease in fit in more distant locations was not accompanied by a significant decrease in correlation between observed and predicted solute concentrations when the model was applied to the replicate experiments section 3 2 this implies that the loss in goodness of fit caused by distance did not significantly affect the ability to predict p concentrations for future application of the ec solute methodology we suggest that the farther the sampling location is in comparison to the injection location the more influence the background concentrations the legacy effects of the existent media and solute dilution will have on the ec solute model fit despite the worse fit we showed that models developed for farther stations performed well when predicting p concentrations 3 4 2 modified models zero intercepts as we compared the models built for autosampler 1 and models for autosampler 4 we could see clear trends regarding the intercept of the models intercepts were always smaller in the first sampling location when compared to the last one in study 2 in contrast in study 1 intercepts were larger in the first sampling location in comparison to the last the intercept can be interpreted as the expected mean value of p concentrations conditional to an ec value in cases when ec is 0 4 4 ec in water is virtually 0 exclusively when there are no salts in solution i e distilled water p concentrations should also be 0 which is a plausible reason for forcing the intercept to 0 and obtain a physical meaning for this parameter to check this rationale we estimated models with zero intercepts using the same datasets 5 5 figures are shown in appendix b however the new models showed a marked decrease in fitting particularly in the constant injections we discussed in section 3 3 that in instantaneous injections the p signal was strong enough to be precisely captured by the ec fluctuations we believe that this is also the reason why the zero intercept models show a better fit in study 1 in comparison to study 2 in all cases the models with non zero intercept were more descriptive of the observed data this is the reason why we decided to maintain the original models non zero intercept however by using the original models we observed negative values of p concentrations in the calculated datasets in two of the constant injections saturation 5 mg l 1 autosampler 4 and saturation 1 mg l 1 autosampler 4 in the validation procedure the constant injections drainage 1 mg l 1 autosampler 4 and saturation 5 mg l 1 as well as the instantaneous injection drainage 440 ml min 1 also had negative calculated p concentrations in general negative values of concentration are a common issue in collected water samples analysis because of possible errors of instrumentation or mistakes in sampling the same approaches to deal with these issues can be replicated when using the ec p technique in tracer injections 3 5 studies 1 2 effects of subsurface hydrology in general the effects of subsurface hydrology were not evident in the models saturation drainage and seepage exhibited equivalent results in terms of model adequacy we expected that the ec p relationship would be affected by the vertical flow rate because of the contribution from the media especially in the seepage condition as mentioned in section 2 1 under seepage the flow is supplemented by a vertical flow that travels upward through the stream bed and actively contributes with dissolved solutes from the media to the surface water our hypothesis was that this addition of dissolved solutes by the upward flow would increase ec without a concurrent increase in p concentrations resulting in a worse fit of the model in comparison to the other subsurface hydrological conditions yet no clear trend could be identified to corroborate that hypothesis nonetheless within the subsurface hydrological conditions the difference between levels of p concentration was noticeable in fact the smallest values of r2 were produced in the experiments that used the smallest level of p concentration constant saturation and drainage 1 mg l 1 study 2 experiments 2 and 4 in comparison to their counterparts 5 mg l 1 the r2 was considerably less in both sampling locations this observation substantiates the hypothesis that a stronger signal can indicate a greater capability of ec to respond to p concentrations in practice these findings show that ec p models can be successfully developed regardless of the subsurface hydrological condition facilitating their use in most streams and flumes 3 6 study 2 effects of an active source of solutes because steel slag was added to sections 2 and 3 of the experimental flume in study 2 the p dynamics and ec measurement scale in these sections differed in comparison to the remaining sections and to the instantaneous injections steel slag noticeably added dissolved solids to the nutrient mixture because of the presence of soluble minerals in its composition at the same time that it was able to reduce dissolved p content in water chagas 2015 hence it was expected that the bulk of the solutes in water would be derived from the slag dissolution rather than p fluctuations this would result in a weak correlation between ec and p concentrations after section 2 of the constant injection experiments as established in section 3 3 the fit of the models for section 4 autosampler 4 did differ in comparison to section 1 autosampler 1 we hypothesized that steel slag presence contributed to the reduction of the fit of the models however the extension of slag interference in that reduction i e the legacy effect of steel slag on the following sections was unclear as an active source of solutes slag contributes mainly with ca 2 and oh to water systems increasing ph the calcium content of solution and consequently ec the ca 2 forms precipitates with po4 3 the soluble form of p then p concentrations decrease despite an increase in ec derived from the additions from the soluble minerals we suggest that this reduction in dissolved p was in part responsible for the reduced fit in the last sampling location in figs 6 and 7 that p concentration reduction may have produced for example the underestimation of the initial concentrations extreme negative values in sampler 4 the models developed for sections 2 and 3 in the constant injections are shown in table 3 it is clear that ec was not able to explain the p variations as it did in sections 1 and 4 the most satisfactory model fittings occurred when a greater concentration of p was injected mainly in the drainage condition this suggests that the downward drainage flow was able to carry dissolved solids out of the ambient solution unmasking p variations in water after the slag sections the relationship between ec p recovered in all experiments which suggested that the interference of the artificial media was rapidly attenuated in conclusion the existence of artificial media acting as an active source of solutes hinders the ec solute relationship as it contributes to dissolved solids in the solution as a result ec responds to their presence rather than to the injected solute 3 7 general models up to this point we have developed site specific models according to the sampling locations and experimental treatments however in a practical sense it would be useful to develop a general model able to predict p concentrations in any tracer injection to occur in the same stream or flume reach 6 6 we emphasize the preference for a model per stream or flume instead of a general model for any reach because of the inherent variability along a reach and the ambient nutrient levels characteristic of a specific experimental location payn et al 2005 that way water samples for p concentration analysis would be collected only once and ec would be the exclusive measured parameter in future tracer injections in that pursuit we built models for sampling locations 1 and 4 regardless of hydrological condition two models were developed per type of injection using the same datasets from the individual models but this time compiled per sampling station after developing the models we applied them to the entire ec dataset of each condition and compared to the site specific models the results are shown in table 4 and in figs 6 8 along with the site specific models and the observed p concentrations because the estimated coefficients shown in table 1 varied among hydrological conditions and also among the different sampling locations we expected a reduction in model fit especially for constant injections great variability in intercept and slope of the lines in figs 6 8 a clear dislocation from the observed data can be visualized in the new breakthrough curves particularly in samplers 4 based on our findings we saw enough reasons for building site specific models by collecting fewer water samples in every tracer addition instead of using a general model with no collected samples this confirmed that it is not adequate to have ec being used as the sole parameter in a tracer injection i e as a true surrogate but rather to be used as an instrument to build robust models with the main parameter of interest the concentration of the injected solute 4 conclusions this research evaluated the performance of ec in predicting p concentrations in tracer injection experiments models developed for each sampling location using a few water samples n 9 as input data were able to accurately describe p behavior along the flumes the ec solute technique was able to i diminish the number of water samples to be collected facilitating the operations in tracer addition studies and ii improve the resolution of btc curves potentially enhancing the characterization of tracer dynamics through more detailed datasets our findings suggested that the primary condition for building efficient models between ec and solute concentrations is the preeminence of these concentrations in comparison to other solutes that way the solute of interest will respond to the bulk of the ec variations resulting in a well correlated relationship the results from this work indicated that ec and p in tracer injections are highly correlated under natural circumstances their relationship can satisfactorily be used for building more precise and detailed breakthrough curves we suggest that the proposed methodology of collecting fewer water samples and relying on the ec tracer correlation is an inexpensive useful and efficient technique to characterize reactive transport and biogeochemical cycling in streams and flumes from this study we found that the ec p relationship is not significantly affected by subsurface hydrology although the interactions between the channel bed and flowing water can be significantly influenced by the subsurface hydrological conditions of the stream we did not observe a consistent variability in model fit when comparing the different subsurface hydrological conditions lack of perfect fit of the ec solute models as measured by r2 were mainly caused by a weaker signal of the injected solute because of i the distance to the injection point with more distant sampling stations showing a decrease in the fit of the models and ii active sources of solutes in the flume the main implication of the proposed methodology is that it facilitates the conduction of tracer injection experiments in terms of labor and costs the trade off is that samples must be collected at specific times and locations along the btc curve that way a representative ec p relationship can be built according to the dominant transport processes occurring in the stream future research includes the application of the ec solute technique in other types of water bodies such as aquifers wetlands and larger systems the use of ec solute models in great background concentrations or in injections in which the trace signal is not preeminent are the main limitations of this technique overall the main conclusions of this work were i ec could effectively predict p concentrations in p injection experiments ii ec p models showed a better fit in instantaneous injections in comparison to constant injections which was explained by the stronger signal that p exerts on solution composition in the former type of injection iii the fit of the model was not influenced by the subsurface hydrological condition meaning that saturation seepage and drainage showed overall similar fit iv under the same subsurface hydrology greater injected concentrations resulted in a better fit of the models and v in the presence of an active source of solute i e steel slag the ability of ec to predict p concentrations was substantially weaker 5 recommendations below we list a methodology to facilitate the application of the ec solute technique and to support data quality for building the models in future tracer injections the ec p technique is recommended to be used in short stream reach distances that do not contain active sources of solutes first to obtain a clear ec solute relationship it is important to add an appreciable amount of solute able to protrude in comparison to ambient concentrations that amount will depend on the reach and on the natural levels of dissolved elements in solution second 9 samples should be collected across the entirety of the btc i e at shoulder peak and tail regions this demands a preceding understanding of streamflow at both injection location and the last sampling location 7 7 covino et al 2010 argued that conservative tracers released at the head of the reach cannot be used to calculate flow at the base of the reach because of tracer mass loss along the stream both locations should be measured that way researchers can estimate specific sampling time for the 9 water samples to be collected also throughout the injection experiment ec must be measured frequently which will contribute to a greater resolution of the curve finally select the ec values measured at the same time and location as the p concentrations for a paired ec solute subset this will be the training data used for building the ec p models the models can then be applied to the entire ec dataset to obtain calculated concentrations at the same frequency as ec was measured credit authorship contribution statement isis s p c scott conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft

5317,understanding the movement and storage of water within agricultural landscapes as functions of management and climate is essential for more efficient and sustainable water use however knowledge of water storage and fluxes on u s agricultural lands is largely incomplete the long term agroecosystem research ltar network provides a unique and geographically diverse set of agricultural study sites in the united states the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the hydrologic variability across the ltar network 2 identify data gaps in the water budgets across the ltar network and 3 identify opportunities to leverage the ltar network to improve understanding of water budgets across agricultural landscapes for each of the 18 ltar sites we developed water budgets on an average annual basis uncertainty propagation methods combined individual component uncertainties to calculate an overall water budget uncertainty datasets length ranged from three to 50 years the network covers a range of precipitation from 240 to 1400 mm yr 1 evapotranspiration from 228 to 1080 mm yr 1 and surface runoff and subsurface flow from negligible to 560 mm yr 1 however uncertainties of where all the water is going remained high in part because soil water storage and downward movement of water were often neglected or measured for very short periods resulting in average water budget uncertainty of 25 of the water inputs more accurate measurement of the major inputs and outputs and direct measurement of water content and percolation are key to understanding how agricultural lands affect terrestrial water budgets 1 introduction intensification of agriculture can affect water availability by increasing land under crop and forage production raymond et al 2008 schilling et al 2008 tomer and schilling 2009 or by increasing land productivity zeri et al 2013 simultaneously climatic changes in temperature and precipitation can alter available water resources in several ways by 1 increasing the rate and timing of evapotranspiration through elevated temperatures flerchinger et al 2019 kingston et al 2009 and changes in crop planting times gautam et al 2018 2 altering the amount timing and form of seasonal or annual precipitation i e rain or snow us global change research program 2017 and 3 altering precipitation intensity which could lead to greater runoff and reduced percolation gautam et al 2018 groisman et al 2001 key to the adaptation of agriculture across varying climates is the management of water the natural availability of which ranges from deficit to excess for crops and rangelands in water limited environments agriculture competes with other water users conversely water replete environments may be challenging because of poorly drained soils extreme precipitation events are challenging everywhere because of erosion and loss of water to runoff agricultural activities can affect the availability and quality of surface and ground waters making careful management a fundamental requirement for sustainability conflicts arising from agricultural water management such as water availability for municipal industrial or recreational uses e g

iowa 2011 and 2019 along the mississippi and missouri rivers have significantly impacted agricultural production as well as water quality of receiving water bodies understanding the balance between precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and groundwater recharge is critical to evaluating local regional and global water resources healy et al 2007 a balanced water budget accounts for all of the major water inputs and outputs over an annual cycle in a defined area water budgets depend on topography climate soils land use and land management in small catchments a water budget provides an overview of the fate of water inputs evapotranspiration is commonly the main output with the remaining balance going to groundwater recharge or streamflow generation water budgets describe the water pathways through the farm and rangeland management systems accurate water budgets for small catchments can also inform integrated land and water management in larger catchments and contribute to the analysis of potential trade offs between water allocations for agriculture and other uses understanding how each budget component may shift as a function of management informs the optimal use of available water resources under varying climate land use and agricultural production optimization of water resources at the watershed or regional scale may in turn result in specific recommendations for the management of agricultural land in those regions our current knowledge of water fluxes across agricultural landscapes in the united states is largely incomplete for areas the size of a field studies in agroecosystems focus on individual components of the water budget often overland or subsurface runoff or evapotranspiration e g bosch et al 2012 buckley et al 2010 for large watersheds

includes 18 experimental watersheds 11 usda ars and ranges where precipitation and other hydro meteorological variables have been systematically measured and archived for decades the ltar network offers an opportunity to estimate and compare water budget components across a gradient of agroecosystems and climatic conditions as a baseline from which to evaluate the impacts and sensitivity of management in a changing climate these water budgets provide a mechanism to identify deficiencies in monitoring instrumentation the availability of data for additional comparative studies and the identification of aspirational goals for regional watershed management these data also provide an opportunity to evaluate the uncertainty of water budget components for accurate cross site and regional analysis the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the hydrologic variability across the ltar network 2 identify data gaps in the water budgets across the ltar network and 3 identify opportunities to leverage the ltar network to improve understanding of water budgets across agricultural landscapes analyses were conducted for 13 small catchments 50 ha and 13 large catchments 400 ha distributed among the 18 ltar site locations 2 methods 2 1 study sites a water budget assessment was conducted at 26 study areas across 18 ltar sites fig 1 each ltar site was responsible for selecting one or more representative study areas determining a period for which data were available and calculating the mean and standard deviation of annual values for each water budget component the assessments cover a range of soil land use supplemental table s1 and climatological conditions supplemental fig s1 the 26 locations were divided based on the size of the drainage area and uniformity of land use 13 small catchments were smaller than 50 ha and had uniform land use 13 large catchments were greater than 400 ha and could include multiple land uses even though some of the study areas were large plots 190 m2 that did not meet the hydrologic definition of a natural catchment artificial boundaries at these sites prevented the inflow of surface and subsurface water as a result they did behave as a catchment and were included in the analysis 2 2 water budget equation we used the following general equation for the annual water budget 1 p i q in e t q out δ s where p is annual precipitation i is annual irrigation qin is annual water flow into the catchment et is annual evapotranspiration qout is annual water flow out of the catchment δs is the annual change in water storage for small catchments the water budgets were derived for the soil profile system down to the maximum of the rooting depth or 150 cm therefore water storage was limited to soil water storage and water flow out of the system included surface flow subsurface lateral flow and downward percolation beyond the monitored soil profile rooting zone fig 2 for large catchments the water budgets were also determined for the soil profile system but for these catchments the maximum depth extended down to and including the aquifer that provides base flow water storage included soil storage ponds and reservoirs and the aquifer water flow out of the system included streamflow measured at the outlet of the catchment and deeper percolation which was considered to replenish deeper regional aquifers that did not contribute to the water storage or flow within the catchment thus system water storage and percolation did not have the same meaning for small and large catchments 2 3 water budget component estimation and uncertainty each site used their own datasets and methods to develop the water budgets supplemental section s3 supplemental tables s4 through s15 provide metadata about estimation methods and estimate uncertainty for each water budget component specific to each site sources of uncertainty may include measurement errors random or systematic errors in the estimation of derived variables extrapolated interpolated data scaled data temporal and spatial variability and data quality control and management issues harmel et al 2006 2009 mcmillan et al 2012 montgomery and sanders 1986 below we provide a summary of the methods used to estimate each component of the water budget and determine its uncertainty all uncertainties are assumed to be bi directional 2 3 1 precipitation precipitation data ranged from 3 to 50 years supplemental tables s4 and s5 for all the sites but the r j cook agronomy farm caf the gauge s were very near or within the catchment at two sites lower chesapeake bay lcb and caf precipitation gauges were the responsibility of a different organization and metadata were not available at most sites precipitation was measured with tipping bucket or 20 cm diameter belfort weighing rain gauges using calibration and maintenance procedures recommended by brakensiek et al 1979 the belfort gauge diameter varied larger or smaller for a few sites several sites used load cells to detect and quantify precipitation at a pre defined frequency the caf site used a non recording rain gauge and measurements were manual the greatest uncertainty in precipitation measurement was the undercatch which we estimated as a function of winter precipitation and whether a wind shield was present details for the estimation of precipitation uncertainty are provided in supplemental section s4 2 3 2 irrigation in the small catchments crops were irrigated at only two sites platte river and high plains aquifer pr hpa in nebraska and gulf atlantic coastal plains gacp in georgia supplemental table s6 among the large catchments irrigation was a component of the water budget at the southern plains sp beasley lake watershed in the lower mississippi river basin lmrb and archbold biological station university of florida abs uf sites supplemental table s7 irrigation was quantified using farmer reports abs uf and lmrb or model estimates sp irrigation was present but was either judged to be insignificant at the upper mississippi river basin umrb central mississippi river basin cmrb and kellogg biological station kbs sites because the irrigated area was small relative to non irrigated cropland or it was unknown gacp irrigation in the small catchments was under the control of the scientists therefore a 5 uncertainty was assigned to account for application uncertainty unless a different value was provided in the large catchments irrigation amounts estimated from farmer reports were assigned a 10 uncertainty to account for reporting errors a 25 uncertainty was assigned when estimates were based on model simulated water stress 2 3 3 evapotranspiration infrastructure measuring et was only recently established at most ltar sites four sites had et data from eddy covariance ec flux towers caf great basin gb walnut gulch experimental watershed wgew and northern plains np supplemental tables s8 and s9 in addition the kbs site was able to use eddy covariance data to validate the et estimates obtained by residual of the water balance equation the texas gulf tg site measured pan evaporation seven sites used modeling to estimate et these models combine potential et e g based on the meteorological parameter based fao 56 penman monteith model allen et al 1998 with a crop growth model and available soil moisture to calculate crop water uptake at abs uf vegetation coefficients were calibrated using lysimeters in lieu of a crop growth model the fao 56 method combined with vegetation coefficients yields accurate estimates of potential et for monocrop agriculture under well watered conditions i e where water availability does not limit transpiration anderson et al 2017 mcmahon et al 2013 pereira et al 2015 all other sites assumed closed systems and estimated et by subtraction from the water balance equation assuming small unquantified components of the system were negligible uncertainty of et varies with the method used to estimate its value supplemental section s5 provides details about et measurement uncertainty estimation the uncertainty of et estimates based on the water budget residual was a function of the uncertainties of the quantified components where percolation and changes in water storage were not quantified the uncertainty of these components was also unknown we assumed that average annual change in water storage and its uncertainty were both equal to 0 we further set the absolute uncertainty of percolation to be 16 of average annual precipitation based on the average ratio of percolation uncertainty to average precipitation among the sites where percolation was quantified modeled et estimates also had uncertainties except for abs uf the uncertainty associated with modeled et estimates was not quantified as for other water budget components a 25 modeling uncertainty was assigned the models used for estimating et included the soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 2012 the agricultural policy environmental extender wang et al 2012 and the annualized agricultural non point source pollution model bingner and theurer 2001 in these et is calculated as a function of potential et and crop growth which is constrained by available nutrients and soil water these models had been calibrated for crop or biomass yields surface outflows and sometimes for drainage or subsurface flow but not for et or percolation modeling errors on crop yields are typically 20 wang et al 2012 and models are often considered acceptable if errors are within 25 of measured values moriasi et al 2015 thus a 25 modeling uncertainty was assigned however we wanted to avoid the possibility that the uncertainty of et would be greater when modeled with a calibrated model than when estimated as the residual of the water budget when all other components were quantified modeled et uncertainty was assigned the lowest of the uncertainty of the water budget residual calculated by uncertainty propagation or 25 as explained later when some components were not quantified the modeled et uncertainty was set at 25 2 3 4 surface and subsurface outflows discharge surface or subsurface was measured at all but three small catchments supplemental table s10 surface runoff was assumed to be negligible at the jornada experimental range jer gutschick and snyder 2006 the np area iv farm and the central plains experimental range cper dodd and lauenroth 1997 surface runoff was assumed to be a fraction of precipitation at the pr hpa site szilagyi et al 2005 most other sites used pre calibrated flumes or weirs to quantify discharge from stage data and were rarely overtopped exceptions included the upper chesapeake bay ucb kepler farm where water volumes flowing through a structure were measured directly with tipping buckets at umrb kelley farm surface flow was considered negligible in some small catchment studies caf umrb ucb eastern corn belt ecb and gacp investigators also measured subsurface flow using a subsurface drain at umrb subsurface drainage was measured with in line flow meters discharge streamflow was directly measured at all the large catchment outlets supplemental table s11 which makes it the second most frequently measured component for all the large catchments except the beasley lake watershed lmrb discharge measurement consisted of continuous stage water depth measurement with a pressure transducer float or sonic sensor the stage data were then converted to discharge rates using an established stage discharge relationship derived from flow measurements or a pre calibrated weir or flume the stage discharge relationship of the control structure was complemented by streamflow measurements for high flows that overtopped the control structure for the beasley lake watershed streamflow was estimated with a calibrated model yasarer et al 2020 in the present study the uncertainty in streamflow surface runoff and subsurface flow was estimated with the procedure of harmel et al 2006 and is described in supplemental section s6 2 3 5 percolation for practical reasons only two small catchments estimated percolation of water beyond the monitored root zone using independent measurements tg measured percolation by measuring groundwater levels in wells placed throughout the catchment and wgew estimated no percolation based on measured chloride concentrations as a function of soil depth supplemental tables s12 and s13 for the large catchments only the wgew site had independent estimates of deep percolation which occurs primarily in depressions and ephemeral channels and was estimated using multiple methods goodrich et al 2004 at other sites percolation was estimated as the residual of the water balance alternatively some sites used a literature value e g gacp 1 of precipitation rawls and asmussen 1973 or modeling e g cmrb 2 3 6 soil water storage soil water content was measured in seven small catchments supplemental table s14 and one large catchment sp supplemental table s15 in all of these soil moisture sensors were installed in multiple locations and at multiple depths for sp starks et al 2014 describe in detail the network of 15 soil moisture sites in the fort cobb watershed and the processing of the data to obtain water storage across the full catchment soil water measurements exist in the gacp large catchment but were not used for this analysis measurement methods included gravimetric measurements neutron probes time domain reflectometry and other soil moisture sensors uncertainty associated with these measurements ranged from 2 5 to 5 5 for the other sites change in soil water storage was either not quantified or was estimated via modeling or by applying the water balance equation as for other modeled water budget components a 25 uncertainty was assigned to change in soil water storage estimated by modeling if the water balance equation was used the uncertainty was dependent on the uncertainty of the other water budget components when several water budget terms were unavailable e g percolation and change in soil water content the difference in known sources and sinks of water was attributed to percolation and changes in soil water content were assumed to be negligible changes in soil water storage were estimated with the water balance equation only when all the other terms were estimated by other means 2 4 effect of missing data missing data introduce a bias by underestimating the annual value of the measured component however filling missing data often performed by regression with relevant time series results in reduced spatial and temporal variability of the data guzman et al 2014 demonstrated this effect across dozens of precipitation time series 5 min time step in the little washita and fort cobb experimental watersheds for sites with less than 10 missing precipitation data the reduction of the coefficient of variation caused by infilling missing data was less than 2 and considered acceptable imputing data gaps was considered preferable to the use of incomplete datasets for analysis of spatial and temporal trends in this study uncertainties in the average annual value for datasets with missing data were derived from the guzman et al 2014 study of precipitation data if missing data consisted of no more than 1 of the dataset no additional uncertainty was applied to the average annual value if the amount of missing data was greater than 1 the uncertainty of the average annual value was increased by the greater of 2 or the percentage of missing data unless the missing data were imputed in that case the uncertainty was increased by 2 occasionally there was no information about missing precipitation and discharge data in those cases we used the upper bound of missing data percentages among the sites that provided this information 14 for precipitation and 11 for discharge an uncertainty value of 40 was assigned to component values estimated from the literature 2 5 combination and propagation of uncertainties the square root of the sum of squares equation was used to estimate uncertainty resulting from several steps or factors e g discharge uncertainty supplemental section s6 and to estimate the uncertainty of data resulting from addition or subtraction for example when a component e g et was estimated from precipitation and outflow eq 2 then the uncertainty of that component was derived from those of the other components as in eq 3 2 et p q 3 u et u p 2 u q 2 to estimate the uncertainty of data resulting from multiplication or division the uncertainties were expressed in percentages relative errors before applying the quadrature formula for example the runoff coefficient qcoeff was calculated from eq 4 and its uncertainty was estimated by eq 5 4 q coeff q p 5 u qcoeff qcoeff u q q 2 u p p 2 2 6 determination of inter annual variability our analysis was based on average annual values availability of measured or simulated data across the network was highly variable ranging from 3 years for some components of the budget for some study areas to 30 50 years for all components at others in order to use estimates based on different lengths of datasets measures of uncertainty of the means caused by interannual variability were calculated we used the standard error of the mean to quantify the range of possible values of the true mean given the sample size and its standard deviation 2 7 hydrologic characterization of each site for each small and large catchment hydrologic characterization was based on the runoff and et coefficients runoff and et as a fraction of precipitation and irrigation and on the closure of the water balance equation the closure indicates the extent to which the water budget was balanced when taking into account the uncertainties of each component measured components as well as those estimated via modeling expert knowledge or literature values were included with the corresponding uncertainties all inputs to the system i e precipitation and irrigation were summed and the total input uncertainty calculated by combining uncertainties of individual components the same was done for all the outputs from the system i e surface runoff subsurface discharge artificial drainage if any evapotranspiration percolation to groundwater and changes in soil water storage while not an output of the system per se changes in soil water storage are one possible use of the water inputs a loss in soil water storage was represented with a negative value the water budget uncertainty δwater eq 6 quantifies the closure of the average annual water budget 6 δ w a t e r i n p u t s o u t p u

u t s additionally the smallest possible water budget uncertainty for each catchment was estimated based on the hypothesis that best measurement practices would be used everywhere over a 30 year period so that both the measurement error and the interannual variability would be minimized we also assumed that there were no missing data or that data gaps had been filled 2 7 1 use of the budyko framework the wide range of precipitation and solar insolation across north america leads to large differences in evapotranspiration which in turn strongly affect water availability for agriculture and downstream ecosystems ltar sites lie along gradients of water availability and solar insolation or energy limitation a graphical way to distinguish between water limited and energy limited sites is the budyko framework budyko 1974 this framework describes the partitioning of catchment precipitation into evapotranspiration and discharge in terms of water and energy availability arora 2002 gunkel and lange 2017 sposito 2017 budyko s assumption was that evapotranspiration is limited by water in semi arid regions and by energy in wet regions zhang et al 2001 the budyko curve is the theoretical relationship between the aridity index potential et precipitation and the evaporative fraction actual et precipitation westhoff et al 2016 potential et is primarily a function of solar radiation and is equivalent to the actual et under conditions of no water limitation actual et is limited by available water and or energy available for the evaporation of water reported average annual actual et and precipitation and average annual potential et derived from modis16 mu et al 2007 2011 were used to compare the relative energy and water limitations across all small and large catchments at the ltar sites an aridity index and evaporative fraction characterized each site if a site had multiple catchments average values of actual et precipitation and potential et were used so that each ltar site was represented by a single point the budyko curve was developed based on the relationship modified by zhang et al 2001 to include vegetation type effects on et and is expressed as eq 8 8 aet p 1 w p e t p 1 w p e t p p p e t where aet is actual et p is precipitation w is the plant available water coefficient with a value of 0 5 for cropland 1 for grassland and 2 for forest based on a study of over 300 catchments worldwide zhang et al 2001 and pet is potential et 3 results 3 1 water budgets across the ltar network the magnitudes and uncertainty of each water budget component are described for each catchment in supplemental tables s16 and s17 and are summarized in figs 3 and 4 and tables 1 and 2 the ltar network covers a gradient of precipitation from 240 mm yr 1 at jer to 1400 mm yr 1 at lmrb precipitation was the component measured with the smallest relative uncertainty 5 17 tables 1 and 2 however it was also the largest component and the absolute uncertainties related to precipitation were the second largest among all water budget components 19 to 237 mm the smallest uncertainties 10 were obtained with shielded rain gauges generally installed at the northern sites where snow conditions dominate for more than half of the year np gb caf and kbs or with unshielded gauges at the southern sites where snow conditions are very rare abs uf gacp and wgew at the remaining sites winter precipitation was significant but not compensated for by gauge shielding consequently precipitation uncertainties were greater than 10 et values ranged from 228 mm yr 1 at jer to 1080 mm yr 1 at abs uf the variety of methods used to estimate et across ltar sites supplemental tables s8 and s9 is reflective of the spectrum of independent approaches used worldwide each with its own sources of uncertainty allen et al 2011 when et was obtained as the water budget residual the uncertainties of each of the components contributed to the uncertainty associated with the et estimate as did the terms that were omitted from the budget modelled results had a different set of uncertainties associated with model assumptions and parameter measurements as well as the inability in some cases to obtain site specific calibration or customization of the models relative uncertainties in et ranging from 8 to 38 resulted in absolute uncertainties ranging from 32 to 325 mm surface and subsurface flows at the small catchments and streamflow at the large ones were also affected by the gradient of precipitation and et ranging from none or negligible amounts 10 mm yr 1 at the driest sites gb wgew jer and central plains experimental range cper to more than 550 mm yr 1 at lmrb however differences between soils had a strong influence runoff at the np site was negligible because permeable soils hydrologic soil group b favored percolation 100 mm yr 1 at ucb surface runoff was low at the small catchment site kepler farm in comparison to that measured at the we 38 watershed because of the presence of karst features at kepler farm which promote downward movement of water percolation was measured only at tg and wgew at the small catchments where percolation was quantified percolation below the monitored root zone ranged from 0 mm at wgew to 136 mm yr 1 at np for the large catchments percolation to the deep aquifer ranged from 5 mm yr 1 at cmrb to 460 mm yr 1 at abs uf because most sites estimated that component uncertainties were large sometimes larger than the mean value e g 374 at caf small catchment or 76 at abs uf and led to considerable uncertainty about water movement at the caf small catchment runoff and subsurface runoff were quantified at 105 13 mm while et was 474 92 mm which led to percolation being 26 98 mm while runoff and subsurface runoff were measured with good accuracy the uncertainties on et and percolation make it difficult to state whether percolation was a significant output at most sites for example at the abs uf site runoff through the ditch canal network was quantified at 92 24 mm while et was 1080 325 mm which resulted in percolation being 460 349 mm this could indicate percolation or seepage was a significant loss of water from the catchment similar to or even larger than surface runoff a distinct possibility given high hydraulic conductivity of sandy soils at abs uf at these sites and others more precise and accurate quantification of et and runoff will lead to improved quantification of percolation and an improved understanding of water movement in this study the net change in water storage soil water for small catchments and soil shallow aquifer and impoundments for large catchments over the data analysis period 3 35 years was always close to zero annual changes could be either positive or negative for years that were abnormally dry or wet but leveled out as weather patterns returned to normal however changes in system water storage may be more significant and meaningful when investigating water movement over periods ranging from a few months to a single year 3 2 irrigated sites irrigation was used in only three of the large catchments fort cobb at the southern plains sp site beasley lake at the lmrb site and the bir35 catchment at the abs uf site and two of the small catchments site 1 at the pr hpa site and gibbs farm at the gacp site it was used in the two large lcb catchments but not quantified among these five irrigated ltar sites the abs uf site is rangeland while the other four sites are predominantly cropland the growing season starts from april to june and ends in october at the cropland sites table 3 applied water ranged from 121 mm yr 1 in the fort cobb watershed sp to 238 mm yr 1 at site 1 pr hpa those amounts represent 17 to 35 of the total growing season water inputs abs uf is a subtropical humid rangeland site with the peak growing season coinciding with the rainy season from april to october hence irrigation occurs primarily during the dry season to maintain pastures from january to april contributing up to 53 of the monthly water inputs to the system on average during these months the source of irrigation water was always outside of the system considered ponds outside the fields considered gacp canal water for abs or groundwater lmrb pr hpa and sp see supplemental information irrigation application values and percentages should not be compared from site to site as each location has a different approach for estimating the irrigation applied for the small catchments the values shown in table 3 are only from irrigated plots small catchment irrigation was controlled by researchers and has low uncertainty for the larger catchments irrigation values were determined using the total catchment size fort cobb and abs uf or the area of total cropland beasley lake irrigation application rates for these sites were estimated based on modeled values for fort cobb farmer reported values for beasley lake and measured input values from canals at abs uf the number of years of data availability differed at each site the irrigation method also influenced irrigation application estimates for example at beasley lake both center pivot and furrow irrigation are common but furrow irrigation has application rates two to three times that of center pivot systems therefore the efficiency of the application method is an important characteristic to consider when evaluating the irrigation component in the water budgets 3 3 water budget uncertainty relative water budget uncertainty ranged from 11 to 47 of inputs for the small catchments and 9 to 40 for the large catchments the average relative uncertainty was not affected by scale and was within 25 for both small and large catchments median values were 23 and 28 for small and large catchments respectively for small catchments the largest sources of uncertainty came from evapotranspiration with an average uncertainty contribution of 99 mm followed by uncertainties in precipitation percolation surface and subsurface flows irrigation and change in soil water table 1 for large catchments the greatest contributors to the uncertainty of the water budget were deep percolation and evapotranspiration followed by precipitation stream discharge irrigation and change in water storage table 2 the difference in the contribution of percolation from the small vs large catchments to the overall water budget uncertainty was largely attributed to the small and large catchments being located at different ltar sites only six sites had both large and small catchments four of which had estimated percolation wgew caf cmrb and gacp for two sites the contribution of percolation uncertainty to the overall water budget uncertainty was very similar for the small and large catchments close to 100 mm at caf for 25 mm of percolation and 3 mm at gacp for 12 mm of percolation at cmrb the percolation contribution to the water budget uncertainty was 18 mm for the small catchment and 5 mm for the large one while at wgew it was 0 mm for the small catchment and 40 mm for the large one when dominant soils elevation climate and land use and management in the large catchment match those in the small catchment percolation for small catchments should be greater than for large catchments that is because percolation from small catchments replenishes the aquifer that provides base flow this was the case at cmrb yet when biophysical characteristics are different soils climate karst features percolation from one scale cannot inform percolation at the other scale differences between the hydrologic soil group of the small catchment soils and dominant large catchment soils existed at caf wgew umrb and ucb 3 4 hydrologic characterization of the ltar network relationships between precipitation and et and precipitation and surface runoff artificial drainage for small catchments or streamflow for large catchments fig 5 were all significant and generally stronger at the small catchment scale the relationships illustrated in fig 5 allowed the identification of groups of sites and anomalies the four driest sites i e gb jer wgew and cper anchored those plots et and p were less than 400 mm and close to each other and surface flow was very small the coefficients of determination obtained without values from these driest sites were smaller and the relationship between precipitation and et was not significant on the other end of the precipitation spectrum maximum small catchment et and precipitation were at the gacp site maximum large catchment et was at abs uf because of 400 mm of irrigation while maximum precipitation was at lmrb anomalies in these graphs include the irrigated sites and those where percolation is important relative to runoff for example the abs uf site sits clearly above the regression line in the et graph of fig 5b and below it in the streamflow graph as discussed previously abs uf receives on average 400 mm irrigation during the low rainfall season and there are strong interactions between surface water and groundwater with percolation being similar or greater than runoff the coefficients of determination for the et graphs increase to 0 93 for small catchments and 0 80 for large ones when plotted against precipitation irrigation irrigation typically occurs during the growing season when plants quickly use it and there are few opportunities for runoff or percolation similarly including percolation increases the strength of the relationship to r2 0 87 between precipitation and water outflow runoff drainage and percolation as the proportion of runoff to percolation is sensitive to the effects of crops tillage and soil type on surface runoff in contrast adding irrigation to precipitation when relating it to runoff or runoff percolation decreases the strength of the relationship indicating that in these watersheds most irrigators apply water at a low enough rate to limit surface runoff and percolation consequently the proportion of runoff and percolation during irrigation is minimal and is not reflective of the hydrologic processes occurring during natural rainfall 3 4 1 budyko plot the budyko plot fig 6 spatially divides the ltar sites into three groups based on their water and energy availability semi arid sites aridity index greater than 3 jer cper gb and wgew intermediate sites aridity index between 1 5 and 2 caf sp np and pr hpa and mesic sites aridity index less than 1 3 abs uf umrb tg gacp cmrb ucb lcb ecb kbs and lmrb this last group represents the optimal conditions for agriculture where the aridity index is around 1 the sites with the smallest values of this ratio correspond to energy limited northeast conditions ucb lcb and ecb where cloudiness decreases available solar energy arora 2002 many sites have similar pet p but vary in aet p from 0 4 for ecb to 0 8 for gacp and 0 9 for abs uf indicating that as a site gets warmer higher solar insolation the fraction of precipitation lost as evapotranspiration increases the lowest value of the aridity index among these agricultural sites was 0 8 an aridity index less than 0 8 would indicate a strongly energy limited system which would severely limit agricultural productivity in contrast jones et al 2012 and vadeboncoeur et al 2018 have estimated lower aridity indices for unmanaged forested small watersheds unmanaged grassland and desert sites had aridity indices in the same range as this set of agricultural sites jones et al 2012 on the right hand side of fig 6 aet p approaches 1 while the aridity index is greater than 3 the high energy availability and low water availability drive these high values of the aridity index the majority of the ltar sites lie under the water limit line where aet p 1 which is consistent with the observation that direct precipitation is the main water source for these sites low and medium aridity points above the budyko curve at gacp umrb abs uf sp and pr hpa may be caused by uncertainty in the component estimates or suggest that irrigation may be contributing to aet at pr hpa irrigation was on average 250 mm per year 30 of all inputs and aet p was greater than one irrigation was also applied at gacp and abs uf in contrast at umrb there is no irrigation and the position of the corresponding point above the theoretical budyko curve may be caused by uncertainties 4 discussion 4 1 opportunities for reducing uncertainties these results highlight opportunities to reduce measurement uncertainties and to improve closure of the water budgets longer datasets and concurrent measurements for all the components which is one objective of the ltar network will produce more accurate annual mean values however greater measurement accuracy is achievable as well we discuss here opportunities for reducing errors and setting achievable goals given that precipitation is the largest component of the water budget improving its measurement accuracy would improve smaller water budget uncertainties as well as modelling of the processes that control water movement across agricultural landscapes while this was the most accurately measured component supplemental tables s4 s5 previous research indicates that errors 4 are attainable with careful monitoring calibration and data quality control groisman and legates 1994 shedekar et al 2016 comparative experiments to measure undercatch with specific gauges are underway at several sites including wgew cmrb and ecb use of wind speed data may help determine the undercatch more accurately however for larger basins spatial variability across the basin may be a larger source of uncertainty than actual measurement errors among the et estimation methods model simulation led to the greatest uncertainties 25 on average uncertainty averaged 19 when et was based on the water budget residual and 17 when based on ec measurements these results highlight the current difficulty estimating et via direct measurement the complexity of the land surface affecting turbulence atmospheric stability and the existence of multiple land use types in proximity to the ec tower footprint influence measurement accuracy the lack of energy balance closure associated with eddy flux measurements is yet another source of uncertainty and is currently an active area of research foken 2008 leuning et al 2012 the energy balance problem creates uncertainty in the et estimate as some proportion of the residual energy from the lack of closure is missing from the latent heat flux causing an underestimation of total et how best to redistribute the missing energy is not well understood for ec measurements however methods do exist for measurements made with the bowen ratio method e g twine et al 2000 all sites that reported et based on ec data underestimated the total amount of et by some unknown amount due to this lack of closure in spite of these limitations all sites have installed ec towers sometimes on land with contrasted management thus providing improved estimates of the largest water budget component reducing overall uncertainties of the water budget and answering the question whether agricultural management can alter et comparing et estimates by using different methods can increase their reliability and overall errors as low as 10 may be achievable allen et al 2011 hamilton et al 2018 while water limitations affect et the penman monteith estimate is considered to be the upper bound of et estimates obtained through other methods allen et al 2011 another source of uncertainty in et arises from species level transpiration differences within mixed plant communities such as in multi crop agriculture or in rangelands containing wetlands and woodlands douglass 1965 further research is needed to reduce uncertainty under these conditions the amount of percolation varies with climate in semiarid regions there is substantial evidence that deep percolation or recharge to the groundwater occurs only in small portions of the basin where runoff is concentrated such as depressions and ephemeral stream channels goodrich et al 2004 or where redistribution and drifting of snow causes concentrated input to the soil chauvin et al 2011 there is little to no deep percolation in small upland or inter channel watersheds due to 1 plant adaptation to extract vadose zone moisture under large negative pressure 2 thick vadose zones and 3 upward temperature gradients coes and pool 2005 goodrich et al 2004 heilweil and solomon 2004 plummer et al 2004 scanlon et al 1997 2003 scott et al 2000 walvoord et al 2002 in more humid regions percolation and groundwater recharge occur throughout the upland catchment area in this study percolation was the component with the greatest uncertainty yet this variable is essential to our understanding of the sustainability of agriculture and regional water resources to ensure maximum crop growth precipitation needs to infiltrate into the soil where plants can utilize it water not used by vegetation nor evaporated can percolate and contribute to aquifer recharge and stream base flow greater and slower percolation through the soil reduces the magnitude of floods and droughts respectively as such it is essential that percolation be adequately quantified since percolation is difficult to measure directly it is frequently derived by subtraction as the water budget residual accuracy of the water balance method to estimate percolation will improve as other components are measured with greater certainty in addition some of the techniques discussed in the percolation section 2 3 5 could possibly be extended from semi arid watersheds to other ltar watershed sites as for et the concurrent use of multiple methods to measure percolation may increase the reliability of percolation estimates soil water content drives plant growth and production in agroecosystems yet it is often poorly measured and carries a high degree of uncertainty across the ltar network fortunately there are many methods available for measuring soil water content vereecken et al 2008 2014 which can increase our understanding of water dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales point based measurements with electromagnetic sensors e g capacitance probes time domain reflectometry can monitor temporal variability in soil water content at a single location or can be linked through wireless sensor networks to increase spatial coverage vereecken et al 2014 air and space borne sensors can map near surface soil water content at larger spatial scales where point based measurements are not feasible mohanty et al 2017 vereecken et al 2014 by increasing our understanding of soil water dynamics in agroecosystems we will improve our water budget estimates and provide valuable information for agricultural production and water management 4 2 the role and detection of climate induced changes with ltar sites spanning the united states potential changes in temperature and precipitation at each site will vary by region romero lankao et al 2014 while these potential differences in climate trajectory are not explored here changes in mean high and or low extremes in temperature garbrecht et al 2014b and precipitation feng et al 2016 have been directly observed at some long term site locations and are likely to be occurring at others garbrecht et al 2014a lu et al 2015 nayak et al 2010 knowledge of the effects of these changes on the water budgets components for agricultural land will inform the management of water resources in agricultural watersheds under future climate currently the effects are simulated based on climate and hydrologic models ltar sites have explored climate change impacts through modeling at various scales and u s locations impacts on winter wheat production and erosion in the southern plains garbrecht and zhang 2015 garbrecht et al 2015 2016 zhang 2012 hydrologic impacts in the goodwater creek experimental watershed in the central mississippi river basin gautam et al 2018 phung et al 2019 impacts on evapotranspiration water stress and productivity in sagebrush ecosystems flerchinger et al 2019 and impacts on runoff sediment and nutrient loads in beasley lake watershed yasarer et al 2017 monitoring of the different water budget components is necessary to provide evidence based demonstration of these effects verify model results and encourage adoption of management practices that mitigate the effects of future climate yet at these ltar sites the expected changes in discharge and et caused by an increase in temperature or precipitation are expected to remain small 10 and smaller than the current measurement uncertainties for these components thus direct observation of these trends will require improved measurement techniques and uncertainty quantification as well as a reduction of these uncertainties at or below the magnitude of the expected changes in addition potential divergence of conclusions based on model results and monitoring data should enable the improvement of these models ultimately modeling uncertainties cannot be smaller than the uncertainties of the data used to develop and calibrate the models thus the use of models to inform adaptation to climate change requires high quality data to develop and calibrate these models the ltar network is addressing these monitoring challenges with respect to evapotranspiration the ec towers installed at most ltar sites will allow for long term measurements of et over a wide range of conditions and may be useful for detecting trends related to climate change these towers will add to the growing body of data broadly collected through networks such as ameriflux and ensure that a variety of agricultural systems are represented in these long term databases thompson et al 2011 extremes in the current climate regime are also a challenge to quantify accurately and present an opportunity for the ltar network to contribute new methods tipping bucket rain gauges typically underestimate precipitation volumes during high rainfall events michaelides et al 2009 expected increases in precipitation intensity may result in more events that exceed the capacity of current measuring systems to accurately measure precipitation volume and rates kunkel et al 2013 shedekar et al 2016 with ltar sites developing field based infrastructure to measure climatic variables in agroecosystems across climatic regions there is potential to test and implement new technologies for direct measurement of precipitation and to provide comparisons for remotely sensed radar and satellite methods an increase in extreme precipitation events may also cause flooding and bankfull flow conditions that exceed the current range of observed flows or the feasibility of a measurement such extreme conditions increase the uncertainty in quantification of flows baffaut et al 2014 hamilton and moore 2012 harman et al 2008 when on the ground data collection is not safe or feasible use of aerial imagery light detection and ranging lidar data or satellite measurements may fill in some gaps bjerklie 2007 mount et al 2003 schumann et al 2011 the diverse expertise within the ltar network in the fields of remote sensing field hydrology and hydrologic modeling provides strong potential for collaborations across these methodologies for improved quantification and understanding of the impacts of extreme events on agroecosystems 4 3 the impact of sustainable management spiegal et al 2018 identified the dominant sustainability goals of agricultural intensification across the ltar network including the protection and improvement of regional water quality sought in 16 of 18 sites and water supply sought in 8 of 18 sites the three most frequently cited water related goals at these sites include reducing runoff increasing infiltration or percolation and increasing soil water content or water holding capacity by amounts ranging from 10 to 20 these goals collectively support the general objectives of increasing water use efficiency for plant growth such aspirational outcomes can be achieved by techniques adapted to the specific conditions at each site sites having excessive runoff or percolation have the opportunity to explore alternative cropping systems or rotations that increase crop production and therefore et and reduce water losses in some locations like the caf site this may mean a transition to more fall seeded crops to take advantage of winter and early spring soil moisture in other locations this may mean exploring cover cropping or intercropping however this analysis has shown that the uncertainty of the components was greater than the expected impact these practices may have on water budget components i e 10 20 therefore improved measurement of the water budget components is necessary to evaluate the suitability of these practices and the quantification of water resources in agricultural watersheds if these practices are widely adopted conversely there are few opportunities to intensify cropping systems in regions with very low percolation and runoff crop production and agroecosystem sustainability will be highly vulnerable to future shifts in the climate and irrigation may have an important role in these regions the relative lack of irrigation use among the ltar sites reflects the rationale for the historical establishment of these research sites long term water quality problems which are often associated with runoff and or drainage or rangeland sites in semi arid climatic regions which are typically not irrigated nevertheless the role of irrigation in major u s regions such as the central and southern plains the lower mississippi river basin the southeast and the california central valley will likely continue to grow as climate becomes less predictable döll 2002 furthermore any water limited i e semi arid region could benefit from irrigation however reliance on irrigation modifies the magnitude of some of the water budget components at field and watershed scale in addition it increases vulnerability to future reductions in water availability accurate determination of water budgets under irrigation management is therefore critical water supply limitations in many of these regions have resulted in initiation of new research on irrigation efficiency and the development of water saving approaches bryant et al 2017 kebede et al 2014 payero et al 2009 as the ltar network continues to evaluate long term water budgets across the united states it will be important to consider the changing role of irrigation use and efficiency on growing season water inputs as irrigation becomes a more significant requirement in the future the ltar network will need to address it as a component of aspirational management scenarios an ongoing challenge to ltar network research is that percolation and soil water content are poorly quantified demonstrating the benefits of these aspirational goals will require additional investment in the development and utilization of monitoring equipment to improve estimates of percolation and soil water content and to further reduce uncertainty in estimation of these water budget components 5 conclusions water budgets were developed using multi annual data from small and large catchments at the 18 ltar sites in the united states by estimating precipitation evapotranspiration surface outflows surface and subsurface flow percolation and change in water storage hydrologic characterization of each catchment was performed using indicators such as evapotranspiration and surface outflow a budyko plot of all the sites

5317,understanding the movement and storage of water within agricultural landscapes as functions of management and climate is essential for more efficient and sustainable water use however knowledge of water storage and fluxes on u s agricultural lands is largely incomplete the long term agroecosystem research ltar network provides a unique and geographically diverse set of agricultural study sites in the united states the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the hydrologic variability across the ltar network 2 identify data gaps in the water budgets across the ltar network and 3 identify opportunities to leverage the ltar network to improve understanding of water budgets across agricultural landscapes for each of the 18 ltar sites we developed water budgets on an average annual basis uncertainty propagation methods combined individual component uncertainties to calculate an overall water budget uncertainty datasets length ranged from three to 50 years the network covers a range of precipitation from 240 to 1400 mm yr 1 evapotranspiration from 228 to 1080 mm yr 1 and surface runoff and subsurface flow from negligible to 560 mm yr 1 however uncertainties of where all the water is going remained high in part because soil water storage and downward movement of water were often neglected or measured for very short periods resulting in average water budget uncertainty of 25 of the water inputs more accurate measurement of the major inputs and outputs and direct measurement of water content and percolation are key to understanding how agricultural lands affect terrestrial water budgets 1 introduction intensification of agriculture can affect water availability by increasing land under crop and forage production raymond et al 2008 schilling et al 2008 tomer and schilling 2009 or by increasing land productivity zeri et al 2013 simultaneously climatic changes in temperature and precipitation can alter available water resources in several ways by 1 increasing the rate and timing of evapotranspiration through elevated temperatures flerchinger et al 2019 kingston et al 2009 and changes in crop planting times gautam et al 2018 2 altering the amount timing and form of seasonal or annual precipitation i e rain or snow us global change research program 2017 and 3 altering precipitation intensity which could lead to greater runoff and reduced percolation gautam et al 2018 groisman et al 2001 key to the adaptation of agriculture across varying climates is the management of water the natural availability of which ranges from deficit to excess for crops and rangelands in water limited environments agriculture competes with other water users conversely water replete environments may be challenging because of poorly drained soils extreme precipitation events are challenging everywhere because of erosion and loss of water to runoff agricultural activities can affect the availability and quality of surface and ground waters making careful management a fundamental requirement for sustainability conflicts arising from agricultural water management such as water availability for municipal industrial or recreational uses e g water shortages in brazil in 2017 south africa in 2018 and in india in 2019 and contamination of water bodies from agricultural pollution are becoming more frequent and threaten the well being of future generations and the environment united nations convention to combat desertification 2017 in the united states recent droughts e g 2016 in georgia or 2011 2017 in california and floods 2008 in iowa 2011 and 2019 along the mississippi and missouri rivers have significantly impacted agricultural production as well as water quality of receiving water bodies understanding the balance between precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and groundwater recharge is critical to evaluating local regional and global water resources healy et al 2007 a balanced water budget accounts for all of the major water inputs and outputs over an annual cycle in a defined area water budgets depend on topography climate soils land use and land management in small catchments a water budget provides an overview of the fate of water inputs evapotranspiration is commonly the main output with the remaining balance going to groundwater recharge or streamflow generation water budgets describe the water pathways through the farm and rangeland management systems accurate water budgets for small catchments can also inform integrated land and water management in larger catchments and contribute to the analysis of potential trade offs between water allocations for agriculture and other uses understanding how each budget component may shift as a function of management informs the optimal use of available water resources under varying climate land use and agricultural production optimization of water resources at the watershed or regional scale may in turn result in specific recommendations for the management of agricultural land in those regions our current knowledge of water fluxes across agricultural landscapes in the united states is largely incomplete for areas the size of a field studies in agroecosystems focus on individual components of the water budget often overland or subsurface runoff or evapotranspiration e g bosch et al 2012 buckley et al 2010 for large watersheds water budget estimates are often based on models which are calibrated with streamflow data measured at the outlet of the watershed afinowicz et al 2005 green et al 2006 schilling et al 2008 or not calibrated if the modeling objective is to understand the primary hydrologic processes abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 gobin et al 2017 regional research networks provide an opportunity to benefit from long term ecological and hydrologic process site studies across a gradient of climatic conditions land use and land management for example data from the u s long term ecological research network as well as other north american networks have helped identify forest type susceptibility to climate warming creed et al 2014 the long term agroecosystem research ltar network is a partnership of 18 long term research sites maintained by the u s department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars and academic institutions spiegal et al 2018 walbridge and shafer 2011 the ltar network was established in 2014 to provide information in support of research for improved sustainability and intensification of u s agriculture over the next 20 to 50 years kleinman et al 2018 the ltar network includes 18 experimental watersheds 11 usda ars and ranges where precipitation and other hydro meteorological variables have been systematically measured and archived for decades the ltar network offers an opportunity to estimate and compare water budget components across a gradient of agroecosystems and climatic conditions as a baseline from which to evaluate the impacts and sensitivity of management in a changing climate these water budgets provide a mechanism to identify deficiencies in monitoring instrumentation the availability of data for additional comparative studies and the identification of aspirational goals for regional watershed management these data also provide an opportunity to evaluate the uncertainty of water budget components for accurate cross site and regional analysis the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the hydrologic variability across the ltar network 2 identify data gaps in the water budgets across the ltar network and 3 identify opportunities to leverage the ltar network to improve understanding of water budgets across agricultural landscapes analyses were conducted for 13 small catchments 50 ha and 13 large catchments 400 ha distributed among the 18 ltar site locations 2 methods 2 1 study sites a water budget assessment was conducted at 26 study areas across 18 ltar sites fig 1 each ltar site was responsible for selecting one or more representative study areas determining a period for which data were available and calculating the mean and standard deviation of annual values for each water budget component the assessments cover a range of soil land use supplemental table s1 and climatological conditions supplemental fig s1 the 26 locations were divided based on the size of the drainage area and uniformity of land use 13 small catchments were smaller than 50 ha and had uniform land use 13 large catchments were greater than 400 ha and could include multiple land uses even though some of the study areas were large plots 190 m2 that did not meet the hydrologic definition of a natural catchment artificial boundaries at these sites prevented the inflow of surface and subsurface water as a result they did behave as a catchment and were included in the analysis 2 2 water budget equation we used the following general equation for the annual water budget 1 p i q in e t q out δ s where p is annual precipitation i is annual irrigation qin is annual water flow into the catchment et is annual evapotranspiration qout is annual water flow out of the catchment δs is the annual change in water storage for small catchments the water budgets were derived for the soil profile system down to the maximum of the rooting depth or 150 cm therefore water storage was limited to soil water storage and water flow out of the system included surface flow subsurface lateral flow and downward percolation beyond the monitored soil profile rooting zone fig 2 for large catchments the water budgets were also determined for the soil profile system but for these catchments the maximum depth extended down to and including the aquifer that provides base flow water storage included soil storage ponds and reservoirs and the aquifer water flow out of the system included streamflow measured at the outlet of the catchment and deeper percolation which was considered to replenish deeper regional aquifers that did not contribute to the water storage or flow within the catchment thus system water storage and percolation did not have the same meaning for small and large catchments 2 3 water budget component estimation and uncertainty each site used their own datasets and methods to develop the water budgets supplemental section s3 supplemental tables s4 through s15 provide metadata about estimation methods and estimate uncertainty for each water budget component specific to each site sources of uncertainty may include measurement errors random or systematic errors in the estimation of derived variables extrapolated interpolated data scaled data temporal and spatial variability and data quality control and management issues harmel et al 2006 2009 mcmillan et al 2012 montgomery and sanders 1986 below we provide a summary of the methods used to estimate each component of the water budget and determine its uncertainty all uncertainties are assumed to be bi directional 2 3 1 precipitation precipitation data ranged from 3 to 50 years supplemental tables s4 and s5 for all the sites but the r j cook agronomy farm caf the gauge s were very near or within the catchment at two sites lower chesapeake bay lcb and caf precipitation gauges were the responsibility of a different organization and metadata were not available at most sites precipitation was measured with tipping bucket or 20 cm diameter belfort weighing rain gauges using calibration and maintenance procedures recommended by brakensiek et al 1979 the belfort gauge diameter varied larger or smaller for a few sites several sites used load cells to detect and quantify precipitation at a pre defined frequency the caf site used a non recording rain gauge and measurements were manual the greatest uncertainty in precipitation measurement was the undercatch which we estimated as a function of winter precipitation and whether a wind shield was present details for the estimation of precipitation uncertainty are provided in supplemental section s4 2 3 2 irrigation in the small catchments crops were irrigated at only two sites platte river and high plains aquifer pr hpa in nebraska and gulf atlantic coastal plains gacp in georgia supplemental table s6 among the large catchments irrigation was a component of the water budget at the southern plains sp beasley lake watershed in the lower mississippi river basin lmrb and archbold biological station university of florida abs uf sites supplemental table s7 irrigation was quantified using farmer reports abs uf and lmrb or model estimates sp irrigation was present but was either judged to be insignificant at the upper mississippi river basin umrb central mississippi river basin cmrb and kellogg biological station kbs sites because the irrigated area was small relative to non irrigated cropland or it was unknown gacp irrigation in the small catchments was under the control of the scientists therefore a 5 uncertainty was assigned to account for application uncertainty unless a different value was provided in the large catchments irrigation amounts estimated from farmer reports were assigned a 10 uncertainty to account for reporting errors a 25 uncertainty was assigned when estimates were based on model simulated water stress 2 3 3 evapotranspiration infrastructure measuring et was only recently established at most ltar sites four sites had et data from eddy covariance ec flux towers caf great basin gb walnut gulch experimental watershed wgew and northern plains np supplemental tables s8 and s9 in addition the kbs site was able to use eddy covariance data to validate the et estimates obtained by residual of the water balance equation the texas gulf tg site measured pan evaporation seven sites used modeling to estimate et these models combine potential et e g based on the meteorological parameter based fao 56 penman monteith model allen et al 1998 with a crop growth model and available soil moisture to calculate crop water uptake at abs uf vegetation coefficients were calibrated using lysimeters in lieu of a crop growth model the fao 56 method combined with vegetation coefficients yields accurate estimates of potential et for monocrop agriculture under well watered conditions i e where water availability does not limit transpiration anderson et al 2017 mcmahon et al 2013 pereira et al 2015 all other sites assumed closed systems and estimated et by subtraction from the water balance equation assuming small unquantified components of the system were negligible uncertainty of et varies with the method used to estimate its value supplemental section s5 provides details about et measurement uncertainty estimation the uncertainty of et estimates based on the water budget residual was a function of the uncertainties of the quantified components where percolation and changes in water storage were not quantified the uncertainty of these components was also unknown we assumed that average annual change in water storage and its uncertainty were both equal to 0 we further set the absolute uncertainty of percolation to be 16 of average annual precipitation based on the average ratio of percolation uncertainty to average precipitation among the sites where percolation was quantified modeled et estimates also had uncertainties except for abs uf the uncertainty associated with modeled et estimates was not quantified as for other water budget components a 25 modeling uncertainty was assigned the models used for estimating et included the soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 2012 the agricultural policy environmental extender wang et al 2012 and the annualized agricultural non point source pollution model bingner and theurer 2001 in these et is calculated as a function of potential et and crop growth which is constrained by available nutrients and soil water these models had been calibrated for crop or biomass yields surface outflows and sometimes for drainage or subsurface flow but not for et or percolation modeling errors on crop yields are typically 20 wang et al 2012 and models are often considered acceptable if errors are within 25 of measured values moriasi et al 2015 thus a 25 modeling uncertainty was assigned however we wanted to avoid the possibility that the uncertainty of et would be greater when modeled with a calibrated model than when estimated as the residual of the water budget when all other components were quantified modeled et uncertainty was assigned the lowest of the uncertainty of the water budget residual calculated by uncertainty propagation or 25 as explained later when some components were not quantified the modeled et uncertainty was set at 25 2 3 4 surface and subsurface outflows discharge surface or subsurface was measured at all but three small catchments supplemental table s10 surface runoff was assumed to be negligible at the jornada experimental range jer gutschick and snyder 2006 the np area iv farm and the central plains experimental range cper dodd and lauenroth 1997 surface runoff was assumed to be a fraction of precipitation at the pr hpa site szilagyi et al 2005 most other sites used pre calibrated flumes or weirs to quantify discharge from stage data and were rarely overtopped exceptions included the upper chesapeake bay ucb kepler farm where water volumes flowing through a structure were measured directly with tipping buckets at umrb kelley farm surface flow was considered negligible in some small catchment studies caf umrb ucb eastern corn belt ecb and gacp investigators also measured subsurface flow using a subsurface drain at umrb subsurface drainage was measured with in line flow meters discharge streamflow was directly measured at all the large catchment outlets supplemental table s11 which makes it the second most frequently measured component for all the large catchments except the beasley lake watershed lmrb discharge measurement consisted of continuous stage water depth measurement with a pressure transducer float or sonic sensor the stage data were then converted to discharge rates using an established stage discharge relationship derived from flow measurements or a pre calibrated weir or flume the stage discharge relationship of the control structure was complemented by streamflow measurements for high flows that overtopped the control structure for the beasley lake watershed streamflow was estimated with a calibrated model yasarer et al 2020 in the present study the uncertainty in streamflow surface runoff and subsurface flow was estimated with the procedure of harmel et al 2006 and is described in supplemental section s6 2 3 5 percolation for practical reasons only two small catchments estimated percolation of water beyond the monitored root zone using independent measurements tg measured percolation by measuring groundwater levels in wells placed throughout the catchment and wgew estimated no percolation based on measured chloride concentrations as a function of soil depth supplemental tables s12 and s13 for the large catchments only the wgew site had independent estimates of deep percolation which occurs primarily in depressions and ephemeral channels and was estimated using multiple methods goodrich et al 2004 at other sites percolation was estimated as the residual of the water balance alternatively some sites used a literature value e g gacp 1 of precipitation rawls and asmussen 1973 or modeling e g cmrb 2 3 6 soil water storage soil water content was measured in seven small catchments supplemental table s14 and one large catchment sp supplemental table s15 in all of these soil moisture sensors were installed in multiple locations and at multiple depths for sp starks et al 2014 describe in detail the network of 15 soil moisture sites in the fort cobb watershed and the processing of the data to obtain water storage across the full catchment soil water measurements exist in the gacp large catchment but were not used for this analysis measurement methods included gravimetric measurements neutron probes time domain reflectometry and other soil moisture sensors uncertainty associated with these measurements ranged from 2 5 to 5 5 for the other sites change in soil water storage was either not quantified or was estimated via modeling or by applying the water balance equation as for other modeled water budget components a 25 uncertainty was assigned to change in soil water storage estimated by modeling if the water balance equation was used the uncertainty was dependent on the uncertainty of the other water budget components when several water budget terms were unavailable e g percolation and change in soil water content the difference in known sources and sinks of water was attributed to percolation and changes in soil water content were assumed to be negligible changes in soil water storage were estimated with the water balance equation only when all the other terms were estimated by other means 2 4 effect of missing data missing data introduce a bias by underestimating the annual value of the measured component however filling missing data often performed by regression with relevant time series results in reduced spatial and temporal variability of the data guzman et al 2014 demonstrated this effect across dozens of precipitation time series 5 min time step in the little washita and fort cobb experimental watersheds for sites with less than 10 missing precipitation data the reduction of the coefficient of variation caused by infilling missing data was less than 2 and considered acceptable imputing data gaps was considered preferable to the use of incomplete datasets for analysis of spatial and temporal trends in this study uncertainties in the average annual value for datasets with missing data were derived from the guzman et al 2014 study of precipitation data if missing data consisted of no more than 1 of the dataset no additional uncertainty was applied to the average annual value if the amount of missing data was greater than 1 the uncertainty of the average annual value was increased by the greater of 2 or the percentage of missing data unless the missing data were imputed in that case the uncertainty was increased by 2 occasionally there was no information about missing precipitation and discharge data in those cases we used the upper bound of missing data percentages among the sites that provided this information 14 for precipitation and 11 for discharge an uncertainty value of 40 was assigned to component values estimated from the literature 2 5 combination and propagation of uncertainties the square root of the sum of squares equation was used to estimate uncertainty resulting from several steps or factors e g discharge uncertainty supplemental section s6 and to estimate the uncertainty of data resulting from addition or subtraction for example when a component e g et was estimated from precipitation and outflow eq 2 then the uncertainty of that component was derived from those of the other components as in eq 3 2 et p q 3 u et u p 2 u q 2 to estimate the uncertainty of data resulting from multiplication or division the uncertainties were expressed in percentages relative errors before applying the quadrature formula for example the runoff coefficient qcoeff was calculated from eq 4 and its uncertainty was estimated by eq 5 4 q coeff q p 5 u qcoeff qcoeff u q q 2 u p p 2 2 6 determination of inter annual variability our analysis was based on average annual values availability of measured or simulated data across the network was highly variable ranging from 3 years for some components of the budget for some study areas to 30 50 years for all components at others in order to use estimates based on different lengths of datasets measures of uncertainty of the means caused by interannual variability were calculated we used the standard error of the mean to quantify the range of possible values of the true mean given the sample size and its standard deviation 2 7 hydrologic characterization of each site for each small and large catchment hydrologic characterization was based on the runoff and et coefficients runoff and et as a fraction of precipitation and irrigation and on the closure of the water balance equation the closure indicates the extent to which the water budget was balanced when taking into account the uncertainties of each component measured components as well as those estimated via modeling expert knowledge or literature values were included with the corresponding uncertainties all inputs to the system i e precipitation and irrigation were summed and the total input uncertainty calculated by combining uncertainties of individual components the same was done for all the outputs from the system i e surface runoff subsurface discharge artificial drainage if any evapotranspiration percolation to groundwater and changes in soil water storage while not an output of the system per se changes in soil water storage are one possible use of the water inputs a loss in soil water storage was represented with a negative value the water budget uncertainty δwater eq 6 quantifies the closure of the average annual water budget 6 δ w a t e r i n p u t s o u t p u

u t s additionally the smallest possible water budget uncertainty for each catchment was estimated based on the hypothesis that best measurement practices would be used everywhere over a 30 year period so that both the measurement error and the interannual variability would be minimized we also assumed that there were no missing data or that data gaps had been filled 2 7 1 use of the budyko framework the wide range of precipitation and solar insolation across north america leads to large differences in evapotranspiration which in turn strongly affect water availability for agriculture and downstream ecosystems ltar sites lie along gradients of water availability and solar insolation or energy limitation a graphical way to distinguish between water limited and energy limited sites is the budyko framework budyko 1974 this framework describes the partitioning of catchment precipitation into evapotranspiration and discharge in terms of water and energy availability arora 2002 gunkel and lange 2017 sposito 2017 budyko s assumption was that evapotranspiration is limited by water in semi arid regions and by energy in wet regions zhang et al 2001 the budyko curve is the theoretical relationship between the aridity index potential et precipitation and the evaporative fraction actual et precipitation westhoff et al 2016 potential et is primarily a function of solar radiation and is equivalent to the actual et under conditions of no water limitation actual et is limited by available water and or energy available for the evaporation of water reported average annual actual et and precipitation and average annual potential et derived from modis16 mu et al 2007 2011 were used to compare the relative energy and water limitations across all small and large catchments at the ltar sites an aridity index and evaporative fraction characterized each site if a site had multiple catchments average values of actual et precipitation and potential et were used so that each ltar site was represented by a single point the budyko curve was developed based on the relationship modified by zhang et al 2001 to include vegetation type effects on et and is expressed as eq 8 8 aet p 1 w p e t p 1 w p e t p p p e t where aet is actual et p is precipitation w is the plant available water coefficient with a value of 0 5 for cropland 1 for grassland and 2 for forest based on a study of over 300 catchments worldwide zhang et al 2001 and pet is potential et 3 results 3 1 water budgets across the ltar network the magnitudes and uncertainty of each water budget component are described for each catchment in supplemental tables s16 and s17 and are summarized in figs 3 and 4 and tables 1 and 2 the ltar network covers a gradient of precipitation from 240 mm yr 1 at jer to 1400 mm yr 1 at lmrb precipitation was the component measured with the smallest relative uncertainty 5 17 tables 1 and 2 however it was also the largest component and the absolute uncertainties related to precipitation were the second largest among all water budget components 19 to 237 mm the smallest uncertainties 10 were obtained with shielded rain gauges generally installed at the northern sites where snow conditions dominate for more than half of the year np gb caf and kbs or with unshielded gauges at the southern sites where snow conditions are very rare abs uf gacp and wgew at the remaining sites winter precipitation was significant but not compensated for by gauge shielding consequently precipitation uncertainties were greater than 10 et values ranged from 228 mm yr 1 at jer to 1080 mm yr 1 at abs uf the variety of methods used to estimate et across ltar sites supplemental tables s8 and s9 is reflective of the spectrum of independent approaches used worldwide each with its own sources of uncertainty allen et al 2011 when et was obtained as the water budget residual the uncertainties of each of the components contributed to the uncertainty associated with the et estimate as did the terms that were omitted from the budget modelled results had a different set of uncertainties associated with model assumptions and parameter measurements as well as the inability in some cases to obtain site specific calibration or customization of the models relative uncertainties in et ranging from 8 to 38 resulted in absolute uncertainties ranging from 32 to 325 mm surface and subsurface flows at the small catchments and streamflow at the large ones were also affected by the gradient of precipitation and et ranging from none or negligible amounts 10 mm yr 1 at the driest sites gb wgew jer and central plains experimental range cper to more than 550 mm yr 1 at lmrb however differences between soils had a strong influence runoff at the np site was negligible because permeable soils hydrologic soil group b favored percolation 100 mm yr 1 at ucb surface runoff was low at the small catchment site kepler farm in comparison to that measured at the we 38 watershed because of the presence of karst features at kepler farm which promote downward movement of water percolation was measured only at tg and wgew at the small catchments where percolation was quantified percolation below the monitored root zone ranged from 0 mm at wgew to 136 mm yr 1 at np for the large catchments percolation to the deep aquifer ranged from 5 mm yr 1 at cmrb to 460 mm yr 1 at abs uf because most sites estimated that component uncertainties were large sometimes larger than the mean value e g 374 at caf small catchment or 76 at abs uf and led to considerable uncertainty about water movement at the caf small catchment runoff and subsurface runoff were quantified at 105 13 mm while et was 474 92 mm which led to percolation being 26 98 mm while runoff and subsurface runoff were measured with good accuracy the uncertainties on et and percolation make it difficult to state whether percolation was a significant output at most sites for example at the abs uf site runoff through the ditch canal network was quantified at 92 24 mm while et was 1080 325 mm which resulted in percolation being 460 349 mm this could indicate percolation or seepage was a significant loss of water from the catchment similar to or even larger than surface runoff a distinct possibility given high hydraulic conductivity of sandy soils at abs uf at these sites and others more precise and accurate quantification of et and runoff will lead to improved quantification of percolation and an improved understanding of water movement in this study the net change in water storage soil water for small catchments and soil shallow aquifer and impoundments for large catchments over the data analysis period 3 35 years was always close to zero annual changes could be either positive or negative for years that were abnormally dry or wet but leveled out as weather patterns returned to normal however changes in system water storage may be more significant and meaningful when investigating water movement over periods ranging from a few months to a single year 3 2 irrigated sites irrigation was used in only three of the large catchments fort cobb at the southern plains sp site beasley lake at the lmrb site and the bir35 catchment at the abs uf site and two of the small catchments site 1 at the pr hpa site and gibbs farm at the gacp site it was used in the two large lcb catchments but not quantified among these five irrigated ltar sites the abs uf site is rangeland while the other four sites are predominantly cropland the growing season starts from april to june and ends in october at the cropland sites table 3 applied water ranged from 121 mm yr 1 in the fort cobb watershed sp to 238 mm yr 1 at site 1 pr hpa those amounts represent 17 to 35 of the total growing season water inputs abs uf is a subtropical humid rangeland site with the peak growing season coinciding with the rainy season from april to october hence irrigation occurs primarily during the dry season to maintain pastures from january to april contributing up to 53 of the monthly water inputs to the system on average during these months the source of irrigation water was always outside of the system considered ponds outside the fields considered gacp canal water for abs or groundwater lmrb pr hpa and sp see supplemental information irrigation application values and percentages should not be compared from site to site as each location has a different approach for estimating the irrigation applied for the small catchments the values shown in table 3 are only from irrigated plots small catchment irrigation was controlled by researchers and has low uncertainty for the larger catchments irrigation values were determined using the total catchment size fort cobb and abs uf or the area of total cropland beasley lake irrigation application rates for these sites were estimated based on modeled values for fort cobb farmer reported values for beasley lake and measured input values from canals at abs uf the number of years of data availability differed at each site the irrigation method also influenced irrigation application estimates for example at beasley lake both center pivot and furrow irrigation are common but furrow irrigation has application rates two to three times that of center pivot systems therefore the efficiency of the application method is an important characteristic to consider when evaluating the irrigation component in the water budgets 3 3 water budget uncertainty relative water budget uncertainty ranged from 11 to 47 of inputs for the small catchments and 9 to 40 for the large catchments the average relative uncertainty was not affected by scale and was within 25 for both small and large catchments median values were 23 and 28 for small and large catchments respectively for small catchments the largest sources of uncertainty came from evapotranspiration with an average uncertainty contribution of 99 mm followed by uncertainties in precipitation percolation surface and subsurface flows irrigation and change in soil water table 1 for large catchments the greatest contributors to the uncertainty of the water budget were deep percolation and evapotranspiration followed by precipitation stream discharge irrigation and change in water storage table 2 the difference in the contribution of percolation from the small vs large catchments to the overall water budget uncertainty was largely attributed to the small and large catchments being located at different ltar sites only six sites had both large and small catchments four of which had estimated percolation wgew caf cmrb and gacp for two sites the contribution of percolation uncertainty to the overall water budget uncertainty was very similar for the small and large catchments close to 100 mm at caf for 25 mm of percolation and 3 mm at gacp for 12 mm of percolation at cmrb the percolation contribution to the water budget uncertainty was 18 mm for the small catchment and 5 mm for the large one while at wgew it was 0 mm for the small catchment and 40 mm for the large one when dominant soils elevation climate and land use and management in the large catchment match those in the small catchment percolation for small catchments should be greater than for large catchments that is because percolation from small catchments replenishes the aquifer that provides base flow this was the case at cmrb yet when biophysical characteristics are different soils climate karst features percolation from one scale cannot inform percolation at the other scale differences between the hydrologic soil group of the small catchment soils and dominant large catchment soils existed at caf wgew umrb and ucb 3 4 hydrologic characterization of the ltar network relationships between precipitation and et and precipitation and surface runoff artificial drainage for small catchments or streamflow for large catchments fig 5 were all significant and generally stronger at the small catchment scale the relationships illustrated in fig 5 allowed the identification of groups of sites and anomalies the four driest sites i e gb jer wgew and cper anchored those plots et and p were less than 400 mm and close to each other and surface flow was very small the coefficients of determination obtained without values from these driest sites were smaller and the relationship between precipitation and et was not significant on the other end of the precipitation spectrum maximum small catchment et and precipitation were at the gacp site maximum large catchment et was at abs uf because of 400 mm of irrigation while maximum precipitation was at lmrb anomalies in these graphs include the irrigated sites and those where percolation is important relative to runoff for example the abs uf site sits clearly above the regression line in the et graph of fig 5b and below it in the streamflow graph as discussed previously abs uf receives on average 400 mm irrigation during the low rainfall season and there are strong interactions between surface water and groundwater with percolation being similar or greater than runoff the coefficients of determination for the et graphs increase to 0 93 for small catchments and 0 80 for large ones when plotted against precipitation irrigation irrigation typically occurs during the growing season when plants quickly use it and there are few opportunities for runoff or percolation similarly including percolation increases the strength of the relationship to r2 0 87 between precipitation and water outflow runoff drainage and percolation as the proportion of runoff to percolation is sensitive to the effects of crops tillage and soil type on surface runoff in contrast adding irrigation to precipitation when relating it to runoff or runoff percolation decreases the strength of the relationship indicating that in these watersheds most irrigators apply water at a low enough rate to limit surface runoff and percolation consequently the proportion of runoff and percolation during irrigation is minimal and is not reflective of the hydrologic processes occurring during natural rainfall 3 4 1 budyko plot the budyko plot fig 6 spatially divides the ltar sites into three groups based on their water and energy availability semi arid sites aridity index greater than 3 jer cper gb and wgew intermediate sites aridity index between 1 5 and 2 caf sp np and pr hpa and mesic sites aridity index less than 1 3 abs uf umrb tg gacp cmrb ucb lcb ecb kbs and lmrb this last group represents the optimal conditions for agriculture where the aridity index is around 1 the sites with the smallest values of this ratio correspond to energy limited northeast conditions ucb lcb and ecb where cloudiness decreases available solar energy arora 2002 many sites have similar pet p but vary in aet p from 0 4 for ecb to 0 8 for gacp and 0 9 for abs uf indicating that as a site gets warmer higher solar insolation the fraction of precipitation lost as evapotranspiration increases the lowest value of the aridity index among these agricultural sites was 0 8 an aridity index less than 0 8 would indicate a strongly energy limited system which would severely limit agricultural productivity in contrast jones et al 2012 and vadeboncoeur et al 2018 have estimated lower aridity indices for unmanaged forested small watersheds unmanaged grassland and desert sites had aridity indices in the same range as this set of agricultural sites jones et al 2012 on the right hand side of fig 6 aet p approaches 1 while the aridity index is greater than 3 the high energy availability and low water availability drive these high values of the aridity index the majority of the ltar sites lie under the water limit line where aet p 1 which is consistent with the observation that direct precipitation is the main water source for these sites low and medium aridity points above the budyko curve at gacp umrb abs uf sp and pr hpa may be caused by uncertainty in the component estimates or suggest that irrigation may be contributing to aet at pr hpa irrigation was on average 250 mm per year 30 of all inputs and aet p was greater than one irrigation was also applied at gacp and abs uf in contrast at umrb there is no irrigation and the position of the corresponding point above the theoretical budyko curve may be caused by uncertainties 4 discussion 4 1 opportunities for reducing uncertainties these results highlight opportunities to reduce measurement uncertainties and to improve closure of the water budgets longer datasets and concurrent measurements for all the components which is one objective of the ltar network will produce more accurate annual mean values however greater measurement accuracy is achievable as well we discuss here opportunities for reducing errors and setting achievable goals given that precipitation is the largest component of the water budget improving its measurement accuracy would improve smaller water budget uncertainties as well as modelling of the processes that control water movement across agricultural landscapes while this was the most accurately measured component supplemental tables s4 s5 previous research indicates that errors 4 are attainable with careful monitoring calibration and data quality control groisman and legates 1994 shedekar et al 2016 comparative experiments to measure undercatch with specific gauges are underway at several sites including wgew cmrb and ecb use of wind speed data may help determine the undercatch more accurately however for larger basins spatial variability across the basin may be a larger source of uncertainty than actual measurement errors among the et estimation methods model simulation led to the greatest uncertainties 25 on average uncertainty averaged 19 when et was based on the water budget residual and 17 when based on ec measurements these results highlight the current difficulty estimating et via direct measurement the complexity of the land surface affecting turbulence atmospheric stability and the existence of multiple land use types in proximity to the ec tower footprint influence measurement accuracy the lack of energy balance closure associated with eddy flux measurements is yet another source of uncertainty and is currently an active area of research foken 2008 leuning et al 2012 the energy balance problem creates uncertainty in the et estimate as some proportion of the residual energy from the lack of closure is missing from the latent heat flux causing an underestimation of total et how best to redistribute the missing energy is not well understood for ec measurements however methods do exist for measurements made with the bowen ratio method e g twine et al 2000 all sites that reported et based on ec data underestimated the total amount of et by some unknown amount due to this lack of closure in spite of these limitations all sites have installed ec towers sometimes on land with contrasted management thus providing improved estimates of the largest water budget component reducing overall uncertainties of the water budget and answering the question whether agricultural management can alter et comparing et estimates by using different methods can increase their reliability and overall errors as low as 10 may be achievable allen et al 2011 hamilton et al 2018 while water limitations affect et the penman monteith estimate is considered to be the upper bound of et estimates obtained through other methods allen et al 2011 another source of uncertainty in et arises from species level transpiration differences within mixed plant communities such as in multi crop agriculture or in rangelands containing wetlands and woodlands douglass 1965 further research is needed to reduce uncertainty under these conditions the amount of percolation varies with climate in semiarid regions there is substantial evidence that deep percolation or recharge to the groundwater occurs only in small portions of the basin where runoff is concentrated such as depressions and ephemeral stream channels goodrich et al 2004 or where redistribution and drifting of snow causes concentrated input to the soil chauvin et al 2011 there is little to no deep percolation in small upland or inter channel watersheds due to 1 plant adaptation to extract vadose zone moisture under large negative pressure 2 thick vadose zones and 3 upward temperature gradients coes and pool 2005 goodrich et al 2004 heilweil and solomon 2004 plummer et al 2004 scanlon et al 1997 2003 scott et al 2000 walvoord et al 2002 in more humid regions percolation and groundwater recharge occur throughout the upland catchment area in this study percolation was the component with the greatest uncertainty yet this variable is essential to our understanding of the sustainability of agriculture and regional water resources to ensure maximum crop growth precipitation needs to infiltrate into the soil where plants can utilize it water not used by vegetation nor evaporated can percolate and contribute to aquifer recharge and stream base flow greater and slower percolation through the soil reduces the magnitude of floods and droughts respectively as such it is essential that percolation be adequately quantified since percolation is difficult to measure directly it is frequently derived by subtraction as the water budget residual accuracy of the water balance method to estimate percolation will improve as other components are measured with greater certainty in addition some of the techniques discussed in the percolation section 2 3 5 could possibly be extended from semi arid watersheds to other ltar watershed sites as for et the concurrent use of multiple methods to measure percolation may increase the reliability of percolation estimates soil water content drives plant growth and production in agroecosystems yet it is often poorly measured and carries a high degree of uncertainty across the ltar network fortunately there are many methods available for measuring soil water content vereecken et al 2008 2014 which can increase our understanding of water dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales point based measurements with electromagnetic sensors e g capacitance probes time domain reflectometry can monitor temporal variability in soil water content at a single location or can be linked through wireless sensor networks to increase spatial coverage vereecken et al 2014 air and space borne sensors can map near surface soil water content at larger spatial scales where point based measurements are not feasible mohanty et al 2017 vereecken et al 2014 by increasing our understanding of soil water dynamics in agroecosystems we will improve our water budget estimates and provide valuable information for agricultural production and water management 4 2 the role and detection of climate induced changes with ltar sites spanning the united states potential changes in temperature and precipitation at each site will vary by region romero lankao et al 2014 while these potential differences in climate trajectory are not explored here changes in mean high and or low extremes in temperature garbrecht et al 2014b and precipitation feng et al 2016 have been directly observed at some long term site locations and are likely to be occurring at others garbrecht et al 2014a lu et al 2015 nayak et al 2010 knowledge of the effects of these changes on the water budgets components for agricultural land will inform the management of water resources in agricultural watersheds under future climate currently the effects are simulated based on climate and hydrologic models ltar sites have explored climate change impacts through modeling at various scales and u s locations impacts on winter wheat production and erosion in the southern plains garbrecht and zhang 2015 garbrecht et al 2015 2016 zhang 2012 hydrologic impacts in the goodwater creek experimental watershed in the central mississippi river basin gautam et al 2018 phung et al 2019 impacts on evapotranspiration water stress and productivity in sagebrush ecosystems flerchinger et al 2019 and impacts on runoff sediment and nutrient loads in beasley lake watershed yasarer et al 2017 monitoring of the different water budget components is necessary to provide evidence based demonstration of these effects verify model results and encourage adoption of management practices that mitigate the effects of future climate yet at these ltar sites the expected changes in discharge and et caused by an increase in temperature or precipitation are expected to remain small 10 and smaller than the current measurement uncertainties for these components thus direct observation of these trends will require improved measurement techniques and uncertainty quantification as well as a reduction of these uncertainties at or below the magnitude of the expected changes in addition potential divergence of conclusions based on model results and monitoring data should enable the improvement of these models ultimately modeling uncertainties cannot be smaller than the uncertainties of the data used to develop and calibrate the models thus the use of models to inform adaptation to climate change requires high quality data to develop and calibrate these models the ltar network is addressing these monitoring challenges with respect to evapotranspiration the ec towers installed at most ltar sites will allow for long term measurements of et over a wide range of conditions and may be useful for detecting trends related to climate change these towers will add to the growing body of data broadly collected through networks such as ameriflux and ensure that a variety of agricultural systems are represented in these long term databases thompson et al 2011 extremes in the current climate regime are also a challenge to quantify accurately and present an opportunity for the ltar network to contribute new methods tipping bucket rain gauges typically underestimate precipitation volumes during high rainfall events michaelides et al 2009 expected increases in precipitation intensity may result in more events that exceed the capacity of current measuring systems to accurately measure precipitation volume and rates kunkel et al 2013 shedekar et al 2016 with ltar sites developing field based infrastructure to measure climatic variables in agroecosystems across climatic regions there is potential to test and implement new technologies for direct measurement of precipitation and to provide comparisons for remotely sensed radar and satellite methods an increase in extreme precipitation events may also cause flooding and bankfull flow conditions that exceed the current range of observed flows or the feasibility of a measurement such extreme conditions increase the uncertainty in quantification of flows baffaut et al 2014 hamilton and moore 2012 harman et al 2008 when on the ground data collection is not safe or feasible use of aerial imagery light detection and ranging lidar data or satellite measurements may fill in some gaps bjerklie 2007 mount et al 2003 schumann et al 2011 the diverse expertise within the ltar network in the fields of remote sensing field hydrology and hydrologic modeling provides strong potential for collaborations across these methodologies for improved quantification and understanding of the impacts of extreme events on agroecosystems 4 3 the impact of sustainable management spiegal et al 2018 identified the dominant sustainability goals of agricultural intensification across the ltar network including the protection and improvement of regional water quality sought in 16 of 18 sites and water supply sought in 8 of 18 sites the three most frequently cited water related goals at these sites include reducing runoff increasing infiltration or percolation and increasing soil water content or water holding capacity by amounts ranging from 10 to 20 these goals collectively support the general objectives of increasing water use efficiency for plant growth such aspirational outcomes can be achieved by techniques adapted to the specific conditions at each site sites having excessive runoff or percolation have the opportunity to explore alternative cropping systems or rotations that increase crop production and therefore et and reduce water losses in some locations like the caf site this may mean a transition to more fall seeded crops to take advantage of winter and early spring soil moisture in other locations this may mean exploring cover cropping or intercropping however this analysis has shown that the uncertainty of the components was greater than the expected impact these practices may have on water budget components i e 10 20 therefore improved measurement of the water budget components is necessary to evaluate the suitability of these practices and the quantification of water resources in agricultural watersheds if these practices are widely adopted conversely there are few opportunities to intensify cropping systems in regions with very low percolation and runoff crop production and agroecosystem sustainability will be highly vulnerable to future shifts in the climate and irrigation may have an important role in these regions the relative lack of irrigation use among the ltar sites reflects the rationale for the historical establishment of these research sites long term water quality problems which are often associated with runoff and or drainage or rangeland sites in semi arid climatic regions which are typically not irrigated nevertheless the role of irrigation in major u s regions such as the central and southern plains the lower mississippi river basin the southeast and the california central valley will likely continue to grow as climate becomes less predictable döll 2002 furthermore any water limited i e semi arid region could benefit from irrigation however reliance on irrigation modifies the magnitude of some of the water budget components at field and watershed scale in addition it increases vulnerability to future reductions in water availability accurate determination of water budgets under irrigation management is therefore critical water supply limitations in many of these regions have resulted in initiation of new research on irrigation efficiency and the development of water saving approaches bryant et al 2017 kebede et al 2014 payero et al 2009 as the ltar network continues to evaluate long term water budgets across the united states it will be important to consider the changing role of irrigation use and efficiency on growing season water inputs as irrigation becomes a more significant requirement in the future the ltar network will need to address it as a component of aspirational management scenarios an ongoing challenge to ltar network research is that percolation and soil water content are poorly quantified demonstrating the benefits of these aspirational goals will require additional investment in the development and utilization of monitoring equipment to improve estimates of percolation and soil water content and to further reduce uncertainty in estimation of these water budget components 5 conclusions water budgets were developed using multi annual data from small and large catchments at the 18 ltar sites in the united states by estimating precipitation evapotranspiration surface outflows surface and subsurface flow percolation and change in water storage hydrologic characterization of each catchment was performed using indicators such as evapotranspiration and surface outflow a budyko plot of all the sites

5318,reliable soil moisture sm estimates are not only crucial for the climate variability but are also significant for agricultural ecological climatic and hydrometeorological predictions with the development of land surface models lsms and multi source data merging techniques various sm model products can serve as alternatives to obtain spatially continuous and temporally complete sm estimates the nine sm model products 0 10 cm including one analysis three reanalyses and five land data assimilation system ldas products are evaluated using the dense 2437 stations after quality control in situ observations at different timescales annual to sub daily in eight climate regions over mainland china during 2010 2017 the kling gupta efficiency kge a performance metric combining correlation bias and variability is used to quantify the strengths and weaknesses of these products cldas china meteorological administration s ldas performs the best with the optimal median values of kge and correlation in most subregions from sub daily to annual timescales followed by global ldas gldas clm product the sm products show large variability for different subregions timescales and spatial resolutions the sm products have better performance in summer than winter in addition high resolution products and ldas products have the potential to improve the performance for example era5 outperforms era interim in most parts of china the markedly better performance of regional product cldas than other global products highlights the importance of incorporating hourly rain gauge and surface temperature observations at a finer model resolution this intercomparison study sheds some light on the capability of the sm products for climate monitoring weather prediction and model validation keywords soil moisture analysis reanalysis land data assimilation system era5 cldas 1 introduction soil moisture sm plays a vital role in hydrological processes blöschl et al 2017 vereecken et al 2008 land atmospheric interaction seneviratne et al 2006 tuttle and salvucci 2016 and bio ecological processes green et al 2019 reich et al 2018 sm is the initial condition of land surface models lsms and distributed hydrologic models and also regulates the energy balance between the lower atmosphere and the land by influencing sensible and latent heat exchange meanwhile sm controls the exchange and partitioning of water fluxes at the land surface through dividing the precipitation into runoff and infiltration in addition long term trends of sm variations can provide accurate climate background to study climate variability while it has been endorsed as an essential climate variable by the global climate observing system gcos 2010 therefore reliable sm datasets are in urgent need for climate monitoring weather prediction and model validation ford and quiring 2019 seneviratne et al 2010 as important resources of hydrometeorological and agricultural applications sm model products have been used worldwide because of their continuity in space and time although in situ point observations are the most accurate measurements of sm vereecken et al 2008 they suffer from low spatial representativeness and limited temporal coverage satellite remote sensing can provide large scale sm estimates for a shallow soil layer usually 2 7 cm but it has lower accuracy than in situ observations and coarse spatial temporal resolution 20 km 1 day or more sm model products including analysis reanalysis and land data assimilation system ldas products see section 2 3 can fill the gap and often serve as alternatives robock et al 2000 sheffield 2004 the model products can combine plenty of in situ observations and remote sensing data to generate an optimal estimate of land surface state under the physical and dynamical constrains however the performance of these sm model products can vary considerably for different regions and products kumar et al 2017 xia et al 2014 which strongly depends on the lsm structure land data assimilation techniques the observation coverage and quality etc the evaluation of sm model products is essential to provide a reference for the application in different regions and timescales since sm is highly heterogeneous over time and space the spatial distribution of multi year average sm at the annual scale is markedly different with that at seasonal scale as the seasonal sm varies closely related to the vegetation growth and phenology dorigo et al 2012 the seasonal sm variation is mainly controlled by the balance between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet grayson et al 1997 for the finer timescales a series of wetting and drying cycles related to storm and inter storm period are superimposed to the seasonal cycle in addition the spatial distribution of sm is significantly non homogeneous as it is evidently affected by several spatial controls including variations in precipitation jackson et al 1999 tayfur et al 2014 soil properties baroni et al 2013 famiglietti et al 1998 vegetation dick et al 2018 qiu et al 2001 topography dunne and black 1970a b penna et al 2009 qiu et al 2001 and radiation mahmood and hubbard 2005 western et al 1999 there are a few studies of intercomparison for different gridded sm model products as many studies have evaluated only a subset of the available sm model products such as one kind of re analyses or the ldas products e g rahmani et al 2016 xia et al 2014 yuan and quiring 2017 due to the availability of sm observations they often focused on a small region subcontinental plot or even point scale which limits the generalizability of the conclusions e g rahmani et al 2016 stillman et al 2015 wang and zeng 2012 and they used very coarse resolution observations both spatially and temporally for the evaluation which constraints the validity of their findings at a higher resolution e g li et al 2005 liu et al 2014 in addition most of them did not analyze the global reanalyses or regional ldas products with high resolution temporally and spatially e g stillman et al 2015 vinodkumar and dharssi 2019 which can be very useful for land surface applications such as flash flood norbiato et al 2008 or drought prediction in particular it is of interest to investigate whether sm from the recently released high resolution era5 dataset developed by the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which has reduced biases of precipitation in many places e g the conterminous us beck et al 2019 obtains better performance than coarser resolution products over china to conduct comprehensive evaluation of sm products spatially and temporally high resolution observations are needed sm observations are critical for evaluation of the sm model products although this has been repeatedly identified as a high priority for years ford and quiring 2019 the sparse distribution and short observational period of sm measurements still limits the comprehensive evaluation studies seneviratne et al 2010 sheffield 2004 furthermore lack of consistent instrument type calibration methods and reporting depths makes it challenging to combine sm observations from multiple networks ford et al 2014 robock et al 2000 in the recent years efforts to combine observations from multiple sm networks are underway globally dorigo et al 2011 such as in america quiring et al 2016 and in china shi et al 2014 by the end of 2017 china meteorological administration cma had established 2776 automatic sm observation asmo stations across china with a temporal resolution of one hour the high resolution asmo network with high quality and density up to 7 stations within a 104 km2 pixel on average table 1 will provide an unprecedented opportunity for sm related research such as the validation of sm model products due to the lack of sm observations rare comprehensive evaluations of model products have been conducted over china the frequently used observations datasets of previous studies are less than 500 stations from cma agricultural meteorological stations cams observed by gravimetric method three times a month and less than 50 stations from the global soil moisture data bank gsmdb robock et al 2000 for example the previous studies only used sm observations from 43 gsmdb stations li et al 2005 225 cams stations mainly located in eastern china liu et al 2014 18 stations over southeast china peng et al 2015 and 74 or less stations over the tibet plateau wang and zeng 2012 zeng et al 2015 by using a relatively small number of stations in china these studies could not evaluate sm products comprehensively with convincing conclusions as china covers many kinds of climate regions in quite a large geographical area benefited from the high temporal resolution of asmos this study can validate model products at sub daily timescale which is rarely explored by previous studies comprehensive evaluations with in situ observations are indispensable for better understanding the inherent error structures of model products e g the spatiotemporal variation of sm fields and systematic errors in the models and enabling product developers to further improve their products therefore the purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of nine sm model products including one global analysis three global reanalyses four global ldas and one regional ldas products using the hourly in situ observations with the state of the art chinese asmos a detailed spatial distribution of sm over china can be provided to address the strengths and weaknesses of these products the performance at different timescales annual monthly seasonal daily and sub daily and different climate regions is discussed also the high resolution model products e g era5 are compared with coarser resolution ones to investigate whether the sm products can take advantage from a finer spatial resolution using dense in situ observation network the variability at different temporal and spatial scales and the quality of the nine sm model products are investigated the results may provide guidance for future hydrological applications of sm products such as real time streamflow prediction at basin scales the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study regions the observations of chinese asmos the sm model products and the evaluation methods section 3 comprehensively assesses nine sm products including the evaluation at different timescales and climate regions and the comparison at different resolutions and sources ldas products vs re analysis the main conclusions are highlighted in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 study regions climate in china is extremely diverse due to the vast territory and complex orography forming different heat and moisture conditions under the monsoon effect the spatial and temporal distributions of heat and moisture dramatically vary from region to region to investigate sm liu and xie 2013 divided china into eight subregions based on the surface dryness and wetness considering the distribution of in situ observational network and geographical locations in this study model products are evaluated in eight climate regions fig 1 a over the mainland of china including northeast china i 43 54 n 110 135 e

the upper reaches of the yellow river the west part vii 35 49 n 73 96 e of northwest china southwest china vi 21 35 n 96 110 e and the tibet plateau viii 27 35 n 78 96 e the climate characteristics for the subregions including mean annual precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature are provided in table 1 based on 30 year 1981 2010 in situ observations from the cma national meteorological information center nmic compared to the subregions used by liu and xie 2013 two new subregions region iv and viii are added to include the new sm observations region ii is defined by merging region ii and iii of liu and xie 2013 and region vi is defined by merging region vii and vii of liu and xie 2013 this can reduce the uncertainty influenced by scale mismatching between the footprint scale of the gridded sm products and the point scale asmos 2 2 hourly in situ observations the 8 year asmo data from 2010 to 2017 are provided by the cma nmic by the end of 2017 cma had built up the sm observation network with 2776 asmo stations across the mainland of china the asmo sensors include dzn1 dzn2 and dzn3 xue and ye 2013 which are all developed based on the frequency domain reflection fdr method soil moisture estimates are not used during times when the 0 10 cm soil temperature is below zero because the fdr sensors will provide invalid sm estimates at temperatures near or below 0 c sm is measured hourly in the unit of volumetric water content vwc m3 m 3 at the depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 50 cm 50 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm only the surface layer 0 10 cm is available for this study the observation data are uploaded to nmic in real time providing an in situ sm observation dataset with the highest spatial and temporal resolution in china however there are no quality control qc procedures applied to the observed raw data in the current operating observation network to improve practicability of the asmo data qc procedures were performed based on threshold value check the frequency of observation and the total days of observation first according to working range of the fdr sensor and the observation specification by cma the values larger than 0 5 m3 m 3 are removed second the observational frequency fig 1b which is the ratio of available observations to the entire period starting from the onset time fig 1a of the station is no less than 0 5 third each station has at least 180 days of data most of the stations were built up in or before the year of 2010 fig 1a after qc procedures are applied observations from 2437 in situ stations fig 1 are used for further model product evaluation the number of observations and estimated observation density after qc number of observations within a 104 km2 pixel on average in each subregion is presented in table 1 2 3 model products the model products evaluated in this study are listed in table 2 including one analysis product no 1 three reanalysis products no 2 4 four global ldas gldas products no 5 8 and one regional high resolution ldas product from cma no 9 the brief descriptions of these products are provided as follows 2 3 1 analysis and reanalysis products both the reanalysis and analysis products combine multisource observations in a physical model to provide a representation of geophysical state such as wind precipitation sm etc but they are different in two major aspects first the reanalysis is delayed to ingest more available observations than the analysis second the reanalysis data are usually produced with the retrospective run using a fixed version of model by assimilating the observation data with the same types while the analysis products are usually affected by the updates in models or observations such as model upgrade resolution new observation data or techniques etc which may cause the discontinuity of the model performance the global forecast system gfs analysis data the environmental modeling center 2016 with 0 5 horizontal resolution are obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental prediction ncep gfs is a fully coupled global model system to implement global weather forecasts including an atmosphere model an ocean model a lsm noah chen and dudhia 2001 and a sea ice model gfs is run four times 00 06 12 18 utc a day at a base horizontal resolution of 28 km which is regularly updated to improve its performance and forecast accuracy the ncep2 is the first generation kanamitsu et al 2002 global reanalysis developed by ncep compared with the former version ncep1 ncep2 provides a better reanalysis and fixes the known errors kanamitsu et al 2002 both ncep1 and ncep2 use the oregon state university osu lsm pan and mahrt 1987 with two layer thicknesses of 10 cm and 190 cm gridded sm data at 2 5 spatial resolution and 6 h temporal resolution are available from 1979 to present the third generation reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 and the fourth generation reanalysis era5 hennermann and paul 2019 are both developed by ecmwf era5 is the latest high resolution reanalysis released by ecmwf which is expected to replace era interim eventually compared to era interim era5 assimilates more historical observations and provides finer temporal 1 h vs 6 h and spatial 31 km vs 75 km estimates for atmospheric land and oceanic states 2 3 2 ldas products ldas combines satellite and ground observations using advanced lsms and data assimilation techniques to generate the optimal estimates of land surface states and fluxes gldas rodell et al 2004 has been developed jointly by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and noaa ncep four 3 h products including gldas noah gldas clm gldas vic and gldas mosaic are used in this study the gldas version 2 1 gldas 2 with 0 25 horizontal resolution only drives noah lsm and gldas noah is available from 2000 to present the rest three gldas products are generated from gldas version 1 0 gldas 2 with 1 horizontal resolution from 1979 to present the main differences among the four gldas products lie in the model parameterizations schemes and the forcing data for a intercomparison of schemes in these lsms see discussions by rodell et al 2004 the gldas 1 simulations are forced with a combination of analysis and observation based products rodell et al 2004 including ncep s global data assimilation system gdas disaggregated climate prediction center cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap and air force weather agency afwa radiation datasets the gldas 2 simulations are forced with the global meteorological forcing dataset from the princeton university sheffield et al 2006 as the demand for high resolution sm products becomes more and more urgent cma s land data assimilation system cldas shi et al 2014 developed by cma has been developed to support drought monitoring in china cldas has been operationally run in cma nmic since july 2013 hourly temperature forcing data incorporate regional automatic surface temperature observations more than 3000 over china while the gridded precipitation forcing data merge over 30 000 rain gauge data and the climate precipitation center morphing cmorph product shen et al 2014 the cldas 1 h sm product with 0 0625 spatial resolution covers asia 0 65 n 60 160 e and is available from 2008 to present 2 4 evaluation methods a set of verification metrics are used to quantitatively analyze unique strengths and shortcomings of the model products including the systematic bias bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse the ubrmse removes the systematic errors and only shows the random errors in addition the objective performance metric kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 and its three components are used to further comprehensively compare the nine sm model products kge combines three components of the key performance statistics including correlation bias and variability the kge value is defined as follows 1 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r is the pearson s correlation coefficient β is the ratio of estimated and observed means i e frequency bias and γ is represented by the ratio of the estimated and observed coefficients of variation the kge is only calculated when the correlation component r passes the 0 05 significance test the β and γ are defined as follows 2 β μ e μ o 3 γ σ e μ e σ o μ o where μ and σ denotes the mean and standard deviation respectively the subscripts e and o denotes the estimate and observation the kge value r β and γ are all perfect at unity and thus smaller absolute values kge 1 r 1 β 1 and γ 1 represent better performance for dichotomous verification the equitable threat score ets is used to analyze the sm model products at different thresholds especially in extremely dry wet cases the ets is defined as follows 4 e t s h h i t s h m f h i t s 5 h i t s h m h f h m f z where h f m z and hits are calculated from the two by two contingency table table 3 the ets ranges from 1 3 worst to 1 perfect as the positive ets indicates skillful forecasts relative to chance the model products are interpolated to specific observation stations fig 1 and vertical depth 0 10 cm bilinear interpolation is used horizontally and linear interpolation is used to match the sm data to the 0 10 cm layer sm from all the stations are treated as independent which means no average is taken when two or more stations are within the same sm pixel 3 results 3 1 performance at different timescales in this section nine sm model products are compared to asmos at annual monthly daily and sub daily timescales respectively because the errors may vary with different timescales this comparison is subjected to ignoring the transferability of sm states between lsms koster et al 2009 which can bring limitations in bias measures that is because all the products are characterized by different characteristics and model assumptions that cause a very different range of variability of the sm estimates thanks to the high resolution 1 h asmo network over china this section provides the evaluation results at an unprecedented fine temporal resolution 6 h section 3 1 3 although 1 h sm products are available for cldas and era5 only the data with the common temporal resolution of 6 h are used in the evaluation of these products 3 1 1 annual evaluation overall the ldas products represent better spatial distributions of annual mean sm than the re analyses datasets fig 2 displays the annual mean sm from 2010 to 2017 over china from observed sm fig 2a and nine model products fig 2b j the kge score is calculated using all points of annual mean fig 2 all model products capture a similar spatial sm pattern characterized by a gradual increase from northwest to southeast in the observations the high sm values 0 25 0 45 m3 m 3 extend from northeast china to humid jianghuai region and southern china the low sm values 0 0 15 m3 m 3 mainly locate in relatively dry western china and hetao region the best performance is obtained by nasa s gldas noah kge 0 51 closely followed by cma s cldas kge 0 48 all the re analyses except for era5 have lower spatial correlation r 0 40 than ldas products with comparatively poor scores kge 0 20 compared to the ecmwf s third generation coarser resolution era interim product the fourth generation era5 product kge 0 37 improves both spatial correlation r 0 50 and variability γ 0 84 and hence outperforms other re analyses and even some ldas products i e gldas clm gldas vic and gldas mosaic however era5 strongly overestimates sm in southern china by 0 15 m3 m 3 causing the largest frequency bias β 1 29 although all products generally capture the spatial pattern of annual mean sm over china there are substantial inter model variations from region to region see regional evaluations in section 3 2 the time series of annual mean sm estimates over the mainland of china shows large discrepancies in magnitude and trend among the nine products figure not shown similar to the spatial distribution of annual mean sm fig 2 best β 1 05 gldas clm has the smallest temporal bias table 4 the largest positive bias is found for era5 while gldas vic demonstrates strong overestimation and gldas mosaic shows large underestimation table 4 for the trend of annual mean sm gfs and ncep2 show little correlation with observed sm and even have opposite trends e g gldas clm during 2013 2015 ncep2 during 2010 2011 and gfs during 2012 2014 overall cldas era5 and era interim well reproduce the annual trend compared to other products but they have larger bias than gldas clm 3 1 2 monthly and seasonal evaluation at the monthly and seasonal timescales the magnitudes and trends of sm estimates show large discrepancies for different sm products figure not shown similar to the annual mean gldas clm shows the best magnitude of monthly mean sm with the lowest bias table 4 while era5 and gldas vic mosaic strongly overestimates underestimates monthly mean sm table 4 cldas has the best monthly variations table 4 with optimal seasonal cycle in comparison gldas clm and gldas noah followed by cldas also show similar monthly trends with observations but fail to capture the timing of sm recharge in february figure not shown among the nine model products gfs has the worst month to month variation and largest ubrmse fig 3 displays kge scores for the nine model products at monthly time scale using the asmos as a reference sm data are averaged for each month from january 2010 to december 2017 the probability distribution for kge scores are obtained using kge scores at in situ stations over china the ldas products except for gldas vic generally perform better than the re analysis products in terms of median kge fig 3 the best performance is obtained by cldas median kge of 0 24 with the highest median correlation r 0 57 followed by gldas clm median kge of 0 13 compared to era interim era5 has better correlation and variability but larger bias resulting in slightly improved median kge of 0 08 ncep2 gldas vic and gfs show comparatively poor performance negative median kge mainly caused by their relatively low correlation or large bias all model products consistently perform better better annual variations of seasonal mean in fig 3 and higher kge in fig 4 in summer than in winter at monthly daily and sub daily timescales fig 4 there is much larger spatial variability at three timescales in winter indicated by the wider density distribution of kge values this is probably attributed to the relatively low quality of the asmos for solid water and the poor representation of frozen soil dynamics of models in winter the median kge of each product generally increases from winter and peaks in summer with transitional median kge values in spring and autumn figures not shown cldas has the highest kge in both warm and cool seasons but lower median kge values close to zero are found in winter ncep2 has the worst performance in both seasons in addition the differences in median kge values among the model products are much greater in summer than in winter and increase from monthly to sub daily timescales fig 4 3 1 3 daily and sub daily evaluation among the nine model products the best overall performance of daily and sub daily sm fig 5 is obtained by cldas median kge of 0 30 followed by gldas clm median kge of 0 19 similar to the kge scores for monthly mean sm gldas clm exhibits the smallest bias while cldas slightly overestimates daily sm however cldas has better correlation and lower ubrmse than gldas clm table 4 performance statistics for daily mean sm are not provided in table 4 because the results are quite similar to sub daily results ncep2 and gldas vic are still the worst two model products when estimating daily sm the kge scores of sub daily sm are similar to the daily sm figure not shown indicating that the errors of sm estimates at sub daily timescale can further propagate to longer timescales e g daily monthly and annual fig 6 a shows the long term 2010 2017 probability distribution of daily sm from 0 0 50 m3 m 3 with bin size of 0 05 m3 m 3 the probability distributions of the model products are quite diverse and none of the products well match the observations all sm products except for gldas mosaic and era5 underestimate the probability of extreme values of sm 0 0 5 m3 m 3 or 0 45 m3 m 3 gldas mosaic generally produce high probability at lower bins 0 1 m3 m 3 era5 exhibits much higher probability than observations at higher bins 0 45 m3 m 3 for the medium sm values the probability is underestimated by most products except for era5 and gldas mosaic the probability distribution highlights the problem of model products to represent extreme events which is partly induced by the smooth of extreme value due to bilinear interpolation from model grids to point scale sm fig 6b displays the long term frequency at different thresholds of sub daily sm from 5 to 95 at the sub daily timescale all products underestimate the frequency of extreme dry events sm 0 055 m3 m 3 while all products except for era5 underestimate the frequency of extreme wet events sm 0 397 m3 m 3 fig 6b c the thresholds for extreme dry wet events are determined by 5 and 95 percentile of the probability distribution of observed sm due to the poor representation of the frequency for extreme events the frequency of moderate events is significantly underestimated by era5 and overestimated by other products to address the ability to represent different wetness scenarios ets scores have been calculated at the selected thresholds based on distribution of in situ observations for dry moderate and wet soil conditions fig 7 all products have quite little skill in representing extremely dry cases with low ets scores figure not shown for the 25 quantile 0 150 m3 m 3 in summer gldas mosaic shows relatively better skill fig 7a with the highest ets score among the nine products fig 7a for the 25 quantile in winter cldas gldas mosaic and gldas noah show relatively higher ets 0 15 than other products for the 50 quantile 0 228 m3 m 3 and the 90 quantile 0 361 m3 m 3 cldas shows the best skill for most months of the year overall the best two sm model products are cldas and gldas noah with relatively high ets scores at the three thresholds by contrast gfs has the lowest skill for the low and medium wetness fig 7a b and the relatively poor ets scores for the high wetness fig 7c gldas clm shows the relatively high skill for the medium wetness condition but exhibits the low skill for the dry and wet conditions at the 50 quantile better ets scores are found compared to more extreme moisture conditions e g 25 90 quantile this is possibly due to the deficiency of precipitation forcing when capturing extreme events which mostly overestimates light precipitation and underestimates heavy precipitation sun et al 2016 3 2 regional evaluation previous studies have presented evidence for the reliability and the usability of the global sm datasets at the regional scale liu and xie 2013 stillman et al 2015 wang et al 2016 while all sm model products capture the overall spatial and temporal variations over china the regional performance of these products is summarized in this section first the kge values fig 8 at each station over china are calculated using sub daily 6 h asmos as a reference secondly the ability of these products to represent the seasonal cycle figure not shown and daily variation fig 9 is analyzed considering four distinct phases the recharge phase p1 the drying phase p2 the wetting phase p3 and the enhanced drying phase p4 defined by the trend of monthly mean sm finally the overall statistics all samples in space and time of 6 h sm in each subregion for nine model products is presented in fig 10 the performance of model products varies from subregion to subregion mainly related to regional climate characteristics and model parameterizations based on the asmos relatively poor performance is found in region i v vii and viii with more negative kge values than the rest regions fig 8 the most kge values higher than 0 4 are found in region iii demonstrating a remarkably good performance in this region cldas has the best kge values at most asmo stations compared to other products fig 8h in hetao region cldas gldas noah gldas clm and gldas mosaic show low biases fig 2 leading to higher kge values than other products in general model products obtain better performance in southeastern than northwestern china the higher kge values in wetter southeast regions table 1 are mainly attributed to the large variation of precipitation in these regions larger variation in precipitation suggests larger variation in sm variation that models can easily capture for northwest regions with low annual mean precipitation table 1 the precipitation variance is low for high latitude or high attitude regions e g region i and viii the differences of model performance are also related to differences in model parameterization of frozen soil and snowmelt there are great discrepancies in the seasonal cycle figure not shown and daily variation fig 9 estimated by the nine model products especially in winter the observations reveal four distinct phases indicated as p1 to p4 of sm variation with the similar trend cldas exhibits the best seasonal cycle though underestimates sm in region vii fig 9g and overestimates sm in the rest regions majority of model products do not perform well in representing the increasing trend of p1 jan apr in region i ii v vii for example only cldas exhibits a similar increase trend of p1 with observations in region i fig 9a the sm trend of p2 apr jun is poorly represented by ncep2 in region ii and v fig 9b e which shows opposite trends with large biases the seasonal trend of p3 and p4 is generally better than p1 and p2 for most products however large positive biases still exist for gldas vic in region i iii fig 9a c era5 in region iv and vi fig 9d f and ncep2 in region v vii and viii fig 9e g h gldas mosaic greatly underestimates the magnitude of sm seasonal cycle and daily variation for six subregions fig 10 presents the overall statistics all samples in space and time of sub daily 6 h sm in eight subregions the kge values fig 10a indicate that the overall performance highly varies for different model products and regions cldas has consistently high kge values in all subregions while gldas clm has the second best kge with quite small variability in most subregions fig 10d the worst two products are gfs and ncep2 for most subregions with kge values close to zero all model products have worse performance in region vii and viii than the rest subregions which results from low correlations in region vii fig 10b and large biases in region viii fig 10c respectively 3 3 products with different resolutions the spatially high resolution products are not always better than the coarser resolution products in terms of kge values the rank of kge values varies from region to region fig 10a the three high resolution products are cldas 6 25 km gldas noah 25 km and era5 31 km although cldas has the highest resolution its performance is surpassed by era5 in region v by gldas mosaic in region vi and by gldas noah in region viii furthermore gldas noah is the worst product in region iv and era5 has comparatively poor performance than era interim the overall results of sm model products with higher resolutions highlight the potentials of improving sm estimate by using high resolution products as a result of the system upgrade the higher resolution era5 performs markedly better than the coarser resolution era interim across most subregions in china fig 8c d and fig 10 especially in region v and vi fig 10 evidence includes the improvements in the kge values three kge components r β γ figs 3 5 8 and the spatial correlation fig 2d e however era5 overestimates the sm compared to era interim especially in the wet subregions such as southern china fig 2d e the improvements are largely attributed to more observations assimilated within era5 in addition to the global model products the performance of a state of art regional high resolution table 2 ldas product cldas for the mainland of china is evaluated cldas has the potential to produce more accurate sm estimates with a high resolution of 6 25 km which allows the better representation of the mesoscale orography in terms of spatial correlation fig 2j cldas performs the second best kge 0 48 outperformed by gldas noah kge 0 51 for the temporal correlation at monthly daily and sub daily timescales cldas always performs the best with the highest median values of the kge and temporal correlation figs 3 5 and 8 note that cldas is not always the best choice for all subregions at different timescales cldas performs the best in five subregions region i ii iii iv and vii and ranks no 2 in the rest three subregions region v vi and viii fig 10a in all subregions cldas obtains the highest correlation followed by gldas clm except region vii and viii fig 10b for region vii and viii gldas noah outperforms gldas clm and has the second best correlation fig 10b in terms of bias cldas is surpassed by gldas clm in most subregions and the gldas products obtain the lowest biases fig 10c though gldas mosaic tends to markedly underestimate sm it has the lowest bias in region viii in terms of variability cldas is not the best one but it outperforms gldas clm in eight subregions fig 10d to examine the effect of the resolution the data thinning has been performed by regridding cldas into 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 and 2 50 using bilinear interpolation table 5 shows the evaluation results for the 6 houly data all samples in space and time in terms of the kge score cldas at 0 0625 original 0 25 0 50 0 75 keep achieving better performance than other products while cldas at 1 00 is surpassed by gldas noah at 0 25 at a coarse upscaled resolution 2 5 the performance of cldas degrades due to the poor representation of the spatial heterogeneity of sm but it still outperforms four sm products with higher resolutions and ncep2 at 2 5 in summary cldas shows the best performance because of its finest resolution of sm more importantly it has good quality by incorporating hourly local rain gauge and surface temperature observations at the finest model resolution 3 4 ldas products vs re analysis although ldas products and re analysis products are derived from models the purpose of the two type of products is quite different the ldas focuses on producing high quality fields of land surface states e g soil moisture temperature and fluxes e g evapotranspiration runoff by integrating satellite and ground based observational data products using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques the global re analysis aims to provide a best estimate of the atmospheric and surface states of the whole globe using the available observations the reanalysis is usually implemented with a fixed version of model and data assimilation systems for climate monitoring and research while the analysis is mainly used for weather prediction and is suffered from regular model upgrades overall ldas products have greater potential to improve sm than re analysis products from the evaluation results for cool season monthly daily and sub daily timescales four ldas products three gldas products and cldas obtain better median kge values than the re analysis figs 3 5 and 8 such as the worst reanalysis era in winter fig 4b by contrast era5 ranks no 3 in terms of the median kge value in summer fig 4a and is even better than three gldas products vic mosaic and noah which underscores the improvements of the fourth generation reanalysis era5 4 conclusions and discussion reliable sm estimates are not only crucial for the climate variability but are also significant for agricultural ecological climatic and hydrometeorological predictions this study provided a comprehensive evaluation of nine model products and quantified the discrepancies of different sm estimates from sub daily to annual timescales over eight climate regions in china the spatial resolutions of nine evaluated model products vary from 0 0625 to 2 5 including analysis gfs reanalysis ncep2 era interim and era5 and ldas gldas noah gldas clm gldas vic gldas mosaic and cldas products the evaluation was carried out with the unprecedented high resolution 2776 station asmos 2437 in situ sites after qc see fig 1 as a reference this study shed some light on the weakness and strengths of different model products using an objective performance metric kge which combines correlation bias and variability this study also provided a framework for comprehensively evaluating model products at different timescales and climate regions the unprecedented high resolution asmos present a detailed spatial pattern of annual mean sm which generally increase from northwest to southeast the ldas products better represent the spatial distribution of annual mean sm than re analyses with high spatial correlations fig 2 cma s cldas obtains the best spatial correlation r 0 63 followed by nasa s gldas clm r 0 56 ncep2 shows the worst performance in representing the spatial distribution r 0 31 which is attributed to its coarsest resolution 2 5 resulting in low spatial variability fig 2c this highlights the potential of high resolution model products to reconstruct the spatial distribution of sm in terms of the kge values the best two products are gldas noah and cldas because the ldas products are particularly designed for optimally estimating land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 with better configurations of land surface components they have the potential to perform better than re analyses figs 2 and 10 previous studies mainly focused on the performance at annual or seasonal timescales due to lack of spatially and temporally high resolution observations this study revealed the error distributions at the annual monthly daily and sub daily timescales section 3 1 cldas well describes the time series which is much better than the second best gldas clm while the worst two products are ncep2 and gldas vic figs 3 and 5 the rank of median kge remains unchanged t for multiple timescales figs 3 and 5 this indicates that the errors of sm estimates at sub daily timescale can further propagate at larger timescales e g the daily and monthly timescales the good performance of cldas highlights the importance of incorporating hourly rain gauge and surface temperature observations and the improvement of spatial and temporal resolution the model products consistently perform better in summer than winter in terms of median kge cldas performs best both in summer and winter followed by gldas clm in summer and gldas mosaic in winter there are large discrepancies in the magnitude of seasonal mean sm among model products especially in winter table 4 this can be attributed to the imperfect model dynamics or physics such as the poor representation of snow and frozen soil processes in parameterization schemes wang et al 2017 in lsms and the uncertainty related to the in situ measurements i e presence of measurement outliers masking of frozen conditions set at 0 c etc for most subregions in china cldas obtains the best kge values and the highest correlation but it is not always the best in terms of bias and variability the criteria of choosing model products for different subregions and seasons can be made according to the kge values and its three components fig 10 the results also highlight the urgent demand for developing regional high resolution ldas products combined with dense in situ observations such as precipitation and surface temperature although the spatially high resolution products are not always better than the coarser resolution products in terms of kge values they show the potential to improve the correlation decrease the bias and better represent the variability the higher resolution 31 km era5 performs markedly better than the coarser resolution era interim in most subregions fig 9 which is also benefited from the significant advances in lsm modeling and data assimilation techniques during the last decade era5 is also the best to represent the spatial distribution among the four re analysis products with the highest spatial correlation fig 2e however its temporal variation is inferior to most ldas products due to its large biases in southern china the cma s cldas product with the highest resolution among the nine sm products generates the second best annual been sm and the best temporal variability of sm over china it can serve as a potential reference dataset for drought monitoring and model validation the findings are subject to at least three limitations first although this evaluation was performed using an unprecedented number of hourly observations as a reference the observations over the western china are quite sparse therefore the sm in the west part of china was not well represented in this study demanding denser observations in the future second the interpolation conducted horizontally and vertically could bring uncertainties into the sm model products because of the scale mismatch al bitar et al 2012 jackson et al 2012 stillman et al 2015 and representativeness errors between the point observations and the model grid it is worth to investigate advanced upscaling techniques to validate sm based on the observation network crow et al 2005 qin et al 2013 last the nine model products were chosen because this study focused on the sm model products with high resolution spatially and temporally although larger numbers of sm model products are included in this study multiple datasets based on remote sensing techniques are available and need a systematic comparison to model products future studies can be integrating in situ model and satellite sm products into a state of art sm dataset which leverages the advantages of each single product over china the accuracy of the selected reference dataset highly affects the precision of the final fused product afshar et al 2019 the high resolution asmos in china can serve as a high quality reference data for the sm data fusion also the rescaling methods such as afshar et al 2019 which derive the relationship between the model products and the observations can be applied to remove the systematic bias in the model products the rescaling methods are also highly recommended to be applied before comparing model products this is to avoid the non transferability of sm states between lsms koster et al 2009 which can bring potential limitations in bias measures as mentioned before in section 3 1 credit authorship contribution statement yong chen conceptualization methodology resources data curation formal analysis visualization investigation

5318,reliable soil moisture sm estimates are not only crucial for the climate variability but are also significant for agricultural ecological climatic and hydrometeorological predictions with the development of land surface models lsms and multi source data merging techniques various sm model products can serve as alternatives to obtain spatially continuous and temporally complete sm estimates the nine sm model products 0 10 cm including one analysis three reanalyses and five land data assimilation system ldas products are evaluated using the dense 2437 stations after quality control in situ observations at different timescales annual to sub daily in eight climate regions over mainland china during 2010 2017 the kling gupta efficiency kge a performance metric combining correlation bias and variability is used to quantify the strengths and weaknesses of these products cldas china meteorological administration s ldas performs the best with the optimal median values of kge and correlation in most subregions from sub daily to annual timescales followed by global ldas gldas clm product the sm products show large variability for different subregions timescales and spatial resolutions the sm products have better performance in summer than winter in addition high resolution products and ldas products have the potential to improve the performance for example era5 outperforms era interim in most parts of china the markedly better performance of regional product cldas than other global products highlights the importance of incorporating hourly rain gauge and surface temperature observations at a finer model resolution this intercomparison study sheds some light on the capability of the sm products for climate monitoring weather prediction and model validation keywords soil moisture analysis reanalysis land data assimilation system era5 cldas 1 introduction soil moisture sm plays a vital role in hydrological processes blöschl et al 2017 vereecken et al 2008 land atmospheric interaction seneviratne et al 2006 tuttle and salvucci 2016 and bio ecological processes green et al 2019 reich et al 2018 sm is the initial condition of land surface models lsms and distributed hydrologic models and also regulates the energy balance between the lower atmosphere and the land by influencing sensible and latent heat exchange meanwhile sm controls the exchange and partitioning of water fluxes at the land surface through dividing the precipitation into runoff and infiltration in addition long term trends of sm variations can provide accurate climate background to study climate variability while it has been endorsed as an essential climate variable by the global climate observing system gcos 2010 therefore reliable sm datasets are in urgent need for climate monitoring weather prediction and model validation ford and quiring 2019 seneviratne et al 2010 as important resources of hydrometeorological and agricultural applications sm model products have been used worldwide because of their continuity in space and time although in situ point observations are the most accurate measurements of sm vereecken et al 2008 they suffer from low spatial representativeness and limited temporal coverage satellite remote sensing can provide large scale sm estimates for a shallow soil layer usually 2 7 cm but it has lower accuracy than in situ observations and coarse spatial temporal resolution 20 km 1 day or more sm model products including analysis reanalysis and land data assimilation system ldas products see section 2 3 can fill the gap and often serve as alternatives robock et al 2000 sheffield 2004 the model products can combine plenty of in situ observations and remote sensing data to generate an optimal estimate of land surface state under the physical and dynamical constrains however the performance of these sm model products can vary considerably for different regions and products kumar et al 2017 xia et al 2014 which strongly depends on the lsm structure land data assimilation techniques the observation coverage and quality etc the evaluation of sm model products is essential to provide a reference for the application in different regions and timescales since sm is highly heterogeneous over time and space the spatial distribution of multi year average sm at the annual scale is markedly different with that at seasonal scale as the seasonal sm varies closely related to the vegetation growth and phenology dorigo et al 2012 the seasonal sm variation is mainly controlled by the balance between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet grayson et al 1997 for the finer timescales a series of wetting and drying cycles related to storm and inter storm period are superimposed to the seasonal cycle in addition the spatial distribution of sm is significantly non homogeneous as it is evidently affected by several spatial controls including variations in precipitation jackson et al 1999 tayfur et al 2014 soil properties baroni et al 2013 famiglietti et al 1998 vegetation dick et al 2018 qiu et al 2001 topography dunne and black 1970a b penna et al 2009 qiu et al 2001 and radiation mahmood and hubbard 2005 western et al 1999 there are a few studies of intercomparison for different gridded sm model products as many studies have evaluated only a subset of the available sm model products such as one kind of re analyses or the ldas products e g rahmani et al 2016 xia et al 2014 yuan and quiring 2017 due to the availability of sm observations they often focused on a small region subcontinental plot or even point scale which limits the generalizability of the conclusions e g rahmani et al 2016 stillman et al 2015 wang and zeng 2012 and they used very coarse resolution observations both spatially and temporally for the evaluation which constraints the validity of their findings at a higher resolution e g li et al 2005 liu et al 2014 in addition most of them did not analyze the global reanalyses or regional ldas products with high resolution temporally and spatially e g stillman et al 2015 vinodkumar and dharssi 2019 which can be very useful for land surface applications such as flash flood norbiato et al 2008 or drought prediction in particular it is of interest to investigate whether sm from the recently released high resolution era5 dataset developed by the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which has reduced biases of precipitation in many places e g the conterminous us beck et al 2019 obtains better performance than coarser resolution products over china to conduct comprehensive evaluation of sm products spatially and temporally high resolution observations are needed sm observations are critical for evaluation of the sm model products although this has been repeatedly identified as a high priority for years ford and quiring 2019 the sparse distribution and short observational period of sm measurements still limits the comprehensive evaluation studies seneviratne et al 2010 sheffield 2004 furthermore lack of consistent instrument type calibration methods and reporting depths makes it challenging to combine sm observations from multiple networks ford et al 2014 robock et al 2000 in the recent years efforts to combine observations from multiple sm networks are underway globally dorigo et al 2011 such as in america quiring et al 2016 and in china shi et al 2014 by the end of 2017 china meteorological administration cma had established 2776 automatic sm observation asmo stations across china with a temporal resolution of one hour the high resolution asmo network with high quality and density up to 7 stations within a 104 km2 pixel on average table 1 will provide an unprecedented opportunity for sm related research such as the validation of sm model products due to the lack of sm observations rare comprehensive evaluations of model products have been conducted over china the frequently used observations datasets of previous studies are less than 500 stations from cma agricultural meteorological stations cams observed by gravimetric method three times a month and less than 50 stations from the global soil moisture data bank gsmdb robock et al 2000 for example the previous studies only used sm observations from 43 gsmdb stations li et al 2005 225 cams stations mainly located in eastern china liu et al 2014 18 stations over southeast china peng et al 2015 and 74 or less stations over the tibet plateau wang and zeng 2012 zeng et al 2015 by using a relatively small number of stations in china these studies could not evaluate sm products comprehensively with convincing conclusions as china covers many kinds of climate regions in quite a large geographical area benefited from the high temporal resolution of asmos this study can validate model products at sub daily timescale which is rarely explored by previous studies comprehensive evaluations with in situ observations are indispensable for better understanding the inherent error structures of model products e g the spatiotemporal variation of sm fields and systematic errors in the models and enabling product developers to further improve their products therefore the purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of nine sm model products including one global analysis three global reanalyses four global ldas and one regional ldas products using the hourly in situ observations with the state of the art chinese asmos a detailed spatial distribution of sm over china can be provided to address the strengths and weaknesses of these products the performance at different timescales annual monthly seasonal daily and sub daily and different climate regions is discussed also the high resolution model products e g era5 are compared with coarser resolution ones to investigate whether the sm products can take advantage from a finer spatial resolution using dense in situ observation network the variability at different temporal and spatial scales and the quality of the nine sm model products are investigated the results may provide guidance for future hydrological applications of sm products such as real time streamflow prediction at basin scales the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study regions the observations of chinese asmos the sm model products and the evaluation methods section 3 comprehensively assesses nine sm products including the evaluation at different timescales and climate regions and the comparison at different resolutions and sources ldas products vs re analysis the main conclusions are highlighted in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 study regions climate in china is extremely diverse due to the vast territory and complex orography forming different heat and moisture conditions under the monsoon effect the spatial and temporal distributions of heat and moisture dramatically vary from region to region to investigate sm liu and xie 2013 divided china into eight subregions based on the surface dryness and wetness considering the distribution of in situ

for the subregions including mean annual precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature are provided in table 1 based on 30 year 1981 2010 in situ observations from the cma national meteorological information center nmic compared to the subregions used by liu and xie 2013 two new subregions region iv and viii are added to include the new sm observations region ii is defined by merging region ii and iii of liu and xie 2013 and region vi is defined by merging region vii and vii of liu and xie 2013 this can reduce the uncertainty influenced by scale mismatching between the footprint scale of the gridded sm products and the point scale asmos 2 2 hourly in situ observations the 8 year asmo data from 2010 to 2017 are provided by the cma nmic by the end of 2017 cma had built up the sm observation network with 2776 asmo stations across the mainland of china the asmo sensors include dzn1 dzn2 and dzn3 xue and ye 2013 which are all developed based on the frequency domain reflection fdr method soil moisture estimates are not used during times when the 0 10 cm soil temperature is below zero because the fdr sensors will provide invalid sm estimates at temperatures near or below 0 c sm is measured hourly in the unit of volumetric water content vwc m3 m 3 at the depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 50 cm 50 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm only the surface layer 0 10 cm is available for this study the observation data are uploaded to nmic in real time providing an in situ sm observation dataset with the highest spatial and temporal resolution in china however there are no quality control qc procedures applied to the observed raw data in the current operating observation network to improve practicability of the asmo data qc procedures were performed based on threshold value check the frequency of observation and the total days of observation first according to working range of the fdr sensor and the observation specification by cma the values larger than 0 5 m3 m 3 are removed second the observational frequency fig 1b which is the ratio of available observations to the entire period starting from the onset time fig 1a of the station is no less than 0 5 third each station has at least 180 days of data most of the stations were built up in or before the year of 2010 fig 1a after qc procedures are applied observations from 2437 in situ stations fig 1 are used for further model product evaluation the number of observations and estimated observation density after qc number of observations within a 104 km2 pixel on average in each subregion is presented in table 1 2 3 model products the model products evaluated in this study are listed in table 2 including one analysis product no 1 three reanalysis products no 2 4 four global ldas gldas products no 5 8 and one regional high resolution ldas product from cma no 9 the brief descriptions of these products are provided as follows 2 3 1 analysis and reanalysis products both the reanalysis and analysis products combine multisource observations in a physical model to provide a representation of geophysical state such as wind precipitation sm etc but they are different in two major aspects first the reanalysis is delayed to ingest more available observations than the analysis second the reanalysis data are usually produced with the retrospective run using a fixed version of model by assimilating the observation data with the same types while the analysis products are usually affected by the updates in models or observations such as model upgrade resolution new observation data or techniques etc which may cause the discontinuity of the model performance the global forecast system gfs analysis data the environmental modeling center 2016 with 0 5 horizontal resolution are obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental prediction ncep gfs is a fully coupled global model system to implement global weather forecasts including an atmosphere model an ocean model a lsm noah chen and dudhia 2001 and a sea ice model gfs is run four times 00 06 12 18 utc a day at a base horizontal resolution of 28 km which is regularly updated to improve its performance and forecast accuracy the ncep2 is the first generation kanamitsu et al 2002 global reanalysis developed by ncep compared with the former version ncep1 ncep2 provides a better reanalysis and fixes the known errors kanamitsu et al 2002 both ncep1 and ncep2 use the oregon state university osu lsm pan and mahrt 1987 with two layer thicknesses of 10 cm and 190 cm gridded sm data at 2 5 spatial resolution and 6 h temporal resolution are available from 1979 to present the third generation reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 and the fourth generation reanalysis era5 hennermann and paul 2019 are both developed by ecmwf era5 is the latest high resolution reanalysis released by ecmwf which is expected to replace era interim eventually compared to era interim era5 assimilates more historical observations and provides finer temporal 1 h vs 6 h and spatial 31 km vs 75 km estimates for atmospheric land and oceanic states 2 3 2 ldas products ldas combines satellite and ground observations using advanced lsms and data assimilation techniques to generate the optimal estimates of land surface states and fluxes gldas rodell et al 2004 has been developed jointly by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and noaa ncep four 3 h products including gldas noah gldas clm gldas vic and gldas mosaic are used in this study the gldas version 2 1 gldas 2 with 0 25 horizontal resolution only drives noah lsm and gldas noah is available from 2000 to present the rest three gldas products are generated from gldas version 1 0 gldas 2 with 1 horizontal resolution from 1979 to present the main differences among the four gldas products lie in the model parameterizations schemes and the forcing data for a intercomparison of schemes in these lsms see discussions by rodell et al 2004 the gldas 1 simulations are forced with a combination of analysis and observation based products rodell et al 2004 including ncep s global data assimilation system gdas disaggregated climate prediction center cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap and air force weather agency afwa radiation datasets the gldas 2 simulations are forced with the global meteorological forcing dataset from the princeton university sheffield et al 2006 as the demand for high resolution sm products becomes more and more urgent cma s land data assimilation system cldas shi et al 2014 developed by cma has been developed to support drought monitoring in china cldas has been operationally run in cma nmic since july 2013 hourly temperature forcing data incorporate regional automatic surface temperature observations more than 3000 over china while the gridded precipitation forcing data merge over 30 000 rain gauge data and the climate precipitation center morphing cmorph product shen et al 2014 the cldas 1 h sm product with 0 0625 spatial resolution covers asia 0 65 n 60 160 e and is available from 2008 to present 2 4 evaluation methods a set of verification metrics are used to quantitatively analyze unique strengths and shortcomings of the model products including the systematic bias bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse the ubrmse removes the systematic errors and only shows the random errors in addition the objective performance metric kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 and its three components are used to further comprehensively compare the nine sm model products kge combines three components of the key performance statistics including correlation bias and variability the kge value is defined as follows 1 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r is the pearson s correlation coefficient β is the ratio of estimated and observed means i e frequency bias and γ is represented by the ratio of the estimated and observed coefficients of variation the kge is only calculated when the correlation component r passes the 0 05 significance test the β and γ are defined as follows 2 β μ e μ o 3 γ σ e μ e σ o μ o where μ and σ denotes the mean and standard deviation respectively the subscripts e and o denotes the estimate and observation the kge value r β and γ are all perfect at unity and thus smaller absolute values kge 1 r 1 β 1 and γ 1 represent better performance for dichotomous verification the equitable threat score ets is used to analyze the sm model products at different thresholds especially in extremely dry wet cases the ets is defined as follows 4 e t s h h i t s h m f h i t s 5 h i t s h m h f h m f z where h f m z and hits are calculated from the two by two contingency table table 3 the ets ranges from 1 3 worst to 1 perfect as the positive ets indicates skillful forecasts relative to chance the model products are interpolated to specific observation stations fig 1 and vertical depth 0 10 cm bilinear interpolation is used horizontally and linear interpolation is used to match the sm data to the 0 10 cm layer sm from all the stations are treated as independent which means no average is taken when two or more stations are within the same sm pixel 3 results 3 1 performance at different timescales in this section nine sm model products are compared to asmos at annual monthly daily and sub daily timescales respectively because the errors may vary with different timescales this comparison is subjected to ignoring the transferability of sm states between lsms koster et al 2009 which can bring limitations in bias measures that is because all the products are characterized by different characteristics and model assumptions that cause a very different range of variability of the sm estimates thanks to the high resolution 1 h asmo network over china this section provides the evaluation results at an unprecedented fine temporal resolution 6 h section 3 1 3 although 1 h sm products are available for cldas and era5 only the data with the common temporal resolution of 6 h are used in the evaluation of these products 3 1 1 annual evaluation overall the ldas products represent better spatial distributions of annual mean sm than the re analyses datasets fig 2 displays the annual mean sm from 2010 to 2017 over china from observed sm fig 2a and nine model products fig 2b j the kge score is calculated using all points of annual mean fig 2 all model products capture a similar spatial sm pattern characterized by a gradual increase from northwest to southeast in the observations the high sm values 0 25 0 45 m3 m 3 extend from northeast china to humid jianghuai region and southern china the low sm values 0 0 15 m3 m 3 mainly locate in relatively dry western china and hetao region the best performance is obtained by nasa s gldas noah kge 0 51 closely followed by cma s cldas kge 0 48 all the re analyses except for era5 have lower spatial correlation r 0 40 than ldas products with comparatively poor scores kge 0 20 compared to the ecmwf s third generation coarser resolution era interim product the fourth generation era5 product kge 0 37 improves both spatial correlation r 0 50 and variability γ 0 84 and hence outperforms other re analyses and even some ldas products i e gldas clm gldas vic and gldas mosaic however era5 strongly overestimates sm in southern china by 0 15 m3 m 3 causing the largest frequency bias β 1 29 although all products generally capture the spatial pattern of annual mean sm over china there are substantial inter model variations from region to region see regional evaluations in section 3 2 the time series of annual mean sm estimates over the mainland of china shows large discrepancies in magnitude and trend among the nine products figure not shown similar to the spatial distribution of annual mean sm fig 2 best β 1 05 gldas clm has the smallest temporal bias table 4 the largest positive bias is found for era5 while gldas vic demonstrates strong overestimation and gldas mosaic shows large underestimation table 4 for the trend of annual mean sm gfs and ncep2 show little correlation with observed sm and even have opposite trends e g gldas clm during 2013 2015 ncep2 during 2010 2011 and gfs during 2012 2014 overall cldas era5 and era interim well reproduce the annual trend compared to other products but they have larger bias than gldas clm 3 1 2 monthly and seasonal evaluation at the monthly and seasonal timescales the magnitudes and trends of sm estimates show large discrepancies for different sm products figure not shown similar to the annual mean gldas clm shows the best magnitude of monthly mean sm with the lowest bias table 4 while era5 and gldas vic mosaic strongly overestimates underestimates monthly mean sm table 4 cldas has the best monthly variations table 4 with optimal seasonal cycle in comparison gldas clm and gldas noah followed by cldas also show similar monthly trends with observations but fail to capture the timing of sm recharge in february figure not shown among the nine model products gfs has the worst month to month variation and largest ubrmse fig 3 displays kge scores for the nine model products at monthly time scale using the asmos as a reference sm data are averaged for each month from january 2010 to december 2017 the probability distribution for kge scores are obtained using kge scores at in situ stations over china the ldas products except for gldas vic generally perform better than the re analysis products in terms of median kge fig 3 the best performance is obtained by cldas median kge of 0 24 with the highest median correlation r 0 57 followed by gldas clm median kge of 0 13 compared to era interim era5 has better correlation and variability but larger bias resulting in slightly improved median kge of 0 08 ncep2 gldas vic and gfs show comparatively poor performance negative median kge mainly caused by their relatively low correlation or large bias all model products consistently perform better better annual variations of seasonal mean in fig 3 and higher kge in fig 4 in summer than in winter at monthly daily and sub daily timescales fig 4 there is much larger spatial variability at three timescales in winter indicated by the wider density distribution of kge values this is probably attributed to the relatively low quality of the asmos for solid water and the poor representation of frozen soil dynamics of models in winter the median kge of each product generally increases from winter and peaks in summer with transitional median kge values in spring and autumn figures not shown cldas has the highest kge in both warm and cool seasons but lower median kge values close to zero are found in winter ncep2 has the worst performance in both seasons in addition the differences in median kge values among the model products are much greater in summer than in winter and increase from monthly to sub daily timescales fig 4 3 1 3 daily and sub daily evaluation among the nine model products the best overall performance of daily and sub daily sm fig 5 is obtained by cldas median kge of 0 30 followed by gldas clm median kge of 0 19 similar to the kge scores for monthly mean sm gldas clm exhibits the smallest bias while cldas slightly overestimates daily sm however cldas has better correlation and lower ubrmse than gldas clm table 4 performance statistics for daily mean sm are not provided in table 4 because the results are quite similar to sub daily results ncep2 and gldas vic are still the worst two model products when estimating daily sm the kge scores of sub daily sm are similar to the daily sm figure not shown indicating that the errors of sm estimates at sub daily timescale can further propagate to longer timescales e g daily monthly and annual fig 6 a shows the long term 2010 2017 probability distribution of daily sm from 0 0 50 m3 m 3 with bin size of 0 05 m3 m 3 the probability distributions of the model products are quite diverse and none of the products well match the observations all sm products except for gldas mosaic and era5 underestimate the probability of extreme values of sm 0 0 5 m3 m 3 or 0 45 m3 m 3 gldas mosaic generally produce high probability at lower bins 0 1 m3 m 3 era5 exhibits much higher probability than observations at higher bins 0 45 m3 m 3 for the medium sm values the probability is underestimated by most products except for era5 and gldas mosaic the probability distribution highlights the problem of model products to represent extreme events which is partly induced by the smooth of extreme value due to bilinear interpolation from model grids to point scale sm fig 6b displays the long term frequency at different thresholds of sub daily sm from 5 to 95 at the sub daily timescale all products underestimate the frequency of extreme dry events sm 0 055 m3 m 3 while all products except for era5 underestimate the frequency of extreme wet events sm 0 397 m3 m 3 fig 6b c the thresholds for extreme dry wet events are determined by 5 and 95 percentile of the probability distribution of observed sm due to the poor representation of the frequency for extreme events the frequency of moderate events is significantly underestimated by era5 and overestimated by other products to address the ability to represent different wetness scenarios ets scores have been calculated at the selected thresholds based on distribution of in situ observations for dry moderate and wet soil conditions fig 7 all products have quite little skill in representing extremely dry cases with low ets scores figure not shown for the 25 quantile 0 150 m3 m 3 in summer gldas mosaic shows relatively better skill fig 7a with the highest ets score among the nine products fig 7a for the 25 quantile in winter cldas gldas mosaic and gldas noah show relatively higher ets 0 15 than other products for the 50 quantile 0 228 m3 m 3 and the 90 quantile 0 361 m3 m 3 cldas shows the best skill for most months of the year overall the best two sm model products are cldas and gldas noah with relatively high ets scores at the three thresholds by contrast gfs has the lowest skill for the low and medium wetness fig 7a b and the relatively poor ets scores for the high wetness fig 7c gldas clm shows the relatively high skill for the medium wetness condition but exhibits the low skill for the dry and wet conditions at the 50 quantile better ets scores are found compared to more extreme moisture conditions e g 25 90 quantile this is possibly due to the deficiency of precipitation forcing when capturing extreme events which mostly overestimates light precipitation and underestimates heavy precipitation sun et al 2016 3 2 regional evaluation previous studies have presented evidence for the reliability and the usability of the global sm datasets at the regional scale liu and xie 2013 stillman et al 2015 wang et al 2016 while all sm model products capture the overall spatial and temporal variations over china the regional performance of these products is summarized in this section first the kge values fig 8 at each station over china are calculated using sub daily 6 h asmos as a reference secondly the ability of these products to represent the seasonal cycle figure not shown and daily variation fig 9 is analyzed considering four distinct phases the recharge phase p1 the drying phase p2 the wetting phase p3 and the enhanced drying phase p4 defined by the trend of monthly mean sm finally the overall statistics all samples in space and time of 6 h sm in each subregion for nine model products is presented in fig 10 the performance of model products varies from subregion to subregion mainly related to regional climate characteristics and model parameterizations based on the asmos relatively poor performance is found in region i v vii and viii with more negative kge values than the rest regions fig 8 the most kge values higher than 0 4 are found in region iii demonstrating a remarkably good performance in this region cldas has the best kge values at most asmo stations compared to other products fig 8h in hetao region cldas gldas noah gldas clm and gldas mosaic show low biases fig 2 leading to higher kge values than other products in general model products obtain better performance in southeastern than northwestern china the higher kge values in wetter southeast regions table 1 are mainly attributed to the large variation of precipitation in these regions larger variation in precipitation suggests larger variation in sm variation that models can easily capture for northwest regions with low annual mean precipitation table 1 the precipitation variance is low for high latitude or high attitude regions e g region i and viii the differences of model performance are also related to differences in model parameterization of frozen soil and snowmelt there are great discrepancies in the seasonal cycle figure not shown and daily variation fig 9 estimated by the nine model products especially in winter the observations reveal four distinct phases indicated as p1 to p4 of sm variation with the similar trend cldas exhibits the best seasonal cycle though underestimates sm in region vii fig 9g and overestimates sm in the rest regions majority of model products do not perform well in representing the increasing trend of p1 jan apr in region i ii v vii for example only cldas exhibits a similar increase trend of p1 with observations in region i fig 9a the sm trend of p2 apr jun is poorly represented by ncep2 in region ii and v fig 9b e which shows opposite trends with large biases the seasonal trend of p3 and p4 is generally better than p1 and p2 for most products however large positive biases still exist for gldas vic in region i iii fig 9a c era5 in region iv and vi fig 9d f and ncep2 in region v vii and viii fig 9e g h gldas mosaic greatly underestimates the magnitude of sm seasonal cycle and daily variation for six subregions fig 10 presents the overall statistics all samples in space and time of sub daily 6 h sm in eight subregions the kge values fig 10a indicate that the overall performance highly varies for different model products and regions cldas has consistently high kge values in all subregions while gldas clm has the second best kge with quite small variability in most subregions fig 10d the worst two products are gfs and ncep2 for most subregions with kge values close to zero all model products have worse performance in region vii and viii than the rest subregions which results from low correlations in region vii fig 10b and large biases in region viii fig 10c respectively 3 3 products with different resolutions the spatially high resolution products are not always better than the coarser resolution products in terms of kge values the rank of kge values varies from region to region fig 10a the three high resolution products are cldas 6 25 km gldas noah 25 km and era5 31 km although cldas has the highest resolution its performance is surpassed by era5 in region v by gldas mosaic in region vi and by gldas noah in region viii furthermore gldas noah is the worst product in region iv and era5 has comparatively poor performance than era interim the overall results of sm model products with higher resolutions highlight the potentials of improving sm estimate by using high resolution products as a result of the system upgrade the higher resolution era5 performs markedly better than the coarser resolution era interim across most subregions in china fig 8c d and fig 10 especially in region v and vi fig 10 evidence includes the improvements in the kge values three kge components r β γ figs 3 5 8 and the spatial correlation fig 2d e however era5 overestimates the sm compared to era interim especially in the wet subregions such as southern china fig 2d e the improvements are largely attributed to more observations assimilated within era5 in addition to the global model products the performance of a state of art regional high resolution table 2 ldas product cldas for the mainland of china is evaluated cldas has the potential to produce more accurate sm estimates with a high resolution of 6 25 km which allows the better representation of the mesoscale orography in terms of spatial correlation fig 2j cldas performs the second best kge 0 48 outperformed by gldas noah kge 0 51 for the temporal correlation at monthly daily and sub daily timescales cldas always performs the best with the highest median values of the kge and temporal correlation figs 3 5 and 8 note that cldas is not always the best choice for all subregions at different timescales cldas performs the best in five subregions region i ii iii iv and vii and ranks no 2 in the rest three subregions region v vi and viii fig 10a in all subregions cldas obtains the highest correlation followed by gldas clm except region vii and viii fig 10b for region vii and viii gldas noah outperforms gldas clm and has the second best correlation fig 10b in terms of bias cldas is surpassed by gldas clm in most subregions and the gldas products obtain the lowest biases fig 10c though gldas mosaic tends to markedly underestimate sm it has the lowest bias in region viii in terms of variability cldas is not the best one but it outperforms gldas clm in eight subregions fig 10d to examine the effect of the resolution the data thinning has been performed by regridding cldas into 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 and 2 50 using bilinear interpolation table 5 shows the evaluation results for the 6 houly data all samples in space and time in terms of the kge score cldas at 0 0625 original 0 25 0 50 0 75 keep achieving better performance than other products while cldas at 1 00 is surpassed by gldas noah at 0 25 at a coarse upscaled resolution 2 5 the performance of cldas degrades due to the poor representation of the spatial heterogeneity of sm but it still outperforms four sm products with higher resolutions and ncep2 at 2 5 in summary cldas shows the best performance because of its finest resolution of sm more importantly it has good quality by incorporating hourly local rain gauge and surface temperature observations at the finest model resolution 3 4 ldas products vs re analysis although ldas products and re analysis products are derived from models the purpose of the two type of products is quite different the ldas focuses on producing high quality fields of land surface states e g soil moisture temperature and fluxes e g evapotranspiration runoff by integrating satellite and ground based observational data products using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques the global re analysis aims to provide a best estimate of the atmospheric and surface states of the whole globe using the available observations the reanalysis is usually implemented with a fixed version of model and data assimilation systems for climate monitoring and research while the analysis is mainly used for weather prediction and is suffered from regular model upgrades overall ldas products have greater potential to improve sm than re analysis products from the evaluation results for cool season monthly daily and sub daily timescales four ldas products three gldas products and cldas obtain better median kge values than the re analysis figs 3 5 and 8 such as the worst reanalysis era in winter fig 4b by contrast era5 ranks no 3 in terms of the median kge value in summer fig 4a and is even better than three gldas products vic mosaic and noah which underscores the improvements of the fourth generation reanalysis era5 4 conclusions and discussion reliable sm estimates are not only crucial for the climate variability but are also significant for agricultural ecological climatic and hydrometeorological predictions this study provided a comprehensive evaluation of nine model products and quantified the discrepancies of different sm estimates from sub daily to annual timescales over eight climate regions in china the spatial resolutions of nine evaluated model products vary from 0 0625 to 2 5 including analysis gfs reanalysis ncep2 era interim and era5 and ldas gldas noah gldas clm gldas vic gldas mosaic and cldas products the evaluation was carried out with the unprecedented high resolution 2776 station asmos 2437 in situ sites after qc see fig 1 as a reference this study shed some light on the weakness and strengths of different model products using an objective performance metric kge which combines correlation bias and variability this study also provided a framework for comprehensively evaluating model products at different timescales and climate regions the unprecedented high resolution asmos present a detailed spatial pattern of annual mean sm which generally increase from northwest to southeast the ldas products better represent the spatial distribution of annual mean sm than re analyses with high spatial correlations fig 2 cma s cldas obtains the best spatial correlation r 0 63 followed by nasa s gldas clm r 0 56 ncep2 shows the worst performance in representing the spatial distribution r 0 31 which is attributed to its coarsest resolution 2 5 resulting in low spatial variability fig 2c this highlights the potential of high resolution model products to reconstruct the spatial distribution of sm in terms of the kge values the best two products are gldas noah and cldas because the ldas products are particularly designed for optimally estimating land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 with better configurations of land surface components they have the potential to perform better than re analyses figs 2 and 10 previous studies mainly focused on the performance at annual or seasonal timescales due to lack of spatially and temporally high resolution observations this study revealed the error distributions at the annual monthly daily and sub daily timescales section 3 1 cldas well describes the time series which is much better than the second best gldas clm while the worst two products are ncep2 and gldas vic figs 3 and 5 the rank of median kge remains unchanged t for multiple timescales figs 3 and 5 this indicates that the errors of sm estimates at sub daily timescale can further propagate at larger timescales e g the daily and monthly timescales the good performance of cldas highlights the importance of incorporating hourly rain gauge and surface temperature observations and the improvement of spatial and temporal resolution the model products consistently perform better in summer than winter in terms of median kge cldas performs best both in summer and winter followed by gldas clm in summer and gldas mosaic in winter there are large discrepancies in the magnitude of seasonal mean sm among model products especially in winter table 4 this can be attributed to the imperfect model dynamics or physics such as the poor representation of snow and frozen soil processes in parameterization schemes wang et al 2017 in lsms and the uncertainty related to the in situ measurements i e presence of measurement outliers masking of frozen conditions set at 0 c etc for most subregions in china cldas obtains the best kge values and the highest correlation but it is not always the best in terms of bias and variability the criteria of choosing model products for different subregions and seasons can be made according to the kge values and its three components fig 10 the results also highlight the urgent demand for developing regional high resolution ldas products combined with dense in situ observations such as precipitation and surface temperature although the spatially high resolution products are not always better than the coarser resolution products in terms of kge values they show the potential to improve the correlation decrease the bias and better represent the variability the higher resolution 31 km era5 performs markedly better than the coarser resolution era interim in most subregions fig 9 which is also benefited from the significant advances in lsm modeling and data assimilation techniques during the last decade era5 is also the best to represent the spatial distribution among the four re analysis products with the highest spatial correlation fig 2e however its temporal variation is inferior to most ldas products due to its large biases in southern china the cma s cldas product with the highest resolution among the nine sm products generates the second best annual been sm and the best temporal variability of sm over china it can serve as a potential reference dataset for drought monitoring and model validation the findings are subject to at least three limitations first although this evaluation was performed using an unprecedented number of hourly observations as a reference the observations over the western china are quite sparse therefore the sm in the west part of china was not well represented in this study demanding denser observations in the future second the interpolation conducted horizontally and vertically could bring uncertainties into the sm model products because of the scale mismatch al bitar et al 2012 jackson et al 2012 stillman et al 2015 and representativeness errors between the point observations and the model grid it is worth to investigate advanced upscaling techniques to validate sm based on the observation network crow et al 2005 qin et al 2013 last the nine model products were chosen because this study focused on the sm model products with high resolution spatially and temporally although larger numbers of sm model products are included in this study multiple datasets based on remote sensing techniques are available and need a systematic comparison to model products future studies can be integrating in situ model and satellite sm products into a state of art sm dataset which leverages the advantages of each single product over china the accuracy of the selected reference dataset highly affects the precision of the final fused product afshar et al 2019 the high resolution asmos in china can serve as a high quality reference data for the sm data fusion also the rescaling methods such as afshar et al 2019 which derive the relationship between the model products and the observations can be applied to remove the systematic bias in the model products the rescaling methods are also highly recommended to be applied before comparing model products this is to avoid the non transferability of sm states between lsms koster et al 2009 which can bring potential limitations in bias measures as mentioned before in section 3 1 credit authorship contribution statement yong chen conceptualization methodology resources data curation formal analysis visualization investigation

5319,estimates of groundwater age based on 14c are often limited by the uncertainty in geochemical processes that alter the 14c concentration measured in water and the composition δ13c and 14c of carbon sources needed to appropriately parametrize 14c adjustment models estimated ages for samples that contain a mixture of young and old groundwater will be particularly sensitive to model parametrization as relatively small additions of modern 14c from recent recharge can mask the presence and amount of old groundwater a novel multi model approach based on inverse geochemical modeling and lumped parameter modeling of age tracers 3h 3hetrit and sf6 was used to better constrain 14c dilution caused by dissolution of carbonates in the unsaturated zone or shallow parts of the glacial aquifer which extends over 2000 miles across the northern contiguous united states calibration of 14c inverse geochemical models to lpm computed 14c concentrations in modern water indicated that 14c of soil zone and shallow aquifer carbonates were not 14c dead 0 pmc as is typically assumed for 14c correction models 14c of such carbonates was on average about 53 pmc ranged 0 110 pmc n 72 this information was used to correct 14c concentrations for water recharged entirely before 1950 and water that is a mixture of pre and post 1950 water the multi model approach developed here was compared to an analytical 14c adjustment model revised fontes and garnier that assumed solid carbonates were 14c dead 14c corrections using the analytical adjustment model tended to over correct final 14c concentrations by 21 pmc and underestimates mean ages by 40 for groundwater mixtures in fact 14c corrections based on analytical model yielded negative ages 14c 120 pmc in nearly 36 of mixed samples this work presents a new approach to constraining 14c corrections and age estimates of mixtures of young and old groundwater the new method is applied to three well networks distributed across the spatially expansive glacial aquifer keywords radiocarbon groundwater age geochemical correction soil processes mixed groundwater sources 1 introduction carbon 14 14c age dating of groundwater is based on correlation of the dissolved inorganic carbon dic 14c to the decayed record of atmospheric 14c concentration over the last 50 000 years intcal13 reimer et al 2013 geochemical processes that otherwise make groundwater appear older than its actual age need to be considered for determination of accurate ages the correction to 14c in dic accounts for dilution of the atmospheric 14c signal by dissolution and isotopic exchange with subsurface carbonates and gases methane or co2 g from organic carbon e g wigley 1975 fontes et al 1978 fontes and garnier 1979 mook 1980 clark and fritz 1997 multiple possible carbon sources with differing isotopic signatures makes correction models difficult to constrain in practice e g horst et al 2008 mcmahon et al 2004 constraining 14c correction models is even more difficult when mixtures of groundwater sources are sampled with the geochemistry of each component influenced by different carbon reservoirs carbon 14 is frequently the only age tracer used for dating groundwater recharged prior to 1950 e g mcmahon et al 2004 horst et al 2008 jurgens et al 2008 bexfield et al 2012 gardner and heilweil 2014 van geldern et al 2014 thus the estimated age of such samples is strongly dependent on the identification of groundwater mixtures and the accuracy of the 14c correction in this study we investigate the influence of dic from differing source zones soil zone and deep saturated aquifer on mixtures of young and old groundwater sample chemistry of relatively young groundwater 100 years was used to estimate 14c activities of recharge zone soil zone and shallow aquifer carbonate results from the modeling of young samples are integrated into a stochiometric and binary mixing geochemical 14c correction approach developed for distinct mixtures of modern post 1950 and pre modern pre 1950 groundwater recharge with varying flow paths travel times and levels of geochemical evolution geochemical correction models which explicitly account for differing recharge sources are compared to single sample approaches that assume no mixing subsurface exchange of dic begins when infiltrating water equilibrated with atmospheric inorganic carbon encounters three primary reservoirs of inorganic carbon in groundwater systems soil gas soil carbonate and aquifer carbonate the modern atmospheric signal of 14c 100 percent modern carbon pmc used for age dating is diluted through dissolution and isotopic exchange with dic reservoirs whose 14c is less than 100 pmc in broad terms these processes occur either in an open system where an unlimited in the context of groundwater dic co2 reservoir is available such as in the unsaturated soil zone or in a closed system below the water table fontes et al 1978 fontes and garnier 1979 han and plummer 2013 analytical single sample 14c correction models have been widely used to correct for the apparent dilution by non atmospheric carbon see kalin 2000 or han and plummer 2016 for a comprehensive review of 14c correction methods these models use a mass balance approach to track major carbon species and or isotopes assuming the geochemistry is dominated by precipitation dissolution and isotopic fractionation according to appropriate exchange process open or closed system full acknowledgement and assessment of the analytical models implicit assumptions is needed to assure proper application accessible documentation and user guidance such as the graphical method of han et al 2012 have made significant contributions toward appropriate application in complex geochemical systems though such as progressive geochemical evolution from open to closed system conditions mixtures of chemically distinct groundwater or systems with reduction and or oxidation of organic carbon assuming a single set of exchange processes may bias estimated groundwater ages mcmahon et al 2004 horst et al 2008 often 14c corrections in such systems are performed using inverse geochemical modeling plummer et al 1994 mcmahon et al 2004 plummer et al 2004 mcmahon et al 2011 which accommodate multiple processes and carbonate sources inverse geochemical codes netpath plummer et al 1994 and phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 are frequently used for this purpose while inverse geochemical modeling is capable of handling mixtures of groundwater from distinct sources the models require the end member chemistry of each source be pre defined for systems in which waters of unknown chemistries are being mixed an alternative approach is needed it is well understood that soil pedogenic carbonates form in isotopic equilibrium with soil zone co2 cerling et al 1991 cerling and quade 1993 and modeling and observation have shown that shallow soil zone co2 14c is near atmospheric levels and decreases with depth e g wang et al 1993 1994 keller and bacon 1998 walvoord et al 2005 wood et al 2014 it is also recognized that atmospheric and soil zone co2 14c have varied on a decadal timescale most recently due to above ground nuclear testing nydal and lövseth 1983 although current atmospheric 14c concentrations have returned to pre bomb levels elevated bomb pulse 14c persist in soil carbonates estimates of soil carbonates turnover times are 100 s to 1000 s of years trumbore et al 1996 gorczyca et al 2013 direct measurement of 14c in speleothems formed in similar processes as pedogenic carbonates confirm that carbonates capture atmospheric co2 14c variations including elevated bomb pulse values hodge et al 2011 in the process of correcting 14c to estimate groundwater age the 14c of soil co2 and carbonates at the time of recharge need be defined as an input for geochemical correction this present an obvious problem as the 14c of soil zone derived dic needed to correct for non atmospheric sources prior to calculation of groundwater age is a function of the soil zone geochemical and isotopic exchanges but also when recharge occurred i e groundwater age relative to the variations in 14c of soil co2 and carbonates the need for a priori definition of 14c source end members means single sample analytical correction methods are under parametrized in cases where modern groundwater is present that could contain elevated 14c from atmospheric and soil sources a poorly conceptualized 14c correction approach in which no contribution of 14c from recharge carbonates are considered could result in large age dating errors particularly for mixed samples which contain a significant fraction of modern water but are reliant upon 14c to estimate age of the old fraction to estimate the influence of shallow 14c sources in mixed samples we extend the inverse modeling of dic 14c in complex mixtures through a novel combination of inverse geochemical and lumped parameter modeling lpm of groundwater age although 14c correction models are rarely applied to modern groundwater once corrected dic 14c activities should directly correspond to the representative atmospheric co2 14c history if the model is appropriately parameterized analysis of multiple modern age tracers e g 3h sf6 3hetrit and dic 14c from modern samples provide a means to test the validity and parametrization of geochemical correction models of shallow processes by assuming that dic 14c of modern groundwater solely reflects the geochemical processes that occurred in the soil zone and shallow aquifer as opposed to radioactive decay we constrain the isotopic composition of soil zone and shallow aquifer carbonates i e recharge carbonates calibrated geochemical models for modern water can then be used to guide development of geochemical inverse models for correction of dic 14c in water recharged before 1950 the goals of inverse geochemical modeling were to assess the relative roles of unsaturated shallow saturated and deep saturated zone processes on overall carbonate geochemistry and to better understand the evolution of the major ion chemistry specifically we set out to define the minimum number of phases mole transfers of defined phases and subsequent dilution and fractionation of δ13c and 14c in water that evolved from precipitation to the groundwater sample chemistry a combination of inverse geochemical modeling phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 isotopic mass balance equations netpathxl parkhurst and charlton 2008 and environmental age tracer modeling tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 were used to calculate corrected final dic 14c needed for age dating we present a comparison between inverse geochemical and analytical model 14c corrections that illustrates the differences between the approaches and provide guidance on appropriate application 2 study area the glacial aquifer system as defined by yager et al 2018 is a series of confined and unconfined aquifers composed of quaternary sediments north of the maximum glacial extent in the contiguous united states the aquifer system extends from the atlantic northeast to the pacific northwest spanning an area of 1 87 106 km2 it includes all unconsolidated aquifers above bedrock north of the line of continental glaciation fig 1 and is not a single hydraulically connected system unconfined and confined conditions are encountered throughout the glacial aquifer with confining layers up to 10 s of meters thick yager et al 2018 fig 1 study area overview and well locations

detail of mss and fps sample networks 2 column color 3 methods our general approach in this study was to investigate effects of differing sources on dic isotopes for relatively young groundwater and use this information to estimate 14c concentrations of recharge zone soil zone and shallow aquifer carbonates results from the geochemical modeling of young samples are integrated into a novel geochemical 14c correction approach developed for binary mixtures of modern and pre modern groundwater corrected dic 14c results from this study are interpreted to estimate groundwater age and age distributions solder et al 2019 2018 the limited number and nature of environmental age tracers available for these studies restrict the number of end members that can be fully characterized for groundwater age distributions of mixtures 3 1 well networks and chemical analysis three networks of wells in the glacial aquifer system fig 1 were sampled in 2013 and 2014 as a part of the u s geological survey s national water quality assessment nawqa project in this study we leverage the large number of samples and design of the well networks to evaluate groundwater geochemistry the largest well network and primary focus of study is the principal aquifer study pas network the pas was designed to assess water quality conditions for public drinking water supplies across the glacial aquifer system stackelberg 2017 burow and belitz 2014 the 115 wells of the pas generally have relatively long screened intervals 0 6 to 34 m across multiple geologic units and are pumped at high rates 100 s of liters per minute the model support study mss network was designed to provide physical and water quality data in support of a regional groundwater flow model juckem et al 2017 the 29 wells of the mss are mixed use and have relatively short screened intervals 0 6 to 13 m in shallow and deep portions of the aquifer targeting specific geologic units one of the public supply wells in the mss is also in the pas well number glacpas1 45 and is reported on in the pas section the flow path survey fps network is designed to assess the geochemical evolution of water quality in central wisconsin tesoriero et al 2007 saad 2008 the 25 wells of the fps are multi level monitoring wells along an approximate flow path saad 2008 with short screened intervals less than1 m well depths in a very general sense decrease from the pas to the mss network with the shallowest wells being in the fps network water samples from the well networks were analyzed for a broad suite of inorganic and organic constituents as well as environmental tracers arnold et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 in this study we utilize the major ion chemistry inorganic carbonate chemistry and environmental tracer concentrations of tritium 3h sulfur hexafluoride sf6 tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit and carbon 14 14c of dic not all tracers were collected at every well 3h samples were collected in dry 500 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and analyzed by electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation thatcher et al 1977 with a 0 16 tu detection limit at the usgs national research program lab menlo park ca or university of miami tritium laboratory miami fl sf6 were collected in duplicate in 1 l amber glass bottles with a polyseal cone lined cap following the procedures outlined on the usgs reston groundwater dating laboratory website http water usgs gov lab sf6 were analyzed by gas chromatography with a detection limit of 0 2 pptv at the usgs reston groundwater dating laboratory and concentrations were corrected for excess air based on noble gas modeling results 3hetrit was calculated following solomon and cook 2000 using model results of heavy noble gases ne ar kr and xe interpreted through the closed equilibrium ce model or the unfractionated air ua model aeschbach hertig et al 2000 nobel gas samples were collected in copper tube weiss 1968 with preparation and analysis conducted by the usgs dissolved noble gas laboratory in denver co 14c samples were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles by flushing filtered water 0 45 µm from the bottom of the bottle up with a minimum of three consecutive bottle volumes and then immediately sealed samples were prepared and analyzed by the national ocean sciences accelerator mass spectrometry facility nosams at woods hole oceanographic institute a detection limit of 0 2 pmc was adopted for this study based on the average reported analytical error specifics of sample processing analytical procedures and information on reference standards can be found at http www whoi edu nosams home the corrected dic 14c results presented here and other environmental tracers are used to estimate groundwater age distributions in the glacial aquifer using lumped parameter models jurgens et al 2012 selection of the most suitable age distribution i e lpm is based on multiple lines of evidence including the conceptual hydrogeology based on geologic maps and well logs measured tracer concentrations and lpm results in an iterative process complete detail of final tracer concentrations and estimated groundwater ages are provided in a usgs data release solder et al 2018 for this study modern and pre modern water is defined as groundwater that was wholly recharged after 1950 or before 1950 respectively these modern or pre modern samples are best described by a single lpm and have unimodal age distributions mixtures are identified to have a component of modern and pre modern water and are represented by a binary mixture of two lpms and have bimodal age distributions as the binary mixture components may not strictly adhere to the above definitions of modern and pre modern the two end member components are referred to as young and old for clarity 3 2 lithology and mineralogy mineralogical composition of the soil and aquifer material is the primary constraint on the geochemical evolution of groundwater the regional glacial aquifer incorporates a broad range of bedrock parent materials fig b 4 soller et al 2012 yager et al 2018 but the majority of pas network well sites are screened in glacial materials derived from clastic sedimentary or marine carbonate rock 69 and 21 of 115 sites respectively additional data such as soil mineralogy smith et al 2014 soil chemistry soil survey staff and surficial geology soller et al 2012 were considered during geochemical conceptualization and inverse model phase selection supporting information a 3 3 carbon 14 geochemical model development the 14c geochemical modeling approach of this study is a multi model and multi step process the framework for the geochemical modeling process is first outlined here with specific details and examples in the following sections complete model input chemistry and output results are presented in the associated usgs data release solder and jurgens 2018 groundwater and soil chemistry lithology previous geochemical studies and iterative modeling of modern samples were used to develop an inverse geochemical model that represents shallow geochemical processes the model was kept generalized to accommodate mixed and pre modern groundwater samples ostensibly sampled from deeper portions of the aquifer which would have undergone similar shallow geochemical processes as the modern samples mole transfers determined by the inverse geochemical model were used as input to isotopic mass balance calculations to determine the final corrected dic 14c for groundwater age estimation as the dic 14c concentration of modern samples is unaffected by radio decay an optimization method was used to calculate the appropriate recharge carbonate 14c optimized recharge carbonate 14c was evaluated on the match between the inverse geochemical modeled and lpm predicted 14c of dic the results from inverse geochemical modeling of the modern samples were then used to guide geochemical modeling of the mixtures and pre modern samples for mixed samples an iterative process between geochemical and isotopic mass balance models and age lpm was conducted final corrected dic 14c for mixed and pre modern samples were used as a fitted tracer in lpm estimated mean ages and age distributions solder et al 2018 2019 3 3 1 inverse geochemical and isotopic mass balance model the goal of inverse geochemical modeling was to define the minimum number of phases and mole transfers of said phases that adequately represent shallow geochemical processes that explain the major ionic evolution from precipitation to modern sampled waters inverse geochemical modeling was performed using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 calculations of mineral speciation and saturation indices of groundwater table a 1 of the supplemental information guided conceptualization of the glacial aquifer geochemical system saturation index si of a given phase indicates the deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium with positive values indicating over saturation i e conditions favorable to precipitation and negative values indicate under saturation i e conditions favorable to dissolution soil characteristics geology previous geochemical studies in the region e g busby et al 1991 eberts and george 2001 williams et al 2007 and iterative geochemical modeling of modern samples were used to select appropriate phases and parameterize the inverse geochemical model the initial chemistry was defined by precipitation chemistry based on wet deposition measurements collected by the national atmospheric deposition program nadp the major geochemical processes were conceptualized to be plant transpiration and respiration soil gas exchange with the atmosphere dissolution of carbonate minerals and gypsum weathering of silicate minerals and redox reactions associated with the reduction of dissolved oxygen and applied fertilizer facilitated by oxidation of organic carbon the model included co2 g to account for carbonate dissolution reactions occurring in the unsaturated zone inverse geochemical model phases are presented in table 1 individual model solutions mole transfers required to evolve rainwater to sample chemistry were checked for coherency models with abnormally large or unrealistic co2 g and cation exchange mole transfers 5 8 mmol were excluded from final model selections the measured dic and δ13c isotopic balance constraints in phreeqc modeling help limit the number of models with excessive carbonate dissolution models were also limited to soil carbonate dissolution of calcite only or calcite and dolomite de dolomitization dissolution of dolomite and precipitation of calcite and dissolution of dolomite only were not considered given conditions to initiate carbonate precipitation si 10 as suggested by herman and lorah 1987 macpherson et al 2008 were not observed table a 1 of the supplemental information and calcite is much more soluble than dolomite log k 8 48 and 17 09 at 25 c respectively nordstrom et al 1990 for silicate mineral weathering a single plagioclase composition was used as an approximate composition an38ab62 from phreeqc documentation potential reduction of fertilizer nh4no3 and organic carbon ch2o were allowed based on the low dissolved oxygen arnold et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 and modest reduction potential estimated pe 1 7 of some sites it is acknowledged that a single set of geochemical reactions and isotopic ratios cannot completely capture the chemical evolution of all the sampled waters given the large spatial extent of the glacial aquifer uncertainty in phreeqc model inputs e g groundwater sample and rainwater chemistry was generally set to 10 n 86 an uncertainty of 20 in sample chemistry was used at 8 sites and an uncertainty of 30 was used at one site solder and jurgens 2018 the uncertainty parameter in phreeqc allows variation in the water chemistry within the set limits and was required at the select sites for the solver to converge the need for uncertainty adjustments is likely a reflection of the generalized nature of the inverse model and geochemical spatial variability not the true uncertainty in the chemical analysis corrected dic 14c was determined by inputting mole transfers from inverse geochemical modeling into isotopic mass balance equations netpathxl parkhurst and charlton 2008 soil zone co2 and carbonate δ13c 20 5 was based on previously measured values cerling et al 1991 cerling and quade 1993 solid phase carbonate δ13c value of 0 was assumed for deep aquifer carbonate as is common in marine derived carbonates keith and weber 1964 solid phase 14c of recharge carbonate soil zone and shallow aquifer was determined through modeling of modern samples as discussed later and the deep saturated aquifer carbonate 14c was set to 0 or 30 pmc as a simplifying assumption soil co2 14c was held constant at 100 pmc as is frequently assumed han and plummer 2016 a combination of historical atmospheric 14c variability most recently from above ground nuclear testing nydal and lövseth 1983 phillips et al 2013 and the fact that soil carbonate isotopic composition is depth dependent and affected by multiple non linear processes e g productivity soil respiration rate soil development and chemistry wang et al 1993 1994 walvoord et al 2005 makes it difficult to constrain co2 14c in the soil zone a value of 100 pmc is generally considered valid for pre modern groundwater and this assumption only effects the modern samples as explained in further detail in the discussion section the initial 14c of dic e g at the water table corrected for addition of non atmospheric dic was calculated by averaging the adjusted initial dic 14c of select inverse and isotopic model realizations for a given site prior to input or comparison to lpm the adjusted initial dic 14c 14co must be transformed to the adjusted final dic 14c 14cf which represents the dic 14c at the point of sample collection modified from jurgens et al 2014 as 1 14 c f a o 14 c t 14 c o where ao is the assumed initial 14c of dic prior to geochemical reaction and 14ct is the measured 14c of total dic in the sample ao is assumed to be 100 pmc for consistency with the soil zone 14c used for isotopic mass balance calculations 3 3 2 inverse geochemical modeling of modern samples inverse geochemical modeling was first conducted on pas samples with mean age less than 120 years n 38 with good agreement between tracers solder et al 2018 2019 and where the hydrogeology is understood these results were used to establish a relationship between estimated mean age and bulk solid phase 14c of the soil zone and shallow aquifer i e recharge carbonate to predict the extent of geochemical evolution and the 14c of dic in the young component of groundwater mixtures single lpms of groundwater age were fit to measured concentrations of tracers 3h 3hetrit and sf6 these lpms were then used to compute the 14c concentration of the sample that would be expected if the sample had not undergone geochemical alteration or dilution i e atmospheric 14c because the groundwater age tracers 3h 3hetrit and sf6 are not affected by carbonate reactions and because the amount of 14c decay half life 5 730 years in modern samples is nearly zero the difference between the measured 14c and the computed 14c from the lpm provides an independent estimate of the potential dilution or geochemical correction of the 14c the computed 14c concentration from the lpms can therefore be used to optimize the recharge carbonate 14c this approach was also used for the fps network since samples were not strictly collected from the water table end member values derived from geochemical modeling of the selected samples represent both unsaturated zone and shallow aquifer carbonate geochemistry as a bulk parameter as previously discussed 14c of soil co2 is difficult to define a priori for this work a soil co2 14c value of 100 pmc was assumed carbon 14 of soil co2 can be higher or lower than 100 pmc e g bacon and keller 1998 walvoord et al 2005 wood et al 2014 depending on inputs from the atmosphere soil respiration rate and organic matter decomposition gillon et al 2012 and varies over shorter time scales than 14c of soil carbonate trumbore et al 1996 gorczyca et al 2013 temporal variability of soil co2 14c could not be appropriately constrained and was not considered in this study optimized 14c for recharge carbonates estimated in this study will have higher uncertainty for samples that had soil co2 14c above or below 100 pmc at the time of recharge the co2 δ13c is well constrained by measured data cerling et al 1991 cerling and quade 1993 and solid phase δ13c by marine carbonates present in deep portions of the aquifer keith and weber 1964 while soil carbonates can have much lighter δ13c values than 0 e g cerling et al 1991 cerling and quade 1993 an assumed value of 0 provides a lower bound for 14cf e g maximum likely groundwater age while there is some conceptual limitation to this approach resulting from the variance in δ13c values between the soil and shallow aquifer inorganic carbon reservoirs we expect that this simplifying assumption does not detract from the primary findings of this study the optimal recharge carbonate 14c was calculated for selected samples by varying the solid phase 14c in the geochemical model to match inverse isotopic model calculated 14cf to lpm simulated 14cf this can be formally described by rearrangement of the carbon isotope mass balance of wigley 1975 and plummer et al 1994 using the selected inverse geochemical model phases the carbon mass balance is 2 c t c o d c s d c c o 2 d c om where ct is the total measured dic co is initial dic prior to geochemical reaction primarily from atmospheric sources and dc is carbon mole transfer with subscripts s co2 and om indicating solid gas or organic matter carbon phase the isotopic mass balance can be described for 14c as 3 14 c t 14 c o d c s 14 c s 0 2 ε s b d c c o 2 14 c c o 2 0 2 ε c o 2 b d c om 14 c om 0 2 ε om b c m where 14c indicates the 14c isotopic ratio for the given phase and ε is the fraction factor between the respective phases indicated by subscript the subscript b indicates the dissolved bicarbonate phase rearranging and substituting in equation 1 results in 4 14 c s a o 14 c t 14 c f d c c o 2 14 c c o 2 0 2 ε c o 2 b d c om 14 c om 0 2 ε om b 14 c t c t d c s 0 2 ε s b for the mss well network valid inverse geochemical models were not found as further discussed in the results section accordingly a single sample analytical solution revised version of fontes and garnier 1979 as reported by han and plummer 2013 was used to correct dic 14c for mss network samples for selected samples with mean ages less than 110 years a procedure like the one described above for the pas and fps networks was used to determine the mss network specific relationship between optimized recharge carbonate 14c and lpm estimated mean age for estimation of the optimized recharge carbonate 14c according to the analytical correction equation 22 from han and plummer 2013 is rearranged as 5 14 c s 14 c o c s c t 14 c s c b c t 14 c b x δ 13 c s δ 13 c b ε s b δ 13 c t c s c t δ 13 c s c b c t δ 13 c b 14 c b 0 2 ε s b combining a re arranged equation 1 and equation 5 results in 6 14 c s

phase unsaturated zone gas δ13c was set to 22 for analytical modeling an intermediate value of the allowable range from inverse models section 3 3 1 3 4 integrated geochemical and lumped parameter modeling of mixed samples 14cf of mixed samples were calculated by integrating lpm age estimates of the young component and results from geochemical modeling of selected young samples preliminary lpm estimates of the mean ages of the two mixing components young and old and mixing ratio f was used in the first iteration of a carbonate binary mixing model the mixing model was used to determine a bulk solid 14c which includes contributions form recharge carbonate 14c and deep saturated carbonate 14c the simple linear mixing model is defined as 7 14 c s 14 c yng f 14 c old 1 f the relationship between optimized recharge carbonate 14c and estimated age section 3 3 2 was used to assign a value of 14c to the young fraction of the mixture 14cyng the solid phase 14c of the old fraction 14cold was set to either 0 or 30 pmc the conceptual upper limit of 30 pmc for 14cold is chosen based on that up to 30 modern water is captured in pre modern samples according modeled age distributions solder et al 2018 2019 and moden water is assumed to be contributing 100 pmc dic in reality it is not expected that aquifer carbonates contain 30 pmc but instead the solid phase 14cold parameter is meant to capture the range of possible recharge carbonate 14c contributions from the old groundwater component the preliminary mixing ratio was calculated in the lpm assuming an old component mean age of 10 000 years this value was used only as a starting point for subsequent calculations and iterations the initial estimate of bulk 14cs from the carbonate binary mixing model eq 7 is input to the geochemical modeling scheme eq 3 and the resulting 14cf is input to lpm to calculate a new old component mean age and mixing ratio it is important to note that the estimated mean age of the young component and thus 14cyng does not change as the bulk 14cs of the mixture and the mixing ratio are codependent the geochemical and lumped parameter model process was performed iteratively until the lpm mixing ratio changed by less than 5 between iterations two values of 14cf are reported for the mixed samples based on assumed 14c of 0 or 30 pmc for the deep aquifer carbonates solder and jurgens 2018 while one 14cf value was chosen for the final interpreted age based on surrounding sites other tracer concentrations and the judgement of the hydrologist conducting the age analysis 3 5 geochemical modeling of pre modern samples the inverse geochemical models developed for modern water in the pas network were used to model the mole transfers required to evolve precipitation to the chemistry of the pre modern waters in the pas well network n 20 solder et al 2018 14cf values determined through inverse geochemical and isotopic mass balance calculations were input to lpm in the cases pas 9 mss where there was not a valid phreeqc model i e solver did not converge or unreasonable geochemical model the analytical correction model was applied han and plummer 2013 aquifer solid 14c was varied between 0 and 30 pmc for both inverse and analytical modeling meaning two values of 14cf are reported for pre modern samples solder and jurgens 2018 while one corrected value was chosen for the final interpreted age 3 6 comparison of inverse to analytical geochemical models as a final evaluation of the geochemical modeling a comparison was made between the inverse geochemical modeling results where available and analytical model results for samples of this study the analytical model was parameterized as if no additional knowledge of the system from inverse modeling was available same as for inverse modeling δ13c of aquifer solids and unsaturated zone gas 0 and 22 respectively were used the purpose of this comparison was to examine how differences in modeling approach with the inverse geochemical model accounting for organic carbon transfers and other mass balance considerations not captured in the analytical model and assumed 14c of recharge and aquifer carbonates affect 14cf values 4 results the need for geochemical correction of 14c in the glacial aquifer was indicated by comparison of measured 3h 3hetrit sf6 and 14c from all pas wells to lpm simulated tracer concentrations fig 2 relationships between 3h 3hetrit an sf6 showed that many samples were comprised of water that was wholly recharged after 1950 measured data groups around atmospheric input curves fig 2 however the measured 14c for most modern samples was less than expected atmospheric 14c values i e greater than or equal to 100 pmc although 3h deposition varies significantly across the glacial aquifer system largely as a result of variations in latitude and distance from the ocean displayed by varying input curves in fig 2 differences in 3h deposition alone cannot explain the discrepancy between the modern tracers 3h 3hetrit sf6 and measured 14c in other words concentrations of 3h 3hetrit and sf6 in modern samples do not appear to be diluted by mixing with pre modern tracer free groundwater in the glacial aquifer helium isotopes such as low terrigenic helium 4 and helium 3 to helium 4 isotopic ratios close to atmospheric ratios solder et al 2018 also indicate short residence times and limited crustal helium accumulation further supporting the lack of modern tracer dilution in the modern samples therefore the disagreement between measured 14c of modern samples to estimated atmospheric 14c at the time of recharge e g 80 of modern samples have 14c less than 100 pmc is most likely from geochemical dilution of dic 14c from soil and aquifer carbonates these findings indicate shallow geochemical processes have an apparent significant effect on dic 14c in the study area geochemical corrections to all the measured 14c concentrations in the glacial aquifer must be performed before use in determining mean groundwater ages fig 2 measured tritium 3h tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit sulphur hexafloride sf6 and carbon 14 14c of pas network

most samples fall along the line and there is little distinction between age classes pre modern samples falling to the right of the line are grouped in western montana and the dakotas and are likely influenced by additional gypsum dissolution previously reported as a significant process in the area by busby et al 1991 comparison of total dissolved inorganic carbon tdic to 3h fig 3b similarly shows little distinction between age class suggesting that most of the dissolution processes that increase dic occur in the shallow portions of the aquifer in fact tdic appears to be more strongly influenced by spatial location and hydrogeology than by groundwater age fig 3c localized processes driving the increase in tdic may be masked by the aggregation of data over the large spatial extent

solutions deemed geochemically reasonable were defined for 38 of the 58 modern samples and 33 of the 57 mixtures and pre modern samples in the pas network inverse geochemical modeling of the mss samples was generally unsuccessful with the model converging on geochemically reasonable solutions for only 8 of the 29 samples inverse modeling of the fps network wells was successful with the model converging for 24 of the 25 samples model results are summarized here with complete results available in the associated usgs data release solder and jurgens 2018 mean mole transfers from select models

stoichiometry and are presented here to facilitate discussion positive values indicate dissolution and negative values indicate precipitation inverse model results table 2 show similar mole transfers of carbonates silicate minerals and gypsum for pre modern mixed and modern samples this further supports that most dissolved constituents are acquired from soil zone and shallow aquifer geochemical

influence on 14cs in the recharge zone while it was previously argued that age class was not a good indicator of geochemical evolution e g fig 3b results from the fps network covering a small spatial

aquifer tracers of modern groundwater 3h 3hetrit and sf6 did not follow dilution or mixing patterns expected for addition of an older tracer free source of groundwater this observation indicated that measured dic 14c in young groundwater which was frequently much less than 100 pmc has been substantially altered by geochemical reactions in the soil zone and shallow aquifer i e recharge zone previous geochemical investigations in the glacial aquifer busby et al 1991 eberts and george 2001 williams et al 2007 support this finding calcite dolomite and gypsum saturation indices less than 0 at most sites table a 1 of the supplemental information indicate conditions favorable to mineral dissolution measured ion concentrations fig 3 and inverse geochemical modeling of groundwater samples table 2 indicated that carbonate and gypsum eq 6 dissolution were the most significant reactions controlling major ion chemistry given the glacial aquifer s broad spatial extent and variability in groundwater chemistry convergence of the generalized inverse model for well over half of all pas samples 71 of 115 is considered a success and indicates the model is a reasonable representation of the dominant geochemical processes given that the fps network wells are completed in shallow portions of the aquifer model convergence for 24 of 25 samples indicates there is good representation of soil zone and shallow aquifer geochemical processes average mole transfers table 2 while not representative of a valid stoichiometric model provide a basis for discussion of the geochemical evolution of groundwater it is important to remember each model represents rainwater geochemically evolved through phase transfers to the final sample concentrations rather than sequentially from modern to pre modern of interest for this study a trend of increasing carbon transfer calcite dolomite co2 gas and organic carbon ch2o from mixed to modern and finally pre modern samples is observed assuming groundwater age is vertically stratified the results are consistent with regional observations of lowest carbonate and co2 concentrations at intermediate depths macpherson 2009 the appearance of limited dolomite dissolution is a result of selecting models with calcite only or calcite and dolomite dissolution as a simplifying assumption as discussed in the methods section for some samples phreeqc found multiple versions of the same inverse model where reduction of organic carbon ch2o was substituted for co2 dissolution which could indicate that soil gas co2 may be at least partly derived from decomposition of organic matter in some parts of the glacial aquifer net dissolution of fertilizer and ex solution of nh3 gas suggest some sites evolved from o2 to no3 reduction relatively consistent mole transfers of plagioclase and biotite from modern and pre modern samples indicates weathering of these minerals occurs in shallow portions of the aquifer increased mole transfers from modern to pre modern samples of potassium feldspar is consistent with the slow rate of silicate weathering and increased bicarbonate in pre modern samples fig 3a clay mineral illite and kaolinite precipitation exhibits a similar trend to silicate mineral dissolution indicating the linkage between silicate weathering and clay formation cation exchange of calcium cax and sodium nax show negative transfers while magnesium mgx potassium kx show positive transfers with an increase in these trends from modern to pre modern waters transfer of na out of the aqueous phase is possibly a result from excess sodium from the dissolution of halite required to balance chloride concentrations or uncertainty in the assumed plagioclase composition the transfer of mg and k cations into the aqueous phase suggests possible underestimation of dolomite and biotite dissolution or the model is missing an additional mg and k bearing mineral e g hornblende or phyllosilicates such as glauconite and phlogopite the generalized inverse geochemical model presented here has utility in capturing general trends and investigating the carbon isotopes but should not be applied for understanding detailed geochemistry of a specific site for example the inability of the model to capture mss well chemistry 21 of 29 models failed to converge suggests locally distinct geochemical processes control the water chemistry poor model fit for the 8 mss models is exemplified by large cation exchange transfers often 10 mmol solder and jurgens 2018 the short screened intervals of mss wells in targeted hydrogeologic units likely need specifically tailored models such detailed investigation is outside the scope of this work generalized models such as the one presented here need to be carefully applied to avoid overinterpretation optimized 14cs of select young pas network samples are statistically correlated to mean age kendall s τ 0 35 p 0 002 and are greater than 0 pmc in samples up to 100 years old table a 2 of the supplemental information fig 4 a 14co of approximately 86 pmc is indicated by inverse modeling results corresponding to a 14 dilution of atmospheric carbon prior to recharge past the water table the influence of recharge zone geochemistry is apparent for 100 years before dissolution of carbon dead aquifer carbonates obscures the effects of the recharge zone carbon sources comparison of lpm predicted 14c and measured δ13c of dic to geochemical model estimated values table a 2 of the supplemental information solder and jurgens 2018 is favorable with root mean square errors rmse of 3 5 and 0 25 respectively three samples glacpas1 17 19 61 drive the overall error where optimized recharge 14cs is 100 pmc this value may be too low if bomb pulse 14c pmc 100 was present in the recharge zone carbonates or gas gillon et al 2012 in the fps network a statistically significant trend between optimized recharge 14c and mean age kendall s τ 0 44 p 0 004 and 14co of about 78 pmc was found the ability of the generalized inverse model to capture fps chemistry 24 of 25 sites and the similarity of optimized recharge 14cs and 14co to pas network results table a 2 of the supplemental information provide additional evidence that the model is a reasonable representation of shallow geochemical processes young sample geochemical model results are important for subsequent modeling in the glacial aquifer in two ways first the least squares best fit of optimized 14cs to age was used to estimate the young water contribution to the bulk 14cs of mixtures for the pas network spatial variation of geochemical conditions may partially account for the apparent relationship between age of modern samples and optimized 14cs but results for fps network samples with similar geochemical conditions across the network suggest that 14cs can reliably be related to age of modern samples while the relationship between optimized 14cs and age has limitations across the large pas network explicit accounting of the geochemical complexity of groundwater mixtures is an important methodological deviation from previous work bulk final 14cs of mixed samples ranging from 21 to 67 pmc for pas network samples fig 4a table a 3 of the supplemental information indicating widely variable influence of shallow geochemistry where bulk 14cs of mss network samples are generally lower 4 44 pmc table a 3 of the supplemental information possible a result of local hydrogeology and well design these results differ significantly from commonly assumed correction model 14cs parameter value of 0 pmc secondly the relationship between optimized recharge 14cs and estimated mean age of young samples suggested that considering a range of 14cs 0 to 30 pmc for the deep aquifer is worthwhile in reality solid carbonates in the deep part of the aquifer are radiocarbon dead but comparison of 14cf of this study and the single sample analytical correction table a 4 of the supplemental information show the separate methods are in modest agreement 10 percent for most pre modern samples and mixed samples when a solid phase concentration of 30 pmc is assumed fig 5a for pre modern samples average percent error in 14c based lpm age between the two approaches is 21 and 16 for 0 and 30 pmc respectively for context an uncertainty in soil gas δ13c of 5 or carbonate δ13c of 3 results in an average percent error in apparent age of 22 and 11 respectively this indicates that recharge zone geochemistry may have a similar influence on 14cf of pre modern samples as appropriate estimation of isotopic end members for traditional correction methods the difference in model approaches is more notable for mixtures with the analytical method resulting in an over corrected 14cf 120 pmc particularly when assuming 0 pmc 14cs in the analytical model fig 5a disagreement between approaches is magnified when 14cf is greater than 80 pmc although lpm estimated mean ages and old component ages of mixtures do not show a clear trend with respect to 14cs or 14cf table a 4 of the supplemental information significant differences in mixture mean ages between model approaches average percent errors of 53 and 48 for 0 and 30 pmc respectively emphasize the importance of explicit accounting for the distinct geochemistry of groundwater mixtures table a 4 of the supplemental information keeping in mind that the two approaches are within normal uncertainty bounds for pre modern samples the indiscriminate use of an inappropriate or poorly parametrized 14c correction model for mixed samples has potentially disastrous effect on modeled mean ages the broader significance of this finding explicitly the pronounced disagreement between accounting for the mixed chemistry whether using the inverse model or analytical model and the single sample method is that even though a binary mixture may not be an appropriate conceptualization nearly all groundwater samples are a mixture of flow paths a quick comparison of mean 14cf from previous regional studies to the select result of this study shows tailored inverse geochemical models for montana and the dakotas 24 8 pmc busby et al 1991 and 35 3 pmc plummer et al 1991 reasonably match with the approach of this study 40 1 pmc with the difference likely associated with assumed solid phase 14c conversely previous study results from the michigan and wisconsin using single sample analytical corrections 33 pmc wen et al 2016 47 6 pmc simpkins and bradbury 1992 and 46 7 pmc ma et al 2004 are dramatically over corrected compared to select results of this study 102 93 and 89 pmc respectively while this comparison is limited by the small number of samples that are not necessarily the same groundwater it illustrates an important difference in conceptual approach between assuming all old groundwater or some mixture of groundwater ages in the glacial aquifer relatively small but meaningful fractions of post 1950 recharge can be present in groundwater with relatively old mean ages solder et al 2019 2018 meaning use of the single sample correction model should be carefully evaluated while an admittedly generalized approach was needed to fit such a broad range of geochemical conditions of this study such investigations may provide valuable insight to aquifer geochemistry in other regions for the glacial aquifer pas network the influence of shallow geochemical processes in relatively old groundwater was surprising one possible explanation is the overall hydrogeology and network design as an unconfined and relatively shallow aquifer 10 s of meters yager et al 2018 with long screened intervals promotes the capture of shallow and modern flow paths along with deep pre modern groundwater it is also curious that additional complexity of the inverse model such as representation of silicate mineral weathering and redox processes is somewhat compensated for by adjusting the solid phase 14c concentration in the single sample analytical model these findings might be the reflection of spatial extent and the dominance of carbonate dissolution of glacial aquifer chemistry but similar study of a variety of hydrogeologic and geochemical conditions is needed to confirm these findings 6 conclusion carbon 14 corrections for groundwater age dating require measurements of or assumptions about the 14c content of soil carbonates unsaturated zone gas and aquifer carbonates the number of samples and variability of ages solder et al 2019 2018 within the glacial aquifer provide a unique opportunity to test commonly assumed values for these parameters 0 pmc of soil and aquifer carbonates and better refine 14c corrections an inverse geochemical model was developed specifically for recently recharged water and used to track groundwater evolution from rain water chemistry in the soil zone and shallow aquifer coupling of geochemical and isotopic modeling with groundwater age lumped parameter models lpms for young samples 100 years allowed optimized recharge carbonate 14c that combines soil carbonates and shallow aquifer carbonates to be calculated and related to non carbonate tracer based groundwater age values of optimized 14c the solid phase carbonate 14c needed to match geochemically modeled and lpm simulated final 14c averages 71 pmc and is 0 pmc for samples up to 100 years old in the network with the largest spatial extent pas this finding indicates that 14c correction for mixtures of modern and pre modern water need to be carefully parametrized to account for both shallow and deep aquifer carbonate sources the relationship between optimized 14c and mean age was used to guide an iterative multi model approach combining geochemical and age modeling to improve calculated final dic 14c and mean ages for the mixtures to evaluate the inverse geochemical model performance corrected final 14c of dic was calculated for pre modern samples and compared to analytical single sample correction model results comparison of modeling approaches indicates three major findings first the inverse geochemical model provides a reasonable representation of pre modern water even parameterized as an open system we suggest that this is largely a result of groundwater accumulating most dissolved solids relatively close to the water table as modern water in the glacial aquifer while conceptually an open system model might be considered inappropriate as older waters are generally in deeper portions of the aquifer the discrepancies in final corrected dic 14c concentration between the inverse geochemical model and single sample analytical correction for pre modern samples correspond to a difference in groundwater ages 18 27 similar to difference in age from δ13c uncertainty of 5 in soil gas 20 or 3 of carbonate 15 second for the glacial aquifer the typical assumption of 0 pmc solid phase 14c results in dramatic underestimation of the final 14c and overestimation of interpreted groundwater age when final 14c is greater than 80 pmc shallow geochemical processes appear to influence samples even with significant portions of pre modern water this finding is most significant for mixed samples with final 14cs greater than 80 pmc with errors in mean age up to 10 000 s of years and is robust regardless of the estimated solid phase 14c for mixed samples it will be important for future studies to investigate the prevalence of such young carbon signatures for other localities and geochemical conditions finally in systems with distinct mixtures of young and old flow paths a more detailed investigation of 14c corrections is prudent in aquifers such as the glacial with active carbonate geochemistry in the soil zone determination of appropriate 14c corrections need to consider the mixed nature of samples application of analytical correction models that do not account for mixtures of carbon sources dramatically underestimate mean ages and could mask the contribution and age of premodern groundwater in a sample while the results of this study have wide ranging implications in the interpretation of groundwater ages using 14c similar detailed investigation will be limited by practical considerations application of a similar approach to geochemical correction in other studies depends strongly on the range of groundwater ages the number of samples collected and appropriateness of a generalized geochemical model for all samples adaptation of this method and development of new methods for application to smaller scale

5319,estimates of groundwater age based on 14c are often limited by the uncertainty in geochemical processes that alter the 14c concentration measured in water and the composition δ13c and 14c of carbon sources needed to appropriately parametrize 14c adjustment models estimated ages for samples that contain a mixture of young and old groundwater will be particularly sensitive to model parametrization as relatively small additions of modern 14c from recent recharge can mask the presence and amount of old groundwater a novel multi model approach based on inverse geochemical modeling and lumped parameter modeling of age tracers 3h 3hetrit and sf6 was used to better constrain 14c dilution caused by dissolution of carbonates in the unsaturated zone or shallow parts of the glacial aquifer which extends over 2000 miles across the northern contiguous united states calibration of 14c inverse geochemical models to lpm computed 14c concentrations in modern water indicated that 14c of soil zone and shallow aquifer carbonates were not 14c dead 0 pmc as is typically assumed for 14c correction models 14c of such carbonates was on average about 53 pmc ranged 0 110 pmc n 72 this information was used to correct 14c concentrations for water recharged entirely before 1950 and water that is a mixture of pre and post 1950 water the multi model approach developed here was compared to an analytical 14c adjustment model revised fontes and garnier that assumed solid carbonates were 14c dead 14c corrections using the analytical adjustment model tended to over correct final 14c concentrations by 21 pmc and underestimates mean ages by 40 for groundwater mixtures in fact 14c corrections based on analytical model yielded negative ages 14c 120 pmc in nearly 36 of mixed samples this work presents a new approach to constraining 14c corrections and age estimates of mixtures of young and old groundwater the new method is applied to three well networks distributed across the spatially expansive glacial aquifer keywords radiocarbon groundwater age geochemical correction soil processes mixed groundwater sources 1 introduction carbon 14 14c age dating of groundwater is based on correlation of the dissolved inorganic carbon dic 14c to the decayed record of atmospheric 14c concentration over the last 50 000 years intcal13 reimer et al 2013 geochemical processes that otherwise make groundwater appear older than its actual age need to be considered for determination of accurate ages the correction to 14c in dic accounts for dilution of the atmospheric 14c signal by dissolution and isotopic exchange with subsurface carbonates and gases methane or co2 g from organic carbon e g wigley 1975 fontes et al 1978 fontes and garnier 1979 mook 1980 clark and fritz 1997 multiple possible carbon sources with differing isotopic signatures makes correction models difficult to constrain in practice e g horst et al 2008 mcmahon et al 2004 constraining 14c correction models is even more difficult when mixtures of groundwater sources are sampled with the geochemistry of each component influenced by different carbon reservoirs carbon 14 is frequently the only age tracer used for dating groundwater recharged prior to 1950 e g mcmahon et al 2004 horst et al 2008 jurgens et al 2008 bexfield et al 2012 gardner and heilweil 2014 van geldern et al 2014 thus the estimated age of such samples is strongly dependent on the identification of groundwater mixtures and the accuracy of the 14c correction in this study we investigate the influence of dic from differing source zones soil zone and deep saturated aquifer on mixtures of young and old groundwater sample chemistry of relatively young groundwater 100 years was used to estimate 14c activities of recharge zone soil zone and shallow aquifer carbonate results from the modeling of young samples are integrated into a stochiometric and binary mixing geochemical 14c correction approach developed for distinct mixtures of modern post 1950 and pre modern pre 1950 groundwater recharge with varying flow paths travel times and levels of geochemical evolution geochemical correction models which explicitly account for differing recharge sources are compared to single sample approaches that assume no mixing subsurface exchange of dic begins when infiltrating water equilibrated with atmospheric inorganic carbon encounters three primary reservoirs of inorganic carbon in groundwater systems soil gas soil carbonate and aquifer carbonate the modern atmospheric signal of 14c 100 percent modern carbon pmc used for age dating is diluted through dissolution and isotopic exchange with dic reservoirs whose 14c is less than 100 pmc in broad terms these processes occur either in an open system where an unlimited in the context of groundwater dic co2 reservoir is available such as in the unsaturated soil zone or in a closed system below the water table fontes et al 1978 fontes and garnier 1979 han and plummer 2013 analytical single sample 14c correction models have been widely used to correct for the apparent dilution by non atmospheric carbon see kalin 2000 or han and plummer 2016 for a comprehensive review of 14c correction methods these models use a mass balance approach to track major carbon species and or isotopes assuming the geochemistry is dominated by precipitation dissolution and isotopic fractionation according to appropriate exchange process open or closed system full acknowledgement and assessment of the analytical models implicit assumptions is needed to assure proper application accessible documentation and user guidance such as the graphical method of han et al 2012 have made significant contributions toward appropriate application in complex geochemical systems though such as progressive geochemical evolution from open to closed system conditions mixtures of chemically distinct groundwater or systems with reduction and or oxidation of organic carbon assuming a single set of exchange processes may bias estimated groundwater ages mcmahon et al 2004 horst et al 2008 often 14c corrections in such systems are performed using inverse geochemical modeling plummer et al 1994 mcmahon et al 2004 plummer et al 2004 mcmahon et al 2011 which accommodate multiple processes and carbonate sources inverse geochemical codes netpath plummer et al 1994 and phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 are frequently used for this purpose while inverse geochemical modeling is capable of handling mixtures of groundwater from distinct sources the models require the end member chemistry of each source be pre defined for systems in which waters of unknown chemistries are being mixed an alternative approach is needed it is well understood that soil pedogenic carbonates form in isotopic equilibrium with soil zone co2 cerling et al 1991 cerling and quade 1993 and modeling and observation have shown that shallow soil zone co2 14c is near atmospheric levels and decreases with depth e g wang et al 1993 1994 keller and bacon 1998 walvoord et al 2005 wood et al 2014 it is also recognized that atmospheric and soil zone co2 14c have varied on a decadal timescale most recently due to above ground nuclear testing nydal and lövseth 1983 although current atmospheric 14c concentrations have returned to pre bomb levels elevated bomb pulse 14c persist in soil carbonates estimates of soil carbonates turnover times are 100 s to 1000 s of years trumbore et al 1996 gorczyca et al 2013 direct measurement of 14c in speleothems formed in similar processes as pedogenic carbonates confirm that carbonates capture atmospheric co2 14c variations including elevated bomb pulse values hodge et al 2011 in the process of correcting 14c to estimate groundwater age the 14c of soil co2 and carbonates at the time of recharge need be defined as an input for geochemical correction this present an obvious problem as the 14c of soil zone derived dic needed to correct for non atmospheric sources prior to calculation of groundwater age is a function of the soil zone geochemical and isotopic exchanges but also when recharge occurred i e groundwater age relative to the variations in 14c of soil co2 and carbonates the need for a priori definition of 14c source end members means single sample analytical correction methods are under parametrized in cases where modern groundwater is present that could contain elevated 14c from atmospheric and soil sources a poorly conceptualized 14c correction approach in which no contribution of 14c from recharge carbonates are considered could result in large age dating errors particularly for mixed samples which contain a significant fraction of modern water but are reliant upon 14c to estimate age of the old fraction to estimate the influence of shallow 14c sources in mixed samples we extend the inverse modeling of dic 14c in complex mixtures through a novel combination of inverse geochemical and lumped parameter modeling lpm of groundwater age although 14c correction models are rarely applied to modern groundwater once corrected dic 14c activities should directly correspond to the representative atmospheric co2 14c history if the model is appropriately parameterized analysis of multiple modern age tracers e g 3h sf6 3hetrit and dic 14c from modern samples provide a means to test the validity and parametrization of geochemical correction models of shallow processes by assuming that dic 14c of modern groundwater solely reflects the geochemical processes that occurred in the soil zone and shallow aquifer as opposed to radioactive decay we constrain the isotopic composition of soil zone and shallow aquifer carbonates i e recharge carbonates calibrated geochemical models for modern water can then be used to guide development of geochemical inverse models for correction of dic 14c in water recharged before 1950 the goals of inverse geochemical modeling were to assess the relative roles of unsaturated shallow saturated and deep saturated zone processes on overall carbonate geochemistry and to better understand the evolution of the major ion chemistry specifically we set out to define the minimum number of phases mole transfers of defined phases and subsequent dilution and fractionation of δ13c and 14c in water that evolved from precipitation to the groundwater sample chemistry a combination of inverse geochemical modeling phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 isotopic mass balance equations netpathxl parkhurst and charlton 2008 and environmental age tracer modeling tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 were used to calculate corrected final dic 14c needed for age dating we present a comparison between inverse geochemical and analytical model 14c corrections that illustrates the differences between the approaches and provide guidance on appropriate application 2 study area the glacial aquifer system as defined by yager et al 2018 is a series

geochemical 14c correction approach developed for binary mixtures of modern and pre modern groundwater corrected dic 14c results from this study are interpreted to estimate groundwater age and age distributions solder et al 2019 2018 the limited number and nature of environmental age tracers available for these studies restrict the number of end members that can be fully characterized for groundwater age distributions of mixtures 3 1 well networks and chemical analysis three networks of wells in the glacial aquifer system fig 1 were sampled in 2013 and 2014 as a part of the u s geological survey s national water quality assessment nawqa project in this study we leverage the large number of samples and design of the well networks to evaluate groundwater geochemistry the largest well network and primary focus of study is the principal aquifer study pas network the pas was designed to assess water quality conditions for public drinking water supplies across the glacial aquifer system stackelberg 2017 burow and belitz 2014 the 115 wells of the pas generally have relatively long screened intervals 0 6 to 34 m across multiple geologic units and are pumped at high rates 100 s of liters per minute the model support study mss network was designed to provide physical and water quality data in support of a regional groundwater flow model juckem et al 2017 the 29 wells of the mss are mixed use and have relatively short screened intervals 0 6 to 13 m in shallow and deep portions of the aquifer targeting specific geologic units one of the public supply wells in the mss is also in the pas well number glacpas1 45 and is reported on in the pas section the flow path survey fps network is designed to assess the geochemical evolution of water quality in central wisconsin tesoriero et al 2007 saad 2008 the 25 wells of the fps are multi level monitoring wells along an approximate flow path saad 2008 with short screened intervals less than1 m well depths in a very general sense decrease from the pas to the mss network with the shallowest wells being in the fps network water samples from the well networks were analyzed for a broad suite of inorganic and organic constituents as well as environmental tracers arnold et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 in this study we utilize the major ion chemistry inorganic carbonate chemistry and environmental tracer concentrations of tritium 3h sulfur hexafluoride sf6 tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit and carbon 14 14c of dic not all tracers were collected at every well 3h samples were collected in dry 500 ml high density

interpreted through the closed equilibrium ce model or the unfractionated air ua model aeschbach hertig et al 2000 nobel gas samples were collected in copper tube weiss 1968 with preparation and analysis conducted by the usgs dissolved noble gas laboratory in denver co 14c samples were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles by flushing filtered water 0 45 µm from the bottom of the bottle up with a minimum of three consecutive bottle volumes and then immediately sealed samples were prepared and analyzed by the national ocean sciences accelerator mass spectrometry facility nosams at woods hole oceanographic institute a detection limit of 0 2 pmc was adopted for this study based on the average reported analytical error specifics of sample processing analytical procedures and information on reference standards can be found at http www whoi edu nosams home the corrected dic 14c results presented here and other environmental tracers are used to estimate groundwater age distributions in the glacial aquifer using lumped parameter models jurgens et al 2012 selection of the most suitable age distribution i e lpm is based on multiple lines of evidence including the conceptual hydrogeology based on geologic maps and well logs measured tracer concentrations and lpm results in an iterative process complete detail of final tracer concentrations and estimated groundwater ages are provided in a usgs data release solder et al 2018 for this study modern and pre modern water is defined as groundwater that was wholly recharged after 1950 or before 1950 respectively these modern or pre modern samples are best described by a single lpm and have unimodal age distributions mixtures are identified to have a component of modern and pre modern water and are represented by a binary mixture of two lpms and have bimodal age distributions as the binary mixture components may not strictly adhere to the above definitions of modern and pre modern the two end member components are referred to as young and old for clarity 3 2 lithology and mineralogy mineralogical composition of the soil and aquifer material is the primary constraint on the geochemical evolution of groundwater the regional glacial aquifer incorporates a broad range of bedrock parent materials fig b 4 soller et al 2012 yager et al 2018 but the majority of pas network well sites are screened in glacial materials derived from clastic sedimentary or marine carbonate rock 69 and 21 of 115 sites respectively additional data such as soil mineralogy smith et al 2014 soil chemistry soil survey staff and surficial geology soller et al 2012 were considered during geochemical conceptualization and inverse model phase selection supporting information a 3 3 carbon 14 geochemical model development the 14c geochemical modeling approach of this study is a multi model and multi step process the framework for the geochemical modeling process is first outlined here with specific details and examples in the following sections complete model input chemistry and output results are presented in the associated usgs data release solder and jurgens 2018 groundwater and soil chemistry lithology previous geochemical studies and iterative modeling of modern samples were used to develop an inverse geochemical model that represents shallow geochemical processes the model was kept generalized to accommodate mixed and pre modern groundwater samples ostensibly sampled from deeper portions of the aquifer which would have undergone similar shallow geochemical processes as the modern samples mole transfers determined by the inverse geochemical model were used as input to isotopic mass balance calculations to determine the final corrected dic 14c for groundwater age estimation as the dic 14c concentration of modern samples is unaffected by radio decay an optimization method was used to calculate the appropriate recharge carbonate 14c optimized recharge carbonate 14c was evaluated on the match between the inverse geochemical modeled and lpm predicted 14c of dic the results from inverse geochemical modeling of the modern samples were then used to guide geochemical modeling of the mixtures and pre modern samples for mixed samples an iterative process between geochemical and isotopic mass balance models and age lpm was conducted final corrected dic 14c for mixed and pre modern samples were used as a fitted tracer in lpm estimated mean ages and age distributions solder et al 2018 2019 3 3 1 inverse geochemical and isotopic mass balance model the goal of inverse geochemical modeling was to define the minimum number of phases and mole transfers of said phases that adequately represent shallow geochemical processes that explain the major ionic evolution from precipitation to modern sampled waters inverse geochemical modeling was performed using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 calculations of mineral speciation and saturation indices of groundwater table a 1 of the supplemental information guided conceptualization of the glacial aquifer geochemical system saturation index si of a given phase indicates the deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium with positive values indicating over saturation i e conditions favorable to precipitation and negative values indicate under saturation i e conditions favorable to dissolution soil characteristics geology previous geochemical studies in the region e g busby et al 1991 eberts and george 2001 williams et al 2007 and iterative geochemical modeling of modern samples were used to select appropriate phases and parameterize the inverse geochemical model the initial chemistry was defined by precipitation chemistry based on wet deposition measurements collected by the national atmospheric deposition program nadp the major geochemical processes were conceptualized to be plant transpiration and respiration soil gas exchange with the atmosphere dissolution of carbonate minerals and gypsum weathering of silicate minerals and redox reactions associated with the reduction of dissolved oxygen and applied fertilizer facilitated by oxidation of organic carbon the model included co2 g to account for carbonate dissolution reactions occurring in the unsaturated zone inverse geochemical model phases are presented in table 1 individual model solutions mole transfers required to evolve rainwater to sample chemistry were checked for coherency models with abnormally large or unrealistic co2 g and cation exchange mole transfers 5 8 mmol were excluded from final model selections the measured dic and δ13c isotopic balance constraints in phreeqc modeling help limit the number of models with excessive carbonate dissolution models were also limited to soil carbonate dissolution of calcite only or calcite and dolomite de dolomitization dissolution of dolomite and precipitation of calcite and dissolution of dolomite only were not considered given conditions to initiate carbonate precipitation si 10 as suggested by herman and lorah 1987 macpherson et al 2008 were not observed table a 1 of the supplemental information and calcite is much more soluble than dolomite log k 8 48 and 17 09 at 25 c respectively nordstrom et al 1990 for silicate mineral weathering a single plagioclase composition was used as an approximate composition an38ab62 from phreeqc documentation potential reduction of fertilizer nh4no3 and organic carbon ch2o were allowed based on the low dissolved oxygen arnold et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 and modest reduction potential estimated pe 1 7 of some sites it is acknowledged that a single set of geochemical reactions and isotopic ratios cannot completely capture the chemical evolution of all the sampled waters given the large spatial extent of the glacial aquifer uncertainty in phreeqc model inputs e g groundwater sample and rainwater chemistry was generally set to 10 n 86 an uncertainty of 20 in sample chemistry was used at 8 sites and an uncertainty of 30 was used at one site solder and jurgens 2018 the uncertainty parameter in phreeqc allows variation in the water chemistry within the set limits and was required at the select sites for the solver to converge the need for uncertainty adjustments is likely a reflection of the generalized nature of the inverse model and geochemical spatial variability not the true uncertainty in the chemical analysis corrected dic 14c was determined by inputting mole transfers from inverse geochemical modeling into isotopic mass balance equations netpathxl parkhurst and charlton 2008 soil zone co2 and carbonate δ13c 20 5 was based on previously measured values cerling et al 1991 cerling and quade 1993 solid phase carbonate δ13c value of 0 was assumed for deep aquifer carbonate as is common in marine derived carbonates keith and weber 1964 solid phase 14c of recharge carbonate soil zone and shallow aquifer was determined through modeling of modern samples as discussed later and the deep saturated aquifer carbonate 14c was set to 0 or 30 pmc as a simplifying assumption soil co2 14c was held constant at 100 pmc as is frequently assumed han and plummer 2016 a combination of historical atmospheric 14c variability most recently from above ground nuclear testing nydal and lövseth 1983 phillips et al 2013 and the fact that soil carbonate isotopic composition is depth dependent and affected by multiple non linear processes e g productivity soil respiration rate soil development and chemistry wang et al 1993 1994 walvoord et al 2005 makes it difficult to constrain co2 14c in the soil zone a value of 100 pmc is generally considered valid for pre modern groundwater and this assumption only effects the modern samples as explained in further detail in the discussion section the initial 14c of dic e g at the water table corrected for addition of non atmospheric dic was calculated by averaging the adjusted initial dic 14c of select inverse and isotopic model realizations for a given site prior to input or comparison to lpm the adjusted initial dic 14c 14co must be transformed to the adjusted final dic 14c 14cf which represents the dic 14c at the point of sample collection modified from jurgens et al 2014 as 1 14 c f a o 14 c t 14 c o where ao is the assumed initial 14c of dic prior to geochemical reaction and 14ct is the measured 14c of total dic in the sample ao is assumed to be 100 pmc for consistency with the soil zone 14c used for isotopic mass balance calculations 3 3 2 inverse geochemical modeling of modern samples inverse geochemical modeling was first conducted on pas samples with mean age less than 120 years n 38 with good agreement between tracers solder et al 2018 2019 and where the hydrogeology is understood these results were used to establish a relationship between estimated mean age and bulk solid phase 14c of the soil zone and shallow aquifer i e recharge carbonate to predict the extent of geochemical evolution and the 14c of dic in the young component of groundwater mixtures single lpms of groundwater age were fit to measured concentrations of tracers 3h 3hetrit and sf6 these lpms were then used to compute the 14c concentration of the sample that would be expected if the sample had not undergone geochemical alteration or dilution i e atmospheric 14c because the groundwater age tracers 3h 3hetrit and sf6 are not affected by carbonate reactions and because the amount of 14c decay half life 5 730 years in modern samples is nearly zero the difference between the measured 14c and the computed 14c from the lpm provides an independent estimate of the potential dilution or geochemical correction of the 14c the computed 14c concentration from the lpms can therefore be used to optimize the recharge carbonate 14c this approach was also used for the fps network since samples were not strictly collected from the water table end member values derived from geochemical modeling of the selected samples represent both unsaturated zone and shallow aquifer carbonate geochemistry as a bulk parameter as previously discussed 14c of soil co2 is difficult to define a priori for this work a soil co2 14c value of 100 pmc was assumed carbon 14 of soil co2 can be higher or lower than 100 pmc e g bacon and keller 1998 walvoord et al 2005 wood et al 2014 depending on inputs from the atmosphere soil respiration rate and organic matter decomposition gillon et al 2012 and varies over shorter time scales than 14c of soil carbonate trumbore et al 1996 gorczyca et al 2013 temporal variability of soil co2 14c could not be appropriately constrained and was not considered in this study optimized 14c for recharge carbonates estimated in this study will have higher uncertainty for samples that had soil co2 14c above or below 100 pmc at the time of recharge the co2 δ13c is well constrained by measured data cerling et al 1991 cerling and quade 1993 and solid phase δ13c by marine carbonates present in deep portions of the aquifer keith and weber 1964 while soil carbonates can have much lighter δ13c values than 0 e g cerling et al 1991 cerling and quade 1993 an assumed value of 0 provides a lower bound for 14cf e g maximum likely groundwater age while there is some conceptual limitation to this approach resulting from the variance in δ13c values between the soil and shallow aquifer inorganic carbon reservoirs we expect that this simplifying assumption does not detract from the primary findings of this study the optimal recharge carbonate 14c was calculated for selected samples by varying the solid phase 14c in the geochemical model to match inverse isotopic model calculated 14cf to lpm simulated 14cf this can be formally described by rearrangement of the carbon isotope mass balance of wigley 1975 and plummer et al 1994 using the selected inverse geochemical model phases the carbon mass balance is 2 c t c o d c s d c c o 2 d c om where ct is the total measured dic co is initial dic prior to geochemical reaction primarily from atmospheric sources and dc is carbon mole transfer with subscripts s co2 and om indicating solid gas or organic matter carbon phase the isotopic mass balance can be described for 14c as 3 14 c t 14 c o d c s 14 c s 0 2 ε s b d c c o 2 14 c c o 2 0 2 ε c o 2 b d c om 14 c om 0 2 ε om b c m where 14c indicates the 14c isotopic ratio for the given phase and ε is the fraction factor between the respective phases indicated by subscript the subscript b indicates the dissolved bicarbonate phase rearranging and substituting in equation 1 results in 4 14 c s a o 14 c t 14 c f d c c o 2 14 c c o 2 0 2 ε c o 2 b d c om 14 c om 0 2 ε om b 14 c t c t d c s 0 2 ε s b for the mss well network valid inverse geochemical models were not found as further discussed in the results section accordingly a single sample analytical solution revised version of fontes and garnier 1979 as reported by han and plummer 2013 was used to correct dic 14c for mss network samples for selected samples with mean ages less than 110 years a procedure like the one described above for the pas and fps networks was used to determine the mss network specific relationship between optimized recharge carbonate 14c and lpm estimated mean age for estimation of the optimized recharge carbonate 14c according to the analytical correction equation 22 from han and plummer 2013 is rearranged as 5 14 c s 14 c o c s c t 14 c s c b c t 14 c b x δ 13 c s δ 13 c b ε s b δ 13 c t c s c t δ 13 c s c b c t δ 13 c b 14 c b 0 2 ε s b combining a re arranged equation 1 and equation 5 results in 6 14 c s

phase unsaturated zone gas δ13c was set to 22 for analytical modeling an intermediate value of the allowable range from inverse models section 3 3 1 3 4 integrated geochemical and lumped parameter modeling of mixed samples 14cf of mixed samples were calculated by integrating lpm age estimates of the young component and results from geochemical modeling of selected young samples preliminary lpm estimates of the mean ages of the two mixing components young and old and mixing ratio f was used in the first iteration of a carbonate binary mixing model the mixing model was used to determine a bulk solid 14c which includes contributions form recharge carbonate 14c and deep saturated carbonate 14c the simple linear mixing model is defined as 7 14 c s 14 c yng f 14 c old 1 f the relationship between optimized recharge carbonate 14c and estimated age section 3 3 2 was used to assign a value of 14c to the young fraction of the mixture 14cyng the solid phase 14c of the old fraction 14cold was set to either 0 or 30 pmc the conceptual upper limit of 30 pmc for 14cold is chosen based on that up to 30 modern water is captured in pre modern samples according modeled age distributions solder et al 2018 2019 and moden water is assumed to be contributing 100 pmc dic in reality it is not expected that aquifer carbonates contain 30 pmc but instead the solid phase 14cold parameter is meant to capture the range of possible recharge carbonate 14c contributions from the old groundwater component the preliminary mixing ratio was calculated in the lpm assuming an old component mean age of 10 000 years this value was used only as a starting point for subsequent calculations and iterations the initial estimate of bulk 14cs from the carbonate binary mixing model eq 7 is input to the geochemical modeling scheme eq 3 and the resulting 14cf is input to lpm to calculate a new old component mean age and mixing ratio it is important to note that the estimated mean age of the young component and thus 14cyng does not change as the bulk 14cs of the mixture and the mixing ratio are codependent the geochemical and lumped parameter model process was performed iteratively until the lpm mixing ratio changed by less than 5 between iterations two values of 14cf are reported for the mixed samples based on assumed 14c of 0 or 30 pmc for the deep aquifer carbonates solder and jurgens 2018 while one 14cf value was chosen for the final interpreted age based on surrounding sites other tracer concentrations and the judgement of the hydrologist conducting the age analysis 3 5 geochemical modeling of pre modern samples the inverse geochemical models developed for modern water in the pas network were used to model the mole transfers required to evolve precipitation to the chemistry of the pre modern waters in the pas well network n 20 solder et al 2018 14cf values determined through inverse geochemical and isotopic mass balance calculations were input to lpm in the cases pas 9 mss where there was not a valid phreeqc model i e solver did not converge or unreasonable geochemical model the analytical correction model was applied han and plummer 2013 aquifer solid 14c was varied between 0 and 30 pmc for both inverse and analytical modeling meaning two values of 14cf are reported for pre modern samples solder and jurgens 2018 while one corrected value was chosen for the final interpreted age 3 6 comparison of inverse to analytical geochemical models as a final evaluation of the geochemical modeling a comparison was made between the inverse geochemical modeling results where available and analytical model results for samples of this study the analytical model was parameterized as if no additional knowledge of the system from inverse modeling was available same as for inverse modeling δ13c of aquifer solids and unsaturated zone gas 0 and 22 respectively were used the purpose of this comparison was to examine how differences in modeling approach with the inverse geochemical model accounting for organic carbon transfers and other mass balance considerations not captured in the analytical model and assumed 14c of recharge and aquifer carbonates affect 14cf values 4 results the need for geochemical correction of 14c in the glacial aquifer was indicated by comparison of measured 3h 3hetrit sf6 and 14c from all pas wells to lpm simulated tracer concentrations fig 2 relationships between 3h 3hetrit an sf6 showed that many samples were comprised of water that was wholly recharged after 1950 measured data groups around atmospheric input curves fig 2 however the measured 14c for most modern samples was less than expected atmospheric 14c values i e greater than or equal to 100 pmc although 3h deposition varies significantly across the glacial aquifer system largely as a result of variations in latitude and distance from the ocean displayed by varying input curves in fig 2 differences in 3h deposition alone cannot explain the discrepancy between the modern tracers 3h 3hetrit sf6 and measured 14c in other words concentrations of 3h 3hetrit and sf6 in modern samples do not appear to be diluted by mixing with pre modern tracer free groundwater in the glacial aquifer helium isotopes such as low terrigenic helium 4 and helium 3 to helium 4 isotopic ratios close to atmospheric ratios solder et al 2018 also indicate short residence times and limited crustal helium accumulation further supporting the lack of modern tracer dilution in the modern samples therefore the disagreement between measured 14c of modern samples to estimated atmospheric 14c at the time of recharge e g 80 of modern samples have 14c less than 100 pmc is most likely from geochemical dilution of dic 14c from soil and aquifer carbonates these findings indicate shallow geochemical processes have an apparent significant effect on dic 14c in the study area geochemical corrections to all the measured 14c concentrations in the glacial aquifer must be performed before use in determining mean groundwater ages fig 2 measured tritium 3h tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit sulphur hexafloride sf6 and carbon 14 14c of pas network

tracer input curves from jurgens et al 2012 and michel et al 2018 2 column color phreeqc speciation and si calculations table a 1 of the supplemental information indicate bicarbonate is the dominant anion in most samples exceptions being one sample in montana dominated by so4 and 9 samples in new england dominated by cl and that the mineral phases of calcite dolomite and gypsum are generally under saturated si less than 0 these phases are likely important sources of major ion chemistry and many groundwater samples can be explained by the following equation 6 cac o 3 c a m g c o 3 2 c a s o 4 3 h 2 c o 3 3 c a 2 m g 2 s o 4 2 6 h c o 3 which indicates a molar ratio of 1 75 hco3 so4 2 to 1 ca2 mg2 fig 3 a several pre modern samples notably fall far to the right of the 1 75 1 line but most samples fall along the line and there is little distinction between age classes pre modern samples falling to the right of the line are grouped in western montana and the dakotas and are likely influenced by additional gypsum dissolution previously reported as a significant process in the area by busby et al 1991 comparison of total dissolved inorganic carbon tdic to 3h fig 3b similarly shows little distinction between age class suggesting that most of the dissolution processes that increase dic occur in the shallow portions of the aquifer in fact tdic appears to be more strongly influenced by spatial location and hydrogeology than by groundwater age fig 3c localized processes driving the increase in tdic may be masked by the aggregation of data over the large spatial extent

solutions deemed geochemically reasonable were defined for 38 of the 58 modern samples and 33 of the 57 mixtures and pre modern samples in the pas network inverse geochemical modeling of the mss samples was generally unsuccessful with the model converging on geochemically reasonable solutions for only 8 of the 29 samples inverse modeling of the fps network wells was successful with the model converging for 24 of the 25 samples model results are summarized here with complete results available in the associated usgs data release solder and jurgens 2018 mean mole transfers from select models for each sample network table 2 illustrate likely geochemical processes and possible limitations of the generalized inverse model the mean values do not represent a valid inverse model with balanced stoichiometry and are presented here to facilitate discussion positive values indicate dissolution and negative values indicate precipitation inverse model results table 2 show similar mole transfers of carbonates silicate minerals and gypsum for pre modern mixed and modern samples this further supports that most dissolved constituents are acquired from soil zone and shallow aquifer geochemical reactions before entering the deeper groundwater system 4 2 inverse modeling optimized solid phase 14c for modern samples optimized 14cs of young 100 years samples from the pas network range from 25

5 pmc table a 2 of the supplemental information the spatial pattern of optimized 14cs is somewhat coherent fig 4b indicating that in addition to age the local geochemical conditions are a significant influence on 14cs in the recharge zone while it was previously argued that age class was not a good indicator of geochemical evolution e g fig 3b results from the fps network covering a small spatial region fig 1 with relatively homogenous geochemical conditions suggest modern samples do indeed follow a geochemical evolutionary path of increasing influence of saturated aquifer carbonate 14c on dic

aquifer tracers of modern groundwater 3h 3hetrit and sf6 did not follow dilution or mixing patterns expected for addition of an older tracer free source of groundwater this observation indicated that measured dic 14c in young groundwater which was frequently much less than 100 pmc has been substantially altered by geochemical reactions in the soil zone and shallow aquifer i e recharge zone previous geochemical investigations in the glacial aquifer busby et al 1991 eberts and george 2001 williams et al 2007 support this finding calcite dolomite and gypsum saturation indices less than 0 at most sites table a 1 of the supplemental information indicate conditions favorable to mineral dissolution measured ion concentrations fig 3 and inverse geochemical modeling of groundwater samples table 2 indicated that carbonate and gypsum eq 6 dissolution were the most significant reactions controlling major ion chemistry given the glacial aquifer s broad spatial extent and variability in groundwater chemistry convergence of the generalized inverse model for well over half of all pas samples 71 of 115 is considered a success and indicates the model is a reasonable representation of the dominant geochemical processes given that the fps network wells are completed in shallow portions of the aquifer model convergence for 24 of 25 samples indicates there is good representation of soil zone and shallow aquifer geochemical processes average mole transfers table 2 while not representative of a valid stoichiometric model provide a basis for discussion of the geochemical evolution of groundwater it is important to remember each model represents rainwater geochemically evolved through phase transfers to the final sample concentrations rather than sequentially from modern to pre modern of interest for this study a trend of increasing carbon transfer calcite dolomite co2 gas and organic carbon ch2o from mixed to modern and finally pre modern samples is observed assuming groundwater age is vertically stratified the results are consistent with regional observations of lowest carbonate and co2 concentrations at intermediate depths macpherson 2009 the appearance of limited dolomite dissolution is a result of selecting models with calcite only or calcite and dolomite dissolution as a simplifying assumption as discussed in the methods section for some samples phreeqc found multiple versions of the same inverse model where reduction of organic carbon ch2o was substituted for co2 dissolution which could indicate that soil gas co2 may be at least partly derived from decomposition of organic matter in some parts of the glacial aquifer net dissolution of fertilizer and ex solution of nh3 gas suggest some sites evolved from o2 to no3 reduction relatively consistent mole transfers of plagioclase and biotite from modern and pre modern samples indicates weathering of these minerals occurs in shallow portions of the aquifer increased mole transfers from modern to pre modern samples of potassium feldspar is consistent with the slow rate of silicate weathering and increased bicarbonate in pre modern samples fig 3a clay mineral illite and kaolinite precipitation exhibits a similar trend to silicate mineral dissolution indicating the linkage between silicate weathering and clay formation cation exchange of calcium cax and sodium nax show negative transfers while magnesium mgx potassium kx show positive transfers with an increase in these trends from modern to pre modern waters transfer of na out of the aqueous phase is possibly a result from excess sodium from the dissolution of halite required to balance chloride concentrations or uncertainty in the assumed plagioclase composition the transfer of mg and k cations into the aqueous phase suggests possible underestimation of dolomite and biotite dissolution or the model is missing an additional mg and k bearing mineral e g hornblende or phyllosilicates such as glauconite and phlogopite the generalized inverse geochemical model presented here has utility in capturing general trends and investigating the carbon isotopes but should not be applied for understanding detailed geochemistry of a specific site for example the inability of the model to capture mss well chemistry 21 of 29 models failed to converge suggests locally distinct geochemical processes control the water chemistry poor model fit for the 8 mss models is exemplified by large cation exchange transfers often 10 mmol solder and jurgens 2018 the short screened intervals of mss wells in targeted hydrogeologic units likely need specifically tailored models such detailed investigation is outside the scope of this work generalized models such as the one presented here need to be carefully applied to avoid overinterpretation optimized 14cs of select young pas network samples are statistically correlated to mean age kendall s τ 0 35 p 0 002 and are greater than 0 pmc in samples up to 100 years old table a 2 of the supplemental information fig 4 a 14co of approximately 86 pmc is indicated by inverse modeling results corresponding to a 14 dilution of atmospheric carbon prior to recharge past the water table the influence of recharge zone geochemistry is apparent for 100 years before dissolution of carbon dead aquifer carbonates obscures the effects of the recharge zone carbon sources comparison of lpm predicted 14c and measured δ13c of dic to geochemical model estimated values table a 2 of the supplemental information solder and jurgens 2018 is favorable with root mean square errors rmse of 3 5 and 0 25 respectively three samples glacpas1 17 19 61 drive the overall error where optimized recharge 14cs is 100 pmc this value may be too low if bomb pulse 14c pmc 100 was present in the recharge zone carbonates or gas gillon et al 2012 in the fps network a statistically significant trend between optimized recharge 14c and mean age kendall s τ 0 44 p 0 004 and 14co of about 78 pmc was found the ability of the generalized inverse model to capture fps chemistry 24 of 25 sites and the similarity of optimized recharge 14cs and 14co to pas network results table a 2 of the supplemental information provide additional evidence that the model is a reasonable representation of shallow geochemical processes young sample geochemical model results are important for subsequent modeling in the glacial aquifer in two ways first the least squares best fit of optimized 14cs to age was used to estimate the young water contribution to the bulk 14cs of mixtures for the pas network spatial variation of geochemical conditions may partially account for the apparent relationship between age of modern samples and optimized 14cs but results for fps network samples with similar geochemical conditions across the network suggest that 14cs can reliably be related to age of modern samples while the relationship between optimized 14cs and age has limitations across the large pas network explicit accounting of the geochemical complexity of groundwater mixtures is an important methodological deviation from previous work bulk final 14cs of mixed samples ranging from 21 to 67 pmc for pas network samples fig 4a table a 3 of the supplemental information indicating widely variable influence of shallow geochemistry where bulk 14cs of mss network samples are generally lower 4 44 pmc table a 3 of the supplemental information possible a result of local hydrogeology and well design these results differ significantly from commonly assumed correction model 14cs parameter value of 0 pmc secondly the relationship between optimized recharge 14cs and estimated mean age of young samples suggested that considering a range of 14cs 0 to 30 pmc for the deep aquifer is worthwhile in reality solid carbonates in the deep part of the aquifer are radiocarbon dead but comparison of 14cf of this study and the single sample analytical correction table a 4 of the supplemental information show the separate methods are in modest agreement 10 percent for most pre modern samples and mixed samples when a solid phase concentration of 30 pmc is assumed fig 5a for pre modern samples average percent error in 14c based lpm age between the two approaches is 21 and 16 for 0 and 30 pmc respectively for context an uncertainty in soil gas δ13c of 5 or carbonate δ13c of 3 results in an average percent error in apparent age of 22 and 11 respectively this indicates that recharge zone geochemistry may have a similar influence on 14cf of pre modern samples as appropriate estimation of isotopic end members for traditional correction methods the difference in model approaches is more notable for mixtures with the analytical method resulting in an over corrected 14cf 120 pmc particularly when assuming 0 pmc 14cs in the analytical model fig 5a disagreement between approaches is magnified when 14cf is greater than 80 pmc although lpm estimated mean ages and old component ages of mixtures do not show a clear trend with respect to 14cs or 14cf table a 4 of the supplemental information significant differences in mixture mean ages between model approaches average percent errors of 53 and 48 for 0 and 30 pmc respectively emphasize the importance of explicit accounting for the distinct geochemistry of groundwater mixtures table a 4 of the supplemental information keeping in mind that the two approaches are within normal uncertainty bounds for pre modern samples the indiscriminate use of an inappropriate or poorly parametrized 14c correction model for mixed samples has potentially disastrous effect on modeled mean ages the broader significance of this finding explicitly the pronounced disagreement between accounting for the mixed chemistry whether using the inverse model or analytical model and the single sample method is that even though a binary mixture may not be an appropriate conceptualization nearly all groundwater samples are a mixture of flow paths a quick comparison of mean 14cf from previous regional studies to the select result of this study shows tailored inverse geochemical models for montana and the dakotas 24 8 pmc busby et al 1991 and 35 3 pmc plummer et al 1991 reasonably match with the approach of this study 40 1 pmc with the difference likely associated with assumed solid phase 14c conversely previous study results from the michigan and wisconsin using single sample analytical corrections 33 pmc wen et al 2016 47 6 pmc simpkins and bradbury 1992 and 46 7 pmc ma et al 2004 are dramatically over corrected compared to select results of this study 102 93 and 89 pmc respectively while this comparison is limited by the small number of samples that are not necessarily the same groundwater it illustrates an important difference in conceptual approach between assuming all old groundwater or some mixture of groundwater ages in the glacial aquifer relatively small but meaningful fractions of post 1950 recharge can be present in groundwater with relatively old mean ages solder et al 2019 2018 meaning use of the single sample correction model should be carefully evaluated while an admittedly generalized approach was needed to fit such a broad range of geochemical conditions of this study such investigations may provide valuable insight to aquifer geochemistry in other regions for the glacial aquifer pas network the influence of shallow geochemical processes in relatively old groundwater was surprising one possible explanation is the overall hydrogeology and network design as an unconfined and relatively shallow aquifer 10 s of meters yager et al 2018 with long screened intervals promotes the capture of shallow and modern flow paths along with deep pre modern groundwater it is also curious that additional complexity of the inverse model such as representation of silicate mineral weathering and redox processes is somewhat compensated for by adjusting the solid phase 14c concentration in the single sample analytical model these findings might be the reflection of spatial extent and the dominance of carbonate dissolution of glacial aquifer chemistry but similar study of a variety of hydrogeologic and geochemical conditions is needed to confirm these findings 6 conclusion carbon 14 corrections for groundwater age dating require measurements of or assumptions about the 14c content of soil carbonates unsaturated zone gas and aquifer carbonates the number of samples and variability of ages solder et al 2019 2018 within the glacial aquifer provide a unique opportunity to test commonly assumed values for these parameters 0 pmc of soil and aquifer carbonates and better refine 14c corrections an inverse geochemical model was developed specifically for recently recharged water and used to track groundwater evolution from rain water chemistry in the soil zone and shallow aquifer coupling of geochemical and isotopic modeling with groundwater age lumped parameter models lpms for young samples 100 years allowed optimized recharge carbonate 14c that combines soil carbonates and shallow aquifer carbonates to be calculated and related to non carbonate tracer based groundwater age values of optimized 14c the solid phase carbonate 14c needed to match geochemically modeled and lpm simulated final 14c averages 71 pmc and is 0 pmc for samples up to 100 years old in the network with the largest spatial extent pas this finding indicates that 14c correction for mixtures of modern and pre modern water need to be carefully parametrized to account for both shallow and deep aquifer carbonate sources the relationship between optimized 14c and mean age was used to guide an iterative multi model approach combining geochemical and age modeling to improve calculated final dic 14c and mean ages for the mixtures to evaluate the inverse geochemical model performance corrected final 14c of dic was calculated for pre modern samples and compared to analytical single sample correction model results comparison of modeling approaches indicates three major findings first the inverse geochemical model provides a reasonable representation of pre modern water even parameterized as an open system we suggest that this is largely a result of groundwater accumulating most dissolved solids relatively close to the water table as modern water in the glacial aquifer while conceptually an open system model might be considered inappropriate as older waters are generally in deeper portions of the aquifer the discrepancies in final corrected dic 14c concentration between the inverse geochemical model and single sample analytical correction for pre modern samples correspond to a difference in groundwater ages 18 27 similar to difference in age from δ13c uncertainty of 5 in soil gas 20 or 3 of carbonate 15 second for the glacial aquifer the typical assumption of 0 pmc solid phase 14c results in dramatic underestimation of the final 14c and overestimation of interpreted groundwater age when final 14c is greater than 80 pmc shallow geochemical processes appear to influence samples even with significant portions of pre modern water this finding is most significant for mixed samples with final 14cs greater than 80 pmc with errors in mean age up to 10 000 s of years and is robust regardless of the estimated solid phase 14c for mixed samples it will be important for future studies to investigate the prevalence of such young carbon signatures for other localities and geochemical conditions finally in systems with distinct mixtures of young and old flow paths a more detailed investigation of 14c corrections is prudent in aquifers such as the glacial with active carbonate geochemistry in the soil zone determination of appropriate 14c corrections need to consider the mixed nature of samples application of analytical correction models that do not account for mixtures of carbon sources dramatically underestimate mean ages and could mask the contribution and age of premodern groundwater in a sample while the results of this study have wide ranging implications in the interpretation of groundwater ages using 14c similar detailed investigation will be limited by practical considerations application of a similar approach to geochemical correction in other studies depends strongly on the range of groundwater ages the number of samples collected and appropriateness of a generalized geochemical model for all samples adaptation of this method and development of new methods for application to smaller scale
