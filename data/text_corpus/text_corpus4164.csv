20820,for pile supported structures scour is a major threat as it removes soils around foundations and causes structural damages scour effects on the performance of the pile foundation have been well studied however most of these studies are focused on lateral responses of single piles while very limited research is focused on lateral responses of pile groups therefore prevailing design standards only recommend scour design procedures for single piles here we proposed an improved analytical method iam to analyze laterally loaded pile groups considering various scour hole dimensions the iam was validated against the results of 3d finite element fe models calibrated against a full scale load test a series of parametric analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of scour hole depth scour hole slope angle sand relative density pile spacing number of piles and pile group configuration on both post scour vertical effective stresses and lateral responses of pile groups based on the iam a simple practical approach called the influence depth method idm was also developed for use in routine design the feasibility of applying the standard methods for the scoured pile groups was evaluated by comparing them with the 3d fe analyses and the proposed methods iam and idm keywords pile group lateral capacity vertical effective stress scour hole depth scour hole slope angle 1 introduction scour is a process of soil removal caused by waves currents and ship propeller jets etc chin et al 1996 whitehouse 1998 which decreases the soil resistance to the foundation it is a major cause for intolerable stresses in offshore structures watson 1974 and bridge collapse worldwide briaud 2015 coleman and melville 2001 liang et al 2017 mueller and wagner 2005 zhang et al 2015 scour includes general scour that causes a uniform decrease in mudline elevation across a riverbed or a seabed and local scour that causes a localized decrease in mudline elevation primarily located at piles for a pile group local scour can be further classified into global scour shallow wide depression across the pile group and localized pit steep sided pits located at individual piles in the past decades the mechanisms and characteristics of scour at pile groups in different flow conditions have been extensively investigated by flume tests amini et al 2012 ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 ji et al 2018 lança et al 2013 liang et al 2017 l ma et al 2018b ni et al 2021 sheppard 2003 solaimani et al 2017 sumer et al 2005 sumer and fredsøe 1998 wang et al 2016 yagci et al 2017 yifan yang et al 2020a yifan yang et al 2020a and field surveys bayram and larson 2000 palmer 1969 sun et al 2007 moreover numerical simulations based on computational fluid dynamics are adopted to investigate complex flow structures in different pile groups hamidi and siadatmousavi 2018 kim et al 2014 liang et al 2019 wang et al 2017 q zhang et al 2017b as indicated by these studies scour at a pile group is rather complicated compared to that at a single isolated pile due to hydraulic group effects and a greater detailed review of the scour hole characteristics of pile group is presented in section 2 currently there is no generally accepted practical approach for determining pile vertical or lateral capacity under local scour conditions probably due to uncertainty in characterizing sizes and shapes of scour holes at piles or pile groups and lack of considering scour induced changes in soil stress history lin and wu 2019 in design practices estimation of vertical effective stress of soils around piles is required before calculation of pile capacities however the prevailing standards such as american petroleum institute api 2011 u s federal highway administration drilled shaft fwha ds brown et al 2010 and driven pile fhwa dp patrick et al 2016 specify inconsistent approaches to computing the vertical effective stress under local scour conditions termed as post scour vertical effective stress the different calculations of post scour vertical effective stress would lead to a discrepancy of the calculated pile axial or lateral capacity and thus confuse practicing engineers when designing pile foundations against scour damage to improve the standard methods both closed form solutions derived from boussinesq s solution lin and jiang 2019 lin and wu 2019 and numerical solution using mindlin s solution h zhang et al 2017a are developed to estimate the post scour vertical effective stress which are further used to calculate the axial or lateral capacity of scoured single piles the drawbacks of these solutions and standard methods api fwha ds and fhwa dp are that they are recommended only for single piles however piles are commonly installed in groups rather than single piles and scour effects are more severe in pile groups than single piles as a result of the double group effect lin and lin 2020 geotechnical group effect that reduces the pile capacity of individual piles in a group as compared with the single isolated piles and hydraulic group effect that intensifies the flow in a pile group as compared with a single isolated pile despite its importance research concerning the capacities of scoured pile groups is highly scarce for example as of this writing there are only one experimental study and two numerical studies reported on the investigation into the local scour effects on the behavior of pile groups liang et al 2020 investigated the seismic responses of the pile group using centrifuge tests in which only two scour hole dimensions and one pile group configuration were examined and no static loading was concerned lin and lin 2020 and h ma et al 2018a employed 3d continuum finite element method fem to investigate laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions which enabled evaluating a wider range of scour hole dimensions and pile group configurations than model tests in practice none of 3d fem centrifuge test or shake table test is widely used in routine design and analysis therefore it necessitates efforts to develop a simple and practical method for evaluating post scour vertical effective stress and behavior of a pile group under local scour conditions lin and lin 2020 initiate such an effort by extending the solution for a scoured single pile lin and wu 2019 to that for a scoured pile group however this method involves several simplifications such as assuming a square pile group assuming equal soil vertical effective stresses between individual piles in a group and ignoring the effect of soil pile interface friction on the change in post scour vertical effective stress these assumptions lead to an unnecessarily conservative estimate of the lateral capacity of the pile group and an incorrect prediction of the pile group response to scour hole slope angle the objectives of this study are threefold firstly we proposed a rigorous analytical solution for calculating post scour vertical effective stresses for pile groups which overcomes the limitations of lin and lin 2020 that is simply extended from the solution for scoured single piles the proposed solution for post scour vertical effective stress was further integrated into the existing p y curve framework to form a new method for the lateral behavior of pile groups under local scour conditions this proposed process is called the improved analytical method iam a matlab program attached as a supplementary file was developed to implement the proposed iam it was validated against 3d fe analyses whose baseline model i e unscoured condition was calibrated against a full scale load test reported in the literature with the iam 288 parametric analyses were performed to elucidate the effects of scour hole depth scour hole slope angle soil relative density pile spacing number of piles and pile group configuration on lateral responses of pile groups the second objective of this study was to assess the suitability for applying the standard methods to analyze the laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions note that although the standard methods are developed only for scoured single piles they may be mistakenly used for scoured pile groups as no corresponding specifications are available for scoured pile groups lastly drawing on the iam we proposed a simple and practical approach called the influence depth method idm for practicing engineers to analyze laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions this paper starts with a synthesis of an extensive literature review on the characteristics of the scour hole at the pile group and the existing methods for analyzing the post scour vertical effective stresses and lateral responses of group piles followed by the development and validation of the proposed methods iam and idm after that the results of parametric analyses are presented in which the standard methods are critically assessed and some design related issues are discussed 2 review of scour hole dimensions at a pile group in contrast to scour at a single isolated pile scour at a pile group is influenced by pile group conditions and hydraulic conditions the hydraulic mechanism involves not only downflow horseshoe vortices and wake vortices that are common to the single isolated pile but also the hydraulic group effect that is unique to the pile group in general the hydraulic group effect includes reinforcement sheltering shed vortices and jetting effects hannah 1978 hosseini and amini 2015 that are dependent on the flow skew angle α f center to center pile spacing s and pile group configuration m n where m and n are the numbers of piles in line with and normal to the lateral load direction respectively most of the past studies focused on scour characteristics considering different pile group configurations e g square rectangular and circular shapes with various pile numbers and pile spacings amini et al 2012 ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 bayram and larson 2000 ji et al 2018 lança et al 2013 liang et al 2017 ni et al 2021 sheppard 2003 solaimani et al 2017 sumer et al 2005 sumer and fredsøe 1998 wang et al 2016 yagci et al 2017 yifan yang et al 2020a yilin yang et al 2020b thereinto the effects of hydraulic conditions including froude number yilin yang et al 2020b keulegan carpenter number sumer and fredsøe 1998 yifan yang et al 2020a and flow direction lança et al 2013 l ma et al 2018b sheppard 2003 sun et al 2007 yifan yang et al 2020a were also examined besides sumer et al 2007 investigated the effect of relative density of soil on the time scale and depth of scour overall under the given flow condition scour pattern is highly governed by pile spacing according to these flume tests and field surveys for example amini et al 2012 presented four photographs to exhibit the shapes of local scour at pile groups m n 5 3 with different spacings s d 1 0 2 0 3 5 5 0 as summarized in table 1 the scouring process at a pile group behaves like that at a single isolated pile when s 1 d 1 15 d d pile diameter due to the negligible flow pile interaction in the zero or narrow pile spacing once s 1 15 d the flow pile interaction starts to develop but decreases as s increases and there is a critical pile spacing approximately 2 d 5 5 d below which only global scour is formed around the pile group without localized pits at individual piles this is due to the strong interference of scouring at individual piles that wipes out the soils between the piles however when s is greater than the critical pile spacing the localized pits at individual piles emerge as the waning interference of scouring between individual piles when s exceeds the upper bound pile spacing 5 d 12 d scour interference ceases while the localized pits dominate the local scour at the pile group i e the hydraulic group effect vanishes the different result of critical pile spacing is mainly resulted from different flow conditions examined in these flume tests yilin yang et al 2020b it is worthwhile to mention that the flume tests may underestimate the critical pile spacing compared with the field observations probably due to the reduced scale and artificial flow used in the flume tests bayram and larson 2000 palmer 1969 sun et al 2007 in practice pile groups are commonly constructed with s 2 5 d 5 d asshto 2012 bowles 1997 therefore the local scour around a pile group can be reasonably represented by a large global scour hole while the localized pits at individual piles can be neglected or incorporated into the global scour hole as indicated by the field surveys bayram and larson 2000 palmer 1969 sun et al 2007 watson 1974 according to amini et al 2012 2014 the global scour hole was found to be an inverted truncated pyramid with a rounded quadrilateral cross section as illustrated in fig 1 a based on this finding lin and lin 2020 established a scour hole model for a pile group using an inverted rounded truncated pyramid characterized by scour depth s gd bottom width s wb and scour hole slope angle s θ in fig 1 a the scour depth for a pile group is often normalized by an effective group diameter d e so that the comparison between scour at a single pile and a pile group is possible i e s gd d e is comparable to s sd d according to sheppard 2003 d e is the diameter of an equivalent single pile that can develop the same scour depth as the pile group under the same flow and sediment conditions it varies with the number of piles and pile spacing for more details regarding d e readers should refer to sheppard 2003 to advance the understanding of typical ranges of scour hole dimensions for pile groups an extensive literature review was conducted the database of 120 samples of measurements supplementary table s1 is established based on field surveys or flume tests a condensed version of the database is presented in table 2 overall scour hole slope angle for offshore pile groups is in a range of s θ 5 15 bayram and larson 2000 sun et al 2007 which is similar to the observed range of s θ 15 for bridge piers butch 1996 surprisingly these values are much smaller than the typical values 26 6 and 30 used for scour at bridges arneson et al 2012 and marine structures whitehouse 1998 the scour depth for pile groups is mainly in the range of s gd d e 1 2 2 0 fig 2 which is comparable to that for single piles i e s sd d 1 3 2 5 api 2011 dnv 2014 gl 2012 3 existing approaches for post scour vertical effective stress the post scour lateral responses of pile groups can be practically evaluated by incorporating the post scour vertical effective stress into the p y curve framework although the standard methods api fhwa ds and fhwa dp are only applicable to single piles they may be mistakenly used to analyze post scour pile groups this section gives a summary of the standard methods and the method of lin and lin 2020 regarding the estimation of post scour vertical effective stress while the integration of the post scour vertical effective stress σ z sc to the p y curves for pile groups are presented later the standard methods specify different procedures to estimate σ z sc for single piles both api and fhwa ds acknowledge the decrease in vertical effective stress by local scour but the decrease is only limited to a certain depth below the post scour ground surface which is called the influence depth z i below which σ z sc is equal to the pre scour vertical effective stress σ z int and above which σ z sc is linearly increased from the post scour ground surface as illustrated in fig 3 a and mathematically expressed in eq 1 for api the influence depth is three times the local scour depth below the post scour ground surface z i 3 s sd while z i recommended by fhwa ds is only half that suggested by api z i 1 5 s sd however fhwa dp neglects the loss of vertical effective stress by local scour therefore z i 0 and the depth distribution of σ z sc is identical to that of σ z int 1 σ z sc γ z 1 s sd z i for z z i γ s sd z for z z i eq 1 can also be presented in a normalized way using vertical stress ratio 2 σ z sc σ z int z s sd z i z i s sd z for z z i 1 0 for z z i in eqs 1 and 2 s sd is substituted with s gd when they are used for scoured pile groups to extend the solution for σ z sc for single piles lin and wu 2019 to that for square pile groups lin and lin 2020 suggest an equivalent scour hole model an inverted truncated cone in fig 3 b which has the same bottom area a b and scour hole slope angle s θ as the scour hole at the pile group an inverted rounded truncated pyramid the vertical effective stress for the pile in the center of the equivalent scour hole is calculated by eq 3 and used as σ z sc for all piles in the group 3 σ z sc γ z 1 s gd tan s θ s wc s gd tan s θ s wc 2 z 2 s wc s wc 2 z 2 tan s θ where γ is the effective unit weight of soil z is the depth below the post scour ground surface s wc is the distance from the scour bottom perimeter to the center pile s wc a b π d 2 as mentioned in the introduction section lin and lin s method involves several simplifications which may limit its application and cause unnecessary conservatism firstly it assumes a pile group to be square which is not always true in practice since the pile group can be rectangular when supporting jetty pier structures and bridges secondly it assumes equal σ z sc around individual piles within a group leading to underestimated σ z sc at individual piles except the center pile particularly for a large scale pile group because when s wc 3 d the local scour effect is equivalent to a general scour effect lin and lin 2020 this also leads to no difference in active or passive earth pressure between the back row and the leading row and thus incorrect responses of the lateral capacity of pile group to the change in s θ lin and lin 2020 lastly it neglects the soil pile interface friction lin and jiang 2019 that can effectively retain the soil effective stress at the piles and prevent the scour induced loss in σ z sc therefore it necessitates the development of a rigorous approach to overcoming the foregoing limitations 4 proposed methods to appropriately analyze laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions an improved analytical method iam is proposed based on the results of iam a practical approach called the influence depth method idm is developed the two methods are implemented in matlab allowing for analyzing post scour vertical effective stresses and lateral responses of pile groups 4 1 post scour vertical effective stresses around piles as discussed in section 2 a scour hole at a pile group can be featured by a frustum with a rounded rectangle cross section amini et al 2012 2014 as shown in fig 1 a it is also possible that a more complicated scour hole shape featuring uneven scour bottom and unequal slope angles can exist in large pile groups involving great pile spacings and or pile numbers liang et al 2017 sumer et al 2005 yilin yang et al 2020b however as will be discussed later for most scour cases considered in this study this simplified uniform scour hole shape is considered to be proper and the effect of the simplification is quantified through a comparative study in section 4 3 in the proposed iam the scour hole shape is slightly modified by substituting the rounded edges with the sharp edges for mathematical convenience note that this simplified scour hole with sharp edges is also adopted by the centrifuge tests kariyawasam et al 2020 while both frustums sharing the same bottom area of the scour hole a b l b w b and scour hole slope angle s θ thereinto l b and w b are the length and width of the scour hole bottom respectively both frustums also share the same length to width ratio l b w b a cartesian coordinate system is established to define the scour hole dimensions with its origin being placed on the upper left corner of the scour hole bottom and y and z axes pointing to the lateral loading and downward direction respectively in fig 1 a the post scour vertical effective stress is calculated by superposition of two components of vertical effective stresses resulting from soil overburden below and above the post scour ground surface i e σ z sc σ z δ σ z the former is easily calculated using σ z γ z the latter δ σ z called additional vertical effective stress is determined by a series of soil columns fig 1 b which have a width of δ x δ y 0 02 d and varied heights of h j 0 s gd within the sloping ground domain sidewall but a larger width of δ x δ y 0 07 d and a constant height of h j s gd within the leveled pre scour ground domain furthermore individual piles are reduced to vertical lines as d is significantly smaller than the soil domain and the pile diameter effect was found to be negligible lin and wu 2019 the value of δ σ z is then calculated using boussinesq s point load solution by integrating the contribution from the weights of soil columns the integration is done over a finite area with boundaries located 60 5 w b and 60 5 l b from the center of the scour hole bottom on x and y directions respectively fig 1 b beyond which soil overburden has no contribution to δ σ z 4 1 1 consideration of entire overburden zone assuming the overburden or remaining soils above the post scour ground is discretized into j soil columns and all the soil columns contribute to δ σ z at an individual pile according to boussinesq s solution therefore δ σ z for different piles in an m n group at a given depth z can be expressed as 4 δ σ z 1 δ σ z 2 δ σ z m n m n 1 ψ 1 1 ψ 1 2 ψ 2 1 ψ 2 2 ψ 1 j ψ 2 j ψ m n 1 ψ m n 2 ψ m n j m n j p 1 p 2 p j m n j where p j is the weight of the j t h soil column p j γ h j δ x δ y ψ i j is the influence factor depending on the distance l i j between the point of interest in the i t h pile to the center of the j t h soil column bottom 5 ψ i j 3 z 3 2 π x p x s 2 y p y s 2 z 2 2 5 i 1 2 m n and j 1 2 j where x s y s and x p y p represent the coordinates of the j t h soil column and the i t h pile respectively z is the depth of point of interest in the i t h pile below the post scour ground once δ σ z is determined from eq 4 post scour vertical stresses at individual piles within a group for a given depth z can be calculated by 6 σ z sc 1 σ z sc 2 σ z sc m n m n 1 η δ σ z 1 δ σ z 2 δ σ z m n m n 1 γ z γ z γ z m n 1 σ z int σ z int σ z int m n 1 besides the vertical stress ratios σ z sc σ z int for individual piles at depth z are 7 σ z sc 1 σ z int σ z sc 2 σ z int σ z sc m n σ z int m n 1 1 γ z s gd σ z sc 1 σ z sc 2 σ z sc m n m n 1 1 1 1 m n 1 in eq 6 η is a semi empirical correction factor to account for the effect of soil pile interface friction on retaining vertical effective stress in soils after scouring this value is back calculated by matching the σ z sc σ z int profile calculated from eqs 4 7 to that from 3d fem e g fig 4 through parametric analyses considering various scour hole depth scour hole slope angle sand relative density pile spacing and number of piles η was found to primarily depend on the scour hole depth and pile spacing and can be expressed as η f d f s where f d and f s are factors considering the effects of s gd and s respectively for the typical ranges of s gd and s encountered in practice η can be determined by table 3 the preceding procedure invoking eqs 4 7 constitutes the first step of the proposed iam concerning the calculation of σ z sc considering the contribution of the entire overburden zone the iam can be further utilized to derive the influence depth z i for different pile groups and scour hole dimensions using equivalent stress ratio area invoking eq 8 the stress ratio area a e calculated using σ z sc σ z int determined from eqs 4 7 is equal to that calculated using σ z sc σ z int determined by eq 3 8 a e 0 l e 1 σ z sc σ z int d z where a e represents the area enclosed by the right vertical axis and σ z sc σ z int profile e g fig 4 using this procedure a typical range of z i is obtained as given in figs 5 and 6 for a 3 3 pile group for other sizes of pile groups the values are presented in supplementary tables s3 s8 by substituting z i into eq 1 σ z sc at individual piles can be obtained this forms part of the proposed idm in relation to the calculation of post scour vertical effective stress 4 1 2 consideration of separate overburden zones in eqs 4 7 δ σ z and σ z sc are calculated considering the total influence of the overburden above the post scour ground surface however when integrating the calculated σ z sc into p y curves the calculated lateral soil resistances for the leading and back rows are identical which is not reasonable to capture the difference in lateral soil resistance the wedge failure model was adopted for scoured single piles lin et al 2014 however the application of the wedge failure model for a pile group is untenable as the difficulty in considering the geotechnical group effect and scour hole geometry to address this issue the preceding procedure for σ z sc was improved by dividing the overburden above the post scour ground surface into different zones and separately evaluating δ σ z and σ z sc as illustrated in fig 1 b when a pile group is under lateral load the overburden pressure contributing to δ σ z can be divided into a passive earth pressure zone an active earth pressure zone and an intermediate zone instead of calculating δ σ z considering the entire overburden above the post scour ground surface δ σ z a and δ σ z p are separately evaluated considering the overburden within the intermediate active pressure zone and the intermediate passive pressure zone respectively mathematically δ σ z a and δ σ z p are calculated by substituting j a the number of soil columns within the intermediate active pressure zone and j p the number of soil columns within the intermediate passive pressure zone respectively for j in eq 4 subsequently post scour vertical effective stresses corresponding to the intermediate active pressure zone and intermediate passive pressure zone σ z a sc and σ z p sc are obtained by substituting δ σ z a and σ z p into eq 6 respectively this constitutes part of the proposed iam in relation to the calculation of the post scour vertical effective stresses considering the effects of the separate overburden zones 4 2 post scour lateral responses of pile group the next part of the proposed iam and idm is to incorporate the post scour vertical effective stress into the p y curve framework this step requires calculating an equivalent depth z e by dividing the post scour vertical effective stress by soil effective unit weight substitution of z e into existing p y curves e g reese s p y curves for sands reese and van impe 2001 for pile groups results in the modified p y curves that can account for laterally loaded pile groups under different scour hole dimensions the above mentioned step is also used when the standard methods are employed the post scour vertical effective stresses calculated considering the entire overburden zone will be used by the standard methods and the idm while those considering separate overburden zones are used by the iam note that the iam considering the entire overburden zone eqs 4 7 is only used for the purpose of deriving the idm 4 2 1 consideration of entire overburden zone the equivalent depths z e of the idm and the standard methods are calculated from eq 9 where σ z sc is calculated by substituting z i developed in this study and suggested by the standard methods respectively into eq 1 the post scour p y curves for group piles are developed by substituting z e for z in reese s p y relationship reese and van impe 2001 as presented in eqs 10 14 9 z e σ z sc γ 10 p f m k z e y y y k f m p m y m λ y λ y k y y m f m p m y y m p u p m y u y m y m y y u f m p u y y u where f m is the p multiplier that considers the geotechnical group effect y m d 60 y u 3 d 80 k is the p y modulus taken as 34 16 3 5 4 mn m3 for the submerged dense medium dense and loose sands respectively api 2011 the other parameters p u p m y k λ are related to the ultimate lateral soil resistance per unit length of a pile p ult 11 p u a s p ult 12 p m b s p ult where a s and b s are the static load type factors that can be determined by substituting z e d for z d in reese s p y curves y k and λ are obtained from y k p m k z e y m λ 1 1 λ and λ y m p u p m p m y u y m respectively p ult is taken as the smaller value of eqs 13 and 14 13 p ult s γ z e tan β z e tan β tan α d tan β φ k 0 z e tan φ sin β tan β φ cos α k 0 z e tan β tan φ sin β tan α k a d 14 p ult d γ z e d k a tan 8 β 1 k 0 tan φ tan 4 β where p ult s and p ult d are ultimate soil resistance per unit length of a pile at shallow and great depths respectively α φ 2 β 45 φ 2 k a tan 2 45 φ 2 and k 0 1 sin φ are active and at rest earth pressure coefficients respectively for normally consolidated soils 4 2 2 consideration of separate overburden zones the proposed iam employs σ z a sc and σ z p sc to account for the differences in the active and passive earth pressures between the back row and the leading row in contributing to the lateral soil resistances the corresponding equivalent depths are calculated using z ea σ z a sc γ and z ep σ z p sc γ respectively for the ultimate lateral resistance at shallow depths p ult s a close examination of eq 13 reveals that it consists of the components related to the active and passive earth pressures therefore eqs 11 13 are modified to calculate p ult s incorporating σ z a sc and σ z p sc given by 15 p u a sp γ z ep k 0 tan β z ep tan β tan α d k 0 tan β φ z ep tan φ sin β tan β φ cos α z ep tan β

sp are the static load type factors dependent on z ea d and z ep d respectively reese and van impe 2001 however soil failure at a great depth typically follows a plane flow mode therefore the lateral soil resistance at a great depth p ult d is influenced by the entire overburden above the post scour ground surface and in this case eq 14 is still used in summary for the iam the post scour p y curves are developed using eqs 10 12 and 14 when p ult p ult d but eqs 10 15 and 16 when p ult p ult s for the idm or the standard methods eqs 10 14 are invoked 4 3 implementation and validation the post scour p y curves developed from the above procedures were incorporated into the euler bernoulli beam equation reese and van impe 2001 to analyze the laterally loaded pile groups considering different scour hole conditions a central finite difference algorithm with newton s iteration was developed in matlab to implement the calculations the matlab code is attached as a supplementary file as discussed in the introduction no field tests or centrifuge tests regarding scoured pile groups can be used to validate the proposed methods therefore the proposed iam and idm were verified against a series of 3d continuum fe results computed by the authors lin and lin 2020 and compared with the standard methods api fhwa dp and fhwa ds and the method of lin and lin 2020 in the 3d fe model lin and lin 2020 the pile was simulated as an elastic material using continuum solid elements while soil as an elastoplastic material with mohr coulomb failure criterion soil parameters were back calculated from a full scale load test on a single pile brown et al 1988 and the baseline 3d fe model for a pile group established using the calibrated soil parameters was verified against a full scale test of a laterally loaded pile group 3 3 s 3 d at the same site as the single pile brown et al 1988 the pile head of individual piles in the pile group was pin connected through a frame and thus was free for rotation while moving equally horizontally the baseline model was for a pre scour condition while the scour hole was created from the baseline model by deactivating the soil elements that were intended to be scoured away the scour depth ranged from 0 to 6 d 0 to 2 8 d e and scour hole slope angle from 0 to 42 one degree less than soil friction angle while scour bottom width remained zero greater details of the 3d fe model can be referred to lin and lin 2020 table 4 shows the soil and pile parameters and the pile head was 0 305 m above the ground surface corresponding to the pre scour ground in this study it is noted that mohr coulomb constitutive model that adopts an elastic perfectly plastic relation has inherent limitations for example it could not evaluate the stress dependent soil stiffness which however can be significant for sands gouw 2014 therefore an advanced model such as strain hardening model may be more proper however the present study has validated the fe model using mohr coulomb constitutive relation against the pile group test brown et al 1988 with the soil parameters back calculated from another field test for a single isolated pile at the same site this indicates that the numerical model in this study is still acceptable besides as discussed in section 4 1 the scour hole shape adopted by this study fig 1 is to some extent simplified from a more complex scour scenario featuring uneven scour hole bottom as well as unequal upstream and downstream side slope angles therefore a preliminary comparative study was conducted herein using 3d fem to quantify the difference between a complex scour hole scenario and a simplified uniform scour hole scenario in terms of the lateral capacity of pile group where the lateral capacity was the lateral load causing 1 inch deflection at the pile head lin and wu 2019 the comparative study investigated the post scour lateral capacities of the 3 3 pile group brown et al 1988 under four different scour hole scenarios illustrated in supplementary fig s1 and the detailed scour hole dimensions are summarized in supplementary table s2 meanwhile the pile spacing was set to be 5 d so that the localized pits could be formed at individual piles as discussed in section 2 by comparing the lateral capacities corresponding to these four different scour hole cases fig s2 simplifying an asymmetrical and uneven scour hole as a uniform scour hole could underestimate the post scour lateral capacity of pile group by 10 13 this indicates that the simplification was conservative and its effect was not significant it is acknowledged that a further study is warranted to explore the limitations of the simplified scour hole model for other sizes of pile group or improve the analytical method to directly account for the nonuniform scour hole conditions overall using the proposed iam and idm lin and lin s method and standard methods api fhwa dp and fhwa ds a total of 288 parametric analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of scour hole depth 0 to 6 0 d or 2 8 d e scour hole slope angle 0 42 soil relative density loose medium dense pile spacing 2 d 6 d number of piles 4 16 piles and pile group configuration square rectangular on the post scour lateral responses of pile groups the details of the parametric analyses are summarized in table 5 5 results and discussion the results of post scour vertical effective stress and lateral responses of pile groups are presented focusing on the demonstration of the efficacy of the proposed methods iam and idm and the appraisal of the existing methods mentioned in section 3 note that the calibrated 3d fe model lin and lin 2020 was used to validate the iam and idm and to evaluate the existing methods prior to presenting the results the effect of soil pile interface friction quantified by η and the determination of influence depth z i are discussed fig 4 a c show the computed σ z sc σ z int profiles of the center corner and edge piles respectively for the 3 d spaced 3 3 pile group with s gd 2 8 d e 6 d s wb 0 and s θ 26 6 also shown in fig 4 is the influence depth z i when the soil pile interface friction effects were neglected i e dropping out η in eq 6 iam that considers the entire overburden zone eqs 4 7 and idm yielded smaller σ z sc σ z int than the 3d fem this is because the effect of soil pile interface friction lin and jiang 2019 was ignored when η was precluded contrarily with the inclusion of η iam and idm yielded a much better comparison with the 3d fem therefore for the following analyses only iam and idm with η table 3 are considered fig 4 also reveals that the proposed influence depths denoted by circles determined from eqs 4 8 were 2 12 s gd center pile 2 25 s gd corner pile and 2 10 s gd edge pile which are similar to the benchmark values 1 94 s gd 2 22 s gd and 2 13 s gd determined from the 3d fem denoted by rhombus symbols 5 1 post scour vertical effective stresses around piles the vertical effective stresses under local scour conditions are discussed in terms of the influence depth a greater z i indicates a deeper influence and thus a greater loss in the vertical effective stress caused by the local scour 5 1 1 effect of scour hole depth on the influence depth the proposed influence depths under different s gd were determined by back calculating from the results of iam and they were compared with those determined by the 3d fem and recommended by the standard methods as indicated in fig 5 the results for different positions of piles agreed well with the 3d fe results showing a nonlinear decrease in z i with increased s gd for example z i decreased by 61 39 and 30 for the center edge and corner piles respectively as s gd increased from 0 to 2 8 d e 6 d the results further indicate that σ z sc reflected by z i varied with the pile position in the pile group with deeper z i at the center pile than the edge piles and corner piles this means that local scour caused a larger loss and a deeper influence in the vertical effective stress at the center pile than the perimeter piles in contrast the standard methods that recommend a constant z i failed to capture the nonlinear relationship and the variation of z i with the pile position however the influence depth suggested by api z i 3 s gd was comparable to that from idm and 3d fem when s gd 1 4 d e the influence depth suggested by fhwa ds z i 1 5 s gd served as a lower bound of idm and 3d fem showing increasing agreement as s gd increased while that by fhwa dp was incorrect as it ignored the local scour effects on the soil stress reduction 5 1 2 effect of pile spacing on the influence depth fig 6 presents variations of influence depth with pile spacing when s gd 3 d s wb 0 s θ 26 6 note that s gd is normalized by d since the effective diameter d e is no longer constant under varied pile spacing overall z i increased as s increased with that at the center pile increasing more significantly than at the edge and corner piles this result is attributed to the reduced soil pile interactions with increased s as indicated by f s in table 3 again this was captured by the idm and 3d fem but not by the standard methods in comparison fhwa ds z i 1 5 s d and api z i 3 s d only agreed with idm and 3d fem when s 2 d and 3 d respectively 5 2 post scour lateral responses of pile groups for a laterally loaded pile group geotechnical group effect is usually characterized by p multiplier f m which can be obtained from load tests 3d continuum fe analyses alternatively typical values of f m can be referenced to design standards in this study f m was back calculated from the abovementioned 3d fe results lin and lin 2020 and compared with the typical values obtained from the field tests brown et al 1988 mokwa 1999 and design recommendations asshto 2012 fema 2012 reese et al 1996 reese and van impe 2001 u s army corps of engineers 1991 as shown in fig 7 overall the back calculated f m was within the range suggested by the design recommendations and field tests as with fayyazi et al 2014 f m back calculated from the 3d continuum numerical model was smaller than the recommended values asshto 2012 fema 2012 reese et al 1996 reese and van impe 2001 particularly for the back row asshto 2012 generally agreed well with f m obtained from field tests and 3d fem for s 4 d rollins et al 2006 contrarily f m values per u s army corps of engineers 1991 were in general small and conservative particularly for the leading row note that the above back calculated f m was obtained in the no scour condition and was reasonably assumed to remain unchanged after scouring lin and lin 2020 in this section the post scour lateral responses of pile groups are presented including the lateral capacity ratio load share and bending moment the effects of scour hole depth scour hole slope angle soil relative density pile spacing and pile group configuration on the post scour lateral responses were evaluated with the ranges of input parameters given in table 5 5 2 1 effect of scour hole depth fig 8 shows the lateral load deflection curves at the pile head 3 3 pile group before and after scouring overall the proposed methods iam and idm yielded agreeable results with the 3d fem at different scour depths in contrast lin and lin s method predicted smaller lateral loads at a given deflection to assess the effects of scour hole dimensions a lateral capacity defined as the post scour to the pre scour lateral capacity of a pile group was adopted the lateral capacity was the lateral load causing 1 inch deflection at the pile head lin and wu 2019 generally a smaller lateral capacity ratio indicates a greater scour induced loss in the lateral capacity fig 9 shows the lateral capacity ratio of the 3 d spaced 3 3 pile group varied with s gd calculated using different methods from the 3d fe analyses the lateral capacity ratio decreased from 1 to 0 42 when s gd increased from 0 to 2 8 d e or 6 d indicating a 58 loss in the lateral capacity surprisingly despite applying only for single piles fhwa ds produced the most agreeable results of scoured pile groups as compared with the 3d fem with the difference of 4 to 10 the proposed methods iam and idm and api also compared well with the 3d fem with the difference of 0 to 14 while the method of lin and lin 2020 underestimated the lateral capacity ratio by up to 22 in contrast fhwa dp considerably overestimated the lateral capacity ratio by up to 47 as the neglect of scour induced loss in the vertical effective stress the above results demonstrate that all the methods assessed except fhwa dp are suitable for use when s θ 26 6 and the iam is approved to be an improvement over lin and lin 2020 fig 10 shows load shares of pile rows varied with s gd the load share of each row is defined as the lateral load carried by the pile row divided by the total load applied to the pile group that mobilized the pile head laterally by 1 inch the load share from the 3d fem increased by 10 for the back row but decreased by 6 for the leading row when s gd increased from 0 to 2 8 d e this result indicates that as local scour intensified the back row attracted more lateral load while the leading row took less lateral load fig 10 also shows that the proposed iam exhibited a better match with the 3d fem than the other methods which indirectly verifies the assumption that f m remained unchanged with the change in s gd as mentioned in section 5 1 furthermore fig 11 a c profile the bending moment of piles in the back middle and leading rows respectively compared with the 3d fem fhwa dp overestimated the average bending moments of back row middle row and leading row piles by up to 39 53 and 50 respectively while all the other methods including iam and idm produced consistent and agreeable estimates in general maximum bending moments decreased by 17 20 when s gd increased from 0 7 d e to 2 8 d e i e 1 5 d to 6 d meanwhile the location of the maximum bending moment moved downward relative to the pile top by 2 4 d 3 0 d 5 2 2 effect of scour hole slope angle fig 12 shows the lateral capacity ratio for s θ 0 42 while the other scour hole dimensions were maintained constant s gd 1 4 d e s wb 0 when s θ 0 a local scour turned into a general scour while the upper bound of the scour hole slope angle s θ 42 was set to be less than the internal friction angle of sand φ 43 the results by the proposed methods iam and idm showed similar trends to the 3d fem i e the lateral capacity ratios increased with the increase in s θ although the magnitudes were slightly lower but conservative and the difference in the magnitude was attributed to the discrepancy of lateral capacity ratio existed at s θ 0 moreover both iam and idm were superior to lin and lin 2020 as compared with the 3d fem when s θ decreased from 26 to 0 the lateral capacity ratio decreased by 25 this indicates that simplifying a local scour as a general scour which is commonly used in practice for foundation design could underestimate the lateral capacity of a pile group by up to 25 contrarily the results of the standard methods were all featured by a constant line as they could not consider the changes in s θ or s wb fhwa dp on average overestimated the lateral capacity ratio by 28 when s θ 0 42 although fhwa ds compared well with the 3d fem when s θ 20 42 it overestimated the lateral capacity ratio by up to 20 when s θ 20 which is unsafe for a scoured pile group the existing data table 2 showed that s θ could be less than 15 bayram and larson 2000 butch 1996 harris and whitehouse 2014 sun et al 2007 in this circumstance fhwa ds could yield an unconservative design api generally gave conservative results except s θ 5 in which it overestimated the lateral capacity ratio by up to 8 fig 13 shows load shares of pile rows varied with s θ as previously mentioned the soil lateral resistance to the leading row is different from that to the back row in general the leading row is anticipated to resist more lateral load with increased s θ as higher passive earth pressures developed in front of it and the opposite is anticipated for the back row as higher active pressures developed behind it this phenomenon was manifested by the 3d fem and iam fig 13 showing a higher lateral load on the leading row but a lower lateral load on the back row as s θ increased although the changes in the load shares estimated by the iam were slightly narrower than those by the 3d fem the trends were similar however the other methods gave insignificant or no changes in load share with increased s θ which is incorrect the reason is that the increases in the active earth pressure to the back row and the passive earth pressure to the leading row due to the increased s θ were not considered in these methods 5 2 3 effect of soil relative density besides the influences of scour hole dimensions effects of soil condition on the post scour lateral responses of pile groups were examined as shown in fig 14 when s gd increased from 0 to 2 8 d e scour induced loss in the lateral capacity was 58 50 and 45 for the pile group in dense medium dense and loose sands respectively from the 3d fem similar results were also obtained by the iam 65 57 and 53 and idm 64 55 and 51 these results indicate that scour caused more loss in the lateral capacity up to 13 of the pile group in dense sands than in loose sands particularly for greater s gd overall the proposed methods iam and idm provided better estimations of lateral capacity ratio than lin and lin 2020 in addition pile bending moments were profiled in various soil conditions but under the same scour hole dimensions s wb 0 s gd 1 4 d e s θ 26 6 fig 15 shows that the bending moments determined by the iam and idm were comparable with those by the 3d fem in general the maximum bending moment increased with the increased relative density of sands and the increases were 71 76 and 57 70 by the iam and 3d fem respectively meanwhile the location of the maximum bending moment shifted downward by 2 1 d when the relative density increased from loose to dense 5 2 4 effects of pile spacing and number of piles as mentioned in section 2 in contrast to scour at a single isolated pile scour at a pile group is influenced not only by hydraulic conditions e g froude number keulegan carpenter number flow direction but also pile group conditions e g pile spacing pile number pile group configuration due to the hydraulic group effects i e reinforcement sheltering shed vortices and jetting effects in general reinforcement and sheltering effects that intensify scour at the upstream pile can be attenuated by increasing the pile spacing in line with the flow likewise jetting effect that wipes out soils between side by side piles as the compression of inner arms of horseshoe vortices can also be weakened by increasing the pile spacing normal to the flow moreover shed vortices that intensify scour at the downstream pile on the path of wake vortices are more significant in a staggered pile group arrangement hosseini and amini 2015 lança et al 2013 sumer and fredsøe 1998 therefore the following two sections will focus on the effects of pile spacing pile number and pile group configuration on the post scour responses of pile group as indicated by table 1 global scour could develop and dominate the scour hole geometry at pile groups when s 5 5 d here we assume global scour occurred for s 2 d 6 d which covers the typical range of spacing in the general design of pile groups fig 16 shows the lateral capacity ratio varied with the pile spacing when s wb 0 s gd 3 d and s θ 26 6 based on the 3d fe analyses the lateral capacity ratio decreased by 4 as s increased from 2 d to 6 d the proposed methods iam and idm yielded agreeable lateral capacity ratios with the 3d fem with differences less than 0 1 as with figs 9 and 12 api produced similar results to iam and idm while fhwa dp significantly overestimated the lateral capacity ratio which is unsafe although fhwa ds produced the best comparable results with the 3d fem when s θ 26 6 it could overestimate the lateral capacity ratio when s θ 20 as shown in fig 12 which is also unsafe furthermore the effect of the number of piles on the lateral capacity ratio was investigated by considering three sizes of pile groups 2 2 s gd 3 d 1 97 d e 3 3 s gd 3 d 1 40 d e and 4 4 s gd 3 d 1 05 d e as shown in table 6 the effect of increasing the number of piles on the lateral capacity ratio was negligible displaying only a slight increase 4 compared with the 3d fem iam and idm underestimated lateral capacity ratios by 13 and 9 respectively while lin and lin s method by 18 however fhwa dp overestimated it by 24 again for s θ 26 6 which is greater than 20 fhwa ds agreed best with the 3d fem and api yielded similar results to the 3d fem and iam 5 2 5 effect of pile group configuration the previous results were determined for the square pile group a prerequisite assumed by the method of lin and lin 2020 the proposed methods iam and idm were developed for different shaped pile groups to assess the effect of pile group configuration pile groups with three configurations m n 6 5 10 3 15 2 but the same number of piles 30 and spacing s 3 d were evaluated using the iam and idm under local scour conditions for comparison purposes it is assumed that the standard methods fig 3 might be applied to the scoured pile groups with rectangular configurations the p multipliers used for the three pile groups were evaluated from asshto 2012 fig 7 the lateral capacity ratios were computed for different scour depths s gd 0 7 d e 2 8 d e s θ 26 6 s wb 0 supplementary fig s3 and different scour hole slope angles s θ 0 26 6 s gd 2 8 d e s wb 0 supplementary fig s4 fig 17 was reduced from supplementary figs s3 and s4 by selecting a given scour hole depth s gd 1 4 d e to evaluate the shape effect surprisingly increasing the aspect ratio of the pile group approximately equal to m n resulted in an increase in the lateral capacity ratio for the case analyzed the lateral capacity ratio increased by 57 when m n increased from 1 2 to 7 5 in other words given the same number of piles m n the square pile group could subject to more scour induced loss in the lateral capacity than the rectangular pile group the standard methods api fhwa dp and fhwa ds could also capture this trend although they might not be technically correct 6 conclusions this study proposed a new approach called the improved analytical method iam for analyzing the laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions drawing on the iam and the concept of influence depth in the standard methods api fhwa dp and fhwa ds a simple and practical influence depth method idm was also proposed the proposed methods iam and idm were validated against the results of the 3d fe model that was calibrated against a full scale load test two matlab programs were developed to implement the iam and idm with which 288 parametric analyses were performed to evaluate the factors scour hole depth scour hole slope angle soil relative density pile spacing number of piles and pile group configuration affecting the post scour behavior of pile groups in sands the standard methods and the method of lin and lin 2020 were critically assessed in the parametric study the following conclusions were obtained from this study 1 compared with the 3d fem the proposed iam and idm produced agreeable and conservative estimates of the lateral capacity and maximum bending moment of pile groups fhwa dp significantly overestimated the lateral capacity which is thus unsafe and not recommended for use for typical scour hole dimensions s θ 26 6 or 30 recommended in practices api and fhwa ds could be used to yield agreeable prediction of the lateral capacity however when s θ 20 as often encountered in the field per the literature survey api and fhwa ds overestimated the lateral capacity and therefore are unsafe 2 the increase in scour hole depth s gd decreased the lateral capacity and maximum bending moment of pile groups and shifted the location of the maximum bending moment toward the post scour ground surface besides more lateral loads were transferred to the back row as s gd increased the proposed iam yielded a better prediction of the load share as compared with the 3d fem than the standard methods and lin and lin s method 3 the lateral capacity and maximum bending moment increased as the scour hole slope angle s θ increased the increase in s θ increased the load share of the leading row but decreased the load share of the back row which was only captured by the iam and 3d fem while neither the standard methods nor lin and lin s method could capture the change in load share with s θ 4 although adopting a larger pile spacing s could reduce the geotechnical group effect scour induced reduction in the lateral capacity increased as s increased given the same local scour depth the scour induced decrease in the lateral capacity was more significant in the square pile group than the rectangular pile group loading along the length of the pile group given the same total number of piles therefore the use of a pile group in rectangular configuration is recommended in the foundation design against scour credit authorship contribution statement wenyu jiang conceptualization methodology software validation formal

20820,for pile supported structures scour is a major threat as it removes soils around foundations and causes structural damages scour effects on the performance of the pile foundation have been well studied however most of these studies are focused on lateral responses of single piles while very limited research is focused on lateral responses of pile groups therefore prevailing design standards only recommend scour design procedures for single piles here we proposed an improved analytical method iam to analyze laterally loaded pile groups considering various scour hole dimensions the iam was validated against the results of 3d finite element fe models calibrated against a full scale load test a series of parametric analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of scour hole depth scour hole slope angle sand relative density pile spacing number of piles and pile group configuration on both post scour vertical effective stresses and lateral responses of pile groups based on the iam a simple practical approach called the influence depth method idm was also developed for use in routine design the feasibility of applying the standard methods for the scoured pile groups was evaluated by comparing them with the 3d fe analyses and the proposed methods iam and idm keywords pile group lateral capacity vertical effective stress scour hole depth scour hole slope angle 1 introduction scour is a process of soil removal caused by waves currents and ship propeller jets etc chin et al 1996 whitehouse 1998 which decreases the soil resistance to the foundation it is a major cause for intolerable stresses in offshore structures watson 1974 and bridge collapse worldwide briaud 2015 coleman and melville 2001 liang et al 2017 mueller and wagner 2005 zhang et al 2015 scour includes general scour that causes a uniform decrease in mudline elevation across a riverbed or a seabed and local scour that causes a localized decrease in mudline elevation primarily located at piles for a pile group local scour can be further classified into global scour shallow wide depression across the pile group and localized pit steep sided pits located at individual piles in the past decades the mechanisms and characteristics of scour at pile groups in different flow conditions have been extensively investigated by flume tests amini et al 2012 ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 ji et al 2018 lança et al 2013 liang et al 2017 l ma et al 2018b ni et al 2021 sheppard 2003 solaimani et al 2017 sumer et al 2005 sumer and fredsøe 1998 wang et al 2016 yagci et al 2017 yifan yang et al 2020a yifan yang et al 2020a and field surveys bayram and larson 2000 palmer 1969 sun et al 2007 moreover numerical simulations based on computational fluid dynamics are adopted to investigate complex flow structures in different pile groups hamidi and siadatmousavi 2018 kim et al 2014 liang et al 2019 wang et al 2017 q zhang et al 2017b as indicated by these studies scour at a pile group is rather complicated compared to that at a single isolated pile due to hydraulic group effects and a greater detailed review of the scour hole characteristics of pile group is presented in section 2 currently there is no generally accepted practical approach for determining pile vertical or lateral capacity under local scour conditions probably due to uncertainty in characterizing sizes and shapes of scour holes at piles or pile groups and lack of considering scour induced changes in soil stress history lin and wu 2019 in design practices estimation of vertical effective stress of soils around piles is required before calculation of pile capacities however the prevailing standards such as american petroleum institute api 2011 u s federal highway administration drilled shaft fwha ds brown et al 2010 and driven pile fhwa dp patrick et al 2016 specify inconsistent approaches to computing the vertical effective stress under local scour conditions termed as post scour vertical effective stress the different calculations of post scour vertical effective stress would lead to a discrepancy of the calculated pile axial or lateral capacity and thus confuse practicing engineers when designing pile foundations against scour damage to improve the standard methods both closed form solutions derived from boussinesq s solution lin and jiang 2019 lin and wu 2019 and numerical solution using mindlin s solution h zhang et al 2017a are developed to estimate the post scour vertical effective stress which are further used to calculate the axial or lateral capacity of scoured single piles the drawbacks of these solutions and standard methods api fwha ds and fhwa dp are that they are recommended only for single piles however piles are commonly installed in groups rather than single piles and scour effects are more severe in pile groups than single piles as a result of the double group effect lin and lin 2020 geotechnical group effect that reduces the pile capacity of individual piles in a group as compared with the single isolated piles and hydraulic group effect that intensifies the flow in a pile group as compared with a single isolated pile despite its importance research concerning the capacities of scoured pile groups is highly scarce for example as of this writing there are only one experimental study and two numerical studies reported on the investigation into the local scour effects on the behavior of pile groups liang et al 2020 investigated the seismic responses of the pile group using centrifuge tests in which only two scour hole dimensions and one pile group configuration were examined and no static loading was concerned lin and lin 2020 and h ma et al 2018a employed 3d continuum finite element method fem to investigate laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions which enabled evaluating a wider range of scour hole dimensions and pile group configurations than model tests in practice none of 3d fem centrifuge test or shake table test is widely used in routine design and analysis therefore it necessitates efforts to develop a simple and practical method for evaluating post scour vertical effective stress and behavior of a pile group under local scour conditions lin and lin 2020 initiate such an effort by extending the solution for a scoured single pile lin and wu 2019 to that for a scoured pile group however this method involves several simplifications such as assuming a square pile group assuming equal soil vertical effective stresses between individual piles in a group and ignoring the effect of soil pile interface friction on the change in post scour vertical effective stress these assumptions lead to an unnecessarily conservative estimate of the lateral capacity of the pile group and an incorrect prediction of the pile group response to scour hole slope angle the objectives of this study are threefold firstly we proposed a rigorous analytical solution for calculating post scour vertical effective stresses for pile groups which overcomes the limitations of lin and lin 2020 that is simply extended from the solution for scoured single piles the proposed solution for post scour vertical effective stress was further integrated into the existing p y curve framework to form a new method for the lateral behavior of pile groups under local scour conditions this proposed process is called the improved analytical method iam a matlab program attached as a supplementary file was developed to implement the proposed iam it was validated against 3d fe analyses whose baseline model i e unscoured condition was calibrated against a full scale load test reported in the literature with the iam 288 parametric analyses were performed to elucidate the effects of scour hole depth scour hole slope angle soil relative density pile spacing number of piles and pile group configuration on lateral responses of pile groups the second objective of this study was to assess the suitability for applying the standard methods to analyze the laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions note that although the standard methods are developed only for scoured single piles they may be mistakenly used for scoured pile groups as no corresponding specifications are available for scoured pile groups lastly drawing on the iam we proposed a simple and practical approach called the influence depth method idm for practicing engineers to analyze laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions this paper starts with a synthesis of an extensive literature review on the characteristics of the scour hole at the pile group and the existing methods for analyzing the post scour vertical effective stresses and lateral responses of group piles followed by the development and validation of the proposed methods iam and idm after that the results of parametric analyses are presented in which the standard methods are critically assessed and some design related issues are discussed 2 review of scour hole dimensions at a pile group in contrast to scour at a single isolated pile scour at a pile group is influenced by pile group conditions and hydraulic conditions the hydraulic mechanism involves not only downflow horseshoe vortices and wake vortices that are common to the single isolated pile but also the hydraulic group effect that is unique to the pile group in general the hydraulic group effect includes reinforcement sheltering shed vortices and jetting effects hannah 1978 hosseini and amini 2015 that are dependent on the flow skew angle α f center to center pile spacing s and pile group configuration m n where m and n are the numbers of piles in line with and normal to the lateral load direction respectively most of the past studies focused on scour characteristics considering different pile group configurations e g square rectangular and circular shapes with various pile numbers and pile spacings amini et al 2012 ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 bayram and larson 2000 ji et al 2018 lança et al 2013 liang et al 2017 ni et al 2021 sheppard 2003 solaimani et al 2017 sumer et al 2005 sumer and fredsøe 1998 wang et al 2016 yagci et al 2017 yifan yang et al 2020a yilin yang et al 2020b thereinto the effects of hydraulic conditions including froude number yilin yang et al 2020b keulegan carpenter number sumer and fredsøe 1998 yifan yang et al 2020a and flow direction lança et al 2013 l ma et al 2018b sheppard 2003 sun et al 2007 yifan yang et al 2020a were also examined besides sumer et al 2007 investigated the effect of relative density of soil on the time scale and depth of scour overall under the given flow condition scour pattern is highly governed by pile spacing according to these flume tests and field surveys for example amini et al 2012 presented four photographs to exhibit the shapes of local scour at pile groups m n 5 3 with different spacings s d 1 0 2 0 3 5 5 0 as summarized in table 1 the scouring process at a pile group behaves like that at a single isolated pile when s 1 d 1 15 d d pile diameter due to the negligible flow pile interaction in the zero or narrow pile spacing once s 1 15 d the flow pile interaction starts to develop but decreases as s increases and there is a critical pile spacing approximately 2 d 5 5 d below which only global scour is formed around the pile group without localized pits at individual piles this is due to the strong interference of scouring at individual piles that wipes out the soils between the piles however when s is greater than the critical pile spacing the localized pits at individual piles emerge as the waning interference of scouring between individual piles when s exceeds the upper bound pile spacing 5 d 12 d scour interference ceases while the localized pits dominate the local scour at the pile group i e the hydraulic group effect vanishes the different result of critical pile spacing is mainly resulted from different flow conditions examined in these flume tests yilin yang et al 2020b it is worthwhile to mention that the flume tests may underestimate the critical pile spacing compared with the field observations probably due to the reduced scale and artificial flow used in the flume tests bayram and larson 2000 palmer 1969 sun et al 2007 in practice pile groups are commonly constructed with s 2 5 d 5 d asshto 2012 bowles 1997 therefore the local scour around a pile group can be reasonably represented by a large global scour hole while the localized pits at individual piles can be neglected or incorporated into the global scour hole as indicated by the field surveys bayram and larson 2000 palmer 1969 sun et al 2007 watson 1974 according to amini et al 2012 2014 the global scour hole was found to be an inverted truncated pyramid with a rounded quadrilateral cross section as illustrated in fig 1 a based on this finding lin and lin 2020 established a scour hole model for a pile group using an inverted rounded truncated pyramid characterized by scour depth s gd bottom width s wb and scour hole slope angle s θ in fig 1 a the scour depth for a pile group is often normalized by an effective group diameter d e so that the comparison between scour at a single pile and a pile group is possible i e s gd d e is comparable to s sd d according to sheppard 2003 d e is the diameter of an equivalent single pile that can develop the same scour depth as the pile group under the same flow and sediment conditions it varies with the number of piles and pile spacing for more details regarding d e readers should refer to sheppard 2003 to advance the understanding of typical ranges of scour hole dimensions for pile groups an extensive literature review was conducted the database of 120 samples of measurements supplementary table s1 is established based on field surveys or flume tests a condensed version of the database is presented in table 2 overall scour hole slope angle for offshore pile groups is in a range of s θ 5 15 bayram and larson 2000 sun et al 2007 which is similar to the observed range of s θ 15 for bridge piers butch 1996 surprisingly these values are much smaller than the typical values 26 6 and 30 used for scour at bridges arneson et al 2012 and marine structures whitehouse 1998 the scour depth for pile groups is mainly in the range of s gd d e 1 2 2 0 fig 2 which is comparable to that for single piles i e s sd d 1 3 2 5 api 2011 dnv 2014 gl 2012 3 existing approaches for post scour vertical effective stress the post scour lateral responses of pile groups can be practically evaluated by incorporating the post scour vertical effective stress into the p y curve framework although the standard methods api fhwa ds and fhwa dp are only applicable to single piles they may be mistakenly used to analyze post scour pile groups this section gives a summary of the standard methods and the method of lin and lin 2020 regarding the estimation of post scour vertical effective stress while the integration of the post scour vertical effective stress σ z sc to the p y curves for pile groups are presented later the standard methods specify different procedures to estimate σ z sc for single piles both api and fhwa ds acknowledge the decrease in vertical effective stress by local scour but the decrease is only limited to a certain depth below the post scour ground surface which is called the influence depth z i below which σ z sc is equal to the pre scour vertical effective stress σ z int and above which σ z sc is linearly increased from the post scour ground surface as illustrated in fig 3 a and mathematically expressed in eq 1 for api the influence depth is three times the local scour depth below the post scour ground surface z i 3 s sd while z i recommended by fhwa ds is only half that suggested by api z i 1 5 s sd however fhwa dp neglects the loss of vertical effective stress by local scour therefore z i 0 and the depth distribution of σ z sc is identical to that of σ z int 1 σ z sc γ z 1 s sd z i for z z i γ s sd z for z z i eq 1 can also be presented in a normalized way using vertical stress ratio 2 σ z sc σ z int z s sd z i z i s sd z for z z i 1 0 for z z i in eqs 1 and 2 s sd is substituted with s gd when they are used for scoured pile groups to extend the solution for σ z sc for single piles lin and wu 2019 to that for square pile groups lin and lin 2020 suggest an equivalent scour hole model an inverted truncated cone in fig 3 b which has the same bottom area a b and scour hole slope angle s θ as the scour hole at the pile group an inverted rounded truncated pyramid the vertical effective stress for the pile in the center of the equivalent scour hole is calculated by eq 3 and used as σ z sc for all piles in the group 3 σ z sc γ z 1 s gd tan s θ s wc s gd tan s θ s wc 2 z 2 s wc s wc 2 z 2 tan s θ where γ is the effective unit weight of soil z is the depth below the post scour ground surface s wc is the distance from the scour bottom perimeter to the center pile s wc a b π d 2 as mentioned in the introduction section lin and lin s method involves several simplifications which may limit its application and cause unnecessary conservatism firstly it assumes a pile group to be square which is not always true in practice since the pile group can be rectangular when supporting jetty pier structures and bridges secondly it assumes equal σ z sc around individual piles within a group leading to underestimated σ z sc at individual piles except the center pile particularly for a large scale pile group because when s wc 3 d the local scour effect is equivalent to a general scour effect lin and lin 2020 this also leads to no difference in active or passive earth pressure between the back row and the leading row and thus incorrect responses of the lateral capacity of pile group to the change in s θ lin and lin 2020 lastly it neglects the soil pile interface friction lin and jiang 2019 that can effectively retain the soil effective stress at the piles and prevent the scour induced loss in σ z sc therefore it necessitates the development of a rigorous approach to overcoming the foregoing limitations 4 proposed methods to appropriately analyze laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions an improved analytical method iam is proposed based on the results of iam a practical approach called the influence depth method idm is developed the two methods are implemented in matlab allowing for analyzing post scour vertical effective stresses and lateral responses of pile groups 4 1 post scour vertical effective stresses around piles as discussed in section 2 a scour hole at a pile group can be featured by a frustum with a rounded rectangle cross section amini et al 2012 2014 as shown in fig 1 a it is also possible that a more complicated scour hole shape featuring uneven scour bottom and unequal slope angles can exist in large pile groups involving great pile spacings and or pile numbers liang et al 2017 sumer et al 2005 yilin yang et al 2020b however as will be discussed later for most scour cases considered in this study this simplified uniform scour hole shape is considered to be proper and the effect of the simplification is quantified through a comparative study in section 4 3 in the proposed iam the scour hole shape is slightly modified by substituting the rounded edges with the sharp edges for mathematical convenience note that this simplified scour hole with sharp edges is also adopted by the centrifuge tests kariyawasam et al 2020 while both frustums sharing the same bottom area of the scour hole a b l b w b and scour hole slope angle s θ thereinto l b and w b are the length and width of the scour hole bottom respectively both frustums also share the same length to width ratio l b w b a cartesian coordinate system is established to define the scour hole dimensions with its origin being placed on the upper left corner of the scour hole bottom and y and z axes pointing to the lateral loading and downward direction respectively in fig 1 a the post scour vertical effective stress is calculated by superposition of two components of vertical effective stresses resulting from soil overburden below and above the post scour ground surface i e σ z sc σ z δ σ z the former is easily calculated using σ z γ z the latter δ σ z called additional vertical effective stress is determined by a series of soil columns fig 1 b which have a width of δ x δ y 0 02 d and varied heights of h j 0 s gd within the sloping ground domain sidewall but a larger width of δ x δ y 0 07 d and a constant height of h j s gd within the leveled pre scour ground domain furthermore individual piles are reduced to vertical lines as d is significantly smaller than the soil domain and the pile diameter effect was found to be negligible lin and wu 2019 the value of δ σ z is then calculated using boussinesq s point load solution by integrating the contribution from the weights of soil columns the integration is done over a finite area with boundaries located 60 5 w b and 60 5 l b from the center of the scour hole bottom on x and y directions respectively fig 1 b beyond which soil overburden has no contribution to δ σ z 4 1 1 consideration of entire overburden zone assuming the overburden or remaining soils above the post scour ground is discretized into j soil columns and all the soil columns contribute to δ σ z at an individual pile according to boussinesq s solution therefore δ σ z for different piles in an m n group at a given depth z can be expressed as 4 δ σ z 1 δ σ z 2 δ σ z m n m n 1 ψ 1 1 ψ 1 2 ψ 2 1 ψ 2 2 ψ 1 j ψ 2 j ψ m n 1 ψ m n 2 ψ m n j m n j p 1 p 2 p j m n j where p j is the weight of the j t h soil column p j γ h j δ x δ y ψ i j is the influence factor depending on the distance l i j between the point of interest in the i t h pile to the center of the j t h soil column bottom 5 ψ i j 3 z 3 2 π x p x s 2 y p y s 2 z 2 2 5 i 1 2 m n and j 1 2 j where x s y s and x p y p represent the coordinates of the j t h soil column and the i t h pile respectively z is the depth of point of interest in the i t h pile below the post scour ground once δ σ z is determined from eq 4 post scour vertical stresses at individual piles within a group for a given depth z can be calculated by 6 σ z sc 1 σ z sc 2 σ z sc m n m n 1 η δ σ z 1 δ σ z 2 δ σ z m n m n 1 γ z γ z γ z m n 1 σ z int σ z int σ z int m n 1 besides the vertical stress ratios σ z sc σ z int for individual piles at depth z are 7 σ z sc 1 σ z int σ z sc 2 σ z int σ z sc m n σ z int m n 1 1 γ z s gd σ z sc 1 σ z sc 2 σ z sc m n m n 1 1 1 1 m n 1 in eq 6 η is a semi empirical correction factor to account for the effect of soil pile interface friction on retaining vertical effective stress in soils after scouring this value is back calculated by matching the σ z sc σ z int profile calculated from eqs 4 7 to that from 3d fem e g fig 4 through parametric analyses considering various scour hole depth scour hole slope angle sand relative density pile spacing and number of piles η was found to primarily depend on the scour hole depth and pile spacing and can be expressed as η f d f s where f d and f s are factors considering the effects of s gd and s respectively for the typical ranges of s gd and s encountered in practice η can be determined by table 3 the preceding procedure invoking eqs 4 7 constitutes the first step of the proposed iam concerning the calculation of σ z sc considering the contribution of the entire overburden zone the iam can be further utilized to derive the influence depth z i for different pile groups and scour hole dimensions using equivalent stress ratio area invoking eq 8 the stress ratio area a e calculated using σ z sc σ z int determined from eqs 4 7 is equal to that calculated using σ z sc σ z int determined by eq 3 8 a e 0 l e 1 σ z sc σ z int d z where a e represents the area enclosed by the right vertical axis and σ z sc σ z int profile e g fig 4 using this procedure a typical range of z i is obtained as given in figs 5 and 6 for a 3 3 pile group for other sizes of pile groups the values are presented in supplementary tables s3 s8 by substituting z i into eq 1 σ z sc at individual piles can be obtained this forms part of the proposed idm in relation to the calculation of post scour vertical effective stress 4 1 2 consideration of separate overburden zones in eqs 4 7 δ σ z and σ z sc are calculated considering the total influence of the overburden above the post scour ground surface however when integrating the calculated σ z sc into p y curves the calculated lateral soil resistances for the leading and back rows are identical which is not reasonable to capture the difference in lateral soil resistance the wedge failure model was adopted for scoured single piles lin et al 2014 however the application of the wedge failure model for a pile group is untenable as the difficulty in considering the geotechnical group effect and scour hole geometry to address this issue the preceding procedure for σ z sc was improved by dividing the overburden above the post scour ground surface into different zones and separately evaluating δ σ z and σ z sc as illustrated in fig 1 b when a pile group is under lateral load the overburden pressure contributing to δ σ z can be divided into a passive earth pressure zone an active earth pressure zone and an intermediate zone instead of calculating δ σ z considering the entire overburden above the post scour ground surface δ σ z a and δ σ z p are separately evaluated considering the overburden within the intermediate active pressure zone and the intermediate passive pressure zone respectively mathematically δ σ z a and δ σ z p are calculated by substituting j a the number of soil columns within the intermediate active pressure zone and j p the number of soil columns within the intermediate passive pressure zone respectively for j in eq 4 subsequently post scour vertical effective stresses corresponding to the intermediate active pressure zone and intermediate passive pressure zone σ z a sc and σ z p sc are obtained by substituting δ σ z a and σ z p into eq 6 respectively this constitutes part of the proposed iam in relation to the calculation of the post scour vertical effective stresses considering the effects of the separate overburden zones 4 2 post scour lateral responses of pile group the next part of the proposed iam and idm is to incorporate the post scour vertical effective stress into the p y curve framework this step requires calculating an equivalent depth z e by dividing the post scour vertical effective stress by soil effective unit weight substitution of z e into existing p y curves e g reese s p y curves for sands reese and van impe 2001 for pile groups results in the modified p y curves that can account for laterally loaded pile groups under different scour hole dimensions the above mentioned step is also used when the standard methods are employed the post scour vertical effective stresses calculated considering the entire overburden zone will be used by the standard methods and the idm while those considering separate overburden zones are used by the iam note that the iam considering the entire overburden zone eqs 4 7 is only used for the purpose of deriving the idm 4 2 1 consideration of entire overburden zone the equivalent depths z e of the idm and the standard methods are calculated from eq 9 where σ z sc is calculated by substituting z i developed in this study and suggested by the standard methods respectively into eq 1 the post scour p y curves for group piles are developed by substituting z e for z in reese s p y relationship reese and van impe 2001 as presented in eqs 10 14 9 z e σ z sc γ 10 p f m k z e y y y k f m p m y m λ y λ y k y y m f m p m y y m p u p m y u y m y m y y u f m p u y y u where f m is the p multiplier that considers the geotechnical group effect y m d 60 y u 3 d 80 k is the p y modulus taken as 34 16 3 5 4 mn m3 for the submerged dense medium dense and loose sands respectively api 2011 the other parameters p u p m y k λ are related to the ultimate lateral soil resistance per unit length of a pile p ult 11 p u a s p ult 12 p m b s p ult where a s and b s are the static load type factors that can be determined by substituting z e d for z d in reese s p y curves y k and λ are obtained from y k p m k z e y m λ 1 1 λ and λ y m p u p m p m y u y m respectively p ult is taken as the smaller value of eqs 13 and 14 13 p ult s γ z e tan β z e tan β tan α d tan β φ k 0 z e tan φ sin β tan β φ cos α k 0 z e tan β tan φ sin β tan α k a d 14 p ult d γ z e d k a tan 8 β 1 k 0 tan φ tan 4 β where p ult s and p ult d are ultimate soil resistance per unit length of a pile at shallow and great depths respectively α φ 2 β 45 φ 2 k a tan 2 45 φ 2 and k 0 1 sin φ are active and at rest earth pressure coefficients respectively for normally consolidated soils 4 2 2 consideration of separate overburden zones the proposed iam employs σ z a sc and σ z p sc to account for the differences in the active and passive earth pressures between the back row and the leading row in contributing to the lateral soil resistances the corresponding equivalent depths are calculated using z ea σ z a sc γ and z ep σ z p sc γ respectively for the ultimate lateral resistance at shallow depths p ult s a close examination of eq 13 reveals that it consists of the components related to the active and passive earth pressures therefore eqs 11 13 are modified to calculate p ult s incorporating σ z a sc and σ z p sc given by 15 p u a sp γ z ep k 0 tan β z ep tan β tan α d k 0 tan β φ z ep tan φ sin β tan β φ cos α z ep tan β

sp are the static load type factors dependent on z ea d and z ep d respectively reese and van impe 2001 however soil failure at a great depth typically follows a plane flow mode therefore the lateral soil resistance at a great depth p ult d is influenced by the entire overburden above the post scour ground surface and in this case eq 14 is still used in summary for the iam the post scour p y curves are developed using eqs 10 12 and 14 when p ult p ult d but eqs 10 15 and 16 when p ult p ult s for the idm or the standard methods eqs 10 14 are invoked 4 3 implementation and validation the post scour p y curves developed from the above procedures were incorporated into the euler bernoulli beam equation reese and van impe 2001 to analyze the laterally loaded pile groups considering different scour hole conditions a central finite difference algorithm with newton s iteration was developed in matlab to implement the calculations the matlab code is attached as a supplementary file as discussed in the introduction no field tests or centrifuge tests regarding scoured pile groups can be used to validate the proposed methods therefore the proposed iam and idm were verified against a series of 3d continuum fe results computed by the authors lin and lin 2020 and compared with the standard methods api fhwa dp and fhwa ds and the method of lin and lin 2020 in the 3d fe model lin and lin 2020 the pile was simulated as an elastic material using continuum solid elements while soil as an elastoplastic material with mohr coulomb failure criterion soil parameters were back calculated from a full scale load test on a single pile brown et al 1988 and the baseline 3d fe model for a pile group established using the calibrated soil parameters was verified against a full scale test of a laterally loaded pile group 3 3 s 3 d at the same site as the single pile brown et al 1988 the pile head of individual piles in the pile group was pin connected through a frame and thus was free for rotation while moving equally horizontally the baseline model was for a pre scour condition while the scour hole was created from the baseline model by deactivating the soil elements that were intended to be scoured away the scour depth ranged from 0 to 6 d 0 to 2 8 d e and scour hole slope angle from 0 to 42 one degree less than soil friction angle while scour bottom width remained zero greater details of the 3d fe model can be referred to lin and lin 2020 table 4 shows the soil and pile parameters and the pile head was 0 305 m above the ground surface corresponding to the pre scour ground in this study it is noted that mohr coulomb constitutive model that adopts an elastic perfectly plastic relation has inherent limitations for example it could not evaluate the stress dependent soil stiffness which however can be significant for sands gouw 2014 therefore an advanced model such as strain hardening model may be more proper however the present study has validated the fe model using mohr coulomb constitutive relation against the pile group test brown et al 1988 with the soil parameters back calculated from another field test for a single isolated pile at the same site this indicates that the numerical model in this study is still acceptable besides as discussed in section 4 1 the scour hole shape adopted by this study fig 1 is to some extent simplified from a more complex scour scenario featuring uneven scour hole bottom as well as unequal upstream and downstream side slope angles therefore a preliminary comparative study was conducted herein using 3d fem to quantify the difference between a complex scour hole scenario and a simplified uniform scour hole scenario in terms of the lateral capacity of pile group where the lateral capacity was the lateral load causing 1 inch deflection at the pile head lin and wu 2019 the comparative study investigated the post scour lateral capacities of the 3 3 pile group brown et al 1988 under four different scour hole scenarios illustrated in supplementary fig s1 and the detailed scour hole dimensions are summarized in supplementary table s2 meanwhile the pile spacing was set to be 5 d so that the localized pits could be formed at individual piles as discussed in section 2 by comparing the lateral capacities corresponding to these four different scour hole cases fig s2 simplifying an asymmetrical and uneven scour hole as a uniform scour hole could underestimate the post scour lateral capacity of pile group by 10 13 this indicates that the simplification was conservative and its effect was not significant it is acknowledged that a further study is warranted to explore the limitations of the simplified scour hole model for other sizes of pile group or improve the analytical method to directly account for the nonuniform scour hole conditions overall using the proposed iam and idm lin and lin s method and standard methods api fhwa dp and fhwa ds a total of 288 parametric analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of scour hole depth 0 to 6 0 d or 2 8 d e scour hole slope angle 0 42 soil relative density loose medium dense pile spacing 2 d 6 d number of piles 4 16 piles and pile group configuration square rectangular on the post scour lateral responses of pile groups the details of the parametric analyses are summarized in table 5 5 results and discussion the results of post scour vertical effective stress and lateral responses of pile groups are presented focusing on the demonstration of the efficacy of the proposed methods iam and idm and the appraisal of the existing methods mentioned in section 3 note that the calibrated 3d fe model lin and lin 2020 was used to validate the iam and idm and to evaluate the existing methods prior to presenting the results the effect of soil pile interface friction quantified by η and the determination of influence depth z i are discussed fig 4 a c show the computed σ z sc σ z int profiles of the center corner and edge piles respectively for the 3 d spaced 3 3 pile group with s gd 2 8 d e 6 d s wb 0 and s θ 26 6 also shown in fig 4 is the influence depth z i when the soil pile interface friction effects were neglected i e dropping out η in eq 6 iam that considers the entire overburden zone eqs 4 7 and idm yielded smaller σ z sc σ z int than the 3d fem this is because the effect of soil pile interface friction lin and jiang 2019 was ignored when η was precluded contrarily with the inclusion of η iam and idm yielded a much better comparison with the 3d fem therefore for the following analyses only iam and idm with η table 3 are considered fig 4 also reveals that the proposed influence depths denoted by circles determined from eqs 4 8 were 2 12 s gd center pile 2 25 s gd corner pile and 2 10 s gd edge pile which are similar to the benchmark values 1 94 s gd 2 22 s gd and 2 13 s gd determined from the 3d fem denoted by rhombus symbols 5 1 post scour vertical effective stresses around piles the vertical effective stresses under local scour conditions are discussed in terms of the influence depth a greater z i indicates a deeper influence and thus a greater loss in the vertical effective stress caused by the local scour 5 1 1 effect of scour hole depth on the influence depth the proposed influence depths under different s gd were determined by back calculating from the results of iam and they were compared with those determined by the 3d fem and recommended by the standard methods as indicated in fig 5 the results for different positions of piles agreed well with the 3d fe results showing a nonlinear decrease in z i with increased s gd for example z i decreased by 61 39 and 30 for the center edge and corner piles respectively as s gd increased from 0 to 2 8 d e 6 d the results further indicate that σ z sc reflected by z i varied with the pile position in the pile group with deeper z i at the center pile than the edge piles and corner piles this means that local scour caused a larger loss and a deeper influence in the vertical effective stress at the center pile than the perimeter piles in contrast the standard methods that recommend a constant z i failed to capture the nonlinear relationship and the variation of z i with the pile position however the influence depth suggested by api z i 3 s gd was comparable to that from idm and 3d fem when s gd 1 4 d e the influence depth suggested by fhwa ds z i 1 5 s gd served as a lower bound of idm and 3d fem showing increasing agreement as s gd increased while that by fhwa dp was incorrect as it ignored the local scour effects on the soil stress reduction 5 1 2 effect of pile spacing on the influence depth fig 6 presents variations of influence depth with pile spacing when s gd 3 d s wb 0 s θ 26 6 note that s gd is normalized by d since the effective diameter d e is no longer constant under varied pile spacing overall z i increased as s increased with that at the center pile increasing more significantly than at the edge and corner piles this result is attributed to the reduced soil pile interactions with increased s as indicated by f s in table 3 again this was captured by the idm and 3d fem but not by the standard methods in comparison fhwa ds z i 1 5 s d and api z i 3 s d only agreed with idm and 3d fem when s 2 d and 3 d respectively 5 2 post scour lateral responses of pile groups for a laterally loaded pile group geotechnical group effect is usually characterized by p multiplier f m which can be obtained from load tests 3d continuum fe analyses alternatively typical values of f m can be referenced to design standards in this study f m was back calculated from the abovementioned 3d fe results lin and lin 2020 and compared with the typical values obtained from the field tests brown et al 1988 mokwa 1999 and design recommendations asshto 2012 fema 2012 reese et al 1996 reese and van impe 2001 u s army corps of engineers 1991 as shown in fig 7 overall the back calculated f m was within the range suggested by the design recommendations and field tests as with fayyazi et al 2014 f m back calculated from the 3d continuum numerical model was smaller than the recommended values asshto 2012 fema 2012 reese et al 1996 reese and van impe 2001 particularly for the back row asshto 2012 generally agreed well with f m obtained from field tests and 3d fem for s 4 d rollins et al 2006 contrarily f m values per u s army corps of engineers 1991 were in general small and conservative particularly for the leading row note that the above back calculated f m was obtained in the no scour condition and was reasonably assumed to remain unchanged after scouring lin and lin 2020 in this section the post scour lateral responses of pile groups are presented including the lateral capacity ratio load share and bending moment the effects of scour hole depth scour hole slope angle soil relative density pile spacing and pile group configuration on the post scour lateral responses were evaluated with the ranges of input parameters given in table 5 5 2 1 effect of scour hole depth fig 8 shows the lateral load deflection curves at the pile head 3 3 pile group before and after scouring overall the proposed methods iam and idm yielded agreeable results with the 3d fem at different scour depths in contrast lin and lin s method predicted smaller lateral loads at a given deflection to assess the effects of scour hole dimensions a lateral capacity defined as the post scour to the pre scour lateral capacity of a pile group was adopted the lateral capacity was the lateral load causing 1 inch deflection at the pile head lin and wu 2019 generally a smaller lateral capacity ratio indicates a greater scour induced loss in the lateral capacity fig 9 shows the lateral capacity ratio of the 3 d spaced 3 3 pile group varied with s gd calculated using different methods from the 3d fe analyses the lateral capacity ratio decreased from 1 to 0 42 when s gd increased from 0 to 2 8 d e or 6 d indicating a 58 loss in the lateral capacity surprisingly despite applying only for single piles fhwa ds produced the most agreeable results of scoured pile groups as compared with the 3d fem with the difference of 4 to 10 the proposed methods iam and idm and api also compared well with the 3d fem with the difference of 0 to 14 while the method of lin and lin 2020 underestimated the lateral capacity ratio by up to 22 in contrast fhwa dp considerably overestimated the lateral capacity ratio by up to 47 as the neglect of scour induced loss in the vertical effective stress the above results demonstrate that all the methods assessed except fhwa dp are suitable for use when s θ 26 6 and the iam is approved to be an improvement over lin and lin 2020 fig 10 shows load shares of pile rows varied with s gd the load share of each row is defined as the lateral load carried by the pile row divided by the total load applied to the pile group that mobilized the pile head laterally by 1 inch the load share from the 3d fem increased by 10 for the back row but decreased by 6 for the leading row when s gd increased from 0 to 2 8 d e this result indicates that as local scour intensified the back row attracted more lateral load while the leading row took less lateral load fig 10 also shows that the proposed iam exhibited a better match with the 3d fem than the other methods which indirectly verifies the assumption that f m remained unchanged with the change in s gd as mentioned in section 5 1 furthermore fig 11 a c profile the bending moment of piles in the back middle and leading rows respectively compared with the 3d fem fhwa dp overestimated the average bending moments of back row middle row and leading row piles by up to 39 53 and 50 respectively while all the other methods including iam and idm produced consistent and agreeable estimates in general maximum bending moments decreased by 17 20 when s gd increased from 0 7 d e to 2 8 d e i e 1 5 d to 6 d meanwhile the location of the maximum bending moment moved downward relative to the pile top by 2 4 d 3 0 d 5 2 2 effect of scour hole slope angle fig 12 shows the lateral capacity ratio for s θ 0 42 while the other scour hole dimensions were maintained constant s gd 1 4 d e s wb 0 when s θ 0 a local scour turned into a general scour while the upper bound of the scour hole slope angle s θ 42 was set to be less than the internal friction angle of sand φ 43 the results by the proposed methods iam and idm showed similar trends to the 3d fem i e the lateral capacity ratios increased with the increase in s θ although the magnitudes were slightly lower but conservative and the difference in the magnitude was attributed to the discrepancy of lateral capacity ratio existed at s θ 0 moreover both iam and idm were superior to lin and lin 2020 as compared with the 3d fem when s θ decreased from 26 to 0 the lateral capacity ratio decreased by 25 this indicates that simplifying a local scour as a general scour which is commonly used in practice for foundation design could underestimate the lateral capacity of a pile group by up to 25 contrarily the results of the standard methods were all featured by a constant line as they could not consider the changes in s θ or s wb fhwa dp on average overestimated the lateral capacity ratio by 28 when s θ 0 42 although fhwa ds compared well with the 3d fem when s θ 20 42 it overestimated the lateral capacity ratio by up to 20 when s θ 20 which is unsafe for a scoured pile group the existing data table 2 showed that s θ could be less than 15 bayram and larson 2000 butch 1996 harris and whitehouse 2014 sun et al 2007 in this circumstance fhwa ds could yield an unconservative design api generally gave conservative results except s θ 5 in which it overestimated the lateral capacity ratio by up to 8 fig 13 shows load shares of pile rows varied with s θ as previously mentioned the soil lateral resistance to the leading row is different from that to the back row in general the leading row is anticipated to resist more lateral load with increased s θ as higher passive earth pressures developed in front of it and the opposite is anticipated for the back row as higher active pressures developed behind it this phenomenon was manifested by the 3d fem and iam fig 13 showing a higher lateral load on the leading row but a lower lateral load on the back row as s θ increased although the changes in the load shares estimated by the iam were slightly narrower than those by the 3d fem the trends were similar however the other methods gave insignificant or no changes in load share with increased s θ which is incorrect the reason is that the increases in the active earth pressure to the back row and the passive earth pressure to the leading row due to the increased s θ were not considered in these methods 5 2 3 effect of soil relative density besides the influences of scour hole dimensions effects of soil condition on the post scour lateral responses of pile groups were examined as shown in fig 14 when s gd increased from 0 to 2 8 d e scour induced loss in the lateral capacity was 58 50 and 45 for the pile group in dense medium dense and loose sands respectively from the 3d fem similar results were also obtained by the iam 65 57 and 53 and idm 64 55 and 51 these results indicate that scour caused more loss in the lateral capacity up to 13 of the pile group in dense sands than in loose sands particularly for greater s gd overall the proposed methods iam and idm provided better estimations of lateral capacity ratio than lin and lin 2020 in addition pile bending moments were profiled in various soil conditions but under the same scour hole dimensions s wb 0 s gd 1 4 d e s θ 26 6 fig 15 shows that the bending moments determined by the iam and idm were comparable with those by the 3d fem in general the maximum bending moment increased with the increased relative density of sands and the increases were 71 76 and 57 70 by the iam and 3d fem respectively meanwhile the location of the maximum bending moment shifted downward by 2 1 d when the relative density increased from loose to dense 5 2 4 effects of pile spacing and number of piles as mentioned in section 2 in contrast to scour at a single isolated pile scour at a pile group is influenced not only by hydraulic conditions e g froude number keulegan carpenter number flow direction but also pile group conditions e g pile spacing pile number pile group configuration due to the hydraulic group effects i e reinforcement sheltering shed vortices and jetting effects in general reinforcement and sheltering effects that intensify scour at the upstream pile can be attenuated by increasing the pile spacing in line with the flow likewise jetting effect that wipes out soils between side by side piles as the compression of inner arms of horseshoe vortices can also be weakened by increasing the pile spacing normal to the flow moreover shed vortices that intensify scour at the downstream pile on the path of wake vortices are more significant in a staggered pile group arrangement hosseini and amini 2015 lança et al 2013 sumer and fredsøe 1998 therefore the following two sections will focus on the effects of pile spacing pile number and pile group configuration on the post scour responses of pile group as indicated by table 1 global scour could develop and dominate the scour hole geometry at pile groups when s 5 5 d here we assume global scour occurred for s 2 d 6 d which covers the typical range of spacing in the general design of pile groups fig 16 shows the lateral capacity ratio varied with the pile spacing when s wb 0 s gd 3 d and s θ 26 6 based on the 3d fe analyses the lateral capacity ratio decreased by 4 as s increased from 2 d to 6 d the proposed methods iam and idm yielded agreeable lateral capacity ratios with the 3d fem with differences less than 0 1 as with figs 9 and 12 api produced similar results to iam and idm while fhwa dp significantly overestimated the lateral capacity ratio which is unsafe although fhwa ds produced the best comparable results with the 3d fem when s θ 26 6 it could overestimate the lateral capacity ratio when s θ 20 as shown in fig 12 which is also unsafe furthermore the effect of the number of piles on the lateral capacity ratio was investigated by considering three sizes of pile groups 2 2 s gd 3 d 1 97 d e 3 3 s gd 3 d 1 40 d e and 4 4 s gd 3 d 1 05 d e as shown in table 6 the effect of increasing the number of piles on the lateral capacity ratio was negligible displaying only a slight increase 4 compared with the 3d fem iam and idm underestimated lateral capacity ratios by 13 and 9 respectively while lin and lin s method by 18 however fhwa dp overestimated it by 24 again for s θ 26 6 which is greater than 20 fhwa ds agreed best with the 3d fem and api yielded similar results to the 3d fem and iam 5 2 5 effect of pile group configuration the previous results were determined for the square pile group a prerequisite assumed by the method of lin and lin 2020 the proposed methods iam and idm were developed for different shaped pile groups to assess the effect of pile group configuration pile groups with three configurations m n 6 5 10 3 15 2 but the same number of piles 30 and spacing s 3 d were evaluated using the iam and idm under local scour conditions for comparison purposes it is assumed that the standard methods fig 3 might be applied to the scoured pile groups with rectangular configurations the p multipliers used for the three pile groups were evaluated from asshto 2012 fig 7 the lateral capacity ratios were computed for different scour depths s gd 0 7 d e 2 8 d e s θ 26 6 s wb 0 supplementary fig s3 and different scour hole slope angles s θ 0 26 6 s gd 2 8 d e s wb 0 supplementary fig s4 fig 17 was reduced from supplementary figs s3 and s4 by selecting a given scour hole depth s gd 1 4 d e to evaluate the shape effect surprisingly increasing the aspect ratio of the pile group approximately equal to m n resulted in an increase in the lateral capacity ratio for the case analyzed the lateral capacity ratio increased by 57 when m n increased from 1 2 to 7 5 in other words given the same number of piles m n the square pile group could subject to more scour induced loss in the lateral capacity than the rectangular pile group the standard methods api fhwa dp and fhwa ds could also capture this trend although they might not be technically correct 6 conclusions this study proposed a new approach called the improved analytical method iam for analyzing the laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions drawing on the iam and the concept of influence depth in the standard methods api fhwa dp and fhwa ds a simple and practical influence depth method idm was also proposed the proposed methods iam and idm were validated against the results of the 3d fe model that was calibrated against a full scale load test two matlab programs were developed to implement the iam and idm with which 288 parametric analyses were performed to evaluate the factors scour hole depth scour hole slope angle soil relative density pile spacing number of piles and pile group configuration affecting the post scour behavior of pile groups in sands the standard methods and the method of lin and lin 2020 were critically assessed in the parametric study the following conclusions were obtained from this study 1 compared with the 3d fem the proposed iam and idm produced agreeable and conservative estimates of the lateral capacity and maximum bending moment of pile groups fhwa dp significantly overestimated the lateral capacity which is thus unsafe and not recommended for use for typical scour hole dimensions s θ 26 6 or 30 recommended in practices api and fhwa ds could be used to yield agreeable prediction of the lateral capacity however when s θ 20 as often encountered in the field per the literature survey api and fhwa ds overestimated the lateral capacity and therefore are unsafe 2 the increase in scour hole depth s gd decreased the lateral capacity and maximum bending moment of pile groups and shifted the location of the maximum bending moment toward the post scour ground surface besides more lateral loads were transferred to the back row as s gd increased the proposed iam yielded a better prediction of the load share as compared with the 3d fem than the standard methods and lin and lin s method 3 the lateral capacity and maximum bending moment increased as the scour hole slope angle s θ increased the increase in s θ increased the load share of the leading row but decreased the load share of the back row which was only captured by the iam and 3d fem while neither the standard methods nor lin and lin s method could capture the change in load share with s θ 4 although adopting a larger pile spacing s could reduce the geotechnical group effect scour induced reduction in the lateral capacity increased as s increased given the same local scour depth the scour induced decrease in the lateral capacity was more significant in the square pile group than the rectangular pile group loading along the length of the pile group given the same total number of piles therefore the use of a pile group in rectangular configuration is recommended in the foundation design against scour credit authorship contribution statement wenyu jiang conceptualization methodology software validation formal

20821,in this paper we investigate the dynamics of the inertial sea wave energy converter iswec device using fully resolved computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations originally prototyped by the polytechnic university of turin the device consists of a floating boat shaped hull that is slack moored to the sea bed internally a gyroscopic power take off pto unit converts the wave induced pitch motion of the hull into electrical energy the cfd model is based on the incompressible navier stokes equations and utilizes the fictitious domain brinkman penalization fd bp technique to couple the device physics and water wave dynamics a numerical wave tank is used to generate both regular waves based on fifth order stokes theory and irregular waves based on the jonswap spectrum to emulate realistic sea operating conditions a froude scaling analysis is performed to enable two and three dimensional simulations for a scaled down 1 20 iswec model it is demonstrated that the scaled down 2d model is sufficient to accurately simulate the hull s pitching motion and to predict the power generation capability of the converter a systematic parameter study of the iswec is conducted and its optimal performance in terms of power generation is determined based on the hull and gyroscope control parameters it is demonstrated that the device achieves peak performance when the gyroscope specifications are chosen based on the reactive control theory it is shown that a proportional control of the pto control torque is required to generate continuous gyroscopic precession effects without which the device generates no power in an inertial reference frame it is demonstrated that the yaw and pitch torques acting on the hull are of the same order of magnitude informing future design investigations of the iswec technology further an energy transfer pathway from the water waves to the hull the hull to the gyroscope and the gyroscope to the pto unit is analytically described and numerically verified additional parametric analysis demonstrates that a hull length to wavelength ratio between one half and one third yields high conversion efficiency ratio of power absorbed by the pto unit to wave power per unit crest width finally device protection during inclement weather conditions is emulated by gradually reducing the gyroscope flywheel speed to zero and the resulting dynamics are investigated keywords renewable energy wave structure interaction brinkman penalization method numerical wave tank level set method adaptive mesh refinement 1 introduction ocean waves are a substantial source of renewable energy with an estimated 2 11 0 05 tw available globally gunn and stock williams 2012 for perspective the united states generated 3 7 twy terawatt years 1 1 1 twy 8 76 1 0 12 kwh worth of energy in 2013 making up about 20 of the world s total energy production of this amount only about 9 or 0 33 twy was generated from renewable sources it is estimated that the us will produce approximately 8 65 twy by 2050 korde and ringwood 2016 there is an ever increasing need to invest in renewable energy harvesting techniques in order to accelerate economic growth while maintaining a safe and healthy planet earth wave energy conversion is one of the crucial strategies towards realizing future energy sustainability it is estimated that about 230 twh year of wave energy can be extracted from the east coast and about 590 twh year from the west coast of the united states alone in spite of this abundantly available energy source there is currently no commercial scale wave power operation that exists today there are several unique challenges specific to wave energy extraction processes including hostile ocean environments saltwater corrosion stochasticity of ocean and sea waves and costly offshore wave farm setup nevertheless steady progress is being made both in the design and engineering analyses of wave energy extraction devices which are known as wave energy converters wecs consequently several wec designs have been proposed over the years after gaining popularity following the 1970s oil crisis however unlike wind turbines an ultimate wec architecture has not yet been identified by researchers one wec design that addresses some of the critical wave energy extraction challenges is the inertial sea wave energy converter iswec device prototyped by the polytechnic university of turin bracco et al 2011 cagninei et al 2015 vissio 2017 this device consists of a floating boat shaped hull that is slack moored to the seabed which internally houses a gyroscopic power take off unit pto see fig 1 the iswec can be classified as a pitching point absorber whose dimensions are shorter than the length of the water waves the device utilizes precession effects produced from the spinning gyroscope and pitching hull to drive a sealed electric generator pto the rotational velocity of the spinning gyroscope and the pto control torque act as sea state tuning parameters that can be optimized controlled in real time or via remote human machine interfaces to enhance the conversion efficiency of the device since all crucial electro mechanical parts are sealed within the hull the iswec is a robust and cost effective wave energy conversion technology due to its simple design devices can be produced by retrofitting abandoned ships which can potentially reduce manufacturing costs and lead to easy adoption of the technology moreover such devices could be lined up end to end just offshore which would not only ensure maximal wave energy absorption but also protection of the coastline although iswec devices have only recently been prototyped since their inception in 2011 by bracco et al 2011 2009 2010a b 2012 their design and performance has been of much interest to the greater research community in the past few years medeiros and brizzolara 2018 used the boundary element method bem based on linear potential flow equations to simulate the iswec and evaluate its power generation capabilities as a function of flywheel speed and derivative control of the pto torque they also demonstrated that the spinning gyroscopes can induce yaw torque on the hull faedo et al used an alternative moment matching based approach to model the radiation force convolution integral thereby overcoming the computational and representational drawbacks of simulating iswec devices using the bem based cummins equation faedo et al 2018 although these lower fidelity methods are able to simulate iswec dynamics at low computational costs they are unable to resolve highly nonlinear phenomena often seen during practical operation such as wave breaking and wave overtopping unsurprisingly the turin group has extensively used carefully calibrated with respect to wave tank experiments bem models to refine and optimize their preliminary designs bracco et al 2015 2019 raffero et al 2015 bracco et al 2016 in contrast simulations based on the incompressible navier stokes ins equations are able to resolve the wave structure interaction wsi quite accurately and without making small motion approximations employed by low fidelity bem models ruehl et al 2014 yu and li 2013 however fully resolved ins simulations are computationally expensive and typically require high performance computing hpc frameworks a compromise between the linear bem and fully nonlinear cfd models is the nonlinear bem framework in which nonlinear wave excitation froude krylov forces are used to simulate the device dynamics based on its instantaneous wetted surface recent studies novo et al 2018 penalba et al 2017 giorgi et al 2020 have successfully simulated the wec dynamics considering the nonlinear effects arising from the device geometry viscous forces and wave excitation forces using the nonlinear bem framework the nonlinear effects can be important particularly when an aggressive control is used for a wec device which may push the device to operate in a nonlinear dynamical regime although fully nonlinear cfd models are computationally expensive nevertheless in a preliminary study bergmann et al enabled fully resolved simulation of the iswec s wave structure interaction by making use of an ins based flow solver coupled to an immersed boundary method bergmann et al 2015 the wave propagation in their channel followed the canonical dam break problem setup nangia et al 2019a a column of water is released from one end of the channel which is then reflected from the opposite end and so forth although such simple wave propagation models are not suitable to study the device performance at a real site of operation bergmann et al were able to capture key device dynamics in their simulations in addition to these research efforts industry has become interested in piloting and manufacturing these devices recently the multinational oil and gas corporation eni installed an iswec device off the coast of ravenna 2 2 https www eni com en it operations iswec eni html near their offshore assets it is clear that there is a need to further investigate iswec dynamics and explore the design space to enable rapid adoption of this technology possibly through an industry academic partnership in this work we perform a comprehensive study of the iswec device using high fidelity simulations from a previously developed fictitious domain brinkman penalization fd bp method based on the incompressible navier stokes equations bhalla et al 2020 although the methodology is similar to the work of bergmann et al we consider more realistic operating conditions by using a numerical wave tank nwt to generate both regular and irregular water waves we conduct a systematic variation of control parameters i e pto control torque flywheel moment of inertia and speed hull length to determine the optimal performance of the device in term of power generation and study its dynamics as a function of these parameters we also provide a theoretical basis to obtain the optimal control parameters for the device s design at a specific installation site moreover we analytically describe an energy transfer pathway from water waves to the hull the hull to the gyroscope and the gyroscope to the power take off pto unit and verify that it is numerically satisfied by our simulations a froude scaling analysis is performed to reduce the computational cost of simulating a full scale iswec device which is used to define the geometry and flow conditions for both two and three dimensional simulations of a scaled down 1 20 iswec device additionally we verify that the 2d iswec model produced similar dynamics to the 3d model thereby allowing us to obtain accurate results at reduced simulation cycle times we also simulate a possible device protection strategy during inclement weather conditions and study the resulting dynamics the rest of the paper is organized as follows we first describe the dynamics power generation geometric properties and scaling analysis of the iswec device in section 2 next we describe the numerical wave tank approach used to generate both regular and irregular waves for our simulations in section 3 in section 4 we describe the continuous and discrete equations for the multiphase wave structure interaction system and outline validate the solution methodology for the fd bp technique in section 5 we briefly describe the software implementation and computing hardware utilized in this study in section 6 we perform spatial and temporal resolution tests to select a grid spacing and time step size that ensures adequate resolution of iswec dynamics finally in section 7 we conduct a systematic parameter study on the various hull and gyroscope parameters and evaluate the device performance in terms of generated power 2 iswec dynamics in this section we mathematically describe the dynamics power generation and geometric properties of the iswec device 2 1 iswec dynamics externally the iswec device appears as a monolithic hull that is slack moored to the seabed internally the device houses a spinning gyroscopic system that drives a sealed electric generator the pitching motion of the hull is mainly responsible for converting the wave motion into electrical output to simplify the model and discussion the other remaining degrees of freedom of the hull are not considered in this study see appendix a for a comparison of one and two degrees of freedom iswec models as the device operates the combination of wave induced pitching torque along δ axis and spinning gyroscope flywheel velocity ϕ along ϕ axis induces a precession torque in the ε coordinate direction the wave energy conversion is made possible by damping the motion along the ε direction by the electric generator which is commonly referred to as the power take off pto unit fig 2 a shows the schematic of the iswec device including the external hull ballast gyroscope and pto unit to derive the three way coupling between the waves hull and gyroscopic system we consider an inertial reference frame x y z attached to the hull and a rotating non inertial reference frame x 1 y 1 z 1 attached to the gyroscope as shown in fig 2 b the gyroscope reference frame is obtained from the hull reference frame by two subsequent finite rotations δ and ε the origin of both reference frames is taken to be the center of gravity of the device in the absence of waves δ 0 and ε 0 and the flywheel rotates with a constant angular velocity ϕ along the vertical z 1 axis this configuration is taken to be the initial position of the device in which the two reference frames also coincide when the first wave reaches the hull location a wave induced pitching torque tilts the device by an angle δ and the hull attains a pitching velocity δ along the x axis the gyroscope structure rotates by the same angle δ about the x or the x 1 axis the rotated configuration of the x 1 y 1 z 1 reference frame is shown by dashed lines in fig 2 b as the hull begins to pitch the gyroscope is subject to two angular velocities δ along x 1 axis and ϕ along z 1 axis this wave induced pitching torque and the angular velocity of the spinning gyroscope produces a precession torque in the third orthogonal direction y 1 this induced torque precesses the gyroscope by an angle ε about the y 1 axis as a result of the two subsequent rotations the gyroscope frame attains an orientation shown by bold red lines in fig 2 b the evolution of the gyroscope s dynamics results in a gyroscopic torque m g m x 1 m y 1 m z 1 which can be related to the rotational kinematic variables using conservation of angular momentum the angular velocity ω 1 of the gyroscope reference frame and the angular velocity ω g of the gyroscope are both written in the x 1 y 1 z 1 coordinate system and their evolution can be expressed in terms of δ ε and ϕ as 1 ω 1 δ cos ε i ˆ 1 ε j ˆ 1 δ sin ε k ˆ 1 2 ω g δ cos ε i ˆ 1 ε j ˆ 1 δ sin ε ϕ k ˆ 1 in which i ˆ 1 j ˆ 1 and k ˆ 1 are the unit vectors along x 1 y 1 and z 1 directions respectively the rate of change of the gyroscope s angular momentum with respect to time is related to the gyroscopic torque m g by 3 m g d h g d t in which h g i g ω g is the angular momentum of the gyroscope and i g is the inertia matrix of the gyroscope in the x 1 y 1 z 1 reference frame i g reads as 4 i g i x 1 x 1 0 0 0 i y 1 y 1 0 0 0 i z 1 z 1 i 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 j the flywheel structure including its support brackets etc is typically designed such that i x 1 x 1 i y 1 y 1 i and i z 1 z 1 j i using eqs 2 and 4 the angular momentum of the flywheel is given by 5 h g i δ cos ε i ˆ 1 i ε j ˆ 1 j δ sin ε ϕ k ˆ 1 differentiating eq 5 with respect to time in the inertial reference frame involves computing time derivatives of the unit vectors i ˆ 1 j ˆ 1 and k ˆ 1 6 d i ˆ 1 d t ω 1 i ˆ 1 ε k ˆ 1 δ sin ε j ˆ 1 7 d j ˆ 1 d t ω 1 j ˆ 1 δ cos ε k ˆ 1 δ sin ε i ˆ 1 8 d k ˆ 1 d t ω 1 k ˆ 1 δ cos ε j ˆ 1 ε i ˆ 1 finally after some algebraic simplifications a componentwise expression for the gyroscopic torque m g is obtained 9 m g m x 1 m y 1 m z 1 i δ cos ε j 2 i δ ε sin ε j ϕ ε i ε i j δ 2 sin ε cos ε j ϕ δ cos ε j δ sin ε j δ ε cos ε j ϕ the precession velocity ε of the generator shaft is damped using a proportional derivative pd control law implemented in the pto unit the pd control torque can be modeled as a spring damper system with the following form 10 m ε m g j ˆ 1 k ε c ε here k is a spring like stiffness parameter and c is a damper like dissipation parameter that can be adjusted in real time usually through feedback to enhance the conversion efficiency of the device when the incoming waves change their characteristics the wave power absorbed by the pto unit as a function of time is 11 p pto c ε 2 therefore the precession component of the gyroscopic torque is balanced by the pd control torque m y 1 m ε which is also responsible for extracting the wave energy the other components m x 1 and m z 1 of the gyroscopic torque are balanced sustained by the hydrodynamic torques acting on the hull and the subsequent hull gyroscope interactions to understand this balance we consider the hydrodynamic torque and motion of the hull about the pitch x direction as observed from the inertial reference frame x y z 12 m hydro i h d δ d t m δ in which m hydro is the hydrodynamic torque acting on the hull i h is the moment of inertia of the hull and m δ is the projection of the gyroscopic torque on the x axis 13 m δ m g i ˆ m g i ˆ 1 cos ε k ˆ 1 sin ε j sin 2 ε i cos 2 ε δ j ϕ ε cos ε 2 j i δ ε sin ε cos ε j ϕ sin ε from eq 12 it can be seen that the gyroscopic reaction m δ acting on the hull opposes the wave induced pitching motion similarly a second reaction torque m ϕ acts on the hull along the z direction and opposes its wave induced yaw motion 14 m ϕ m g k ˆ m g k ˆ 1 cos ε i ˆ 1 sin ε cos δ j ˆ 1 sin δ j i δ sin ε cos ε δ ε j cos 2 ε sin 2 ε 2 i sin 2 ε j ϕ ε sin ε j ϕ cos ε cos δ i ε i j δ 2 sin ε cos ε j ϕ δ cos ε sin δ in section 7 3 1 we show that this yaw torque is the same order of magnitude as the pitch torque m δ in practice however its contribution is partially cancelled out by the mooring system of the device moreover using an even number of gyroscopic units will cancel the yaw component of the gyroscopic torque acting on the hull if each flywheel pair spins with equal and opposite velocity as described by raffero 2014 therefore we do not consider the effect of m ϕ on the iswec dynamics in our 3d model 2 2 power transfer from waves to pto to understand the power transfer from waves to the hull and from the hull to the pto unit we derive the time averaged kinetic energy equations of the iswec system these equations highlight the coupled terms that are responsible for wave energy conversion through the iswec device first we consider the rotation of the gyroscope around the pto axis the equation of motion in the ε coordinate direction as derived in the previous section is re written below 15 i ε i j δ 2 sin ε cos ε j ϕ δ cos ε m ε k ε c ε rearranging eq 15 with the approximation i j simplifies the equation to 16 i ε c ε k ε j ϕ δ cos ε from the above equation it can be seen that the product of the hull s pitch velocity δ and the gyroscope s angular velocity ϕ yields a forcing term that drives the pto motion multiplying eq 16 by the precession velocity ε and rearranging some terms we obtain the kinetic energy equation for the pto dynamics 17 i d dt ε 2 2 c ε 2 k d dt ε 2 2 j ϕ δ ε cos ε taking the time average of eq 17 over one wave period the first and third terms on the left hand side of the equation evaluate to zero the remaining terms describe the transfer of power from the hull to the pto unit 18 c ε 2 j ϕ δ ε cos ε in which 1 t t t t dt represents the time average of a quantity over one wave period t 3 3 for irregular waves the time average could be defined over one significant wave period here c ε 2 is the average power absorbed by the pto denoted p pto and j ϕ δ ε cos ε is the average power generated due to the gyroscopic motion through its interaction with the hull denoted p gyro similarly the kinetic energy equation of the hull can be derived by multiplying the hull dynamics eq 12 by the pitch velocity δ 19 m hydro δ i h δ δ m δ δ under the assumptions i j and a constant gyroscope spinning speed m δ in eq 13 simplifies to 20 m δ j δ j ϕ ε cos ε using eqs 19 and 20 and rearranging some terms we obtain 21 m hydro δ i h d dt δ 2 2 j d dt δ 2 2 j ϕ δ ε cos ε taking the time average of eq 21 over one wave period the first and second terms on the right hand side evaluate to zero and the expression reads 22 m hydro δ j ϕ δ ε cos ε here m hydro δ is the power transferred from the waves to the hull denoted p hull and j ϕ δ ε cos ε is the same expression on the right side of eq 18 hence combining eqs 18 and 22 we obtain an equation describing the pathway of energy transfer from waves to the pto 23 m hydro δ waves hull j ϕ δ ε cos ε hull gyroscope c ε 2 gyroscope pto which is written succinctly as p hull p gyro p pto eq 23 is quantitatively verified for the iswec model under both regular and irregular wave environments in section 7 2 3 pto and gyroscope parameters the energy transfer equation can be used to select the pto and gyroscope parameters that achieve a rated power of the installed device p r from eq 23 24 c p r ε 2 2 p r ε 0 2 in which ε 0 is the amplitude of the precession velocity expressed in terms of the amplitude of the precession angle ε 0 as ε 0 ε 0 ω here we assume that all of the iswec components are excited at the external wave frequency ω 2 π t to achieve optimal performance based on experimental data of real iswec devices vissio 2017 cagninei et al 2015 we prescribe ε 0 in the range 40 ε 0 80 to obtain the damping parameter c from eq 24 to prescribe the rest of the gyroscope parameters we make use of eq 18 since this expression is nonlinear we linearize it about ε 0 a reasonable approximation for relatively calm conditions to estimate the gyroscope angular momentum as 25 j ϕ c ε 0 δ 0 in which the amplitude of the hull pitch velocity δ 0 δ 0 ω expressed in terms of the amplitude of the hull pitch angle δ 0 is used again based on the experimental data we prescribe δ 0 in the range 2 δ 0 20 and ϕ in the range 250 ϕ 1000 rpm 4 4 this range of ϕ is for the full scale iswec device which can be scaled by an appropriate factor for the scaled down model see section 2 5 for scaling analyses to obtain the j value of the gyroscope from eq 25 the i value of the gyroscope is set as a scaled value of j i e i γ j where γ 1 we study the effect of varying γ in section 7 3 3 the only remaining free parameter is the pto stiffness k used in the control torque we make use of reactive control theory korde and ringwood 2016 and prescribe k as 26 k ω 2 i ensuring that the gyroscopic system oscillates at the wave frequency around the pto axis using the linearized version of eq 16 it can be shown that if the gyroscope oscillates with the external wave forcing frequency a resonance condition is achieved along the pto axis and the output power is maximized korde and ringwood 2016 in this state both the hull and gyroscopic systems oscillate at the external wave frequency and their coupling is maximized 2 4 hull shape the iswec s external hull is a boat shaped vessel which we idealize by a half cylinder of length l height h and width w for the actual device a part of the outer periphery is flattened out to ease the installation of mechanical and electrical parts near the bottom center location see fig 3 b we neglect these geometric details in our model shown in fig 3 a the inside of the device is mostly hollow and the buoyancy countering ballast is placed around the outer periphery the hull length l is a function of λ the wavelength of the design wave at device installation site as analyzed by cagninei et al 2015 the optimal hull length is between λ 3 l λ 2 for an iswec device that is mainly excited in the pitch direction the hull width w is decided based on the rated power of the installed device p r relative capture width rcw conversion efficiency of the device assuming a unit width η and wave power per unit crest width p wave these quantities are related through the expressions 27 w p r η p wave and η p pto p wave in which p denotes time averaged power section 3 provides closed form expressions of p wave for both regular and irregular waves for the 2d iswec model we use w 1 which corresponds to a unit crest width of the wave 2 5 scaled iswec model in order to reduce the computational cost of simulating a full scale iswec device operating in high reynolds number re regimes we use froude scaling journée and massie 2001 to scale the model problem down by a 1 20 ratio the froude number fr measures the resistance of a partially submerged object moving through water and is defined as 28 fr characteristic velocity gravitational wave velocity u c g l c in which u c is the characteristic velocity l c is the characteristic length and g is the gravitational acceleration constant in offshore marine hydromechanics froude scaling allows us to compare the dynamics of two vessels even if their sizes are different since they produce a similar wake two vessels having the same froude number may not be operating in the same reynolds number regime in the present study the scaled down model operates in lower re conditions and it does not capture fine scale details such as extreme wave breaking and spray dynamics that occur at higher reynolds numbers these small scale features are mostly dictated by viscous and surface tension effects and a very fine computational mesh is needed to adequately resolve them however the main quantities of interest such as power generated for the full scale device can be inferred from scaled down simulations by using appropriate scaling factors some of which we derive next length scaling the geometric parameters such as length width or height are simply scaled by a factor of α in the present study we use α 20 an exception to this length scaling is hull width in 2d which is taken to be unity in the scaled model therefore in 2d the scaling factor for hull width is w rather than α acceleration scaling the full scale and scaled down models operate under the same gravitational force field therefore the gravitational constant g or any other acceleration remains unchanged density scaling density is an intrinsic material property and thus it remains the same for both the full scale and scaled down models volume scaling since volume is proportional to the length cubed it is scaled by α 3 mass scaling mass can be expressed as a product of density ρ and volume and its scaling for 2d and 3d iswec models are obtained as 29 m model m full scale ρ l h w model ρ l h w full scale w model α 2 w full scale velocity scaling velocity scaling is obtained by equating the froude numbers 30 u c g l c model u c g l c full scale 31 u c model u c full scale l c model l c full scale 1 α 1 2 time scaling letting t c represent a characteristic time time scaling can be obtained from the length and velocity scalings as 32 u c model u c full scale l c t c model l c t c full scale 33 t c model t c full scale 1 α 1 2 similarly scaling factors of other quantities of interest such as force and power can be obtained in terms of α and are enumerated in table 1 for both two and three spatial dimensions full scale scaled down quantities should be divided multiplied by factors in the third and fourth columns to obtain the scaled down full scale quantities in three and two spatial dimensions respectively 2 6 scaled hull parameters in this section we use the froude scaling derived in the previous section to obtain the scaled down hull parameters required for our simulations the scaled down parameters of the gyroscope will be presented in section 7 where they are systematically varied to study their effect on device performance the hull properties of the full scale iswec device are taken from an experimental campaign cagninei et al 2015 vissio 2017 conducted at the pantelleria test site in the mediterranean sea the scaled down 1 20 values of the hull properties are tabulated in table 2 to verify that the scaled down values correlate well to the model geometry we perform geometric estimation of the hull properties by assuming the hull to be a filled sector of a circle in two spatial dimensions the geometric center gc and the center of buoyancy cb of the submerged sector can be calculated geometrically and are found to be located at a distance z gc 0 0163 m and z cb 0 0605 m below the still waterline respectively see fig 4 from table 2 the scaled distance between the center of gravity of the device and waterline is z cg 0 0285 m it can be seen that the cb lies below the cg and gc satisfying the stability condition for floating bodies additionally cg lies below gc because in the real device more mass is distributed towards the lower half portion similarly the scaled down moment of inertia of the hull i h can be argued geometrically we first estimate the density of the hull from the scaled mass 90 kg and the area of the sector 0 1225 m2 to be ρ estimate 734 69 kg m 3 then we use ρ estimate to calculate the moment of inertia of the filled sector about its geometric center as i gc 3 1768 kg m2 in the real device most of the mass is concentrated along the outer periphery resembling a ring rather than a filled sector since the moment of inertia of a ring is twice as that of a filled circle i estimate 2 i gc 6 3536 kg m2 which is close to what we obtain from table 2 3 wave dynamics this section describes the types of waves both regular and irregular and the numerical tank approach used to simulate the iswec dynamics 3 1 regular waves we use fenton s fifth order wave theory fenton 1985 to generate regular waves of height h time period t and wavelength λ according to fifth order stokes theory and assuming that the waves propagate in the positive y direction the wave elevation η y t from a still water surface at depth d above the sea floor is 34 η y t s η 1 y t s 2 η 2 y t s 3 η 3 y t s 4 η 4 y t s 5 η 5 y t in which s κ h 2 is the wave steepness η 1 κ 1 cos ω t κ y is the basic harmonic component κ 2 π λ is the wavenumber and ω 2 π t is the wave frequency the remaining terms in eq 34 are higher order corrections to linear wave theory whose details are given in fenton 1985 the velocity and pressure solutions to the fifth order stokes wave can also be found in fenton 1985 the fifth order stokes waves satisfy the dispersion relationship given by 35 ω 2 g κ tanh κ d which relates the wavenumber κ to the wave frequency ω eq 35 is an implicit equation requiring an iterative process to compute κ given ω or vice versa instead an explicit equation can be used with sufficient accuracy in all water depth regimes fenton 1988 36 κ d γ β 2 cosh β 2 tanh β β cosh β 2 in which β γ tanh γ 1 2 and γ ω 2 d g a converter s efficiency η is measured relative to the available wave energy at the installation site the traveling water waves transport kinetic and potential energy as they move along the sea or ocean surface which is partially absorbed by the converter the time averaged wave power per unit crest width carried by regular waves in the propagation direction is given by journée and massie 2001 37 p wave 1 8 ρ w g h 2 c g in which ρ w is the density of water and c g is the group velocity of waves the velocity with which wave energy is transported given by 38 c g 1 2 λ t 1 2 κ d sinh 2 κ d in the deep water limit where d λ 2 and κ d eqs 35 and 38 become 39 ω 2 g κ or λ g t 2 2 π and c g λ 2 t deep water limit using eq 39 in eq 37 the wave power in the deep water limit can be expressed as 40 p wave ρ w g 2 h 2 t 32 π h 2 t kw m deep water limit in which the constant numerical factor ρ w g 2 32 π 1 0 3 when evaluated with si units when simulating a scaled down model both h and λ are scaled down by the length scale α to generate waves similar to the full scale model the scaled time period is obtained from the dispersion relationship between λ and t 3 2 irregular waves irregular waves depict a more realistic sea state and are modeled as a superposition of a large number of first order regular wave components using the superposition principle the sea surface elevation is expressed as 41 η y t i 1 n a i cos κ i y ω i t θ i in which n is the number of wave components each having its own amplitude a i angular frequency ω i wavenumber κ i and a random phase θ i the wavenumber κ i is related to the angular frequency ω i by the dispersion relationship given by eq 35 the phases θ i of each wave component are random variables following a uniform distribution in the range 0 2 π the linear superposition of wave components also implies that the energy carried by an irregular wave is the sum of the energy transported by individual wave components when the number of wave components n tends to infinity a continuous wave spectral density function s ω is used to describe the energy content of the wave components in an infinitesimal frequency bandwidth d ω the area under the curve gives the total energy of an irregular wave modulo the factor ρ w g discretely the component wave frequencies are typically chosen at an equal interval of δ ω between a narrow bandwidth of frequencies the wave spectrum s ω approaches zero for frequencies outside the narrow bandwidth and peaks at a particular value of frequency ω p here we consider only singly peaked wave spectra the amplitude of each wave component is related to the spectral density function by 42 a i 2 s ω i δ ω the standard uni directional wave energy spectra s ω are based on two parameters the significant wave height and the average wave period journée and massie 2001 one such wave energy spectrum was defined by hasselmann et al 1973 who analyzed the fetch limited or coastal wind generated sea data collected during the joint north sea wave project jonswap carried out in 1968 and 1969 in this work we use the jonswap spectrum to generate irregular waves which reads as 43 s ω 320 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1950 t p 4 ω 4 γ a in which h s is the significant wave height and t p is the peak time period i e the time period with the highest spectral peak see fig 5 the remaining parameters in eq 43 are 44 γ 3 3 peakedness factor a exp ω ω p 1 σ 2 2 45 ω p 2 π t p angular frequency at spectral peak 46 σ 0 07 if ω ω p 0 09 if ω ω p the peak enhancement factor γ a in eq 43 accounts for the fully developed sea state for more details on the assumptions used to define the jonswap spectrum we refer the readers to hasselmann et al 1973 the mean wave power per unit crest width carried by an irregular wave is obtained from s ω as 47 p wave ρ w g 0 s ω d ω c g ρ w g i 1 n 1 2 a i 2 c g in which the group velocity c g is calculated from eq 38 using the significant wavelength and peak time period of the spectrum in the deep water limit eq 47 simplifies to 48 p wave 0 49 h s 2 t p kw m deep water limit 3 3 wave steepness as discussed in section 2 3 if the oscillation frequencies of the hull and gyroscope system are synchronized with that of the wave the coupling between the hull and the gyroscope system and therefore the output power can be increased along with frequency synchronization the oscillation amplitude of the hull can also be increased to enhance the device performance this will result in more power transfer from the hull to the gyroscope system the wave steepness s defined in eq 34 which gives a relation between the wave height h and wavelength λ plays an important role in deciding the pto and gyroscope system parameters such that the hull exhibits larger pitching motion this is achieved by adjusting the gyroscope and pto parameters such that the maximum hull pitch angle amplitude δ 0 is expected to reach the maximum wave steepness angle δ s of the incoming wave an expression for δ s can be obtained by approximating the incoming wave as a regular simple harmonic wave with elevation η y t given by 49 η y t a cos κ y ω t where a h 2 is the wave amplitude differentiating the above equation with respect to y we obtain 50 d η y t d y a κ sin κ y ω t the maximum wave steepness i e the slope is obtained when sin κ y ω t 1 51 d η y t d y max κ h 2 s finally the maximum wave steepness angle is then given by 52 δ s tan 1 κ h 2 tan 1 π h λ when the condition δ 0 δ s is used to calculate the gyroscope and pto parameters the iswec device is observed to have maximum efficiency a study on the variation of δ 0 relative to δ s for different wave heights is conducted in section 7 2 3 4 numerical wave tank the wave structure interaction of the scaled down iswec device is simulated in a numerical wave tank nwt as shown in fig 6 water waves are generated at the left boundary of the domain using dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity components the waves traveling in the positive y direction are reflected back towards the inlet side from the device surface and also from the right boundary of the domain this results in wave distortion and wave interference phenomena which reduces the quality of waves reaching the device to study its performance several techniques have been proposed in the literature miquel et al 2018 windt et al 2018 2019 to mitigate these effects including the relaxation zone method jacobsen et al 2012 the active wave absorption method higuera et al 2013 frigaard and brorsen 1995 schäffer and klopman 2000 the momentum damping method choi and yoon 2009 ha et al 2013 the viscous beach method ghasemi et al 2014 the porous media method dong and zhan 2009 jacobsen et al 2015 and the mass balance pde method hu et al 2016 in this work we use the relaxation zone method at inlet and outlet boundaries the purpose of the relaxation zone near the channel inlet the wave generation zone is to smoothly extend the dirichlet velocity boundary conditions into the wave tank up to a distance of one wavelength so that the reflected waves coming from the iswec device do not interfere with the left boundary in contrast the relaxation zone near the right boundary the wave damping zone smoothly damps out the waves reaching the domain outlet near the right end the wave damping zone is taken to be two wavelengths wide in our simulations more details on the implementation of the relaxation zone method and level set based nwt can be found in our prior work nangia et al 2019a we impose zero pressure boundary condition at the channel top boundary z max 2 75 d to mitigate the interaction between shed vortices due to the device motion and the top boundary of the channel we use a vorticity damping zone to dissipate the vortex structures reaching the boundary see fig 6 the vorticity damping zone is implemented in terms of a damping force f d in the momentum equation 53 f d g z u in which g z ρ air cos π z 1 4 δ t is the smoothed damping coefficient ρ air is the density of the air phase δ t is the time step size z z z max δ d is the normalized z coordinate and δ d is the vorticity damping zone width which is taken to be six cells wide in our simulations 4 numerical model based on the incompressible navier stokes equations we use a fully eulerian fictitious domain brinkman penalization fd bp method bhalla et al 2020 to perform fully resolved wave structure interaction simulations in the fictitious domain methods the governing equations for the fluid are extended into the region occupied by the solid structure yielding a single set of pdes for the entire domain additional constraints are imposed in the structure domain to ensure that the velocity field within acts like a rigid body this is in contrast to body conforming grid methods in which the fluid equations are solved only on a domain surrounding the immersed body for applications involving moving body fluid structure interaction fsi fictitious domain methods are computationally less expensive than body conforming grid techniques due to the absence of expensive re meshing operations in this section we first describe the continuous governing equations for the fd bp formulation and the interface tracking approach for the multiphase fsi system next we briefly describe the spatiotemporal discretization overall solution methodology and time stepping scheme finally we describe the coupling used to simulate the dynamics of an inertial sea wave energy converter device which involves modeling the effect of a rigid body pitch torque a validation case for vortex induced vibration of a rectangular plate exhibiting galloping motion is presented at the end of this section we refer readers to the references by nangia et al 2019a b bhalla et al 2020 and dafnakis et al 2020 for more details on the cartesian grid fluid solver fd bp formulation and simulating wave energy converters within this framework respectively 4 1 continuous equations of motion let ω r d with d 3 denote a fixed three dimensional region in space the dynamics of a coupled multiphase fluid structure system occupying this domain are governed by the incompressible navier stokes ins equations 54 ρ u x t t ρ u x t u x t p x t μ u x t u x t t ρ g f c x t 55 u x t 0 which describe the momentum and incompressibility of a fluid with velocity u x t and pressure p x t using an eulerian coordinate system x x y z ω note that eqs 54 and 55 are written for the entire fixed region ω which can be further decomposed into two regions occupied by the fluid ω f t ω and the immersed body ω b t ω these regions are non overlapping i e ω ω f t ω b t and f c x t represents a rigidity enforcing constraint force density that vanishes outside ω b t this ensures a rigid body velocity u b x t is attained within the solid region the spatiotemporally varying density and viscosity fields are denoted by ρ x t and μ x t respectively an indicator function χ x t is further used to track the location of the solid body which is nonzero only within ω b t the acceleration due to gravity is directed towards the negative z direction g 0 0 g the immersed structure is treated as a porous region with vanishing permeability κ p 1 yielding the following formula for the brinkman penalized constraint force 56 f c x t χ x t κ p u b x t u x t section 4 4 5 describes the fluid structure coupling algorithm and section 4 4 6 describes the external iswec torque specification which together are used to determine the rigid body velocity u b x t applied to ω b t 4 2 interface tracking all of the cases described in the present work involve a single rigid structure interacting with an air water interface we briefly describe the interface tracking methodology here and refer readers to nangia et al 2019b a for further details on its implementation a scalar level set function σ x t is used to demarcate liquid water and gas air regions ω l ω and ω g ω respectively in the computational domain the air water interface γ t ω l ω g is implicitly defined by the zero contour of σ the same methodology is employed to track the surface of the immersed body s b t v b t using the zero contour of a level set function ψ x t the aforementioned indicator function for the solid domain is computed based on ψ the evolution of these level set fields is governed by linear advection via the local fluid velocity field 57 σ t σ u 0 58 ψ t ψ u 0 making use of the signed distance property the density and viscosity across the entire computational domain can be conveniently expressed as a functions of σ x t and ψ x t 59 ρ x t ρ σ x t ψ x t 60 μ x t μ σ x t ψ x t after every time step both level set functions are reinitialized to maintain signed distance functions to their respective interfaces standard approaches for computing a steady state solution to the hamilton jacobi equation is used to reinitialize σ whereas an analytical distance computation to the immersed body is used to reinitialize ψ 4 3 spatial discretization the continuous equations of motion eqs 54 55 are discretized on a staggered cartesian grid made up of n x n y n z rectangular cells covering the domain ω see fig 7 the mesh spacings in the three spatial directions are denoted by δ x δ y and δ z respectively without loss of generality let the lower left corner of the rectangular domain be the origin 0 0 0 of the coordinate system using this reference point each cell center of the grid has position x i j k i 1 2 δ x j 1 2 δ y k 1 2 δ z for i 0 n x 1 j 0 n y 1 and k 0 n z 1 the physical location of the cell face that is half a grid cell away from x i j k in the x direction is given by x i 1 2 j k i δ x j 1 2 δ y k 1 2 δ z similarly x i j 1 2 k i 1 2 δ x j δ y k 1 2 δ z and x i j k 1 2 i 1 2 δ x j 1 2 δ y k δ z are the physical locations of the cell faces that are half a grid cell away from x i j k in the y and z directions respectively the level set fields pressure degrees of freedom and the material properties are all approximated at cell centers and are denoted σ i j k n σ x i j k t n ψ i j k n ψ x i j k t n p i j k n p x i j k t n ρ i j k n ρ x i j k t n and μ i j k n μ x i j k t n respectively some of these quantities are interpolated onto the required degrees of freedom as needed see nangia et al 2019b for further details here the time at time step n is denoted t n the velocity degrees of freedom are approximated on cell faces with notation u i 1 2 j k n u x i 1 2 j k t n v i j 1 2 k n v x i j 1 2 k t n and w i j k 1 2 n w x i j k 1 2 t n the gravitational body force and constraint force density on the right hand side of the momentum equation 54 are also approximated on the cell faces second order finite differences are used to discretize all spatial derivatives subsequently the discretized version of these differential operators are denoted with h subscripts i e h for more details on the spatial discretization we refer readers to prior studies nangia et al 2019b cai et al 2014 griffith 2009 bhalla et al 2013 4 4 solution methodology next we describe the methodology used to solve the discretized equations of motion at a high level this involves three major steps 1 specifying the material properties ρ x t and μ x t throughout the computational domain 2 calculating the brinkman penalization rigidity constraint force density f c based on the iswec dynamics 3 computing the updated solutions to σ ψ u and p in the present work we briefly review the computations above in the context of iswec devices with a single unlocked rotational degree of freedom for a more general treatment of the fd bp method we refer readers to previous work by bhalla et al 2020 and references therein 4 4 1 density and viscosity specification at

otherwise we use the same number of transition cells n cells 2 for both air water and fluid solid interfaces in our simulations although this is not an inherent limitation of our method we refer readers to nangia et al 2019a for more discussion 4 4 2 time stepping scheme a fixed point iteration time stepping scheme using n cycles 2 cycles per time step is used to evolve quantities from time level t n to time level t n 1 t n δ t a k superscript is used to denote the cycle number of the fixed point iteration at the beginning of each time step the solutions from the previous time step are used to initialize cycle k 0 u n 1 0 u n p n 1 2 0 p n 1 2 σ n 1 0 σ n and ψ n 1 0 ψ n at the initial time n 0 the physical quantities are prescribed via initial condition 4 4 3 level set advection an standard explicit advection scheme is used to evolve the two level set functions 65 σ n 1 k 1 σ n δ t q u n 1 2 k σ n 1 2 k 0 66 ψ n 1 k 1 ψ n δ t q u n 1 2 k ψ n 1 2 k 0 in which q represents an explicit piecewise parabolic method xsppm7 limited approximation to the linear advection terms on cell centers griffith 2009 rider et al 2007 4 4 4 incompressible navier stokes solution the following spatiotemporal discretization of the incompressible navier stokes eqs 54 55 in conservative form is employed 67 ρ n 1 k 1 u n 1 k 1 ρ n u n δ t c n 1 k h p n 1 2 k 1 l μ u n 1 2 k 1 n 1 k 1 g f c n 1 k 1 68 h u n 1 k 1 0 in which the discretized convective derivative c n 1 k and the density approximation ρ n 1 k 1 are computed using a consistent mass momentum transport scheme this is vital to ensure numerical stability for cases involving air water density ratios this scheme is described in detail in previous studies by nangia et al 2019b and bhalla et al 2020 a standard semi implicit approximation to the viscous strain rate l μ u n 1 2 k 1 1 2 l μ u n 1 k 1 l μ u n is employed in which l μ n 1 h μ n 1 h u h u t n 1 the two stage process described by eqs 61 and 62 is used to obtain the newest approximation to viscosity μ n 1 k 1 the flow density field is used to construct the gravitational body force term g ρ flow g which avoids spurious currents due to large density variation near the fluid solid interface nangia et al 2019a 4 4 5 fluid structure coupling next we describe the brinkman penalization term that imposes the rigidity constraint in the solid region and the overall fluid structure coupling scheme in this work we simplify the treatment of the fsi coupling by only considering immersed bodies with a single unlocked rotational degree of freedom dof a more general approach is described in bhalla et al 2020 the brinkman penalization term is treated implicitly and computed as 69 f c n 1 k 1 χ κ p u b n 1 k 1 u n 1 k 1 in which the discretized indicator function χ 1 h body is 1 only inside the body domain and defined using the structure heaviside function h body from eq 64 a permeability value of κ p o 1 0 8 has been shown to be sufficiently small enough to effectively enforce the rigidity constraint gazzola et al 2011 bhalla et al 2020 with x com denoting the position of the center of mass of the body the rigid body velocity u b u r w r x x com can be expressed as a sum of translational u r and rotational w r velocities in this work u r 0 and we simply have 70 u b n 1 k 1 w r n 1 k 1 x x com n 1 k 1 moreover two of the rotational dofs are locked in the present study i e they are constrained to zero hence the expression for w r can be simplified even further 71 w r n 1 k 1 δ n 1 k 1 0 0 in which δ is the rotational velocity of the structure about its pitch axis the rigid body velocity can be computed by integrating newton s second law of motion for the pitch axis rotational velocity 72 i h δ n 1 k 1 δ n δ t m hydro n 1 k m δ n 1 k in which i h is the moment of inertia of the hull m hydro is the net hydrodynamic torque and m δ n 1 k is the projection of the gyroscopic torque about the x axis the net hydrodynamic torque is computed by summing the contributions from pressure and viscous forces acting on the hull and taking the pitch component 73 m hydro i ˆ f x x com n 1 k p n 1 k n f μ f h u n 1 k h u n 1 k t n f δ a f the hydrodynamic traction in the above equation is evaluated on cartesian grid faces near the hull that define a stair step representation of the body on the eulerian mesh bhalla et al 2020 with n f and δ a f representing the unit normal vector and the area of a given cell face respectively the computation of the gyroscopic action m δ is described in the following section 4 4 6 coupling the iswec dynamics the iswec is allowed to freely rotate about its pitch axis and its motion depends on the hydrodynamic and external torques acting on it the external torque m δ generated by the gyroscopic action is unloaded on the hull and opposes the wave induced pitching motion therefore m δ appears with negative sign on the right side of eq 72 the analytical expression for this pitch torque is given by eq 13 while its discretization is written as 74 m δ n 1 k j sin 2 ε n 1 k i cos 2 ε n 1 k δ n 1 k j ϕ ε n 1 k cos ε n 1 k 2 j i δ n 1 k ε n 1 k sin ε n 1 k cos ε n 1 k j ϕ sin ε n 1 k in which the pitch acceleration term δ n 1 k is calculated using a standard finite difference explicit forward euler of the hull s pitch velocity 75 δ n 1 k δ n 1 k δ n δ t k 0 δ n δ n 1 δ t k 0 we set δ n 1 0 δ n ε n 1 0 ε n δ n 1 0 δ n and ε n 1 0 ε n for cycle k 0 the precession acceleration ε is given analytically by eq 15 which in discretized form reads 76 ε n 1 k 1 i k ε n 1 k 1 c ε n 1 k 1 i j δ n 1 k 2 sin ε n 1 k 1 cos ε n 1 k 1 j ϕ δ n 1 k cos ε n 1 k 1 this newest approximation to the precession acceleration ε n 1 k is explicitly calculated using only the prior cycle s values of precession velocity ε n 1 k 1 and angle ε n 1 k 1 new approximations to ε and ε at cycle k are computed using the newmark β method newmark 1959 as follows 77 ε n 1 k ε n δ t 2 ε n ε n 1 k 78 ε n 1 k ε n δ t ε n δ t 2 4 ε n ε n 1 k as described in section 2 the pto stiffness k and damping c parameters in the control torque and the gyroscope s angular velocity ϕ acceleration ϕ 0 and moments of inertia i and j are known a priori and do not represent additional unknowns in the calculation of m δ n 1 k hence the procedure outlined by eqs 74 to 78 enables the calculation of the external pitch torque shown on the right hand side of eq 72 thus coupling the iswec dynamics to the fd bp methodology 4 5 fsi validation to validate our implementation of the method described in this section we simulate the vortex induced vibration of a rectangular plate undergoing galloping motion this single rotational degree of freedom case has been widely used as a benchmark problem for fsi algorithms in prior literature it also mimics the iswec model well which primarily oscillates in the pitch direction the governing equation for the spring mass damper plate model reads as 79 i ϑ ϑ c ϑ ϑ k ϑ ϑ m hydro in which ϑ is the pitch angle of the plate measured from the horizontal axis i ϑ is the pitch moment of inertia about the center of mass c ϑ is the torsional damping constant k ϑ is the torsional spring constant and m hydro is the hydrodynamic moment acting on the plate due to the external fluid flow to compare of our results with prior simulations we consider a plate with a width to thickness ratio of λ l p h p 4 a non dimensional moment of inertia of i ϑ i ϑ ρ s h p 4 400 a non dimensional damping ratio of ζ ϑ c ϑ 2 k ϑ i ϑ 0 25 and a reduced velocity of u u f ϑ h p 40 here u is the free stream velocity and f ϑ k ϑ i ϑ 2 π is the natural frequency of the spring mass damper system the rectangular plate is centered at the origin with an initial non zero pitch of ϑ 1 the computational domain is taken to be ω 32 cm 96 cm 32 cm 32 cm a rectangular domain of size l x l y 128 cm 64 cm five grid levels are used to discretize the domain with the structure embedded on the finest grid level a coarse grid spacing of h coarsest l y 32 is used on the coarsest level the finest level is refined with a refinement ratio of n ref 2 whereas the rest of the finer levels are refined using a refinement ratio of n ref 4 from their next coarser level a uniform inflow velocity u u 1 cm s 0 cm s is imposed on the left boundary x 32 cm whereas zero normal traction and zero tangential velocity boundary conditions are imposed on the right boundary x 96 cm the bottom y 32 cm and top y 32 cm boundaries satisfy zero normal velocity and zero tangential traction boundary conditions the reynolds number of the flow based on the inlet velocity is set to re ρ f u h p μ f 250 a constant time step size of δ t 0 048 h finest is used for the simulation after the initial transients a vortex shedding state is established which results in a periodic galloping of the rectangular plate fig 8 a shows the pitch angle of the plate as a function of time figs 8 b 8 d show three representative snapshots of the fsi dynamics and the vortex shedding pattern fig 8 e shows a typical amr patch distribution in the domain due to the evolving structural and vortical dynamics table 3 compares the maximum pitch angle ϑ max and galloping frequency of the plate f ϑ with values obtained from previous numerical studies an excellent agreement with prior studies is obtained for both these rotational quantities 5 software

is μ air 1 8 1 0 5 pa s surface tension effects are neglected for all cases as they do not affect the wave and converter dynamics at the scale of these problems 6 1 grid convergence study to ensure the wave structure interaction dynamics are accurately resolved we conduct a grid convergence study to determine an adequate mesh spacing the dynamics of the iswec hull interacting with regular water waves are simulated on four meshes coarse medium fine and finest each mesh consists of a hierarchy of ℓ grids the computational domain is discretized by a coarsest grid of size n y n z and then locally refined ℓ 1 times by an integer refinement ratio n ref ensuring that the iswec device and air water interface are covered by the finest grid level the grid spacing on the finest level are calculated using the following expressions δ y min δ y 0 n ref ℓ 1 and δ z min δ z 0 n ref ℓ 1 where δ y 0 and δ z 0 are the grid spacings on the coarsest level the time step size δ t is chosen to ensure the maximum courant friedrichs levy cfl number 0 12 for coarse medium and fine grid resolutions and 0 24 for the finest to reduce the computational cost grid resolution the mesh parameters and time step sizes considered here are shown in table 4 regular water waves generated based on the fifth order wave theory presented in section 3 1 enter the left side of the domain and interact with the iswec hull temporal evolution of the hull s pitch angle δ and the gyroscope s precession angle ε are the primary outputs used to evaluate mesh convergence the results and the specification of the wave iswec and gyroscope parameters are shown in fig 9 for a quantitative comparison we calculate the average percentage change in the peak values of δ and ε for two consecutive grid resolutions between the time interval t 10 s to 20 s the obtained average percentage change for δ peaks is 24 18 between coarse and medium grid resolutions 10 42 between medium and fine grid resolutions and 3 4 between fine and finest grid resolutions and for ε peaks these values are 22 15 14 6 and 1 9 respectively fig 10 a shows a close up of the medium resolution grid and the 2d iswec model a minimum of 8 grid cells vertically span the height of the wave indicating that the wave elevation is adequately resolved for the coarse finest grid resolution approximately 4 30 grid cells span the wave height results not shown additionally the number of cells covering the iswec hull length is approximately 30 60 119 and 238 for the coarse medium fine and finest grid resolutions respectively fig 10 b shows well resolved vortical structures produced by the interaction of the iswec device and air water interface on the medium resolution grid from the quantitative and qualitative results shown in figs 9 and 10 we conclude that the medium grid resolution can capture the wsi dynamics with reasonable accuracy table 5 compares the wall clock time required to execute 10 000 time steps of the 2d iswec model for the four grid resolutions the medium grid resolution offers a reasonable compromise between accuracy of the solution and simulation time therefore for the remaining cases studied here we make use of the medium grid resolution 6 2 temporal resolution study next we conduct a temporal resolution study to ensure that wsi dynamics of irregular waves and the iswec device are adequately resolved as described in section 3 2 irregular water waves are modeled as a superposition of n harmonic wave components the energy carried by each wave component is related to its frequency ω i see eq 43 and fig 5 moreover as shown in fig 5 high frequency waves with ω i in the range of 10 rad s to 20 rad s carry considerable amounts of energy hence the time step δ t should be chosen such that these high frequency small wave period t i components are well resolved since they contribute significantly to the power absorbed by the device the dynamics of the iswec hull interacting with irregular water waves are simulated using three different time step sizes δ t 10 3 s 5 1 0 4 s and 2 5 1 0 4 s for all three cases we use a medium resolution grid with refinement parameters given by table 4 temporal evolution of the hull s pitch angle δ and the power absorbed by the pto unit p pto are the primary outputs used to evaluate temporal convergence the results and the specification of the irregular wave iswec and gyroscope parameters are shown in fig 11 it is observed that the hull s pitching motion is relatively insensitive to the chosen time step size δ t since its dynamics are governed mainly by those waves carrying the largest energy we can conclude that the higher frequency wave components are adequately resolved the difference between the three temporal resolutions is more apparent in fig 11 b in which we calculate the average power absorbed by the pto unit p pto over the interval t 10 s and t 20 s for δ t 1 0 3 s 5 1 0 4 s and 2 5 1 0 4 s the power absorbed is p pto 1 7656 w 1 8859 w and 1 9484 w respectively it is seen that smaller time step sizes allow for the resolution of higher frequency wave peaks which directly increases the absorbed power by 6 81 when halving the time step from 1 1 0 3 s to 5 1 0 4 s and an increase by 3 31 when halving the time step from 5 1 0 4 s to 2 5 1 0 4 s based on these results we hereafter use the medium grid spatial resolution and time step sizes of δ t 1 1 0 3 s and δ t 5 1 0 4 s for regular and irregular wave wsi cases respectively 7 results and discussion in this section we investigate several aspects of the dynamics of the inertial sea wave energy converter device first we compare the pto power predictions by the 3d and 2d iswec models under identical wave conditions utilizing the scaling factors presented in table 1 we show that the power predicted by the 3d model can be inferred from the power predicted by the 2d model reasonably well next we study the effect of the maximum hull pitch angle parameter δ 0 and make recommendations on how to select it based on the maximum wave steepness δ s we consider different sea states characterized by regular waves of different heights h and consequently of different steepnesses thereafter a parametric analysis for the 2d iswec model is performed using both regular and irregular water waves to study its dynamics we vary the following parameters to recommend design conditions for the device pto damping coefficient c flywheel speed ϕ moment of inertia j and i and pto stiffness coefficient k afterwards the effect of varying hull length to wavelength ratios is studied finally we simulate a possible device protection strategy during inclement weather conditions and study the resulting dynamics all the 2d simulations are conducted in a nwt with computational domain size ω 0 10 λ 0 2 75 d as shown in fig 6 our prior experience in wave structure interaction modeling in two spatial dimensions suggests that the aforementioned length and height extents of the nwt are adequate to avoid boundary effects dafnakis et al 2020 nangia et al 2019a for 3d cases the computational domain size is same as in 2d with the additional dimension having length 5 w w is the width of 3d model of the hull simulation results in appendix b verify that the tank width of 5 w is large enough to ensure that the iswec dynamics are undisturbed by lateral boundaries as well the origin of the nwt is taken to be the bottom left corner of the domain and shown by the point o in fig 6 the cg of the iswec hull is located at 2 5 w 5 λ d z cg for 3d cases and 5 λ d z cg for the 2d cases the rest of the hull parameters are presented in table 2 the water and air material properties are the same as those described in section 6 7 1 3d and 2d iswec models in this section we investigate the dynamics of the 2d and 3d iswec models interacting with regular and irregular water waves we compare the motion of the hull and the power absorption capabilities of each model the 2d model is simulated on a medium grid resolution and the 3d model on a coarse grid resolution using the refinement parameters specified in table 4 the third dimension is discretized with n x 38 grid cells for 3d cases fig 12 a shows the configuration of the locally refined mesh ℓ 2 along with visualizations of regular and irregular waves for the three dimensional nwt first we consider two different prescribed maximum pitch angles δ 0 5 and 20 for each model regular waves are generated with properties h 0 1 m and t 1 s the values for the gyroscope and pto parameters for this choice of δ 0 are given in table 6 the rated power of the device p r is taken to be the available wave power p wave for calculating the parameters reported in table 6 the hull undergoes pitching motion as the regular waves impact the device as shown in fig 12 b the temporal evolution of the hull pitch angle δ for the 2d and the 3d iswec models are shown in figs 13 a and 13 b from these results it is observed that the dynamics for the 2d case match well with the 3d case after the initial transients the power transferred to the hull from the waves p hull the power generated through the hull gyroscope interaction p gyro and the power absorbed by the pto unit p pto at δ 0 5 δ 0 20 for the 2d and 3d models are shown in figs 13 c and 13 d figs 13 e and 13 f respectively the time averaged powers p pto p gyro and p hull over the time interval t 10 s and t 20 s after the hull s motion achieved a periodic steady state are also shown in figs 13 c 13 f from these results it is seen that the energy transfer pathway eq 23 is numerically verified furthermore the power absorbed by the pto unit for the full scale device can be calculated by multiplying the power absorbed by the 2d model by the froude scaling given in table 1 80 p full scale α 5 2 w p 2d pto unit similarly for the 3d model 81 p full scale α 7 2 p 3d pto unit finally combining the two expressions above yields 82 p 3d w full scale α p 2d 0 4 p 2d pto unit in which w full scale 8 m is the width of the full scale model and α 20 is the length scaling factor for the 2d cases the average power absorbed by the pto unit is p 2d 1 6972 w for δ 0 5 and p 2d 1 1694 w for δ 0 2 0 for the 3d cases the average powers absorbed by the pto unit are 0 5915 w and 0 4178 w for δ 0 5 and δ 0 2 0 respectively which are close to the expected values of 0 6788 w and 0 4677 w predicted by eq 82 note that better agreement between the simulated and expected average powers in 3d can be obtained by increasing the spatial and temporal resolutions nevertheless we are confident that the dynamics are reasonably resolved for the chosen grid spacing and time step size next we perform a similar scaling analysis for 2d and 3d iswec models in irregular wave conditions irregular water waves are generated with properties h s 0 1 m t p 1 s and 50 wave components with frequencies ω i in the range 3 8 rad s to 20 rad s see fig 12 c through empirical testing fifty wave components were found to be sufficient to represent the energy of the jonswap spectrum we consider a maximum pitch angle of δ 0 5 for the device the evolution of δ for the two models are compared in fig 14 a similar to the regular wave case presented above the dynamics of the 2d and 3d models numerically agree and the energy transfer pathway eq 23 is nearly satisfied moreover the average power absorbed by the pto unit for the 2d model is p 2d 1 8859 w yielding an expected 3d power of 0 7543 w according to eq 82 this is close to the power value of 0 5538 w obtained by the 3d simulation based on these results we ultimately conclude that the 2d model is sufficient to accurately simulate iswec dynamics and to predict the power generation absorption capability of the converter hereafter we focus on further investigating dynamics and parameter choices for the 2d model 7 2 selection of prescribed hull pitch angle δ 0 in this section we investigate the relationship between the prescribed hull pitch angle parameter δ 0 the maximum pitch angle actually attained by the hull δ max through wsi and the maximum wave steepness of the incoming waves δ s recall that the maximum wave steepness was calculated in section 3 3 by approximating the fifth order wave as a linear harmonic wave we consider the iswec dynamics on four regular water waves with same time period t 1 s i e λ 1 5456 m but varying wave heights h 0 025 m 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 125 m each having maximum wave steepness δ s 2 9 5 8 11 4 8 and 14 2 5 respectively see eq 52 the prescribed pto and gyroscope system parameters for each sea state and six maximum pitch angle values δ 0 2 5 10 15 20 and δ s are shown in table 6 additionally δ 0 1 and 30 cases are also simulated but the parameter values are not tabulated for brevity the results of this parameter study are shown in fig 15 it is observed that when δ 0 δ s δ max increases linearly with δ 0 fig 15 a illustrating that the hull s maximum oscillation amplitude correlates well with δ 0 when the prescribed δ 0 is greater than δ s it is seen that δ max no longer increases rather it maintains a constant value with respect to δ 0 this indicates that further increasing δ 0 will not lead to larger pitch oscillations i e the δ max attained by the hull is the largest value permitted by the slopes of the wave in figs 15 b and 15 c we show trends in the maximum precession angle attained by the gyroscope ε max and the relative capture width rcw η which measures the device efficiency as a ratio of the average power absorbed by the pto unit to the average wave power per unit crest width see eq 27 maximization of both these quantities is achieved when δ 0 is set close to δ s as the hull achieves the maximum pitch angle physically permitted by the slopes of the wave further increasing δ 0 amounts to reducing j ϕ eq 25 or the hull gyroscope coupling which explains the reduction in both maximum precession and device efficiency hereafter we prescribe δ 0 based on the value maximizing η as we conduct further parametric analyses of the 2d iswec model 7 3 parametric analyses of gyroscope parameters in this section we conduct a parameter sweep around the energy maximizing pto and gyroscope parameters estimated by the theory presented in section 2 3 we test the theory s predictive capability and describe the effect of these parameters on the converter s performance and dynamics in each of the following subsections only a single parameter is varied at a time simulations are conducted using both regular water waves with h 0 1 m and t 1 s and irregular waves with h s 0 1 m t p 1 s and 50 wave components with frequencies ω i in the range 3 8 rad s to 20 rad s these wave conditions serve as device design conditions at its installation site for regular waves the prescribed pitch angle is taken to be δ 0 1 0 and the pto and gyroscope parameters are given in table 6 for irregular waves the prescribed pitch angle δ 0 5 is used the pto and gyroscope parameters remain the same as those used in the temporal resolution study see section 6 2 these particular values of δ 0 were found to maximize the rcw of the converter at design conditions for an example see fig 15 for regular waves with h 0 1 m and t 1 s 7 3 1 pto damping coefficient c we first consider the pto unit damping coefficient c which directly impacts the power absorption capability of the device we prescribe four different values c 0 05 0 3473 1 0 and 2 0 n m s rad to evaluate its impact on iswec dynamics the optimal damping coefficient value of c 0 3473 is predicted by the theory results for the hull interacting with regular waves are shown in fig 16 as expected for smaller damping coefficients the gyroscope is able to attain larger precession angles ε and velocities ε as seen in fig 16 b higher precession velocities yield larger pitch torque m δ values see eq 20 which opposes the motion of the hull and restrict its maximum pitch oscillation this is consistent with the dynamics shown in figs 16 a and 16 c moreover the hull s pitch velocity δ is reduced with decreasing c leading to a smaller in magnitude precession torque m ε acting on the pto shaft see eq 15 our simulations show this behavior as observed in fig 16 d in fig 16 e we compare the time averaged powers p hull p gyro and p pto as a function of varying pto damping coefficient it can be seen that these three powers are in reasonable agreement with each other indicating that the energy transfer pathway eq 23 is approximately satisfied in terms of power generation it is observed that the device achieves peak performance when a pto damping coefficient c 0 2 is prescribed which is close to the theoretically estimated c value of 0 3473 the percentage difference in powers is approximately 8 between these two c values the reason for an optimum value of c is as follows as the damping coefficient increases the precession velocity decreases the power absorbed by the pto unit is the product of c and ε 2 eq 11 and therefore these competing factors must be balanced in order to achieve maximum power generation finally in fig 16 f we show the evolution of the yaw torque m ϕ acting on the hull for c 0 3473 noting that its magnitude is approximately one fifth of the pitch torque m δ although this is not insignificant we do not consider the effect of m ϕ for the 3d iswec model see section 2 1 since its contribution will be canceled out 1 by using an even number of gyroscopic units if each flywheel pair spins with equal and opposite velocities raffero 2014 and 2 partially by the mooring system discounting m ϕ during the iswec design phase would misalign the converter with respect to the main wave direction which will reduce its performance it is also interesting to note that the yaw torque in the gyroscopic frame of reference m z 1 is at least two orders of magnitude lower than the yaw torque in the inertial reference frame as evidenced by the inset of fig 16 f similar dynamics are observed when the iswec model is simulated in irregular wave conditions for four different values c 0 05 0 1724 1 0 and 2 0 n m s rad the results are presented in appendix c 1 the optimal damping coefficient value of c 0 1724 is obtained from the theory the results are compared in fig c 26 the figure shows that the device achieves peak performance at a c value of 0 2 which is quite close to the theoretically predicted optimum value of c 0 1724 the percentage difference in powers is less than 2 between these two c values the response of the hull and gyroscope to irregular waves can be seen in figs 26 a and 26 b respectively the pitch torque and the precession torque are shown in figs 26 c and 26 d respectively from fig 26 e it is verified that the energy transfer pathway given by eq 23 is satisfied we note that the device efficiency is higher in irregular wave conditions as compared to regular wave conditions this can be seen by comparing the maximum value of relative capture width for h 0 1 m in figs 15 c and 26 f η max 24 36 vs η max 37 61 respectively the power carried by irregular waves is approximately half that of regular waves when they have the same significant height and time period therefore for the prescribed device dimensions the converter is more efficient in less energetic wave conditions 7 3 2 flywheel speed ϕ next we conduct a parameter sweep of the flywheel speed ϕ and investigate its effects on the iswec dynamics the speed of the flywheel affects not only the amount of angular momentum j ϕ generated in the gyroscope but also the magnitude of the gyroscopic torques produced as seen in eqs 15 and 20 we consider four different flywheel speeds ϕ 100 rpm 1000 rpm 4000 rpm and 8000 rpm with δ 0 10 and the remaining gyroscope parameter are prescribed based on table 6 recall that these values were obtained for ϕ 4000 rpm in table 6 the results for a hull interacting with regular waves are shown in fig 17 it is seen that the maximum pitch angle decreases with increasing ϕ fig 17 a while a non monotonic relationship is seen between the maximum precession angle and ϕ fig 17 b time averaged powers are shown in fig 17 c which again shows that eq 23 is approximately satisfied power absorption is maximized at flywheel speed of ϕ 4500 rpm which can be physically explained as follows as j ϕ increases the gyroscopic system is able to generate significant precession torque which increases the absorption capacity of the pto unit however this increased angular momentum also increases the pitch torque opposing the hull thereby limiting its pitching motion and reducing the power absorbed from the waves these two competing factors leads to an optimum value of ϕ similar dynamics are obtained when the iswec interacts with irregular waves for varying values of ϕ the results are shown in appendix c 2 the comparison of pitch angle for various ϕ values is shown in fig 27 a and of precession angle is shown in fig 27 b eq 23 is again satisfied as seen from the time averaged powers in fig 27 c in this case the power maximizing flywheel speed is ϕ 3500 rpm 7 3 3 flywheel moment of inertia j and i the angular momentum j ϕ generated in the gyroscope can also be modified by varying the flywheel size via its moment of inertia components j and i first we consider three different values j 0 0005 kg m 2 0 0058 kg m 2 and 0 5 kg m 2 which correspond to light medium and heavy weight gyroscopes respectively the j 0 0058 value is obtained from theoretical estimates based on the prescribed δ 0 and ε 0 values a value of i 0 94 j is set for each case and the remaining gyroscope parameters are prescribed based on table 6 the results for a hull interacting with regular waves are shown in fig 18 it is seen that the light gyroscope produces insignificant precession angles and torques due to the lack of angular momentum generated by the flywheel moreover the heavy gyroscope produces even smaller m ε torque as it slowly drifts around the pto axis the proportional component of the control torque k ε is not strong enough to return the gyroscope to its mean position of ε 0 additionally the light heavy weight gyroscope produces small large pitch torques m δ opposing the hull which explains the large small pitch amplitudes exhibited by the device finally it is seen that the medium weight gyroscope with j 0 0058 kg m 2 calculated from the procedure described in section 2 3 produces the largest precession amplitudes ε and velocities ε leading to high power absorption by the pto unit we also study the effect of varying i while keeping j 0 0058 kg m 2 fixed we consider four different values i 0 5 j i 0 75 j i 0 94 j and i 1 0 j and the results for a device interacting with regular waves are shown in fig 19 it is seen that the dynamics of the hull and gyroscope and the system powers are not significantly affected by the choice of i similarly iswec dynamics with irregular waves are studied for three different values of j results for varying j values are compared in fig c 28 in appendix c 3 which are qualitatively similar to the results obtained with regular waves the effect of varying i with respect to j is also simulated and the results are shown in fig c 29 in appendix c 3 it is seen that the hull pitch and the gyroscope precession angles are relatively insensitive to variations in i it is observed that the powers are relatively constant across different i values under irregular wave conditions as well 7 3 4 pto stiffness coefficient k finally we study the effect of varying the pto stiffness coefficient k on the dynamics of the iswec device this term appears as a restoring torque k ε in the precession angle eq 16 and acts to drive the gyroscope s oscillation about its mean position ε 0 the oscillation frequency is directly influenced by k and can be chosen to ensure a resonant condition is attained between the gyroscope and the incoming waves thus maximizing the power absorbed by the system we consider four different values of k 0 0 n m rad 0 2171 n m rad 1 0 n m rad and 5 0 n m rad with the remaining gyroscope parameter chosen according to table 6 the k 0 2171 value is obtained from theoretical considerations provided in section 2 3 the results for a hull interacting with regular waves are shown in fig 20 as k increases the maximum precession angle ε and velocity ε decreases leading to decreased power absorption by the device the increased pto stiffness value tends to keep the gyroscope close to its zero mean position which reduces the hull gyroscope coupling this can be observed from the lowered values of m δ torques in fig 20 c as a consequence the hull pitching motion increases as seen in fig 20 a the k 0 case warrants additional discussion when the pto stiffness is zero the gyroscope attains a larger maximum precession amplitude and generates more power than the k 0 cases over the time period t 10 s and t 20 s however fig 21 shows the long term dynamics for k 0 it is seen that the gyroscope is unable to sustain its precession oscillation as it eventually falls to one side ε 9 0 and remains there at this configuration the gyroscope yaw axis and the hull pitch axis are aligned and the precession effect is lost as these gyroscopic oscillations vanish the torques tend towards zero the hull exhibits unrestrained pitch oscillation and no power is generated next we simulate iswec dynamics with irregular waves using four different values of k 0 n m rad 0 2138 n m rad 1 0 n m rad and 5 0 n m rad the results are compared in fig c 30 in appendix c 4 and are qualitatively similar to the those obtained with regular waves similar behavior of the iswec with k 0 is observed the gyroscope is unable to oscillate and falls to one side ε 9 0 and produces vanishing precession effects however with irregular waves the precession effects are lost much sooner compared to the regular waves case 7 4 hull length to wavelength l λ variation in this section we study the effect of hull length to wavelength ratio l λ on the iswec dynamics we select three ratios l λ 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 for this analysis the length of the hull is kept constant at l 0 7665 m and the wavelength of the regular water waves is varied the pto and gyroscope parameters used in the three simulations are presented in table 7 results consist of temporal evolution of the hull pitch and gyroscope precession angles in figs 22 a and 22 b respectively it is observed that the hull pitch is maximum when λ 3 l λ 2 as discussed in section 2 4 as a consequence the gyroscope precesses more and the conversion efficiency of the device increases see fig 22 c 7 5 device protection during inclement weather conditions the iswec hull houses costly electro mechanical components that need to be protected during harsh stormy weather conditions during inclement weather the hull and gyroscope dynamics can be chaotic which may damage the system components to protect the housed components the gyroscope needs to be turned off this can be done by reducing the flywheel speed to zero using remote human machine interfaces the combined hull gyroscope system then behaves like a single floating entity in this section we simulate the dynamics of the iswec device as the flywheel speed is reduced to zero amidst steady operation we simulate this scenario with regular water waves of h 0 1 m and t 1 s to reduce the flywheel speed from 4000 rpm to 0 rpm we use the following relation 83 ϕ t 4000 1 f t 2 in which f t is a function that smoothly transitions from 1 to 1 in the transition time interval δ t the function f is given by 84 f tanh 2 π t t half δ t in which t half t start δ t 2 in our simulation we set t start 15 s and δ t 5 s fig 23 e shows the smooth transition of the flywheel speed towards zero in 5 s when the gyroscope is turned off the precession effects cease and the system attains a mean zero position thus protecting the internal hardware and device components this is seen in figs 23 b 23 c and 23 d which show that ε m δ and m ε are reduced to zero respectively as the gyroscopic effects vanish the hull is observed to be oscillating with greater pitch amplitude fig 23 a from the device protection standpoint this poses no critical issue as the external hull is specifically designed to weather sea storms 8 conclusions in this study we systematically investigated the wave structure interaction dynamics of the inertial sea wave energy converter iswec technology our computational model is based on the incompressible navier stokes equations and employs the fictitious domain brinkman penalization fd bp approach to handle the fluid structure coupling the dynamics of the iswec hull and gyroscope system were coupled to this cfd solver to enable fully resolved 1 dof simulations of the device to emulate realistic operating conditions of the device a numerical wave tank was used to generate both regular waves based on fifth order stokes theory and irregular waves based on the jonswap spectrum we performed froude scaling analysis of the full scale iswec model to determine the required parameters for our 1 20 scaled down two and three dimensional simulations our numerical investigation demonstrated that the 2d model was sufficient to accurately simulate the hull s pitching motion and to predict the power generation absorption capability of the converter we showed that setting the prescribed hull pitch angle parameter δ 0 close to the maximum wave steepness will maximize the device s relative capture width i e power generation efficiency a comprehensive parameter sweep demonstrated that the device achieves peak performance when the gyroscope specifications are chosen based on the reactive control theory described in section 2 3 it was also shown that a proportional control of the pto control torque is required to generate continuous precession effects of the gyroscope without which the gyroscope tends to align with the hull pitch axis under this scenario the device does not generate any power we also showed that although the yaw torque in the gyroscope reference frame is small it is of the same order of magnitude as the pitch torque induced on the hull in an inertial reference frame therefore the yaw torque on the hull should be considered in the design phase of these devices to avoid any misalignment of the converter from the main wave direction our simulations also verify that the hull length to wavelength ratio should be between one half and one third to achieve high conversion efficiency throughout our parameter study we numerically verify the theoretical power transfer pathway between the water waves and the hull the hull and the gyroscope and the gyroscope to the pto unit for both regular and irregular wave environments although the power transfer is derived for iswec devices in this work an analogous relationship could be derived for heaving or surging point absorbers finally we investigated the dynamics of the iswec system as the flywheel speed is reduced to zero to emulate device protection during inclement weather conditions by making use of high performance computing our work demonstrates that it is feasible to use fully resolved simulations to interrogate the device physics and dynamics of wave energy converters they can also be used as a design tool to explore the parametric space for further optimization of such devices credit authorship contribution statement kaustubh khedkar data generation

1931368 nsf xsede and sdsu fermi compute resources are particularly acknowledged appendix a two degrees of freedom iswec model we compare the hull and gyroscope dynamics obtained using two degrees of freedom pitch and heave and one degree of freedom pitch only iswec models the same case from fig 24 a is simulated using the two models on a medium grid resolution figs 24 a and 24 b show the comparison of hull pitch angle δ and gyroscope precession angle ε respectively as observed in fig a 24 including an additional heave degree of freedom only marginally affects the rotational motion of the hull and gyroscope and consequently the power output of the device fig 24 c shows the heave dynamics of the hull about its mean z location the heave amplitude is approximately one tenth of the hull height for the prescribed wave characteristics although the heave motion is not negligible in this case it nonetheless does not significantly affect the rotational dynamics in contrast to heave the surge degree of freedom can affect the relative phase between the wave excitation forces and the body motion which can lead to a different set of optimal parameters of the device than those found without considering the surge motion however the surge motion of the iswec device is assumed to be negligible because of the motion constraints imposed by the mooring system finally fig 24 d shows that the power transfer equation is satisfied even for the 2 dof iswec model appendix b effect of domain width in 3d simulations here we simulate the iswec dynamics by taking three different tank widths to select a sufficiently wide tank that reduces the interference caused by the lateral walls on the device dynamics the 3d regular wave case with a prescribed pitch angle of δ 0 5 as discussed in section 7 1 is considered the selected widths for the wave tank are 3 w 5 w and 7 w in which w is the hull width of the 3d iswec model among the considered widths the 7 w tank width case has the iswec device located farthest away from the lateral walls and is therefore expected to be least affected from the wall interference effects the temporal evolution of hull pitch angle is compared for three wave tank widths and the results are shown in fig b 25 from the plots it is observed that there is not much difference in the pitch dynamics of the device however taking a closer look at the inset plot reveals that the results obtained using a tank width of 5 w is closer to those obtained using a width of 7 w hence we take the tank width to be 5 w in our 3d simulations which has a lower

20821,in this paper we investigate the dynamics of the inertial sea wave energy converter iswec device using fully resolved computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations originally prototyped by the polytechnic university of turin the device consists of a floating boat shaped hull that is slack moored to the sea bed internally a gyroscopic power take off pto unit converts the wave induced pitch motion of the hull into electrical energy the cfd model is based on the incompressible navier stokes equations and utilizes the fictitious domain brinkman penalization fd bp technique to couple the device physics and water wave dynamics a numerical wave tank is used to generate both regular waves based on fifth order stokes theory and irregular waves based on the jonswap spectrum to emulate realistic sea operating conditions a froude scaling analysis is performed to enable two and three dimensional simulations for a scaled down 1 20 iswec model it is demonstrated that the scaled down 2d model is sufficient to accurately simulate the hull s pitching motion and to predict the power generation capability of the converter a systematic parameter study of the iswec is conducted and its optimal performance in terms of power generation is determined based on the hull and gyroscope control parameters it is demonstrated that the device achieves peak performance when the gyroscope specifications are chosen based on the reactive control theory it is shown that a proportional control of the pto control torque is required to generate continuous gyroscopic precession effects without which the device generates no power in an inertial reference frame it is demonstrated that the yaw and pitch torques acting on the hull are of the same order of magnitude informing future design investigations of the iswec technology further an energy transfer pathway from the water waves to the hull the hull to the gyroscope and the gyroscope to the pto unit is analytically described and numerically verified additional parametric analysis demonstrates that a hull length to wavelength ratio between one half and one third yields high conversion efficiency ratio of power absorbed by the pto unit to wave power per unit crest width finally device protection during inclement weather conditions is emulated by gradually reducing the gyroscope flywheel speed to zero and the resulting dynamics are investigated keywords renewable energy wave structure interaction brinkman penalization method numerical wave tank level set method adaptive mesh refinement 1 introduction ocean waves are a substantial source of renewable energy with an estimated 2 11 0 05 tw available globally gunn and stock williams 2012 for perspective the united states generated 3 7 twy terawatt years 1 1 1 twy 8 76 1 0 12 kwh worth of energy in 2013 making up about 20 of the world s total energy production of this amount only about 9 or 0 33 twy was generated from renewable sources it is estimated that the us will produce approximately 8 65 twy by 2050 korde and ringwood 2016 there is an ever increasing need to invest in renewable energy harvesting techniques in order to accelerate economic growth while maintaining a safe and healthy planet earth wave energy conversion is one of the crucial strategies towards realizing future energy sustainability it is estimated that about 230 twh year of wave energy can be extracted from the east coast and about 590 twh year from the west coast of the united states alone in spite of this abundantly available energy source there is currently no commercial scale wave power operation that exists today there are several unique challenges specific to wave energy extraction processes including hostile ocean environments saltwater corrosion stochasticity of ocean and sea waves and costly offshore wave farm setup nevertheless steady progress is being made both in the design and engineering analyses of wave energy extraction devices which are known as wave energy converters wecs consequently several wec designs have been proposed over the years after gaining popularity following the 1970s oil crisis however unlike wind turbines an ultimate wec architecture has not yet been identified by researchers one wec design that addresses some of the critical wave energy extraction challenges is the inertial sea wave energy converter iswec device prototyped by the polytechnic university of turin bracco et al 2011 cagninei et al 2015 vissio 2017 this device consists of a floating boat shaped hull that is slack moored to the seabed which internally houses a gyroscopic power take off unit pto see fig 1 the iswec can be classified as a pitching point absorber whose dimensions are shorter than the length of the water waves the device utilizes precession effects produced from the spinning gyroscope and pitching hull to drive a sealed electric generator pto the rotational velocity of the spinning gyroscope and the pto control torque act as sea state tuning parameters that can be optimized controlled in real time or via remote human machine interfaces to enhance the conversion efficiency of the device since all crucial electro mechanical parts are sealed within the hull the iswec is a robust and cost effective wave energy conversion technology due to its simple design devices can be produced by retrofitting abandoned ships which can potentially reduce manufacturing costs and lead to easy adoption of the technology moreover such devices could be lined up end to end just offshore which would not only ensure maximal wave energy absorption but also protection of the coastline although iswec devices have only recently been prototyped since their inception in 2011 by bracco et al 2011 2009 2010a b 2012 their design and performance has been of much interest to the greater research community in the past few years medeiros and brizzolara 2018 used the boundary element method bem based on linear potential flow equations to simulate the iswec and evaluate its power generation capabilities as a function of flywheel speed and derivative control of the pto torque they also demonstrated that the spinning gyroscopes can induce yaw torque on the hull faedo et al used an alternative moment matching based approach to model the radiation force convolution integral thereby overcoming the computational and representational drawbacks of simulating iswec devices using the bem based cummins equation faedo et al 2018 although these lower fidelity methods are able to simulate iswec dynamics at low computational costs they are unable to resolve highly nonlinear phenomena often seen during practical operation such as wave breaking and wave overtopping unsurprisingly the turin group has extensively used carefully calibrated with respect to wave tank experiments bem models to refine and optimize their preliminary designs bracco et al 2015 2019 raffero et al 2015 bracco et al 2016 in contrast simulations based on the incompressible navier stokes ins equations are able to resolve the wave structure interaction wsi quite accurately and without making small motion approximations employed by low fidelity bem models ruehl et al 2014 yu and li 2013 however fully resolved ins simulations are computationally expensive and typically require high performance computing hpc frameworks a compromise between the linear bem and fully nonlinear cfd models is the nonlinear bem framework in which nonlinear wave excitation froude krylov forces are used to simulate the device dynamics based on its instantaneous wetted surface recent studies novo et al 2018 penalba et al 2017 giorgi et al 2020 have successfully simulated the wec dynamics considering the nonlinear effects arising from the device geometry viscous forces and wave excitation forces using the nonlinear bem framework the nonlinear effects can be important particularly when an aggressive control is used for a wec device which may push the device to operate in a nonlinear dynamical regime although fully nonlinear cfd models are computationally expensive nevertheless in a preliminary study bergmann et al enabled fully resolved simulation of the iswec s wave structure interaction by making use of an ins based flow solver coupled to an immersed boundary method bergmann et al 2015 the wave propagation in their channel followed the canonical dam break problem setup nangia et al 2019a a column of water is released from one end of the channel which is then reflected from the opposite end and so forth although such simple wave propagation models are not suitable to study the device performance at a real site of operation bergmann et al were able to capture key device dynamics in their simulations in addition to these research efforts industry has become interested in piloting and manufacturing these devices recently the multinational oil and gas corporation eni installed an iswec device off the coast of ravenna 2 2 https www eni com en it operations iswec eni html near their offshore assets it is clear that there is a need to further investigate iswec dynamics and explore the design space to enable rapid adoption of this technology possibly through an industry academic partnership in this work we perform a comprehensive study of the iswec device using high fidelity simulations from a previously developed fictitious domain brinkman penalization fd bp method based on the incompressible navier stokes equations bhalla et al 2020 although the methodology is similar to the work of bergmann et al we consider more realistic operating conditions by using a numerical wave tank nwt to generate both regular and irregular water waves we conduct a systematic variation of control parameters i e pto control torque flywheel moment of inertia and speed hull length to determine the optimal performance of the device in term of power generation and study its dynamics as a function of these parameters we also provide a theoretical basis to obtain the optimal control parameters for the device s design at a specific installation site moreover we analytically describe an energy transfer pathway from water waves to the hull the hull to the gyroscope and the gyroscope to the power take off pto unit and verify that it is numerically satisfied by our simulations a froude scaling analysis is performed to reduce the computational cost of simulating a full scale iswec device which is used to define the geometry and flow conditions for both two and three dimensional simulations of a scaled down 1 20 iswec device additionally we verify that the 2d iswec model produced similar dynamics to the 3d model thereby allowing us to obtain accurate results at reduced simulation cycle times we also simulate a possible device protection strategy during inclement weather conditions and study the resulting dynamics the rest of the paper is organized as follows we first describe the dynamics power generation geometric properties and scaling analysis of the iswec device in section 2 next we describe the numerical wave tank approach used to generate both regular and irregular waves for our simulations in section 3 in section 4 we describe the continuous and discrete equations for the multiphase wave structure interaction system and outline validate the solution methodology for the fd bp technique in section 5 we briefly describe the software implementation and computing hardware utilized in this study in section 6 we perform spatial and temporal resolution tests to select a grid spacing and time step size that ensures adequate resolution of iswec dynamics finally in section 7 we conduct a systematic parameter study on the various hull and gyroscope parameters and evaluate the device performance in terms of generated power 2 iswec dynamics in this section we mathematically describe the dynamics power generation and geometric properties of the iswec device 2 1 iswec dynamics externally the iswec device appears as a monolithic hull that is slack moored to the seabed internally the device houses a spinning gyroscopic system that drives a sealed electric generator the pitching motion of the hull is mainly responsible for converting the wave motion into electrical output to simplify the model and discussion the other remaining degrees of freedom of the hull are not considered in this study see appendix a for a comparison of one and two degrees of freedom iswec models as the device operates the combination of wave induced pitching torque along δ axis and spinning gyroscope flywheel velocity ϕ along ϕ axis induces a precession torque in the ε coordinate direction the wave energy conversion is made possible by damping the motion along the ε direction by the electric generator which is commonly referred to as the power take off pto unit fig 2 a shows the schematic of the iswec device including the external hull ballast gyroscope and pto unit to derive the three way coupling between the waves hull and gyroscopic system we consider an inertial reference frame x y z attached to the hull and a rotating non inertial reference frame x 1 y 1 z 1 attached to the gyroscope as shown in fig 2 b the gyroscope reference frame is obtained from the hull reference frame by two subsequent finite rotations δ and ε the origin of both reference frames is taken to be the center of gravity of the device in the absence of waves δ 0 and ε 0 and the flywheel rotates with a constant angular velocity ϕ along the vertical z 1 axis this configuration is taken to be the initial position of the device in which the two reference frames also coincide when the first wave reaches the hull location a wave induced pitching torque tilts the device by an angle δ and the hull attains a pitching velocity δ along the x axis the gyroscope structure rotates by the same angle δ about the x or the x 1 axis the rotated configuration of the x 1 y 1 z 1 reference frame is shown by dashed lines in fig 2 b as the hull begins to pitch the gyroscope is subject to two angular velocities δ along x 1 axis and ϕ along z 1 axis this wave induced pitching torque and the angular velocity of the spinning gyroscope produces a precession torque in the third orthogonal direction y 1 this induced torque precesses the gyroscope by an angle ε about the y 1 axis as a result of the two subsequent rotations the gyroscope frame attains an orientation shown by bold red lines in fig 2 b the evolution of the gyroscope s dynamics results in a gyroscopic torque m g m x 1 m y 1 m z 1 which can be related to the rotational kinematic variables using conservation of angular momentum the angular velocity ω 1 of the gyroscope reference frame and the angular velocity ω g of the gyroscope are both written in the x 1 y 1 z 1 coordinate system and their evolution can be expressed in terms of δ ε and ϕ as 1 ω 1 δ cos ε i ˆ 1 ε j ˆ 1 δ sin ε k ˆ 1 2 ω g δ cos ε i ˆ 1 ε j ˆ 1 δ sin ε ϕ k ˆ 1 in which i ˆ 1 j ˆ 1 and k ˆ 1 are the unit vectors along x 1 y 1 and z 1 directions respectively the rate of change of the gyroscope s angular momentum with respect to time is related to the gyroscopic torque m g by 3 m g d h g d t in which h g i g ω g is the angular momentum of the gyroscope and i g is the inertia matrix of the gyroscope in the x 1 y 1 z 1 reference frame i g reads as 4 i g i x 1 x 1 0 0 0 i y 1 y 1 0 0 0 i z 1 z 1 i 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 j the flywheel structure including its support brackets etc is typically designed such that i x 1 x 1 i y 1 y 1 i and i z 1 z 1 j i using eqs 2 and 4 the angular momentum of the flywheel is given by 5 h g i δ cos ε i ˆ 1 i ε j ˆ 1 j δ sin ε ϕ k ˆ 1 differentiating eq 5 with respect to time in the inertial reference frame involves computing time derivatives of the unit vectors i ˆ 1 j ˆ 1 and k ˆ 1 6 d i ˆ 1 d t ω 1 i ˆ 1 ε k ˆ 1 δ sin ε j ˆ 1 7 d j ˆ 1 d t ω 1 j ˆ 1 δ cos ε k ˆ 1 δ sin ε i ˆ 1 8 d k ˆ 1 d t ω 1 k ˆ 1 δ cos ε j ˆ 1 ε i ˆ 1 finally after some algebraic simplifications a componentwise expression for the gyroscopic torque m g is obtained 9 m g m x 1 m y 1 m z 1 i δ cos ε j 2 i δ ε sin ε j ϕ ε i ε i j δ 2 sin ε cos ε j ϕ δ cos ε j δ sin ε j δ ε cos ε j ϕ the precession velocity ε of the generator shaft is damped using a proportional derivative pd control law implemented in the pto unit the pd control torque can be modeled as a spring damper system with the following form 10 m ε m g j ˆ 1 k ε c ε here k is a spring like stiffness parameter and c is a damper like dissipation parameter that can be adjusted in real time usually through feedback to enhance the conversion efficiency of the device when the incoming waves change their characteristics the wave power absorbed by the pto unit as a function of time is 11 p pto c ε 2 therefore the precession component of the gyroscopic torque is balanced by the pd control torque m y 1 m ε which is also responsible for extracting the wave energy the other components m x 1 and m z 1 of the gyroscopic torque are balanced sustained by the hydrodynamic torques acting on the hull and the subsequent hull gyroscope interactions to understand this balance we consider the hydrodynamic torque and motion of the hull about the pitch x direction as observed from the inertial reference frame x y z 12 m hydro i h d δ d t m δ in which m hydro is the hydrodynamic torque acting on the hull i h is the moment of inertia of the hull and m δ is the projection of the gyroscopic torque on the x axis 13 m δ m g i ˆ m g i ˆ 1 cos ε k ˆ 1 sin ε j sin 2 ε i cos 2 ε δ j ϕ ε cos ε 2 j i δ ε sin ε cos ε j ϕ sin ε from eq 12 it can be seen that the gyroscopic reaction m δ acting on the hull opposes the wave induced pitching motion similarly a second reaction torque m ϕ acts on the hull along the z direction and opposes its wave induced yaw motion 14 m ϕ m g k ˆ m g k ˆ 1 cos ε i ˆ 1 sin ε cos δ j ˆ 1 sin δ j i δ sin ε cos ε δ ε j cos 2 ε sin 2 ε 2 i sin 2 ε j ϕ ε sin ε j ϕ cos ε cos δ i ε i j δ 2 sin ε cos ε j ϕ δ cos ε sin δ in section 7 3 1 we show that this yaw torque is the same order of magnitude as the pitch torque m δ in practice however its contribution is partially cancelled out by the mooring system of the device moreover using an even number of gyroscopic units will cancel the yaw component of the gyroscopic torque acting on the hull if each flywheel pair spins with equal and opposite velocity as described by raffero 2014 therefore we do not consider the effect of m ϕ on the iswec dynamics in our 3d model 2 2 power transfer from waves to pto to understand the power transfer from waves to the hull and from the hull to the pto unit we derive the time averaged kinetic energy equations of the iswec system these equations highlight the coupled terms that are responsible for wave energy conversion through the iswec device first we consider the rotation of the gyroscope around the pto axis the equation of motion in the ε coordinate direction as derived in the previous section is re written below 15 i ε i j δ 2 sin ε cos ε j ϕ δ cos ε m ε k ε c ε rearranging eq 15 with the approximation i j simplifies the equation to 16 i ε c ε k ε j ϕ δ cos ε from the above equation it can be seen that the product of the hull s pitch velocity δ and the gyroscope s angular velocity ϕ yields a forcing term that drives the pto motion multiplying eq 16 by the precession velocity ε and rearranging some terms we obtain the kinetic energy equation for the pto dynamics 17 i d dt ε 2 2 c ε 2 k d dt ε 2 2 j ϕ δ ε cos ε taking the time average of eq 17 over one wave period the first and third terms on the left hand side of the equation evaluate to zero the remaining terms describe the transfer of power from the hull to the pto unit 18 c ε 2 j ϕ δ ε cos ε in which 1 t t t t dt represents the time average of a quantity over one wave period t 3 3 for irregular waves the time average could be defined over one significant wave period here c ε 2 is the average power absorbed by the pto denoted p pto and j ϕ δ ε cos ε is the average power generated due to the gyroscopic motion through its interaction with the hull denoted p gyro similarly the kinetic energy equation of the hull can be derived by multiplying the hull dynamics eq 12 by the pitch velocity δ 19 m hydro δ i h δ δ m δ δ under the assumptions i j and a constant gyroscope spinning speed m δ in eq 13 simplifies to 20 m δ j δ j ϕ ε cos ε using eqs 19 and 20 and rearranging some terms we obtain 21 m hydro δ i h d dt δ 2 2 j d dt δ 2 2 j ϕ δ ε cos ε taking the time average of eq 21 over one wave period the first and second terms on the right hand side evaluate to zero and the expression reads 22 m hydro δ j ϕ δ ε cos ε here m hydro δ is the power transferred from the waves to the hull denoted p hull and j ϕ δ ε cos ε is the same expression on the right side of eq 18 hence combining eqs 18 and 22 we obtain an equation describing the pathway of energy transfer from waves to the pto 23 m hydro δ waves hull j ϕ δ ε cos ε hull gyroscope c ε 2 gyroscope pto which is written succinctly as p hull p gyro p pto eq 23 is quantitatively verified for the iswec model under both regular and irregular wave environments in section 7 2 3 pto and gyroscope parameters the energy transfer equation can be used to select the pto and gyroscope parameters that achieve a rated power of the installed device p r from eq 23 24 c p r ε 2 2 p r ε 0 2 in which ε 0 is the amplitude of the precession velocity expressed in terms of the amplitude of the precession angle ε 0 as ε 0 ε 0 ω here we assume that all of the iswec components are excited at the external wave frequency ω 2 π t to achieve optimal performance based on experimental data of real iswec devices vissio 2017 cagninei et al 2015 we prescribe ε 0 in the range 40 ε 0 80 to obtain the damping parameter c from eq 24 to prescribe the rest of the gyroscope parameters we make use of eq 18 since this expression is nonlinear we linearize it about ε 0 a reasonable approximation for relatively calm conditions to estimate the gyroscope angular momentum as 25 j ϕ c ε 0 δ 0 in which the amplitude of the hull pitch velocity δ 0 δ 0 ω expressed in terms of the amplitude of the hull pitch angle δ 0 is used again based on the experimental data we prescribe δ 0 in the range 2 δ 0 20 and ϕ in the range 250 ϕ 1000 rpm 4 4 this range of ϕ is for the full scale iswec device which can be scaled by an appropriate factor for the scaled down model see section 2 5 for scaling analyses to obtain the j value of the gyroscope from eq 25 the i value of the gyroscope is set as a scaled value of j i e i γ j where γ 1 we study the effect of varying γ in section 7 3 3 the only remaining free parameter is the pto stiffness k used in the control torque we make use of reactive control theory korde and ringwood 2016 and prescribe k as 26 k ω 2 i ensuring that the gyroscopic system oscillates at the wave frequency around the pto axis using the linearized version of eq 16 it can be shown that if the gyroscope oscillates with the external wave forcing frequency a resonance condition is achieved along the pto axis and the output power is maximized korde and ringwood 2016 in this state both the hull and gyroscopic systems oscillate at the external wave frequency and their coupling is maximized 2 4 hull shape the iswec s external hull is a boat shaped vessel which we idealize by a half cylinder of length l height h and width w for the actual device a part of the outer periphery is flattened out to ease the installation of mechanical and electrical parts near the bottom center location see fig 3 b we neglect these geometric details in our model shown in fig 3 a the inside of the device is mostly hollow and the buoyancy countering ballast is placed around the outer periphery the hull length l is a function of λ the wavelength of the design wave at device installation site as analyzed by cagninei et al 2015 the optimal hull length is between λ 3 l λ 2 for an iswec device that is mainly excited in the pitch direction the hull width w is decided based on the rated power of the installed device p r relative capture width rcw conversion efficiency of the device assuming a unit width η and wave power per unit crest width p wave these quantities are related through the expressions 27 w p r η p wave and η p pto p wave in which p denotes time averaged power section 3 provides closed form expressions of p wave for both regular and irregular waves for the 2d iswec model we use w 1 which corresponds to a unit crest width of the wave 2 5 scaled iswec model in order to reduce the computational cost of simulating a full scale iswec device operating in high reynolds number re regimes we use froude scaling journée and massie 2001 to scale the model problem down by a 1 20 ratio the froude number fr measures the resistance of a partially submerged object moving through water and is defined as 28 fr characteristic velocity gravitational wave velocity u c g l c in which u c is the characteristic velocity l c is the characteristic length and g is the gravitational acceleration constant in offshore marine hydromechanics froude scaling allows us to compare the dynamics of two vessels even if their sizes are different since they produce a similar wake two vessels having the same froude number may not be operating in the same reynolds number regime in the present study the scaled down model operates in lower re conditions and it does not capture fine scale details such as extreme wave breaking and spray dynamics that occur at higher reynolds numbers these small scale features are mostly dictated by viscous and surface tension effects and a very fine computational mesh is needed to adequately resolve them however the main quantities of interest such as power generated for the full scale device can be inferred from scaled down simulations by using appropriate scaling factors some of which we derive next length scaling the geometric parameters such as length width or height are simply scaled by a factor of α in the present study we use α 20 an exception to this length scaling is hull width in 2d which is taken to be unity in the scaled model therefore in 2d the scaling factor for hull width is w rather than α acceleration scaling the full scale and scaled down models operate under the same gravitational force field therefore the gravitational constant g or any other acceleration remains unchanged density scaling density is an intrinsic material property and thus it remains the same for both the full scale and scaled down models volume scaling since volume is proportional to the length cubed it is scaled by α 3 mass scaling mass can be expressed as a product of density ρ and volume and its scaling for 2d and 3d iswec models are obtained as 29 m model m full scale ρ l h w model ρ l h w full scale w model α 2 w full scale velocity scaling velocity scaling is obtained by equating the froude numbers 30 u c g l c model u c g l c full scale 31 u c model u c full scale l c model l c full scale 1 α 1 2 time scaling letting t c represent a characteristic time time scaling can be obtained from the length and velocity scalings as 32 u c model u c full scale l c t c model l c t c full scale 33 t c model t c full scale 1 α 1 2 similarly scaling factors of other quantities of interest such as force and power can be obtained in terms of α and are enumerated in table 1 for both two and three spatial dimensions full scale scaled down quantities should be divided multiplied by factors in the third and fourth columns to obtain the scaled down full scale quantities in three and two spatial dimensions respectively 2 6 scaled hull parameters in this section we use the froude scaling derived in the previous section to obtain the scaled down hull parameters required for our simulations the scaled down parameters of the gyroscope will be presented in section 7 where they are systematically varied to study their effect on device performance the hull properties of the full scale iswec device are taken from an experimental campaign cagninei et al 2015 vissio 2017 conducted at the pantelleria test site in the mediterranean sea the scaled down 1 20 values of the hull properties are tabulated in table 2 to verify that the scaled down values correlate well to the model geometry we perform geometric estimation of the hull properties by assuming the hull to be a filled sector of a circle in two spatial dimensions the geometric center gc and the center of buoyancy cb of the submerged sector can be calculated geometrically and are found to be located at a distance z gc 0 0163 m and z cb 0 0605 m below the still waterline respectively see fig 4 from table 2 the scaled distance between the center of gravity of the device and waterline is z cg 0 0285 m it can be seen that the cb lies below the cg and gc satisfying the stability condition for floating bodies additionally cg lies below gc because in the real device more mass is distributed towards the lower half portion similarly the scaled down moment of inertia of the hull i h can be argued geometrically we first estimate the density of the hull from the scaled mass 90 kg and the area of the sector 0 1225 m2 to be ρ estimate 734 69 kg m 3 then we use ρ estimate to calculate the moment of inertia of the filled sector about its geometric center as i gc 3 1768 kg m2 in the real device most of the mass is concentrated along the outer periphery resembling a ring rather than a filled sector since the moment of inertia of a ring is twice as that of a filled circle i estimate 2 i gc 6 3536 kg m2 which is close to what we obtain from table 2 3 wave dynamics this section describes the types of waves both regular and irregular and the numerical tank approach used to simulate the iswec dynamics 3 1 regular waves we use fenton s fifth order wave theory fenton 1985 to generate regular waves of height h time period t and wavelength λ according to fifth order stokes theory and assuming that the waves propagate in the positive y direction the wave elevation η y t from a still water surface at depth d above the sea floor is 34 η y t s η 1 y t s 2 η 2 y t s 3 η 3 y t s 4 η 4 y t s 5 η 5 y t in which s κ h 2 is the wave steepness η 1 κ 1 cos ω t κ y is the basic harmonic component κ 2 π λ is the wavenumber and ω 2 π t is the wave frequency the remaining terms in eq 34 are higher order corrections to linear wave theory whose details are given in fenton 1985 the velocity and pressure solutions to the fifth order stokes wave can also be found in fenton 1985 the fifth order stokes waves satisfy the dispersion relationship given by 35 ω 2 g κ tanh κ d which relates the wavenumber κ to the wave frequency ω eq 35 is an implicit equation requiring an iterative process to compute κ given ω or vice versa instead an explicit equation can be used with sufficient accuracy in all water depth regimes fenton 1988 36 κ d γ β 2 cosh β 2 tanh β β cosh β 2 in which β γ tanh γ 1 2 and γ ω 2 d g a converter s efficiency η is measured relative to the available wave energy at the installation site the traveling water waves transport kinetic and potential energy as they move along the sea or ocean surface which is partially absorbed by the converter the time averaged wave power per unit crest width carried by regular waves in the propagation direction is given by journée and massie 2001 37 p wave 1 8 ρ w g h 2 c g in which ρ w is the density of water and c g is the group velocity of waves the velocity with which wave energy is transported given by 38 c g 1 2 λ t 1 2 κ d sinh 2 κ d in the deep water limit where d λ 2 and κ d eqs 35 and 38 become 39 ω 2 g κ or λ g t 2 2 π and c g λ 2 t deep water limit using eq 39 in eq 37 the wave power in the deep water limit can be expressed as 40 p wave ρ w g 2 h 2 t 32 π h 2 t kw m deep water limit in which the constant numerical factor ρ w g 2 32 π 1 0 3 when evaluated with si units when simulating a scaled down model both h and λ are scaled down by the length scale α to generate waves similar to the full scale model the scaled time period is obtained from the dispersion relationship between λ and t 3 2 irregular waves irregular waves depict a more realistic sea state and are modeled as a superposition of a large number of first order regular wave components using the superposition principle the sea surface elevation is expressed as 41 η y t i 1 n a i cos κ i y ω i t θ i in which n is the number of wave components each having its own amplitude a i angular frequency ω i wavenumber κ i and a random phase θ i the wavenumber κ i is related to the angular frequency ω i by the dispersion relationship given by eq 35 the phases θ i of each wave component are random variables following a uniform distribution in the range 0 2 π the linear superposition of wave components also implies that the energy carried by an irregular wave is the sum of the energy transported by individual wave components when the number of wave components n tends to infinity a continuous wave spectral density function s ω is used to describe the energy content of the wave components in an infinitesimal frequency bandwidth d ω the area under the curve gives the total energy of an irregular wave modulo the factor ρ w g discretely the component wave frequencies are typically chosen at an equal interval of δ ω between a narrow bandwidth of frequencies the wave spectrum s ω approaches zero for frequencies outside the narrow bandwidth and peaks at a particular value of frequency ω p here we consider only singly peaked wave spectra the amplitude of each wave component is related to the spectral density function by 42 a i 2 s ω i δ ω the standard uni directional wave energy spectra s ω are based on two parameters the significant wave height and the average wave period journée and massie 2001 one such wave energy spectrum was defined by hasselmann et al 1973 who analyzed the fetch limited or coastal wind generated sea data collected during the joint north sea wave project jonswap carried out in 1968 and 1969 in this work we use the jonswap spectrum to generate irregular waves which reads as 43 s ω 320 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1950 t p 4 ω 4 γ a in which h s is the significant wave height and t p is the peak time period i e the time period with the highest spectral peak see fig 5 the remaining parameters in eq 43 are 44 γ 3 3 peakedness factor a exp ω ω p 1 σ 2 2 45 ω p 2 π t p angular frequency at spectral peak 46 σ 0 07 if ω ω p 0 09 if ω ω p the peak enhancement factor γ a in eq 43 accounts for the fully developed sea state for more details on the assumptions used to define the jonswap spectrum we refer the readers to hasselmann et al 1973 the mean wave power per unit crest width carried by an irregular wave is obtained from s ω as 47 p wave ρ w g 0 s ω d ω c g ρ w g i 1 n 1 2 a i 2 c g in which the group velocity c g is calculated from eq 38 using the significant wavelength and peak time period of the spectrum in the deep water limit eq 47 simplifies to 48 p wave 0 49 h s 2 t p kw m deep water limit 3 3 wave steepness as discussed in section 2 3 if the oscillation frequencies of the hull and gyroscope system are synchronized with that of the wave the coupling between the hull and the gyroscope system and therefore the output power can be increased along with frequency synchronization the oscillation amplitude of the hull can also be increased to enhance the device performance this will result in more power transfer from the hull to the gyroscope system the wave steepness s defined in eq 34 which gives a relation between the wave height h and wavelength λ plays an important role in deciding the pto and gyroscope system parameters such that the hull exhibits larger pitching motion this is achieved by adjusting the gyroscope and pto parameters such that the maximum hull pitch angle amplitude δ 0 is expected to reach the maximum wave steepness angle δ s of the incoming wave an expression for δ s can be obtained by approximating the incoming wave as a regular simple harmonic wave with elevation η y t given by 49 η y t a cos κ y ω t where a h 2 is the wave amplitude differentiating the above equation with respect to y we obtain 50 d η y t d y a κ sin κ y ω t the maximum wave steepness i e the slope is obtained when sin κ y ω t 1 51 d η y t d y max κ h 2 s finally the maximum wave steepness angle is then given by 52 δ s tan 1 κ h 2 tan 1 π h λ when the condition δ 0 δ s is used to calculate the gyroscope and pto parameters the iswec device is observed to have maximum efficiency a study on the variation of δ 0 relative to δ s for different wave heights is conducted in section 7 2 3 4 numerical wave tank the wave structure interaction of the scaled down iswec device is simulated in a numerical wave tank nwt as shown in fig 6 water waves are generated at the left boundary of the domain using dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity components the waves traveling in the positive y direction are reflected back towards the inlet side from the device surface and also from the right boundary of the domain this results in wave distortion and wave interference phenomena which reduces the quality of waves reaching the device to study its performance several techniques have been proposed in the literature miquel et al 2018 windt et al 2018 2019 to mitigate these effects including the relaxation zone method jacobsen et al 2012 the active wave absorption method higuera et al 2013 frigaard and brorsen 1995 schäffer and klopman 2000 the momentum damping method choi and yoon 2009 ha et al 2013 the viscous beach method ghasemi et al 2014 the porous media method dong and zhan 2009 jacobsen et al 2015 and the mass balance pde method hu et al 2016 in this work we use the relaxation zone method at inlet and outlet boundaries the purpose of the relaxation zone near the channel inlet the wave generation zone is to smoothly extend the dirichlet velocity boundary conditions into the wave tank up to a distance of one wavelength so that the reflected waves coming from the iswec device do not interfere with the left boundary in contrast the relaxation zone near the right boundary the wave damping zone smoothly damps out the waves reaching the domain outlet near the right end the wave damping zone is taken to be two wavelengths wide in our simulations more details on the implementation of the relaxation zone method and level set based nwt can be found in our prior work nangia et al 2019a we impose zero pressure boundary condition at the channel top boundary z max 2 75 d to mitigate the interaction between shed vortices due to the device motion and the top boundary of the channel we use a vorticity damping zone to dissipate the vortex structures reaching the boundary see fig 6 the vorticity damping zone is implemented in terms of a damping force f d in the momentum equation 53 f d g z u in which g z ρ air cos π z 1 4 δ t is the smoothed damping coefficient ρ air is the density of the air phase δ t is the time step size z z z max δ d is the normalized z coordinate and δ d is the vorticity damping zone width which is taken to be six cells wide in our simulations 4 numerical model based on the incompressible navier stokes equations we use a fully eulerian fictitious domain brinkman penalization fd bp method bhalla et al 2020 to perform fully resolved wave structure interaction simulations in the fictitious domain methods the governing equations for the fluid are extended into the region occupied by the solid structure yielding a single set of pdes for the entire domain additional constraints are imposed in the structure domain to ensure that the velocity field within acts like a rigid body this is in contrast to body conforming grid methods in which the fluid equations are solved only on a domain surrounding the immersed body for applications involving moving body fluid structure interaction fsi fictitious domain methods are computationally less expensive than body conforming grid techniques due to the absence of expensive re meshing operations in this section we first describe the continuous governing equations for the fd bp formulation and the interface tracking approach for the multiphase fsi system next we briefly describe the spatiotemporal discretization overall solution methodology and time stepping scheme finally we describe the coupling used to simulate the dynamics of an inertial sea wave energy converter device which involves modeling the effect of a rigid body pitch torque a validation case for vortex induced vibration of a rectangular plate exhibiting galloping motion is presented at the end of this section we refer readers to the references by nangia et al 2019a b bhalla et al 2020 and dafnakis et al 2020 for more details on the cartesian grid fluid solver fd bp formulation and simulating wave energy converters within this framework respectively 4 1 continuous equations of motion let ω r d with d 3 denote a fixed three dimensional region in space the dynamics of a coupled multiphase fluid structure system occupying this domain are governed by the incompressible navier stokes ins equations 54 ρ u x t t ρ u x t u x t p x t μ u x t u x t t ρ g f c x t 55 u x t 0 which describe the momentum and incompressibility of a fluid with velocity u x t and pressure p x t using an eulerian coordinate system x x y z ω note that eqs 54 and 55 are written for the entire fixed region ω which can be further decomposed into two regions occupied by the fluid ω f t ω and the immersed body ω b t ω these regions are non overlapping i e ω ω f t ω b t and f c x t represents a rigidity enforcing constraint force density that vanishes outside ω b t this ensures a rigid body velocity u b x t is attained within the solid region the spatiotemporally varying density and viscosity fields are denoted by ρ x t and μ x t respectively an indicator function χ x t is further used to track the location of the solid body which is nonzero only within ω b t the acceleration due to gravity is directed towards the negative z direction g 0 0 g the immersed structure is treated as a porous region with vanishing permeability κ p 1 yielding the following formula for the brinkman penalized constraint force 56 f c x t χ x t κ p u b x t u x t section 4 4 5 describes the fluid structure coupling algorithm and section 4 4 6 describes the external iswec torque specification which together are used to determine the rigid body velocity u b x t applied to ω b t 4 2 interface tracking all of the cases described in the present work involve a single rigid structure interacting with an air water interface we briefly describe the interface tracking methodology here and refer readers to nangia et al 2019b a for further details on its implementation a scalar level set function σ x t is used to demarcate liquid water and gas air regions ω l ω and ω g ω respectively in the computational domain the air water interface γ t ω l ω g is implicitly defined by the zero contour of σ the same methodology is employed to track the surface of the immersed body s b t v b t using the zero contour of a level set function ψ x t the aforementioned indicator function for the solid domain is computed based on ψ the evolution of these level set fields is governed by linear advection via the local fluid velocity field 57 σ t σ u 0 58 ψ t ψ u 0 making use of the signed distance property the density and viscosity across the entire computational domain can be conveniently expressed as a functions of σ x t and ψ x t 59 ρ x t ρ σ x t ψ x t 60 μ x t μ σ x t ψ x t after every time step both level set functions are reinitialized to maintain signed distance functions to their respective interfaces standard approaches for computing a steady state solution to the hamilton jacobi equation is used to reinitialize σ whereas an analytical distance computation to the immersed body is used to reinitialize ψ 4 3 spatial discretization the continuous equations of motion eqs 54 55 are discretized on a staggered cartesian grid made up of n x n y n z rectangular cells covering the domain ω see fig 7 the mesh spacings in the three spatial directions are denoted by δ x δ y and δ z respectively without loss of generality let the lower left corner of the rectangular domain be the origin 0 0 0 of the coordinate system using this reference point each cell center of the grid has position x i j k i 1 2 δ x j 1 2 δ y k 1 2 δ z for i 0 n x 1 j 0 n y 1 and k 0 n z 1 the physical location of the cell face that is half a grid cell away from x i j k in the x direction is given by x i 1 2 j k i δ x j 1 2 δ y k 1 2 δ z similarly x i j 1 2 k i 1 2 δ x j δ y k 1 2 δ z and x i j k 1 2 i 1 2 δ x j 1 2 δ y k δ z are the physical locations of the cell faces that are half a grid cell away from x i j k in the y and z directions respectively the level set fields pressure degrees of freedom and the material properties are all approximated at cell centers and are denoted σ i j k n σ x i j k t n ψ i j k n ψ x i j k t n p i j k n p x i j k t n ρ i j k n ρ x i j k t n and μ i j k n μ x i j k t n respectively some of these quantities are interpolated onto the required degrees of freedom as needed see nangia et al 2019b for further details here the time at time step n is denoted t n the velocity degrees of freedom are approximated on cell faces with notation u i 1 2 j k n u x i 1 2 j k t n v i j 1 2 k n v x i j 1 2 k t n and w i j k 1 2 n w x i j k 1 2 t n the gravitational body force and constraint force density on the right hand side of the momentum equation 54 are also approximated on the cell faces second order finite differences are used to discretize all spatial derivatives subsequently the discretized version of these differential operators are denoted with h subscripts i e h for more details on the spatial discretization we refer readers to prior studies nangia et al 2019b cai et al 2014 griffith 2009 bhalla et al 2013 4 4 solution methodology next we describe the methodology used to solve the discretized equations of motion at a high level this involves three major steps 1 specifying the material properties ρ x t and μ x t throughout the computational domain 2 calculating the brinkman penalization rigidity constraint force density f c based on the iswec dynamics 3 computing the updated solutions to σ ψ u and p in the present work we briefly review the computations above in the context of iswec devices with a single unlocked rotational degree of freedom for a more general treatment of the fd bp method we refer readers to previous work by bhalla et al 2020 and references therein 4 4 1 density and viscosity specification at

otherwise we use the same number of transition cells n cells 2 for both air water and fluid solid interfaces in our simulations although this is not an inherent limitation of our method we refer readers to nangia et al 2019a for more discussion 4 4 2 time stepping scheme a fixed point iteration time stepping scheme using n cycles 2 cycles per time step is used to evolve quantities from time level t n to time level t n 1 t n δ t a k superscript is used to denote the cycle number of the fixed point iteration at the beginning of each time step the solutions from the previous time step are used to initialize cycle k 0 u n 1 0 u n p n 1 2 0 p n 1 2 σ n 1 0 σ n and ψ n 1 0 ψ n at the initial time n 0 the physical quantities are prescribed via initial condition 4 4 3 level set advection an standard explicit advection scheme is used to evolve the two level set functions 65 σ n 1 k 1 σ n δ t q u n 1 2 k σ n 1 2 k 0 66 ψ n 1 k 1 ψ n δ t q u n 1 2 k ψ n 1 2 k 0 in which q represents an explicit piecewise parabolic method xsppm7 limited approximation to the linear advection terms on cell centers griffith 2009 rider et al 2007 4 4 4 incompressible navier stokes solution the following spatiotemporal discretization of the incompressible navier stokes eqs 54 55 in conservative form is employed 67 ρ n 1 k 1 u n 1 k 1 ρ n u n δ t c n 1 k h p n 1 2 k 1 l μ u n 1 2 k 1 n 1 k 1 g f c n 1 k 1 68 h u n 1 k 1 0 in which the discretized convective derivative c n 1 k and the density approximation ρ n 1 k 1 are computed using a consistent mass momentum transport scheme this is vital to ensure numerical stability for cases involving air water density ratios this scheme is described in detail in previous studies by nangia et al 2019b and bhalla et al 2020 a standard semi implicit approximation to the viscous strain rate l μ u n 1 2 k 1 1 2 l μ u n 1 k 1 l μ u n is employed in which l μ n 1 h μ n 1 h u h u t n 1 the two stage process described by eqs 61 and 62 is used to obtain the newest approximation to viscosity μ n 1 k 1 the flow density field is used to construct the gravitational body force term g ρ flow g which avoids spurious currents due to large density variation near the fluid solid interface nangia et al 2019a 4 4 5 fluid structure coupling next we describe the brinkman penalization term that imposes the rigidity constraint in the solid region and the overall fluid structure coupling scheme in this work we simplify the treatment of the fsi coupling by only considering immersed bodies with a single unlocked rotational degree of freedom dof a more general approach is described in bhalla et al 2020 the brinkman penalization term is treated implicitly and computed as 69 f c n 1 k 1 χ κ p u b n 1 k 1 u n 1 k 1 in which the discretized indicator function χ 1 h body is 1 only inside the body domain and defined using the structure heaviside function h body from eq 64 a permeability value of κ p o 1 0 8 has been shown to be sufficiently small enough to effectively enforce the rigidity constraint gazzola et al 2011 bhalla et al 2020 with x com denoting the position of the center of mass of the body the rigid body velocity u b u r w r x x com can be expressed as a sum of translational u r and rotational w r velocities in this work u r 0 and we simply have 70 u b n 1 k 1 w r n 1 k 1 x x com n 1 k 1 moreover two of the rotational dofs are locked in the present study i e they are constrained to zero hence the expression for w r can be simplified even further 71 w r n 1 k 1 δ n 1 k 1 0 0 in which δ is the rotational velocity of the structure about its pitch axis the rigid body velocity can be computed by integrating newton s second law of motion for the pitch axis rotational velocity 72 i h δ n 1 k 1 δ n δ t m hydro n 1 k m δ n 1 k in which i h is the moment of inertia of the hull m hydro is the net hydrodynamic torque and m δ n 1 k is the projection of the gyroscopic torque about the x axis the net hydrodynamic torque is computed by summing the contributions from pressure and viscous forces acting on the hull and taking the pitch component 73 m hydro i ˆ f x x com n 1 k p n 1 k n f μ f h u n 1 k h u n 1 k t n f δ a f the hydrodynamic traction in the above equation is evaluated on cartesian grid faces near the hull that define a stair step representation of the body on the eulerian mesh bhalla et al 2020 with n f and δ a f representing the unit normal vector and the area of a given cell face respectively the computation of the gyroscopic action m δ is described in the following section 4 4 6 coupling the iswec dynamics the iswec is allowed to freely rotate about its pitch axis and its motion depends on the hydrodynamic and external torques acting on it the external torque m δ generated by the gyroscopic action is unloaded on the hull and opposes the wave induced pitching motion therefore m δ appears with negative sign on the right side of eq 72 the analytical expression for this pitch torque is given by eq 13 while its discretization is written as 74 m δ n 1 k j sin 2 ε n 1 k i cos 2 ε n 1 k δ n 1 k j ϕ ε n 1 k cos ε n 1 k 2 j i δ n 1 k ε n 1 k sin ε n 1 k cos ε n 1 k j ϕ sin ε n 1 k in which the pitch acceleration term δ n 1 k is calculated using a standard finite difference explicit forward euler of the hull s pitch velocity 75 δ n 1 k δ n 1 k δ n δ t k 0 δ n δ n 1 δ t k 0 we set δ n 1 0 δ n ε n 1 0 ε n δ n 1 0 δ n and ε n 1 0 ε n for cycle k 0 the precession acceleration ε is given analytically by eq 15 which in discretized form reads 76 ε n 1 k 1 i k ε n 1 k 1 c ε n 1 k 1 i j δ n 1 k 2 sin ε n 1 k 1 cos ε n 1 k 1 j ϕ δ n 1 k cos ε n 1 k 1 this newest approximation to the precession acceleration ε n 1 k is explicitly calculated using only the prior cycle s values of precession velocity ε n 1 k 1 and angle ε n 1 k 1 new approximations to ε and ε at cycle k are computed using the newmark β method newmark 1959 as follows 77 ε n 1 k ε n δ t 2 ε n ε n 1 k 78 ε n 1 k ε n δ t ε n δ t 2 4 ε n ε n 1 k as described in section 2 the pto stiffness k and damping c parameters in the control torque and the gyroscope s angular velocity ϕ acceleration ϕ 0 and moments of inertia i and j are known a priori and do not represent additional unknowns in the calculation of m δ n 1 k hence the procedure outlined by eqs 74 to 78 enables the calculation of the external pitch torque shown on the right hand side of eq 72 thus coupling the iswec dynamics to the fd bp methodology 4 5 fsi validation to validate our implementation of the method described in this section we simulate the vortex induced vibration of a rectangular plate undergoing galloping motion this single rotational degree of freedom case has been widely used as a benchmark problem for fsi algorithms in prior literature it also mimics the iswec model well which primarily oscillates in the pitch direction the governing equation for the spring mass damper plate model reads as 79 i ϑ ϑ c ϑ ϑ k ϑ ϑ m hydro in which ϑ is the pitch angle of the plate measured from the horizontal axis i ϑ is the pitch moment of inertia about the center of mass c ϑ is the torsional damping constant k ϑ is the torsional spring constant and m hydro is the hydrodynamic moment acting on the plate due to the external fluid flow to compare of our results with prior simulations we consider a plate with a width to thickness ratio of λ l p h p 4 a non dimensional moment of inertia of i ϑ i ϑ ρ s h p 4 400 a non dimensional damping ratio of ζ ϑ c ϑ 2 k ϑ i ϑ 0 25 and a reduced velocity of u u f ϑ h p 40 here u is the free stream velocity and f ϑ k ϑ i ϑ 2 π is the natural frequency of the spring mass damper system the rectangular plate is centered at the origin with an initial non zero pitch of ϑ 1 the computational domain is taken to be ω 32 cm 96 cm 32 cm 32 cm a rectangular domain of size l x l y 128 cm 64 cm five grid levels are used to discretize the domain with the structure embedded on the finest grid level a coarse grid spacing of h coarsest l y 32 is used on the coarsest level the finest level is refined with a refinement ratio of n ref 2 whereas the rest of the finer levels are refined using a refinement ratio of n ref 4 from their next coarser level a uniform inflow velocity u u 1 cm s 0 cm s is imposed on the left boundary x 32 cm whereas zero normal traction and zero tangential velocity boundary conditions are imposed on the right boundary x 96 cm the bottom y 32 cm and top y 32 cm boundaries satisfy zero normal velocity and zero tangential traction boundary conditions the reynolds number of the flow based on the inlet velocity is set to re ρ f u h p μ f 250 a constant time step size of δ t 0 048 h finest is used for the simulation after the initial transients a vortex shedding state is established which results in a periodic galloping of the rectangular plate fig 8 a shows the pitch angle of the plate as a function of time figs 8 b 8 d show three representative snapshots of the fsi dynamics and the vortex shedding pattern fig 8 e shows a typical amr patch distribution in the domain due to the evolving structural and vortical dynamics table 3 compares the maximum pitch angle ϑ max and galloping frequency of the plate f ϑ with values obtained from previous numerical studies an excellent agreement with prior studies is obtained for both these rotational quantities 5 software implementation the fd bp algorithm and the numerical wave tank method described here is implemented within the ibamr library which is an open source c simulation software focused on immersed boundary methods with adaptive mesh refinement the code is publicly hosted at https github com ibamr ibamr ibamr relies on samrai hornung and kohn 2002 for cartesian grid management and the amr framework linear and nonlinear solver support in ibamr is provided by the petsc library balay et al 1997 2015a b all of the example cases in the present work made use of distributed memory parallelism using the message passing interface mpi library simulations were carried out on both the xsede comet cluster at the san diego supercomputer center sdsc 5 5 https www xsede org xsede resources aid international engineering team on wave energy project and the fermi cluster at san diego state university sdsu comet houses 1 944 intel haswell standard compute nodes consisting of intel xeon e5 2680v3 processors with a clock speed of 2 5 ghz and 24 cpu cores per node fermi houses 65 compute nodes with different generations of intel xeon processors between 64 and 128 cores were used for the 2d computations presented here while 128 cores were used for the 3d computations the 2d iswec model using the medium grid resolution described in section 6 1 required approximately 6 129 s to execute 15 000 time steps on comet using 80 cores the 3d iswec model using the coarse grid resolution described in section 7 1 required approximately 82 000 s to execute 10 000 time steps on fermi using 128 cores of intel xeon e5 2697av4 broadwell processors with a clock speed of 2 6 ghz 6 spatial and temporal resolution tests in this section we perform a grid convergence study on the 2d iswec model in a nwt with regular waves using four different spatial resolutions we also conduct a temporal resolution study to determine a time step size δ t that is able to adequately resolve the high frequency wave components of irregular waves although our implementation is capable of adaptive mesh refinement we use static grids for all cases presented in this section as mentioned in section 4 we lock all the translational degrees of freedom of the hull and only consider its pitching motion appendix a compares the rotational dynamics in the presence of heaving motion of the device and justifies the accuracy of the 1 dof model to calculate the main quantities of interest such as power output and conversion efficiency of the device the size of the computational domain is ω 0 10 λ 0 2 75 d with the origin located at the bottom left corner see fig 6 the hull parameters for the 2d model are given in table 2 and the cg of the hull is located at 5 λ d z cg the quiescent water depth is d 0 65 m acceleration due to gravity is g 9 81 m s directed in negative z direction density of water is ρ w 1025 kg m3 density of air is ρ air 1 2 kg m3 viscosity of water μ w 1 0 3 pa s and viscosity of air is μ air 1 8 1 0 5 pa s surface tension effects are neglected for all cases as they do not affect the wave and converter dynamics at the scale of these problems 6 1 grid convergence study to ensure the wave structure interaction dynamics are accurately resolved we conduct a grid convergence study to determine an adequate mesh spacing the dynamics of the iswec hull interacting with regular water waves are simulated on four meshes coarse medium fine and finest each mesh consists of a hierarchy of ℓ grids the computational domain is discretized by a coarsest grid of size n y n z and then locally refined ℓ 1 times by an integer refinement ratio n ref ensuring that the iswec device and air water interface are covered by the finest grid level the grid spacing on the finest level are calculated using the following expressions δ y min δ y 0 n ref ℓ 1 and δ z min δ z 0 n ref ℓ 1 where δ y 0 and δ z 0 are the grid spacings on the coarsest level the time step size δ t is chosen to ensure the maximum courant friedrichs levy cfl number 0 12 for coarse medium and fine grid resolutions and 0 24 for the finest to reduce the computational cost grid resolution the mesh parameters and time step sizes considered here are shown in table 4 regular water waves generated based on the fifth order wave theory presented in section 3 1 enter the left side of the domain and interact with the iswec hull temporal evolution of the hull s pitch angle δ and the gyroscope s precession angle ε are the primary outputs used to evaluate mesh convergence the results and the specification of the wave iswec and gyroscope parameters are shown in fig 9 for a quantitative comparison we calculate the average percentage change in the peak values of δ and ε for two consecutive grid resolutions between the time interval t 10 s to 20 s the obtained average percentage change for δ peaks is 24 18 between coarse and medium grid resolutions 10 42 between medium and fine grid resolutions and 3 4 between fine and finest grid resolutions and for ε peaks these values are 22 15 14 6 and 1 9 respectively fig 10 a shows a close up of the medium resolution grid and the 2d iswec model a minimum of 8 grid cells vertically span the height of the wave indicating that the wave elevation is adequately resolved for the coarse finest grid resolution approximately 4 30 grid cells span the wave height results not shown additionally the number of cells covering the iswec hull length is approximately 30 60 119 and 238 for the coarse medium fine and finest grid resolutions respectively fig 10 b shows well resolved vortical structures produced by the interaction of the iswec device and air water interface on the medium resolution grid from the quantitative and qualitative results shown in figs 9 and 10 we conclude that the medium grid resolution can capture the wsi dynamics with reasonable accuracy table 5 compares the wall clock time required to execute 10 000 time steps of the 2d iswec model for the four grid resolutions the medium grid resolution offers a reasonable compromise between accuracy of the solution and simulation time therefore for the remaining cases studied here we make use of the medium grid resolution 6 2 temporal resolution study next we conduct a temporal resolution study to ensure that wsi dynamics of irregular waves and the iswec device are adequately resolved as described in section 3 2 irregular water waves are modeled as a superposition of n harmonic wave components the energy carried by each wave component is related to its frequency ω i see eq 43 and fig 5 moreover as shown in fig 5 high frequency waves with ω i in the range of 10 rad s to 20 rad s carry considerable amounts of energy hence the time step δ t should be chosen such that these high frequency small wave period t i components are well resolved since they contribute significantly to the power absorbed by the device the dynamics of the iswec hull interacting with irregular water waves are simulated using three different time step sizes δ t 10 3 s 5 1 0 4 s and 2 5 1 0 4 s for all three cases we use a medium resolution grid with refinement parameters given by table 4 temporal evolution of the hull s pitch angle δ and the power absorbed by the pto unit p pto are the primary outputs used to evaluate temporal convergence the results and the specification of the irregular wave iswec and gyroscope parameters are shown in fig 11 it is observed that the hull s pitching motion is relatively insensitive to the chosen time step size δ t since its dynamics are governed mainly by those waves carrying the largest energy we can conclude that the higher frequency wave components are adequately resolved the difference between the three temporal resolutions is more apparent in fig 11 b in which we calculate the average power absorbed by the pto unit p pto over the interval t 10 s and t 20 s for δ t 1 0 3 s 5 1 0 4 s and 2 5 1 0 4 s the power absorbed is p pto 1 7656 w 1 8859 w and 1 9484 w respectively it is seen that smaller time step sizes allow for the resolution of higher frequency wave peaks which directly increases the absorbed power by 6 81 when halving the time step from 1 1 0 3 s to 5 1 0 4 s and an increase by 3 31 when halving the time step from 5 1 0 4 s to 2 5 1 0 4 s based on these results we hereafter use the medium grid spatial resolution and time step sizes of δ t 1 1 0 3 s and δ t 5 1 0 4 s for regular and irregular wave wsi cases respectively 7 results and discussion in this section we investigate several aspects of the dynamics of the inertial sea wave energy converter device first we compare the pto power predictions by the 3d and 2d iswec models under identical wave conditions utilizing the scaling factors presented in table 1 we show that the power predicted by the 3d model can be inferred from the power predicted by the 2d model reasonably well next we study the effect of the maximum hull pitch angle parameter δ 0 and make recommendations on how to select it based on the maximum wave steepness δ s we consider different sea states characterized by regular waves of different heights h and consequently of different steepnesses thereafter a parametric analysis for the 2d iswec model is performed using both regular and irregular water waves to study its dynamics we vary the following parameters to recommend design conditions for the device pto damping coefficient c flywheel speed ϕ moment of inertia j and i and pto stiffness coefficient k afterwards the effect of varying hull length to wavelength ratios is studied finally we simulate a possible device protection strategy during inclement weather conditions and study the resulting dynamics all the 2d simulations are conducted in a nwt with computational domain size ω 0 10 λ 0 2 75 d as shown in fig 6 our prior experience in wave structure interaction modeling in two spatial dimensions suggests that the aforementioned length and height extents of the nwt are adequate to avoid boundary effects dafnakis et al 2020 nangia et al 2019a for 3d cases the computational domain size is same as in 2d with the additional dimension having length 5 w w is the width of 3d model of the hull simulation results in appendix b verify that the tank width of 5 w is large enough to ensure that the iswec dynamics are undisturbed by lateral boundaries as well the origin of the nwt is taken to be the bottom left corner of the domain and shown by the point o in fig 6 the cg of the iswec hull is located at 2 5 w 5 λ d z cg for 3d cases and 5 λ d z cg for the 2d cases the rest of the hull parameters are presented in table 2 the water and air material properties are the same as those described in section 6 7 1 3d and 2d iswec models in this section we investigate the dynamics of the 2d and 3d iswec models interacting with regular and irregular water waves we compare the motion of the hull and the power absorption capabilities of each model the 2d model is simulated on a medium grid resolution and the 3d model on a coarse grid resolution using the refinement parameters specified in table 4 the third dimension is discretized with n x 38 grid cells for 3d cases fig 12 a shows the configuration of the locally refined mesh ℓ 2 along with visualizations of regular and irregular waves for the three dimensional nwt first we consider two different prescribed maximum pitch angles δ 0 5 and 20 for each model regular waves are generated with properties h 0 1 m and t 1 s the values for the gyroscope and pto parameters for this choice of δ 0 are given in table 6 the rated power of the device p r is taken to be the available wave power p wave for calculating the parameters reported in table 6 the hull undergoes pitching motion as the regular waves impact the device as shown in fig 12 b the temporal evolution of the hull pitch angle δ for the 2d and the 3d iswec models are shown in figs 13 a and 13 b from these results it is observed that the dynamics for the 2d case match well with the 3d case after the initial transients the power transferred to the hull from the waves p hull the power generated through the hull gyroscope interaction p gyro and the power absorbed by the pto unit p pto at δ 0 5 δ 0 20 for the 2d and 3d models are shown in figs 13 c and 13 d figs 13 e and 13 f respectively the time averaged powers p pto p gyro and p hull over the time interval t 10 s and t 20 s after the hull s motion achieved a periodic steady state are also shown in figs 13 c 13 f from these results it is seen that the energy transfer pathway eq 23 is numerically verified furthermore the power absorbed by the pto unit for the full scale device can be calculated by multiplying the power absorbed by the 2d model by the froude scaling given in table 1 80 p full scale α 5 2 w p 2d pto unit similarly for the 3d model 81 p full scale α 7 2 p 3d pto unit finally combining the two expressions above yields 82 p 3d w full scale α p 2d 0 4 p 2d pto unit in which w full scale 8 m is the width of the full scale model and α 20 is the length scaling factor for the 2d cases the average power absorbed by the pto unit is p 2d 1 6972 w for δ 0 5 and p 2d 1 1694 w for δ 0 2 0 for the 3d cases the average powers absorbed by the pto unit are 0 5915 w and 0 4178 w for δ 0 5 and δ 0 2 0 respectively which are close to the expected values of 0 6788 w and 0 4677 w predicted by eq 82 note that better agreement between the simulated and expected average powers in 3d can be obtained by increasing the spatial and temporal resolutions nevertheless we are confident that the dynamics are reasonably resolved for the chosen grid spacing and time step size next we perform a similar scaling analysis for 2d and 3d iswec models in irregular wave conditions irregular water waves are generated with properties h s 0 1 m t p 1 s and 50 wave components with frequencies ω i in the range 3 8 rad s to 20 rad s see fig 12 c through empirical testing fifty wave components were found to be sufficient to represent the energy of the jonswap spectrum we consider a maximum pitch angle of δ 0 5 for the device the evolution of δ for the two models are compared in fig 14 a similar to the regular wave case presented above the dynamics of the 2d and 3d models numerically agree and the energy transfer pathway eq 23 is nearly satisfied moreover the average power absorbed by the pto unit for the 2d model is p 2d 1 8859 w yielding an expected 3d power of 0 7543 w according to eq 82 this is close to the power value of 0 5538 w obtained by the 3d simulation based on these results we ultimately conclude that the 2d model is sufficient to accurately simulate iswec dynamics and to predict the power generation absorption capability of the converter hereafter we focus on further investigating dynamics and parameter choices for the 2d model 7 2 selection of prescribed hull pitch angle δ 0 in this section we investigate the relationship between the prescribed hull pitch angle parameter δ 0 the maximum pitch angle actually attained by the hull δ max through wsi and the maximum wave steepness of the incoming waves δ s recall that the maximum wave steepness was calculated in section 3 3 by approximating the fifth order wave as a linear harmonic wave we consider the iswec dynamics on four regular water waves with same time period t 1 s i e λ 1 5456 m but varying wave heights h 0 025 m 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 125 m each having maximum wave steepness δ s 2 9 5 8 11 4 8 and 14 2 5 respectively see eq 52 the prescribed pto and gyroscope system parameters for each sea state and six maximum pitch angle values δ 0 2 5 10 15 20 and δ s are shown in table 6 additionally δ 0 1 and 30 cases are also simulated but the parameter values are not tabulated for brevity the results of this parameter study are shown in fig 15 it is observed that when δ 0 δ s δ max increases linearly with δ 0 fig 15 a illustrating that the hull s maximum oscillation amplitude correlates well with δ 0 when the prescribed δ 0 is greater than δ s it is seen that δ max no longer increases rather it maintains a constant value with respect to δ 0 this indicates that further increasing δ 0 will not lead to larger pitch oscillations i e the δ max attained by the hull is the largest value permitted by the slopes of the wave in figs 15 b and 15 c we show trends in the maximum precession angle attained by the gyroscope ε max and the relative capture width rcw η which measures the device efficiency as a ratio of the average power absorbed by the pto unit to the average wave power per unit crest width see eq 27 maximization of both these quantities is achieved when δ 0 is set close to δ s as the hull achieves the maximum pitch angle physically permitted by the slopes of the wave further increasing δ 0 amounts to reducing j ϕ eq 25 or the hull gyroscope coupling which explains the reduction in both maximum precession and device efficiency hereafter we prescribe δ 0 based on the value maximizing η as we conduct further parametric analyses of the 2d iswec model 7 3 parametric analyses of gyroscope parameters in this section we conduct a parameter sweep around the energy maximizing pto and gyroscope parameters estimated by the theory presented in section 2 3 we test the theory s predictive capability and describe the effect of these parameters on the converter s performance and dynamics in each of the following subsections only a single parameter is varied at a time simulations are conducted using both regular water waves with h 0 1 m and t 1 s and irregular waves with h s 0 1 m t p 1 s and 50 wave components with frequencies ω i in the range 3 8 rad s to 20 rad s these wave conditions serve as device design conditions at its installation site for regular waves the prescribed pitch angle is taken to be δ 0 1 0 and the pto and gyroscope parameters are given in table 6 for irregular waves the prescribed pitch angle δ 0 5 is used the pto and gyroscope parameters remain the same as those used in the temporal resolution study see section 6 2 these particular values of δ 0 were found to maximize the rcw of the converter at design conditions for an example see fig 15 for regular waves with h 0 1 m and t 1 s 7 3 1 pto damping coefficient c we first consider the pto unit damping coefficient c which directly impacts the power absorption capability of the device we prescribe four different values c 0 05 0 3473 1 0 and 2 0 n m s rad to evaluate its impact on iswec dynamics the optimal damping coefficient value of c 0 3473 is predicted by the theory results for the hull interacting with regular waves are shown in fig 16 as expected for smaller damping coefficients the gyroscope is able to attain larger precession angles ε and velocities ε as seen in fig 16 b higher precession velocities yield larger pitch torque m δ values see eq 20 which opposes the motion of the hull and restrict its maximum pitch oscillation this is consistent with the dynamics shown in figs 16 a and 16 c moreover the hull s pitch velocity δ is reduced with decreasing c leading to a smaller in magnitude precession torque m ε acting on the pto shaft see eq 15 our simulations show this behavior as observed in fig 16 d in fig 16 e we compare the time averaged powers p hull p gyro and p pto as a function of varying pto damping coefficient it can be seen that these three powers are in reasonable agreement with each other indicating that the energy transfer pathway eq 23 is approximately satisfied in terms of power generation it is observed that the device achieves peak performance when a pto damping coefficient c 0 2 is prescribed which is close to the theoretically estimated c value of 0 3473 the percentage difference in powers is approximately 8 between these two c values the reason for an optimum value of c is as follows as the damping coefficient increases the precession velocity decreases the power absorbed by the pto unit is the product of c and ε 2 eq 11 and therefore these competing factors must be balanced in order to achieve maximum power generation finally in fig 16 f we show the evolution of the yaw torque m ϕ acting on the hull for c 0 3473 noting that its magnitude is approximately one fifth of the pitch torque m δ although this is not insignificant we do not consider the effect of m ϕ for the 3d iswec model see section 2 1 since its contribution will be canceled out 1 by using an even number of gyroscopic units if each flywheel pair spins with equal and opposite velocities raffero 2014 and 2 partially by the mooring system discounting m ϕ during the iswec design phase would misalign the converter with respect to the main wave direction which will reduce its performance it is also interesting to note that the yaw torque in the gyroscopic frame of reference m z 1 is at least two orders of magnitude lower than the yaw torque in the inertial reference frame as evidenced by the inset of fig 16 f similar dynamics are observed when the iswec model is simulated in irregular wave conditions for four different values c 0 05 0 1724 1 0 and 2 0 n m s rad the results are presented in appendix c 1 the optimal damping coefficient value of c 0 1724 is obtained from the theory the results are compared in fig c 26 the figure shows that the device achieves peak performance at a c value of 0 2 which is quite close to the theoretically predicted optimum value of c 0 1724 the percentage difference in powers is less than 2 between these two c values the response of the hull and gyroscope to irregular waves can be seen in figs 26 a and 26 b respectively the pitch torque and the precession torque are shown in figs 26 c and 26 d respectively from fig 26 e it is verified that the energy transfer pathway given by eq 23 is satisfied we note that the device efficiency is higher in irregular wave conditions as compared to regular wave conditions this can be seen by comparing the maximum value of relative capture width for h 0 1 m in figs 15 c and 26 f η max 24 36 vs η max 37 61 respectively the power carried by irregular waves is approximately half that of regular waves when they have the same significant height and time period therefore for the prescribed device dimensions the converter is more efficient in less energetic wave conditions 7 3 2 flywheel speed ϕ next we conduct a parameter sweep of the flywheel speed ϕ and investigate its effects on the iswec dynamics the speed of the flywheel affects not only the amount of angular momentum j ϕ generated in the gyroscope but also the magnitude of the gyroscopic torques produced as seen in eqs 15 and 20 we consider four different flywheel speeds ϕ 100 rpm 1000 rpm 4000 rpm and 8000 rpm with δ 0 10 and the remaining gyroscope parameter are prescribed based on table 6 recall that these values were obtained for ϕ 4000 rpm in table 6 the results for a hull interacting with regular waves are shown in fig 17 it is seen that the maximum pitch angle decreases with increasing ϕ fig 17 a while a non monotonic relationship is seen between the maximum precession angle and ϕ fig 17 b time averaged powers are shown in fig 17 c which again shows that eq 23 is approximately satisfied power absorption is maximized at flywheel speed of ϕ 4500 rpm which can be physically explained as follows as j ϕ increases the gyroscopic system is able to generate significant precession torque which increases the absorption capacity of the pto unit however this increased angular momentum also increases the pitch torque opposing the hull thereby limiting its pitching motion and reducing the power absorbed from the waves these two competing factors leads to an optimum value of ϕ similar dynamics are obtained when the iswec interacts with irregular waves for varying values of ϕ the results are shown in appendix c 2 the comparison of pitch angle for various ϕ values is shown in fig 27 a and of precession angle is shown in fig 27 b eq 23 is again satisfied as seen from the time averaged powers in fig 27 c in this case the power maximizing flywheel speed is ϕ 3500 rpm 7 3 3 flywheel moment of inertia j and i the angular momentum j ϕ generated in the gyroscope can also be modified by varying the flywheel size via its moment of inertia components j and i first we consider three different values j 0 0005 kg m 2 0 0058 kg m 2 and 0 5 kg m 2 which correspond to light medium and heavy weight gyroscopes respectively the j 0 0058 value is obtained from theoretical estimates based on the prescribed δ 0 and ε 0 values a value of i 0 94 j is set for each case and the remaining gyroscope parameters are prescribed based on table 6 the results for a hull interacting with regular waves are shown in fig 18 it is seen that the light gyroscope produces insignificant precession angles and torques due to the lack of angular momentum generated by the flywheel moreover the heavy gyroscope produces even smaller m ε torque as it slowly drifts around the pto axis the proportional component of the control torque k ε is not strong enough to return the gyroscope to its mean position of ε 0 additionally the light heavy weight gyroscope produces small large pitch torques m δ opposing the hull which explains the large small pitch amplitudes exhibited by the device finally it is seen that the medium weight gyroscope with j 0 0058 kg m 2 calculated from the procedure described in section 2 3 produces the largest precession amplitudes ε and velocities ε leading to high power absorption by the pto unit we also study the effect of varying i while keeping j 0 0058 kg m 2 fixed we consider four different values i 0 5 j i 0 75 j i 0 94 j and i 1 0 j and the results for a device interacting with regular waves are shown in fig 19 it is seen that the dynamics of the hull and gyroscope and the system powers are not significantly affected by the choice of i similarly iswec dynamics with irregular waves are studied for three different values of j results for varying j values are compared in fig c 28 in appendix c 3 which are qualitatively similar to the results obtained with regular waves the effect of varying i with respect to j is also simulated and the results are shown in fig c 29 in appendix c 3 it is seen that the hull pitch and the gyroscope precession angles are relatively insensitive to variations in i it is observed that the powers are relatively constant across different i values under irregular wave conditions as well 7 3 4 pto stiffness coefficient k finally we study the effect of varying the pto stiffness coefficient k on the dynamics of the iswec device this term appears as a restoring torque k ε in the precession angle eq 16 and acts to drive the gyroscope s oscillation about its mean position ε 0 the oscillation frequency is directly influenced by k and can be chosen to ensure a resonant condition is attained between the gyroscope and the incoming waves thus maximizing the power absorbed by the system we consider four different values of k 0 0 n m rad 0 2171 n m rad 1 0 n m rad and 5 0 n m rad with the remaining gyroscope parameter chosen according to table 6 the k 0 2171 value is obtained from theoretical considerations provided in section 2 3 the results for a hull interacting with regular waves are shown in fig 20 as k increases the maximum precession angle ε and velocity ε decreases leading to decreased power absorption by the device the increased pto stiffness value tends to keep the gyroscope close to its zero mean position which reduces the hull gyroscope coupling this can be observed from the lowered values of m δ torques in fig 20 c as a consequence the hull pitching motion increases as seen in fig 20 a the k 0 case warrants additional discussion when the pto stiffness is zero the gyroscope attains a larger maximum precession amplitude and generates more power than the k 0 cases over the time period t 10 s and t 20 s however fig 21 shows the long term dynamics for k 0 it is seen that the gyroscope is unable to sustain its precession oscillation as it eventually falls to one side ε 9 0 and remains there at this configuration the gyroscope yaw axis and the hull pitch axis are aligned and the precession effect is lost as these gyroscopic oscillations vanish the torques tend towards zero the hull exhibits unrestrained pitch oscillation and no power is generated next we simulate iswec dynamics with irregular waves using four different values of k 0 n m rad 0 2138 n m rad 1 0 n m rad and 5 0 n m rad the results are compared in fig c 30 in appendix c 4 and are qualitatively similar to the those obtained with regular waves similar behavior of the iswec with k 0 is observed the gyroscope is unable to oscillate and falls to one side ε 9 0 and produces vanishing precession effects however with irregular waves the precession effects are lost much sooner compared to the regular waves case 7 4 hull length to wavelength l λ variation in this section we study the effect of hull length to wavelength ratio l λ on the iswec dynamics we select three ratios l λ 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 for this analysis the length of the hull is kept constant at l 0 7665 m and the wavelength of the regular water waves is varied the pto and gyroscope parameters used in the three simulations are presented in table 7 results consist of temporal evolution of the hull pitch and gyroscope precession angles in figs 22 a and 22 b respectively it is observed that the hull pitch is maximum when λ 3 l λ 2 as discussed in section 2 4 as a consequence the gyroscope precesses more and the conversion efficiency of the device increases see fig 22 c 7 5 device protection during inclement weather conditions the iswec hull houses costly electro mechanical components that need to be protected during harsh stormy weather conditions during inclement weather the hull and gyroscope dynamics can be chaotic which may damage the system components to protect the housed components the gyroscope needs to be turned off this can be done by reducing the flywheel speed to zero using remote human machine interfaces the combined hull gyroscope system then behaves like a single floating entity in this section we simulate the dynamics of the iswec device as the flywheel speed is reduced to zero amidst steady operation we simulate this scenario with regular water waves of h 0 1 m and t 1 s to reduce the flywheel speed from 4000 rpm to 0 rpm we use the following relation 83 ϕ t 4000 1 f t 2 in which f t is a function that smoothly transitions from 1 to 1 in the transition time interval δ t the function f is given by 84 f tanh 2 π t t half δ t in which t half t start δ t 2 in our simulation we set t start 15 s and δ t 5 s fig 23 e shows the smooth transition of the flywheel speed towards zero in 5 s when the gyroscope is turned off the precession effects cease and the system attains a mean zero position thus protecting the internal hardware and device components this is seen in figs 23 b 23 c and 23 d which show that ε m δ and m ε are reduced to zero respectively as the gyroscopic effects vanish the hull is observed to be oscillating with greater pitch amplitude fig 23 a from the device protection standpoint this poses no critical issue as the external hull is specifically designed to weather sea storms 8 conclusions in this study we systematically investigated the wave structure interaction dynamics of the inertial sea wave energy converter iswec technology our computational model is based on the incompressible navier stokes equations and employs the fictitious domain brinkman penalization fd bp approach to handle the fluid structure coupling the dynamics of the iswec hull and gyroscope system were coupled to this cfd solver to enable fully resolved 1 dof simulations of the device to emulate realistic operating conditions of the device a numerical wave tank was used to generate both regular waves based on fifth order stokes theory and irregular waves based on the jonswap spectrum we performed froude scaling analysis of the full scale iswec model to determine the required parameters for our 1 20 scaled down two and three dimensional simulations our numerical investigation demonstrated that the 2d model was sufficient to accurately simulate the hull s pitching motion and to predict the power generation absorption capability of the converter we showed that setting the prescribed hull pitch angle parameter δ 0 close to the maximum wave steepness will maximize the device s relative capture width i e power generation efficiency a comprehensive parameter sweep demonstrated that the device achieves peak performance when the gyroscope specifications are chosen based on the reactive control theory described in section 2 3 it was also shown that a proportional control of the pto control torque is required to generate continuous precession effects of the gyroscope without which the gyroscope tends to align with the hull pitch axis under this scenario the device does not generate any power we also showed that although the yaw torque in the gyroscope reference frame is small it is of the same order of magnitude as the pitch torque induced on the hull in an inertial reference frame therefore the yaw torque on the hull should be considered in the design phase of these devices to avoid any misalignment of the converter from the main wave direction our simulations also verify that the hull length to wavelength ratio should be between one half and one third to achieve high conversion efficiency throughout our parameter study we numerically verify the theoretical power transfer pathway between the water waves and the hull the hull and the gyroscope and the gyroscope to the pto unit for both regular and irregular wave environments although the power transfer is derived for iswec devices in this work an analogous relationship could be derived for heaving or surging point absorbers finally we investigated the dynamics of the iswec system as the flywheel speed is reduced to zero to emulate device protection during inclement weather conditions by making use of high performance computing our work demonstrates that it is feasible to use fully resolved simulations to interrogate the device physics and dynamics of wave energy converters they can also be used as a design tool to explore the parametric space for further optimization of such devices credit authorship contribution statement kaustubh khedkar data generation

1931368 nsf xsede and sdsu fermi compute resources are particularly acknowledged appendix a two degrees of freedom iswec model we compare the hull and gyroscope dynamics obtained using two degrees of freedom pitch and heave and one degree of freedom pitch only iswec models the same case from fig 24 a is simulated using the two models on a medium grid resolution figs 24 a and 24 b show the comparison of hull pitch angle δ and gyroscope precession angle ε respectively as observed in fig a 24 including an additional heave degree of freedom only marginally affects the rotational motion of the hull and gyroscope and consequently the power output of the device fig 24 c shows the heave dynamics of the hull about its mean z location the heave amplitude is approximately one tenth of the hull height for the prescribed wave characteristics although the heave motion is not negligible in this case it nonetheless does not significantly affect the rotational dynamics in contrast to heave the surge degree of freedom can affect the relative phase between the wave excitation forces and the body motion which can lead to a different set of optimal parameters of the device than those found without considering the surge motion however the surge motion of the iswec device is assumed to be negligible because of the motion constraints imposed by the mooring system finally fig 24 d shows that the power transfer equation is satisfied even for the 2 dof iswec model appendix b effect of domain width in 3d simulations here we simulate the iswec dynamics by taking three different tank widths to select a sufficiently wide tank that reduces the interference caused by the lateral walls on the device dynamics the 3d regular wave case with a prescribed pitch angle of δ 0 5 as discussed in section 7 1 is considered the selected widths for the wave tank are 3 w 5 w and 7 w in which w is the hull width of the 3d iswec model among the considered widths the 7 w tank width case has the iswec device located farthest away from the lateral walls and is therefore expected to be least affected from the wall interference effects the temporal evolution of hull pitch angle is compared for three wave tank widths and the results are shown in fig b 25 from the plots it is observed that there is not much difference in the pitch dynamics of the device however taking a closer look at the inset plot reveals that the results obtained using a tank width of 5 w is closer to those obtained using a width of 7 w hence we take the tank width to be 5 w in our 3d simulations which has a lower computational cost compared to the 7 w case appendix c irregular wave results c 1 pto damping coefficient c see fig c 26 c 2 flywheel speed ϕ see fig c 27 c 3 flywheel moment of inertia j and i see

20822,extreme waves usually emerge from intensive wave groups detection of wave groups from random waves may be a key step in predicting the occurrence of extreme events a new method to discriminate wave groups in random waves based on the wavelet transform is proposed and investigated the approach can identify wave groups effectively and efficiently to test the methods propagation of random wave trains over constant spanwise submerged obstacles with a wide range of bottom slopes varying from 1 3 to 1 80 are simulated using a fully nonlinear wave model extreme waves satisfying the definition of freak waves are identified close to the top of the obstacles steeper slopes increase the probability of freak waves moreover it is found that the non dimensionalized maximum of the scaled non uniformity wavelet power of wave groups can be used as a precursor to predict the occurrence of extreme waves over sloping bottoms the indicator correlates linearly with the maximum heights of wave groups using the simulated data formulae to predict freak waves for various wave steepness over sloping bottoms are constructed after testing a large number of cases it is found that the formulae predict most extreme waves successfully and effectively keywords freak waves wave groups non hydrostatic wave model wavelet power prediction 1 introduction freak or rogue waves have caused considerable damages to marine structures and human life not only in open seas but also in coastal regions cherneva et al 2005 haver 2004 kharif et al 2009 liu 2007 waseda 2010 a common definition of freak waves is η c 1 25h s or h 2h s dysthe et al 2008 where h s is the significant wave height defined as h s 4σ where σ is the standard deviation of surface elevation h is the wave height and η c is the crest elevation relative to the mean water level it has now been widely accepted that these extreme events occur more frequently than linear gaussian statistics would suggest mori et al 2007 nazarenko and lukaschuk 2016 onorato et al 2013 therefore to decrease the underlying catastrophic impact of freak waves it is crucial to provide an effective approach to predict these large amplitude waves according to statistical analysis the probability of freak wave occurrence can be obtained from the probability distribution of wave heights or crests for a given sea state cherneva et al 2009 janssen 2003 ying and kaplan 2012 but the specific information on when and where freak waves will occur is still unknown recently many studies have sought a deterministic prediction of extreme waves on shorter time scales and probabilistic quantification of chaotic systems cousins and sapsis 2014 dematteis et al 2018 farazmand and sapsis 2016 mohamad et al 2016 vlachas et al 2018 wan and sapsis 2017 wan et al 2018 birkholz et al 2015 observed that there may be some warnings before the appearance of rogue waves but the predictability was limited and may only provide a last second warning prior to the formation of an extreme wave a general method to predict sea surfaces is a phase resolved wave reconstruction via linear hilmer and thornhill 2014 2015 kusters et al 2016 naaijen and huijsmans 2010 naaijen et al 2009 2018 ruban 2016 van groesen and wijaya 2017 wijaya et al 2015 or nonlinear models blondel couprie et al 2013 blondel et al 2010 ducrozet et al 2016 köllisch et al 2018 qi et al 2018 linear prediction has the advantage of computational efficiency but it neglects wave wave interactions and it is likely not applicable to strongly nonlinear waves nonlinear wave reconstruction is able to provide a more accurate forecast however it is computationally demanding furthermore all of these methods are sensitive to measurement and computation errors by investigating single waves in random time series of sea surface elevations islas and schober 2005 slunyaev 2018 predicted the occurrence and strength of rogue waves using the inverse scattering theory of the nonlinear schrödinger nls equation but the technique is limited to homoclinic solutions of the nls equation mori et al 2002 found that freak waves could be discriminated easily from the wavelet spectrum if a strong energy density is visible in the spectrum akhmediev et al 2011 suggested that triangular spectra may provide useful indicators to predict freak waves furthermore latifah and groesen 2012 predicted the position and time of a rogue wave by minimizing the variance of the total wave phase bayındır 2016 showed that a specific v shaped high energy area of the wavelet spectra can be used as a precursor to predict rogue waves to further consider the effect of nonlinearity alam 2014 gave a predictability time scale for rogue waves through the high order spectral hos model dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 but it mainly examined wave fields with broad spectra guo and alam 2017 demonstrated that the spatial distribution of energy flux can predict extreme waves in deep water although the energy flux will vary under different time windows simanesew et al 2017 predicted waves in weakly nonlinear directional seas and showed that for long crested waves with steepness k c a c 0 10 where a c is the characteristic amplitude and k c is the characteristic wavenumber according to the modified nonlinear schrödinger equation the reliable prediction zone is about 40 characteristic wavelengths for short crested waves the accuracy of prediction is strongly reduced with increasing directional spread klein et al 2020 compared prediction results for unidirectional irregular waves by hos nls and the linear wave model they found that nonlinear dispersion effects play a significant role for moderate to high wave steepness more recently machine learning techniques were applied in phase resolved wave prediction duan et al 2020 guth and sapsis 2019 law et al 2020 and may play a key role in forecasting freak waves dudley et al 2019 to date many studies have indicated that freak waves evolve from intense wave groups in which wave energy is concentrated and include several successive large waves in random wave trains trulsen 2001 numerically reconstructed the new year wave and found that the large wave did not suddenly appear but gradually evolved from a short but steep wave group slunyaev 2006 and slunyaev et al 2005 demonstrated that freak waves which occurred in the north sea also emerged from intense wave groups likewise in coastal regions sergeeva et al 2014 showed that rogue waves often belong to intense wave groups therefore it is important to predict freak waves based on the characteristics of wave groups cousins and sapsis 2016 proposed a reduced order precursor based on a modified nls mnls equation for predicting unidirectional freak waves in deep water it is claimed that this method can forecast 12 39 wave periods before the occurrence of an extreme wave by knowledge of the amplitudes and length scales of wave groups in random sea states with a well defined spectrum farazmand and sapsis 2017 extended this method to horizontal two dimensional water waves recently the unidirectional method was examined in physical experiments cousins et al 2019 they showed that the method erred in predicting a few rogue waves during a temporal window of o 10t 0 with different frequency bandwidths where t 0 is the dominant wave period comparing with other methods to distinguish wave groups such as those based on upper envelopes huang et al 1999 list 1991 sanina et al 2016 and sequences of wave heights larger than a given threshold value i e runs battjes and van vledder 1985 ewing 1973 goda 1970 kimura 1980 wavelet spectra indicate wave groups more readily dong et al 2008 li et al 2015 liu 2000 liu and hawley 2002 and effectively decrease the sensitivity caused by the artificial definition therefore to identify whole wave groups accurately a new method based on the wavelet transform wt torrence and compo 1998 is proposed in the present study as a wave field propagates on variable bathymetry a number of studies sergeeva et al 2011 trulsen et al 2012 zeng and trulsen 2012 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 have demonstrated that bottom non uniformity can lead to an increased likelihood of freak waves trulsen et al 2012 conducted a series of experiments and found that the probability of freak waves exhibits a local maximum near the shallower side of a barred profile also it has a local maximum of kurtosis and skewness there janssen and herbers 2009 sergeeva et al 2011 and gramstad et al 2013 found that kurtosis and skewness reach a local maximum in the vicinity of the shallower side by using a frequency angular spectrum model a one dimensional korteweg de vries kdv and a boussinesq model respectively zeng and trulsen 2012 used a depth modified nonlinear schrödinger nls equation and demonstrated that a change of depth can induce a spatially non uniform distribution of kurtosis on the seaward crest of bars but they did not observe the enhanced probability of extreme waves due to the slowly varying depth viotti and dias 2014 observed strongly non gaussian statistics in depth transition regions using fully nonlinear potential flow equations and suggested that freak waves can be formed due to the out of equilibrium dynamics considering directional sea states ducrozet and gouin 2017 demonstrated that the probability of freak waves is reduced compared to the unidirectional varying depth bathymetry using the high order spectral hos model zhang et al 2019 showed that the second order nonlinear effects could be responsible for the formation of freak waves over a submerged bar this by adopting the boussinesq type model recently trulsen et al 2020 provided experimental evidence that the occurrence of extreme waves over a shoal depends on the depth of the shoal when the shoal is shallower than a threshold depth kh 1 3 the skewness and the kurtosis are enhanced significantly over the shallower part of the shoal additionally they investigated statistical moments of the horizontal fluid velocity and found that a local maximum skewness of horizontal velocity occurred at the same location as those for the surface elevations however a local maximum kurtosis of the horizontal velocity was seen on the downward slope of the lee side of the shoal although the above studies have given valuable insight on statistics of wavefields over variable depth the prediction of freak waves over unidirectional sloped bottoms has not been studied in detail in the present study a new method to identify wave groups based on the wavelet transform wt torrence and compo 1998 is proposed firstly to detect wave groups from random wave trains then random wave trains over unidirectional submerged bars with a wide range of bottom slope varying from 1 3 to 1 80 are simulated using a fully non hydrostatic model dong et al 2019 and the statistical properties skewness kurtosis freak wave probability over different sloping bottoms are analyzed furthermore a new precursor is constructed to predict the occurrence of extreme waves over sloping bottoms the remainder of this paper is as follows in section 2 a new method of determining isolated wave groups is proposed section 3 presents a brief introduction of the non hydrostatic water wave numerical model in section 4 probabilities and statistical characteristics of freak waves over different slopes are investigated section 5 proposes a precursor of freak waves over varying bathymetry and then evaluates it considering various cases lastly conclusions are presented in section 6 2 wave groups detection to efficiently and accurately detect wave groups a new method of ascertaining wave groups based on the wavelet transform wt is proposed to verify the robustness and applicability of the approach detection of wave groups from various series with well resolved double gaussian shaped groups and random waves with different spectra are assessed by the method 2 1 basic definitions of the wavelet transform the continuous wavelet transform of a time series x t is defined as follows daubechies 1992 dong et al 2008 torrence and compo 1998 1 w t τ s 1 s x t ψ t τ s d t where the denotes the complex conjugate s is a scale parameter t is time and τ is the localized time parameter by varying the wavelet scale s or frequency and translating along the localized time τ a figure showing the amplitude of any features versus the scale and how this amplitude varies with time can be constructed ψ is the so called mother wavelet generally the most widely used mother wavelet is the complex morlet wavelet dong et al 2008 huang 2004 liu 2000 massel 2001 given by 2 ψ 0 t π 1 4 exp t 2 2 exp i ω 0 t where ω 0 is the peak frequency of the wavelet taken here to be 6 0 farge 1992 kijewski and kareem 2003 to apply the wt to a given time series s and τ need to be discretized in general the scales are expressed as fractional powers of 2 dong et al 2008 massel 2001 torrence and compo 1998 3 s j s 0 2 j δ j 0 1 2 j 4 j 1 δ log 2 n δ t s 0 where s 0 is the smallest resolvable scale j determines the largest scale δ is the scale factor n is the total number of samples in the time series and δt is the sample time interval the value of s 0 should be chosen to satisfy the smallest equivalent fourier period the reciprocal of the nyquist frequency approximately 2δt a smaller δ is able to provide more adequate sampling in the scale s for the morlet wavelet the largest permitted value of δ is about 0 5 the relationship between s and cyclic frequency f is as follows torrence and compo 1998 5 f ω 0 ω 0 2 2 4 π s 2 2 detecting wave groups based on the wavelet spectrum wave groups can be identified according to their wavelet spectrum liu 2000 liu and hawley 2002 at the start and end of a wave group the total wavelet power is relatively small while the energy density at each discretized scale is relatively uniform however the distribution of the energy density inside a wave group is usually non uniform and the wavelet power over different scales varies significantly consequently the scale non uniformity wavelet power is defined here to identify the wave groups 6 w τ max w t τ s 2 w τ where w τ is defined as 7 w τ 1 j 0 w t τ s 2 d s where j is the number of scales the scale non uniformity wavelet power is a time series of the difference between the local maximum wavelet power and the scaled averaged wavelet power w τ it reflects the degree of energy variance over the scale domain at the front and rear of a wave group the value of the maximum wavelet power is close to the scaled averaged wavelet power w τ on the other hand the value of w τ reaches a local minimum between therefore two ends of wave groups can be identified based on the location of adjacent local minimums it should be noted that for random wave series there are small oscillations in the scale non uniformity wavelet power between large wave groups to separate wave groups successfully these small oscillations should be neglected and the corresponding time series are merged into adjacent rear wave groups small oscillations may be detected if the elevation difference between the crest and the adjacent preceding trough δw is smaller than a prescribed criterion an example of the scale non uniformity wavelet power w τ based on the morlet wavelet the differences between the crests and the preceding troughs δw and the wavelet spectra of a random wave train is shown in fig 1 the random wave train is generated based on the jonswap spectrum with peak enhancement factors of γ 7 0 peak period t p 7 s and significant wave height h s 1 6 m at t 0 s value of w τ reaches the first local minimum then it increase to a local maximum and decrease until at t 31 s that is at t 31 s w τ occurs the second local minimum therefore the first wave group is divided from t 0 s to t 31 s in analogy other wave groups can be discriminated it should be noted that some discriminated wave groups based on the location of adjacent local minimums are small and unreasonable for example at around t 169 s the scale non uniformity wavelet power reaches a trough the adjacent crest is at around t 195 s a wave group may be considered between these two ends however the wave group is quite small and should be only considered as a small oscillation likewise the differences between the trough and the adjacent crest at t 232 256 s t 410 5 401 6 s t 441 451 s are also small and thus should not be considered as wave groups therefore a rational criterion based on the difference between a crest and the adjacent preceding trough δw is necessary to accurately divide wave groups to verify the robustness of this method to discriminate wave groups the sensitivity of different mother wavelets is tested the scale non uniformity wavelet power w τ based on different mother wavelets morlet mother wavelet paul mother wavelet mexican hat mother wavelet torrence and compo 1998 for the time series in fig 1 are shown in fig 2 the shapes of w τ are similar using different mother wavelets compared to the morlet wavelet more small oscillations in w τ based on the paul mother wavelet is found therefore for the paul wavelet two ends of the wave groups can still be identified based on the location of adjacent local minimums but the criterion to detect small oscillations should be reconfirmed w τ based on the mexican hat wavelet are not smooth therefore smoothing may be needed to effectively implement w τ based on the mexican hat wavelet hence for different mother wavelets two ends of wave groups can still be identified based on the location of adjacent local minimums of w τ but the criterion to detect small oscillations may be different therefore in the following small oscillations are detected based on the morlet wavelet after assessing more than 1200 random wave cases with different frequency bandwidths and significant wave heights a criterion is recommended to detect and remove from consideration small oscillations based on the morlet wavelet the difference between the crest and the adjacent preceding trough of the scale non uniformity wavelet power δw is less than or equal to 1 3 of the average value of all of these differences this criterion provides the following expression 8 δ w τ 1 3 n 0 i 1 n 0 w c i τ w t i τ where w c i and w t i are the ith crest and the preceding trough of the scale non uniformity wavelet power respectively n 0 is the total number of crests of the scale non uniformity wavelet power to non dimensionalized w τ the non dimensional scale non uniformity wavelet power nsnwp w τ is divided by the square of the significant wave height 9 w τ w τ h s 2 where h s is the significant wave height for random waves likewise the criterion 8 can be non dimensionalized as follows 10 δ w τ 1 3 n 0 i 1 n 0 w c i τ w t i τ here w c i and w t i are the ith crest and the preceding trough value of the nsnwp respectively to address the robustness and wide applicability of the threshold 1 3 used in the above criterion different thresholds ranging from 1 6 to 1 2 are investigated random wave trains are generated based on the jonswap spectrum with three different peak enhancement factors γ 1 0 3 3 and 7 0 which have corresponding spectra varying from broad to narrow in deep water a wave peak period of t p 7 0 s is used and the significant wave heights h s are chosen to be 0 6 m 1 6 m 2 6 m and 3 6 m respectively thus the wave steepness ϵ k p h s 2 is varied from 0 02 to 0 14 where k p is the peak wave number for each wave case 100 realizations with random phases are generated based on the longuet higgins model longuet higgins 1952 and the total time is 800 s for each realization therefore a total of 1200 random wave trains with more than 130 000 individual waves are used to discriminate the wave groups which is sufficient to give reliable results different thresholds may have an effect on the durations of wave groups which are defined as the difference between the rear and front ends of wave groups the exceedance probability distributions of group durations t t p for different wave cases are obtained fig 3 shows the exceedance probability distributions of group durations t t p for a significant wave height h s of 1 6 m with different frequency bandwidths generally for the same peak enhancement factors γ with the values of threshold increasing wave group durations are longer this is mainly due to some small oscillations in the nsnwp that may be neglected and then the corresponding time series are included in adjacent rear wave groups for the same threshold group durations increase with a narrowing spectrum if the threshold is too large it is more sensitive to the oscillations hence most of these oscillations will be ignored and each wave group s duration will be longer on the other hand if the threshold is too small some small oscillations will be identified as independent wave groups and the probability of small duration wave groups will be increased fig 3 shows that the exceedance probability distributions of group durations for different frequency bandwidths are similar therefore to test the sensitivity of these thresholds to the durations of wave groups wave group durations corresponding to exceedance probabilities of 5 and 95 relative maximum and the minimum group durations are chosen thus most group durations are included using different thresholds fig 4 shows the comparisons of wave group durations corresponding to exceedance probabilities of 5 and 95 for different significant wave heights for the random wave trains with the same steepness averages and mean square errors of wave group durations are shown in each subfigure at a threshold of 1 3 the standard mean errors for different frequency bandwidths are minimum meanwhile for different significant wave heights the group durations corresponding to the exceedance probabilities 5 and 95 are all in the vicinity of 8t p and 17t p therefore among the values explored 1 3 is a more stable threshold to discriminate wave groups based on the morlet wavelet in the following several different scenarios are illustrated to demonstrate the utility of this method 2 2 1 double gaussian shaped wave groups to verify the applicability of the method trains with gaussian shaped wave groups are examined by comparing two shapes one of which is stretched in time a wave series of two gaussian shape wave groups with different frequencies is defined as 11 η t a 1 a g b g e t t f w 1 2 2 σ 1 2 a 2 b g e t t f w 2 2 2 σ 2 2 where a 1 0 5h 0cos ω 1 t a 2 0 5h 0cos ω 2 t h 0 0 03 m ω 1 7 85 rad s ω 2 4 18 rad s t fw1 6 46 s t fw2 18 81 s σ 1 n t p 1 2 n 2 t p1 0 8 s σ 2 n t p 2 2 t p2 1 5 s ag 0 05 and bg 0 95 the nsnwp w δw and the delineated two gaussian shaped wave groups are shown in fig 5 the differences between the first crest at t 6 46 s and the preceding trough at around t 11 2 s the second crest at t 18 81 s and the preceding trough at around t 28 s are both larger than the criterion described by eq 10 hence time intervals from the start of time series to t 11 s and t 11 s to t 28 s are determined to be the two wave groups therefore the two different gaussian shaped wave groups are also well divided by the method further demonstrating its robustness 2 2 2 random waves as mentioned above to demonstrate the robustness and wide applicability of the method groups in random waves with wide frequency bandwidths are determined using the above method wave groupiness is not obvious according to the time series in broadband spectra however the contour patches of the wavelet spectrum can clearly indicate wave groupings liu 1994 liu and hawley 2002 random wave trains are generated based on the jonswap spectrum with peak enhancement factors of γ 1 0 the peak period t p 7 s and a significant wave height h s 1 6 m is used which is similar to the above surface elevation case in fig 1 the nsnwp w the differences between the crests and the preceding troughs δw and the corresponding wavelet spectrum and divided wave group are shown in fig 6 small oscillations in fig 6 at t 108 120 s t 172 182 s t 230 263 s t 464 497 s 497 533 s and t 611 634 s are excluded by comparing the magnitude of δw and the threshold calculated by eq 10 the separated wave groups fig 6 d are again consistent with those presented by the wavelet spectrum fig 6 a demonstrating that the method seemingly discriminates wave groups effectively not only in narrow spectra but also for wide spectra to demonstrate applicability of the method to discriminate wave groups based on bi modal spectra following seyffert et al 2016 the ochi 6 parameter spectrum ochi 2005 is chosen parameter values for the bi modal spectrum used are h s1 6 m t modal1 16 s λ 1 4 and h s2 5 295 m t modal2 8 s λ 2 3 the nsnwp w is non dimensionalized by the square of the significant wave height h s defined as h s 1 2 h s 2 2 the differences between the crests and the preceding troughs δw and the corresponding wavelet spectrum and divided wave group are shown in fig 7 the separated wave groups fig 7 d are again reasonably consistent with those presented by the wavelet spectrum fig 7 a demonstrating that the method also discriminates wave groups effectively for bi modal spectra finally to demonstrate further the ability of this method to identify wave groups in physical oceanographic records wave buoy records from the coastal data information program cdip are used station 028 located at the santa monica bay ca is chosen for this purpose the record s duration was 30 min from 20 58 00 april 24 2020 to 21 28 00 april 24 2020 for these data the wave spectrum was obtained by fast fourier transform fft and then smoothed by a 20 point running average the corresponding spectrum is shown in fig 8 it is found that the corresponding spectrum is a bi modal spectrum with peak angular frequencies of the swell waves and the wind waves 0 25 and 0 42 rad s respectively after calculation the significant wave height defined as h s 4σ where σ is the standard deviation of surface elevation was 0 62 m the nsnwp w the differences between the crests and the preceding troughs δw the corresponding wavelet spectrum and the wave groups in the time series are all shown in fig 9 each wave group is well discriminated demonstrating that the method works well with wave groups of actual ocean waves 3 numerical model a non hydrostatic water wave model proposed by dong et al 2019 is adopted here to simulate random waves propagating over a submerged 2d obstacle with differing slopes the model was exercised previously dong et al 2019 and is exercised herein to demonstrate its ability to accurately simulate wave transformations under different scenarios 3 1 governing equations the governing equations of the non hydrostatic free surface inviscid flow are the 3 d incompressible euler equations the total pressure is divided into the hydrostatic pressure ρg η z and the dynamic pressure p the governing equations of the model are given by 12 u x v y w z 0 13 u t u u x v u y w u z g η x 1 ρ p x 14 v t u v x v v y w v z g η y 1 ρ p y 15 w t u w x v w y w w z 1 ρ p z where t is time u v and w are the velocity components in the horizontal x y and vertical z directions respectively g is the gravitational acceleration η is the free surface elevation and ρ is the water density to solve these governing equations boundary conditions at all the physical boundaries are required the kinematic boundary conditions at the free surface and the impermeable bottom are 16 η t u η x v η y w z η 17 h t u h x v h y w z h the free surface equation is 18 η t x h η u d z y h η v d z 0 to accurately describe the bottom and surface geometry a vertical σ coordinate is used in the model the governing equations and boundary conditions in the σ coordinate are referred to dong et al 2019 at the inlet boundary the incident local velocity and the surface elevation are specified and hence to generate waves at the outlet boundary a sponge layer larsen and dancy 1983 is employed to minimize wave reflections 3 2 spatial discretization a staggered grid system is introduced to discretize the physical domain the pressure is placed at the upper cell faces whereas the velocity u v w and water surface η are located on the cell center ma et al 2012 the layout of computational variables is shown in fig 10 3 3 numerical method three major steps are implemented to solve the governing equations first the momentum equations containing the non hydrostatic pressure at the previous time step are solved to obtain the intermediate velocity fields second the non hydrostatic pressure difference of the current time step is obtained by computing the discretized matrix equation which is obtained by the integration of the discretized continuity and momentum equations then the intermediate velocity fields are corrected through a pressure correction technique last the wave surface is determined via the discretized continuity equation for more details about the solution procedure the reader is referred to dong et al 2019 the ability and accuracy of the types of fully non hydrostatic wave models to simulate waves propagating over varying bathymetries have been widely validated ai et al 2011 lee et al 2006 ma et al 2012 young and wu 2010 zijlema and stelling 2005 4 occurrence of freak waves over different bottom slopes in this section unidirectional propagating random waves over different sloped bottoms are simulated to determine the occurrence probability of freak waves the length of the numerical wave flume is 100 m a 2d fore aft symmetrical submerged bar with slope 1 n is placed in the flume where n is varied from 3 to 80 the length of the constant depth before the offshore slope is 8 0 m the still water depth is set to 0 45 m which gives 0 1 m on the crest of the bar the crest width of the bar is 16 38 m which is sufficiently long to guarantee that the wave evolves to a stable form along the crest previous tests show that skewness and kurtosis can reach steady values after about 8 1 m 3l p propagation distance at the end of the flume a 9 0 m sponge layer is established a sketch of the numerical flume is presented in fig 11 in the simulation to examine the bottom slope effect a wide range of slopes n is varied from 3 through 80 is considered random waves are generated based on the jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 the number of discrete frequencies is 300 and the cutoff frequency is 3 5f p to include the effects of higher frequencies the wave peak period is t p 1 5 s and the significant wave height is h s 0 03 m the non dimensional water depth k p h in the offshore water is 1 04 indicating that the modulation instability can be neglected in the present simulations the spatial horizontal grid size is dx 0 01 m and three uniform vertical layers are adopted the total simulation time is 300 s for each realization and 70 realizations are simulated for each bottom slope stable time series from 30 s to 280 s is chosen to analyze and more than 10 000 individual waves are obtained at each location helping to ensure that the number of waves is sufficiently large for accurate statistical analysis according to the previous studies sergeeva et al 2011 trulsen et al 2012 2020 zeng and trulsen 2012 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 extreme wave events are likely to occur near the seaward top of the submerged bars in the present simulations it is also found that the maximum probability of extreme waves for each sloping bottom occurred at the seaward part of the bar therefore only the exceedance probability for the seaward part of the bar is discussed the probabilities of freak waves at the location of the maximal kurtosis over different slopes are presented in table 1 in general the probability of large waves is increasing with steeper slopes on the same slope the probability according to the criterion η c 1 25h s is larger than those of h 2h s indicating that the extreme waves are primarily with higher crests but smaller troughs furthermore for the slopes steeper than 1 15 the probabilities based on h 2h s are significantly larger than the probability for the deep water conditions 0 0336 kharif and pelinovsky 2003 indicating that wave shoaling can be an important factor in generating freak waves across bars 5 precursors of extreme events in the previous section it is shown that extreme waves occur near the crest of the bars an example of spatial variation of non dimensional maximum wave surface and wave height over the bottom slope 1 3 is shown in fig 12 where h s0 is the significant wave height in the offshore location both the maximum wave height and wave surface increase rapidly and an extreme wave occurs on the crest of the bar however it is not known when these extreme events will appear to quantify the properties of wave groups that will lead to extreme events wave groups are identified at the offshore location x 0 m using the method described in section 3 and then they are traced to the crest of the bars where large waves are likely to occur to demonstrate this procedure one of the realizations over the bottom slope 1 3 is described the nsnwp at the offshore location x 0 m δw and the corresponding delineated wave groups are shown in fig 13 each wave group is consistent with those determined by the wavelet spectrum at x 10 m on the crest of the bar the nsnwp w δw and the corresponding wave groups are shown in fig 14 in addition the highest value of w for each isolated wave group coincides with the maximum elevations of the wave group therefore the maximum nsnwp of each isolated wave group w m at x 0 m is investigated for each bottom slope nearly 1500 wave groups are generated via the jonswap spectrum as mentioned previously and then are analyzed the relationship between w m and the non dimensional maximum wave heights h max h s over different slopes are shown in fig 15 and the relationship between w m and the non dimensional maximum wave crests η c h s over different slopes are shown in fig 16 where h max η c are the maximum wave height and sea surface elevation respectively it is found that linear correlations provide a somewhat reasonable fit to the data distribution demonstrating that freak waves can be predicted somewhat through the non dimensional maximum scale non uniformity wavelet power at x 0 m of each isolated wave group the relationships between the gradients of the fitted curves and the corresponding slopes are shown in fig 17 where α h represents the gradient of the fitted curve corresponding to fig 15 and α η represents the gradient of the fitted curve corresponding to fig 16 exponential relationships between coefficients α h α η and the slopes are obtained with bottom slopes lower than 1 10 the coefficients α h α η are increasing rapidly however for steeper slopes the variations of the coefficients are nearly constant likewise the relationships between the intercepts of the fitted curves and the corresponding slopes are shown in fig 18 where b h represents the intercept of the fitted curves corresponding to fig 15 and b η represents the intercept of the fitted lines corresponding to fig 16 as is evident reasonable exponential relationships between the coefficients b h b η and the slopes are obtained also a formulation to predict extreme events is now presented the first cut formulations are given by 19 h m h s 0 0058 e 40 08 β 0 0075 w m 0 81 e 58 89 β 0 234 20 η c h s 0 0055 e 29 90 β 0 0068 w m 0 62 e 48 54 β 0 059 these equations have been generated via fitting of the data using the least square method to an exponential curve to minimize the number of false negatives extreme events that we fail to predict a conservative prediction threshold is given first the sensitivity of different thresholds is tested thresholds are varied from 1 0 to 0 75 that is if w m reaches 75 100 of the extreme event threshold then we predict that an extreme event will occur it is noted that in addition to the previous bottom slopes 1 3 1 5 and 1 10 other slope bottoms 1 4 1 8 and 1 12 are also included for each bottom slope 30 realizations are simulated with the total simulation time 300 s for each case prediction statistics for extreme waves according to the criteria h max h s 2 and η c h s 1 25 over different slopes with respect to different thresholds are shown in fig 19 and fig 20 respectively as mentioned false negatives denote extreme events which the method fails to predict on the other hand false positives are predicted extreme events that do not occur for the thresholds larger than 0 85 eg 0 9 0 95 and 1 0 both the probability of false negatives and false positives vary rapidly whereas when the thresholds are smaller than 0 85 the probability of false negatives and false positives are reasonably stable therefore to predict almost all the extreme waves low rate of false negatives with reasonably low false positive rates it is rational to choose the threshold of 0 85 therefore the above formulations i e eqs 19 and 20 are altered to 21 h m h s 0 0058 e 40 08 β 0 0075 0 85 w m 0 81 e 58 89 β 0 234 22 η c h s 0 0055 e 29 90 β 0 0068 0 85 w m 0 62 e 48 54 β 0 059 furthermore to demonstrate the wide application of the above prediction method for different significant wave heights another two significant wave heights 0 02 m and 0 035 m are chosen nearly 1500 wave groups are analyzed for each significant wave height then the relationship between w m and the non dimensional maximum wave heights h max h s and the relationship between w m and the maximum wave crests η c h s over different slopes are investigated it is found that for different significant wave heights linear correlations to the data distributions are all satisfied however the gradients of each fitted line are different ratios of gradients for different significant wave heights are almost identical to those of wave steepness ε which is defined as k p h s 2 where k p is the peak wave number in an offshore region and h s is the initial significant wave height next the corresponding wave steepness for the w m are multiplied and the fitted lines for different significant wave heights are determined to be almost the same examples of the relationship between w m ε and the non dimensionalized maximum wave height h max h s for different significant wave heights along sloped bottoms 1 3 and 1 10 are shown in fig 21 fitted lines are obtained using all points based on the three significant wave heights it is found that most points for the different significant wave heights overlap demonstrating the robustness of the precursor w m ε note that these fitted lines have little difference with those calculated by h s 0 03 m i e gradients of the lines are almost equal to the gradients of the fitted lines divided by the wave steepness in figs 15 and 16 therefore the formulations to predict extreme waves for different significant wave heights are further altered to 23 h m h s 0 0058 e 40 08 β 0 0075 0 85 w m ε ε 0 0 81 e 58 89 β 0 234 24 η c h s 0 0055 e 29 90 β 0 0068 0 85 w m ε ε 0 0 62 e 48 54 β 0 059 where ε is the wave steepness of the predicted waves ε 0 is the wave steepness for the wave case corresponding to figs 16 and 17 and where the wave peak period is t p 1 5 s the significant wave height is h s 0 03 m and the offshore depth is 0 045 m to summarize the above procedure to predict freak waves over 2d sloping bottoms in detail the entire process is illustrated in fig 22 in the method as the waves are propagating primarily in shallow water dispersion is very weak and therefore the wave groups interaction is not considered in the wave evolution the prediction process can be described by three primary steps first wave groups in the initial location are segregated based on the wavelet method and the maximum nsnwp of each isolated wave group w m is obtained second using eq 23 and eq 24 the minimum nsnwp w mt corresponding to the extreme waves are calculated by the threshold criterion of freak waves h max h s 2 and η c h s 1 25 then the values of w m for each isolated wave group and the w mt are compared if w m of the wave group is larger than the w mt extreme waves in the wave group are predicted to occur on the crest of bars to demonstrate the wide applicability and robustness of the above formulation extreme waves with different frequency bandwidths and significant wave heights are predicted for each bottom slope three peak enhancement factors γ 1 0 3 3 and 7 0 and significant wave heights from 0 02 m to 0 035 m are chosen for each wave case 30 realizations are simulated with a total simulation time 300 s for each prediction statistics for rogue waves with different frequency bandwidths and significant wave heights according to the criteria h h s 2 and η c h s 1 25 are shown in fig 23 and fig 24 for most wave cases false negatives are less than 0 2 and false positives are less than 0 3 for the same significant wave heights with narrower spectra widths false negatives decrease and even reach zero for some wave cases which means that the method could predict all wave groups with reasonably low false positive rates additionally for different significant wave heights variations of prediction errors are small compared to the criteria h h s 2 0 both false negatives are smaller according to the criteria η c h s 1 25 this is due to an increase in the number of freak waves for η c h s 1 25 therefore it seems that more robust and reliable prediction results are obtained for η c h s 1 25 thus the formulation could predict most of the extreme waves for different spectral widths and significant wave heights next to test the applicability of eqs 23 and 24 to different distances between the locations of discriminating wave groups and occurring extreme waves the initial location was varied from x 0 m to x 8 0 m the length of the offshore region is 8 0 m x 0 m is the location of wave maker x 8 m is the edge of the offshore region bottom slopes chosen are 1 3 1 5 and 1 10 for each bottom slope the peak enhancement factor implemented is γ 3 3 and the significant wave height used is 0 03 m prediction statistics for rogue waves with different distances between discriminating wave groups and occurring extreme waves according to the criteria h h s 2 and η c h s 1 25 are shown in fig 25 and fig 26 overall both false negatives and positives are relatively stable indicating that eqs 23 and 24 are robust for different distances in more detail false negatives slightly decrease but false positives increase as the distance decreases this may be due to further evolution the maximum nsnwp w m slightly decreases considering energy dissipation hence the threshold of w m occurring for extreme waves decreases as the distance decreases in conclusion eqs 23 and 24 could be applied to various distances between the locations of discriminating wave groups and occurring extreme waves if energy dissipation is weak in the following an example to predict an extreme event with a spectrum with a significant wave height 0 03 m γ 3 3 and along a slope of 1 4 is presented according to eqs 23 and 24 the threshold w m is 200 16 based on the h max h s 2 whereas the threshold w m is 148 88 based on the η c h s 1 25 fig 27 shows identified wave groups of the time series at the offshore location x 0 m at around t 127 s w m is 213 6 exceeding the threshold of 200 16 based on h max h s 2 and 148 88 based on η c h s 1 25 therefore a freak wave is predicted to occur on the crest of the bar by using eq 23 and eq 24 the predicted maximum non dimensionalized wave height is 2 12 on the other hand the predicted maximum non dimensionalized sea surface is 1 77 fig 28 shows the actual numerical evolution of the surface time series by tracing the wave group on the crest of the bar x 10 m at around t 135 s a freak wave is seen to occur the actual non dimensionalized wave height 2 14 and the non dimensionalized wave surface 1 85 which are quite close to the predicted values demonstrating the accuracy of the prediction method for the wave evolution over sloping bathymetry in addition at the initial location around t 136 s in the seventh wave group w m is 196 4 exceeding the threshold of 148 88 based on η c h s 1 25 but less than the threshold of 200 16 based on h max h s 2 therefore a large wave satisfied η c h s 1 25 but did not satisfy h max h s 2 on the crest of the bar using eq 24 the predicted maximum non dimensionalized sea surface is 1 62 by tracing the wave group on the crest of the bar x 10 m at around t 145 s in fig 28 the actual non dimensionalized wave surface is 1 52 while the non dimensionalized wave height is 1 97 both values are quite close to the predicted values therefore the prediction method for the wave evolution over sloping bathymetry would have provided reliable results 6 conclusions a new method to identify wave groups among random waves is proposed based on the wavelet transform the approach effectively decreases the sensitivity caused by artificial definitions and circumvents limitations to the shape of the wave groups subsequently this method is used to discriminate wave groups over varying bathymetry a large number of realizations of unidirectional random waves over a wide range of trapezoidal shaped bars with slopes from 1 3 through 1 80 are simulated by a fully non hydrostatic wave model probabilities of freak waves over different bottom slopes show that freak waves are almost always formed on the crest immediately following the seaward side of the bar with the slope steeper the probabilities of freak waves are increased and concurrently the statistical moments kurtosis and skewness also increase furthermore a new precursor the maximum non dimensional scale non uniformity wavelet power nsnwp is formulated to predict extreme events on the basis of the detected wave groups the indicator exhibits a good linear correlation with the maximum wave heights then formulations to predict freak waves over bottom slopes are constructed furthermore to predict waves with spectra of different significant wave heights the indicator multiplying the wave steepness is adopted after testing the applicability of the method with different wave steepness and spectral widths it is found that for most wave cases false negatives are less than 0 2 and false positives are less than 0 3 demonstrating that the precursor would have predicted most of the freak waves for different significant wave heights variations of prediction errors are not large further demonstrating the wide applicability and robustness of the prediction method for the same significant wave heights with narrower spectral widths false negatives decrease and even reach zero for some wave cases which indicates that the method would have predicted all of wave groups with reasonably low false positive rates therefore the precursor predicts most of the freak waves effectively credit authorship contribution statement ruili fu

20822,extreme waves usually emerge from intensive wave groups detection of wave groups from random waves may be a key step in predicting the occurrence of extreme events a new method to discriminate wave groups in random waves based on the wavelet transform is proposed and investigated the approach can identify wave groups effectively and efficiently to test the methods propagation of random wave trains over constant spanwise submerged obstacles with a wide range of bottom slopes varying from 1 3 to 1 80 are simulated using a fully nonlinear wave model extreme waves satisfying the definition of freak waves are identified close to the top of the obstacles steeper slopes increase the probability of freak waves moreover it is found that the non dimensionalized maximum of the scaled non uniformity wavelet power of wave groups can be used as a precursor to predict the occurrence of extreme waves over sloping bottoms the indicator correlates linearly with the maximum heights of wave groups using the simulated data formulae to predict freak waves for various wave steepness over sloping bottoms are constructed after testing a large number of cases it is found that the formulae predict most extreme waves successfully and effectively keywords freak waves wave groups non hydrostatic wave model wavelet power prediction 1 introduction freak or rogue waves have caused considerable damages to marine structures and human life not only in open seas but also in coastal regions cherneva et al 2005 haver 2004 kharif et al 2009 liu 2007 waseda 2010 a common definition of freak waves is η c 1 25h s or h 2h s dysthe et al 2008 where h s is the significant wave height defined as h s 4σ where σ is the standard deviation of surface elevation h is the wave height and η c is the crest elevation relative to the mean water level it has now been widely accepted that these extreme events occur more frequently than linear gaussian statistics would suggest mori et al 2007 nazarenko and lukaschuk 2016 onorato et al 2013 therefore to decrease the underlying catastrophic impact of freak waves it is crucial to provide an effective approach to predict these large amplitude waves according to statistical analysis the probability of freak wave occurrence can be obtained from the probability distribution of wave heights or crests for a given sea state cherneva et al 2009 janssen 2003 ying and kaplan 2012 but the specific information on when and where freak waves will occur is still unknown recently many studies have sought a deterministic prediction of extreme waves on shorter time scales and probabilistic quantification of chaotic systems cousins and sapsis 2014 dematteis et al 2018 farazmand and sapsis 2016 mohamad et al 2016 vlachas et al 2018 wan and sapsis 2017 wan et al 2018 birkholz et al 2015 observed that there may be some warnings before the appearance of rogue waves but the predictability was limited and may only provide a last second warning prior to the formation of an extreme wave a general method to predict sea surfaces is a phase resolved wave reconstruction via linear hilmer and thornhill 2014 2015 kusters et al 2016 naaijen and huijsmans 2010 naaijen et al 2009 2018 ruban 2016 van groesen and wijaya 2017 wijaya et al 2015 or nonlinear models blondel couprie et al 2013 blondel et al 2010 ducrozet et al 2016 köllisch et al 2018 qi et al 2018 linear prediction has the advantage of computational efficiency but it neglects wave wave interactions and it is likely not applicable to strongly nonlinear waves nonlinear wave reconstruction is able to provide a more accurate forecast however it is computationally demanding furthermore all of these methods are sensitive to measurement and computation errors by investigating single waves in random time series of sea surface elevations islas and schober 2005 slunyaev 2018 predicted the occurrence and strength of rogue waves using the inverse scattering theory of the nonlinear schrödinger nls equation but the technique is limited to homoclinic solutions of the nls equation mori et al 2002 found that freak waves could be discriminated easily from the wavelet spectrum if a strong energy density is visible in the spectrum akhmediev et al 2011 suggested that triangular spectra may provide useful indicators to predict freak waves furthermore latifah and groesen 2012 predicted the position and time of a rogue wave by minimizing the variance of the total wave phase bayındır 2016 showed that a specific v shaped high energy area of the wavelet spectra can be used as a precursor to predict rogue waves to further consider the effect of nonlinearity alam 2014 gave a predictability time scale for rogue waves through the high order spectral hos model dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 but it mainly examined wave fields with broad spectra guo and alam 2017 demonstrated that the spatial distribution of energy flux can predict extreme waves in deep water although the energy flux will vary under different time windows simanesew et al 2017 predicted waves in weakly nonlinear directional seas and showed that for long crested waves with steepness k c a c 0 10 where a c is the characteristic amplitude and k c is the characteristic wavenumber according to the modified nonlinear schrödinger equation the reliable prediction zone is about 40 characteristic wavelengths for short crested waves the accuracy of prediction is strongly reduced with increasing directional spread klein et al 2020 compared prediction results for unidirectional irregular waves by hos nls and the linear wave model they found that nonlinear dispersion effects play a significant role for moderate to high wave steepness more recently machine learning techniques were applied in phase resolved wave prediction duan et al 2020 guth and sapsis 2019 law et al 2020 and may play a key role in forecasting freak waves dudley et al 2019 to date many studies have indicated that freak waves evolve from intense wave groups in which wave energy is concentrated and include several successive large waves in random wave trains trulsen 2001 numerically reconstructed the new year wave and found that the large wave did not suddenly appear but gradually evolved from a short but steep wave group slunyaev 2006 and slunyaev et al 2005 demonstrated that freak waves which occurred in the north sea also emerged from intense wave groups likewise in coastal regions sergeeva et al 2014 showed that rogue waves often belong to intense wave groups therefore it is important to predict freak waves based on the characteristics of wave groups cousins and sapsis 2016 proposed a reduced order precursor based on a modified nls mnls equation for predicting unidirectional freak waves in deep water it is claimed that this method can forecast 12 39 wave periods before the occurrence of an extreme wave by knowledge of the amplitudes and length scales of wave groups in random sea states with a well defined spectrum farazmand and sapsis 2017 extended this method to horizontal two dimensional water waves recently the unidirectional method was examined in physical experiments cousins et al 2019 they showed that the method erred in predicting a few rogue waves during a temporal window of o 10t 0 with different frequency bandwidths where t 0 is the dominant wave period comparing with other methods to distinguish wave groups such as those based on upper envelopes huang et al 1999 list 1991 sanina et al 2016 and sequences of wave heights larger than a given threshold value i e runs battjes and van vledder 1985 ewing 1973 goda 1970 kimura 1980 wavelet spectra indicate wave groups more readily dong et al 2008 li et al 2015 liu 2000 liu and hawley 2002 and effectively decrease the sensitivity caused by the artificial definition therefore to identify whole wave groups accurately a new method based on the wavelet transform wt torrence and compo 1998 is proposed in the present study as a wave field propagates on variable bathymetry a number of studies sergeeva et al 2011 trulsen et al 2012 zeng and trulsen 2012 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 have demonstrated that bottom non uniformity can lead to an increased likelihood of freak waves trulsen et al 2012 conducted a series of experiments and found that the probability of freak waves exhibits a local maximum near the shallower side of a barred profile also it has a local maximum of kurtosis and skewness there janssen and herbers 2009 sergeeva et al 2011 and gramstad et al 2013 found that kurtosis and skewness reach a local maximum in the vicinity of the shallower side by using a frequency angular spectrum model a one dimensional korteweg de vries kdv and a boussinesq model respectively zeng and trulsen 2012 used a depth modified nonlinear schrödinger nls equation and demonstrated that a change of depth can induce a spatially non uniform distribution of kurtosis on the seaward crest of bars but they did not observe the enhanced probability of extreme waves due to the slowly varying depth viotti and dias 2014 observed strongly non gaussian statistics in depth transition regions using fully nonlinear potential flow equations and suggested that freak waves can be formed due to the out of equilibrium dynamics considering directional sea states ducrozet and gouin 2017 demonstrated that the probability of freak waves is reduced compared to the unidirectional varying depth bathymetry using the high order spectral hos model zhang et al 2019 showed that the second order nonlinear effects could be responsible for the formation of freak waves over a submerged bar this by adopting the boussinesq type model recently trulsen et al 2020 provided experimental evidence that the occurrence of extreme waves over a shoal depends on the depth of the shoal when the shoal is shallower than a threshold depth kh 1 3 the skewness and the kurtosis are enhanced significantly over the shallower part of the shoal additionally they investigated statistical moments of the horizontal fluid velocity and found that a local maximum skewness of horizontal velocity occurred at the same location as those for the surface elevations however a local maximum kurtosis of the horizontal velocity was seen on the downward slope of the lee side of the shoal although the above studies have given valuable insight on statistics of wavefields over variable depth the prediction of freak waves over unidirectional sloped bottoms has not been studied in detail in the present study a new method to identify wave groups based on the wavelet transform wt torrence and compo 1998 is proposed firstly to detect wave groups from random wave trains then random wave trains over unidirectional submerged bars with a wide range of bottom slope varying from 1 3 to 1 80 are simulated using a fully non hydrostatic model dong et al 2019 and the statistical properties skewness kurtosis freak wave probability over different sloping bottoms are analyzed furthermore a new precursor is constructed to predict the occurrence of extreme waves over sloping bottoms the remainder of this paper is as follows in section 2 a new method of determining isolated wave groups is proposed section 3 presents a brief introduction of the non hydrostatic water wave numerical model in section 4 probabilities and statistical characteristics of freak waves over different slopes are investigated section 5 proposes a precursor of freak waves over varying bathymetry and then evaluates it considering various cases lastly conclusions are presented in section 6 2 wave groups detection to efficiently and accurately detect wave groups a new method of ascertaining wave groups based on the wavelet transform wt is proposed to verify the robustness and applicability of the approach detection of wave groups from various series with well resolved double gaussian shaped groups and random waves with different spectra are assessed by the method 2 1 basic definitions of the wavelet transform the continuous wavelet transform of a time series x t is defined as follows daubechies 1992 dong et al 2008 torrence and compo 1998 1 w t τ s 1 s x t ψ t τ s d t where the denotes the complex conjugate s is a scale parameter t is time and τ is the localized time parameter by varying the wavelet scale s or frequency and translating along the localized time τ a figure showing the amplitude of any features versus the scale and how this amplitude varies with time can be constructed ψ is the so called mother wavelet generally the most widely used mother wavelet is the complex morlet wavelet dong et al 2008 huang 2004 liu 2000 massel 2001 given by 2 ψ 0 t π 1 4 exp t 2 2 exp i ω 0 t where ω 0 is the peak frequency of the wavelet taken here to be 6 0 farge 1992 kijewski and kareem 2003 to apply the wt to a given time series s and τ need to be discretized in general the scales are expressed as fractional powers of 2 dong et al 2008 massel 2001 torrence and compo 1998 3 s j s 0 2 j δ j 0 1 2 j 4 j 1 δ log 2 n δ t s 0 where s 0 is the smallest resolvable scale j determines the largest scale δ is the scale factor n is the total number of samples in the time series and δt is the sample time interval the value of s 0 should be chosen to satisfy the smallest equivalent fourier period the reciprocal of the nyquist frequency approximately 2δt a smaller δ is able to provide more adequate sampling in the scale s for the morlet wavelet the largest permitted value of δ is about 0 5 the relationship between s and cyclic frequency f is as follows torrence and compo 1998 5 f ω 0 ω 0 2 2 4 π s 2 2 detecting wave groups based on the wavelet spectrum wave groups can be identified according to their wavelet spectrum liu 2000 liu and hawley 2002 at the start and end of a wave group the total wavelet power is relatively small while the energy density at each discretized scale is relatively uniform however the distribution of the energy density inside a wave group is usually non uniform and the wavelet power over different scales varies significantly consequently the scale non uniformity wavelet power is defined here to identify the wave groups 6 w τ max w t τ s 2 w τ where w τ is defined as 7 w τ 1 j 0 w t τ s 2 d s where j is the number of scales the scale non uniformity wavelet power is a time series of the difference between the local maximum wavelet power and the scaled averaged wavelet power w τ it reflects the degree of energy variance over the scale domain at the front and rear of a wave group the value of the maximum wavelet power is close to the scaled averaged wavelet power w τ on the other hand the value of w τ reaches a local minimum between therefore two ends of wave groups can be identified based on the location of adjacent local minimums it should be noted that for random wave series there are small oscillations in the scale non uniformity wavelet power between large wave groups to separate wave groups successfully these small oscillations should be neglected and the corresponding time series are merged into adjacent rear wave groups small oscillations may be detected if the elevation difference between the crest and the adjacent preceding trough δw is smaller than a prescribed criterion an example of the scale non uniformity wavelet power w τ based on the morlet wavelet the differences between the crests and the preceding troughs δw and the wavelet spectra of a random wave train is shown in fig 1 the random wave train is generated based on the jonswap spectrum with peak enhancement factors of γ 7 0 peak period t p 7 s and significant wave height h s 1 6 m at t 0 s value of w τ reaches the first local minimum then it increase to a local maximum and decrease until at t 31 s that is at t 31 s w τ occurs the second local minimum therefore the first wave group is divided from t 0 s to t 31 s in analogy other wave groups can be discriminated it should be noted that some discriminated wave groups based on the location of adjacent local minimums are small and unreasonable for example at around t 169 s the scale non uniformity wavelet power reaches a trough the adjacent crest is at around t 195 s a wave group may be considered between these two ends however the wave group is quite small and should be only considered as a small oscillation likewise the differences between the trough and the adjacent crest at t 232 256 s t 410 5 401 6 s t 441 451 s are also small and thus should not be considered as wave groups therefore a rational criterion based on the difference between a crest and the adjacent preceding trough δw is necessary to accurately divide wave groups to verify the robustness of this method to discriminate wave groups the sensitivity of different mother wavelets is tested the scale non uniformity wavelet power w τ based on different mother wavelets morlet mother wavelet paul mother wavelet mexican hat mother wavelet torrence and compo 1998 for the time series in fig 1 are shown in fig 2 the shapes of w τ are similar using different mother wavelets compared to the morlet wavelet more small oscillations in w τ based on the paul mother wavelet is found therefore for the paul wavelet two ends of the wave groups can still be identified based on the location of adjacent local minimums but the criterion to detect small oscillations should be reconfirmed w τ based on the mexican hat wavelet are not smooth therefore smoothing may be needed to effectively implement w τ based on the mexican hat wavelet hence for different mother wavelets two ends of wave groups can still be identified based on the location of adjacent local minimums of w τ but the criterion to detect small oscillations may be different therefore in the following small oscillations are detected based on the morlet wavelet after assessing more than 1200 random wave cases with different frequency bandwidths and significant wave heights a criterion is recommended to detect and remove from consideration small oscillations based on the morlet wavelet the difference between the crest and the adjacent preceding trough of the scale non uniformity wavelet power δw is less than or equal to 1 3 of the average value of all of these differences this criterion provides the following expression 8 δ w τ 1 3 n 0 i 1 n 0 w c i τ w t i τ where w c i and w t i are the ith crest and the preceding trough of the scale non uniformity wavelet power respectively n 0 is the total number of crests of the scale non uniformity wavelet power to non dimensionalized w τ the non dimensional scale non uniformity wavelet power nsnwp w τ is divided by the square of the significant wave height 9 w τ w τ h s 2 where h s is the significant wave height for random waves likewise the criterion 8 can be non dimensionalized as follows 10 δ w τ 1 3 n 0 i 1 n 0 w c i τ w t i τ here w c i and w t i are the ith crest and the preceding trough value of the nsnwp respectively to address the robustness and wide applicability of the threshold 1 3 used in the above criterion different thresholds ranging from 1 6 to 1 2 are investigated random wave trains are generated based on the jonswap spectrum with three different peak enhancement factors γ 1 0 3 3 and 7 0 which have corresponding spectra varying from broad to narrow in deep water a wave peak period of t p 7 0 s is used and the significant wave heights h s are chosen to be 0 6 m 1 6 m 2 6 m and 3 6 m respectively thus the wave steepness ϵ k p h s 2 is varied from 0 02 to 0 14 where k p is the peak wave number for each wave case 100 realizations with random phases are generated based on the longuet higgins model longuet higgins 1952 and the total time is 800 s for each realization therefore a total of 1200 random wave trains with more than 130 000 individual waves are used to discriminate the wave groups which is sufficient to give reliable results different thresholds may have an effect on the durations of wave groups which are defined as the difference between the rear and front ends of wave groups the exceedance probability distributions of group durations t t p for different wave cases are obtained fig 3 shows the exceedance probability distributions of group durations t t p for a significant wave height h s of 1 6 m with different frequency bandwidths generally for the same peak enhancement factors γ with the values of threshold increasing wave group durations are longer this is mainly due to some small oscillations in the nsnwp that may be neglected and then the corresponding time series are included in adjacent rear wave groups for the same threshold group durations increase with a narrowing spectrum if the threshold is too large it is more sensitive to the oscillations hence most of these oscillations will be ignored and each wave group s duration will be longer on the other hand if the threshold is too small some small oscillations will be identified as independent wave groups and the probability of small duration wave groups will be increased fig 3 shows that the exceedance probability distributions of group durations for different frequency bandwidths are similar therefore to test the sensitivity of these thresholds to the durations of wave groups wave group durations corresponding to exceedance probabilities of 5 and 95 relative maximum and the minimum group durations are chosen thus most group durations are included using different thresholds fig 4 shows the comparisons of wave group durations corresponding to exceedance probabilities of 5 and 95 for different significant wave heights for the random wave trains with the same steepness averages and mean square errors of wave group durations are shown in each subfigure at a threshold of 1 3 the standard mean errors for different frequency bandwidths are minimum meanwhile for different significant wave heights the group durations corresponding to the exceedance probabilities 5 and 95 are all in the vicinity of 8t p and 17t p therefore among the values explored 1 3 is a more stable threshold to discriminate wave groups based on the morlet wavelet in the following several different scenarios are illustrated to demonstrate the utility of this method 2 2 1 double gaussian shaped wave groups to verify the applicability of the method trains with gaussian shaped wave groups are examined by comparing two shapes one of which is stretched in time a wave series of two gaussian shape wave groups with different frequencies is defined as 11 η t a 1 a g b g e t t f w 1 2 2 σ 1 2 a 2 b g e t t f w 2 2 2 σ 2 2 where a 1 0 5h 0cos ω 1 t a 2 0 5h 0cos ω 2 t h 0 0 03 m ω 1 7 85 rad s ω 2 4 18 rad s t fw1 6 46 s t fw2 18 81 s σ 1 n t p 1 2 n 2 t p1 0 8 s σ 2 n t p 2 2 t p2 1 5 s ag 0 05 and bg 0 95 the nsnwp w δw and the delineated two gaussian shaped wave groups are shown in fig 5 the differences between the first crest at t 6 46 s and the preceding trough at around t 11 2 s the second crest at t 18 81 s and the preceding trough at around t 28 s are both larger than the criterion described by eq 10 hence time intervals from the start of time series to t 11 s and t 11 s to t 28 s are determined to be the two wave groups therefore the two different gaussian shaped wave groups are also well divided by the method further demonstrating its robustness 2 2 2 random waves as mentioned above to demonstrate the robustness and wide applicability of the method groups in random waves with wide frequency bandwidths are determined using the above method wave groupiness is not obvious according to the time series in broadband spectra however the contour patches of the wavelet spectrum can clearly indicate wave groupings liu 1994 liu and hawley 2002 random wave trains are generated based on the jonswap spectrum with peak enhancement factors of γ 1 0 the peak period t p 7 s and a significant wave height h s 1 6 m is used which is similar to the above surface elevation case in fig 1 the nsnwp w the differences between the crests and the preceding troughs δw and the corresponding wavelet spectrum and divided wave group are shown in fig 6 small oscillations in fig 6 at t 108 120 s t 172 182 s t 230 263 s t 464 497 s 497 533 s and t 611 634 s are excluded by comparing the magnitude of δw and the threshold calculated by eq 10 the separated wave groups fig 6 d are again consistent with those presented by the wavelet spectrum fig 6 a demonstrating that the method seemingly discriminates wave groups effectively not only in narrow spectra but also for wide spectra to demonstrate applicability of the method to discriminate wave groups based on bi modal spectra following seyffert et al 2016 the ochi 6 parameter spectrum ochi 2005 is chosen parameter values for the bi modal spectrum used are h s1 6 m t modal1 16 s λ 1 4 and h s2 5 295 m t modal2 8 s λ 2 3 the nsnwp w is non dimensionalized by the square of the significant wave height h s defined as h s 1 2 h s 2 2 the differences between the crests and the preceding troughs δw and the corresponding wavelet spectrum and divided wave group are shown in fig 7 the separated wave groups fig 7 d are again reasonably consistent with those presented by the wavelet spectrum fig 7 a demonstrating that the method also discriminates wave groups effectively for bi modal spectra finally to demonstrate further the ability of this method to identify wave groups in physical oceanographic records wave buoy records from the coastal data information program cdip are used station 028 located at the santa monica bay ca is chosen for this purpose the record s duration was 30 min from 20 58 00 april 24 2020 to 21 28 00 april 24 2020 for these data the wave spectrum was obtained by fast fourier transform fft and then smoothed by a 20 point running average the corresponding spectrum is shown in fig 8 it is found that the corresponding spectrum is a bi modal spectrum with peak angular frequencies of the swell waves and the wind waves 0 25 and 0 42 rad s respectively after calculation the significant wave height defined as h s 4σ where σ is the standard deviation of surface elevation was 0 62 m the nsnwp w the differences between the crests and the preceding troughs δw the corresponding wavelet spectrum and the wave groups in the time series are all shown in fig 9 each wave group is well discriminated demonstrating that the method works well with wave groups of actual ocean waves 3 numerical model a non hydrostatic water wave model proposed by dong et al 2019 is adopted here to simulate random waves propagating over a submerged 2d obstacle with differing slopes the model was exercised previously dong et al 2019 and is exercised herein to demonstrate its ability to accurately simulate wave transformations under different scenarios 3 1 governing equations the governing equations of the non hydrostatic free surface inviscid flow are the 3 d incompressible euler equations the total pressure is divided into the hydrostatic pressure ρg η z and the dynamic pressure p the governing equations of the model are given by 12 u x v y w z 0 13 u t u u x v u y w u z g η x 1 ρ p x 14 v t u v x v v y w v z g η y 1 ρ p y 15 w t u w x v w y w w z 1 ρ p z where t is time u v and w are the

boundary conditions in the σ coordinate are referred to dong et al 2019 at the inlet boundary the incident local velocity and the surface elevation are specified and hence to generate waves at the outlet boundary a sponge layer larsen and dancy 1983 is employed to minimize wave reflections 3 2 spatial discretization a staggered grid system is introduced to discretize the physical domain the pressure is placed at the upper cell faces whereas the velocity u v w and water surface η are located on the cell center ma et al 2012 the layout of computational variables is shown in fig 10 3 3 numerical method three major steps are implemented to solve the governing equations first the momentum equations containing the non hydrostatic pressure at the previous time step are solved to obtain the intermediate velocity fields second the non hydrostatic pressure difference of the current time step is obtained by computing the discretized matrix equation which is obtained by the integration of the discretized continuity and momentum equations then the intermediate velocity fields are corrected through a pressure correction technique last the wave surface is determined via the discretized continuity equation for more details about the solution procedure the reader is referred to dong et al 2019 the ability and accuracy of the types of fully non hydrostatic wave models to simulate waves propagating over varying bathymetries have been widely validated ai et al 2011 lee et al 2006 ma et al 2012 young and wu 2010 zijlema and stelling 2005 4 occurrence of freak waves over different bottom slopes in this section unidirectional propagating random waves over different sloped bottoms are simulated to determine the occurrence probability of freak waves the length of the numerical wave flume is 100 m a 2d fore aft symmetrical submerged bar with slope 1 n is placed in the flume where n is varied from 3 to 80 the length of the constant depth before the offshore slope is 8 0 m the still water depth is set to 0 45 m which gives 0 1 m on the crest of the bar the crest width of the bar is 16 38 m which is sufficiently long to guarantee that the wave evolves to a stable form along the crest previous tests show that skewness and kurtosis can reach steady values after about 8 1 m 3l p propagation distance at the end of the flume a 9 0 m sponge layer is established a sketch of the numerical flume is presented in fig 11 in the simulation to examine the bottom slope effect a wide range of slopes n is varied from 3 through 80 is considered random waves are generated based on the jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 the number of discrete frequencies is 300 and the cutoff frequency is 3 5f p to include the effects of higher frequencies the wave peak period is t p 1 5 s and the significant wave height is h s 0 03 m the non dimensional water depth k p h in the offshore water is 1 04 indicating that the modulation instability can be neglected in the present simulations the spatial horizontal grid size is dx 0 01 m and three uniform vertical layers are adopted the total simulation time is 300 s for each realization and 70 realizations are simulated for each bottom slope stable time series from 30 s to 280 s is chosen to analyze and more than 10 000 individual waves are obtained at each location helping to ensure that the number of waves is sufficiently large for accurate statistical analysis according to the previous studies sergeeva et al 2011 trulsen et al 2012 2020 zeng and trulsen 2012 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 extreme wave events are likely to occur near the seaward top of the submerged bars in the present simulations it is also found that the maximum probability of extreme waves for each sloping bottom occurred at the seaward part of the bar therefore only the exceedance probability for the seaward part of the bar is discussed the probabilities of freak waves at the location of the maximal kurtosis over different slopes are presented in table 1 in general the probability of large waves is increasing with steeper slopes on the same slope the probability according to the criterion η c 1 25h s is larger than those of h 2h s indicating that the extreme waves are primarily with higher crests but smaller troughs furthermore for the slopes steeper than 1 15 the probabilities based on h 2h s are significantly larger than the probability for the deep water conditions 0 0336 kharif and pelinovsky 2003 indicating that wave shoaling can be an important factor in generating freak waves across bars 5 precursors of extreme events in the previous section it is shown that extreme waves occur near the crest of the bars an example of spatial variation of non dimensional maximum wave surface and wave height over the bottom slope 1 3 is shown in fig 12 where h s0 is the significant wave height in the offshore location both the maximum wave height and wave surface increase rapidly and an extreme wave occurs on the crest of the bar however it is not known when these extreme events will appear to quantify the properties of wave groups that will lead to extreme events wave groups are identified at the offshore location x 0 m using the method described in section 3 and then they are traced to the crest of the bars where large waves are likely to occur to demonstrate this procedure one of the realizations over the bottom slope 1 3 is described the nsnwp at the offshore location x 0 m δw and the corresponding delineated wave groups are shown in fig 13 each wave group is consistent with those determined by the wavelet spectrum at x 10 m on the crest of the bar the nsnwp w δw and the corresponding wave groups are shown in fig 14 in addition the highest value of w for each isolated wave group coincides with the maximum elevations of the wave group therefore the maximum nsnwp of each isolated wave group w m at x 0 m is investigated for each bottom slope nearly 1500 wave groups are generated via the jonswap spectrum as mentioned previously and then are analyzed the relationship between w m and the non dimensional maximum wave heights h max h s over different slopes are shown in fig 15 and the relationship between w m and the non dimensional maximum wave crests η c h s over different slopes are shown in fig 16 where h max η c are the maximum wave height and sea surface elevation respectively it is found that linear correlations provide a somewhat reasonable fit to the data distribution demonstrating that freak waves can be predicted somewhat through the non dimensional maximum scale non uniformity wavelet power at x 0 m of each isolated wave group the relationships between the gradients of the fitted curves and the corresponding slopes are shown in fig 17 where α h represents the gradient of the fitted curve corresponding to fig 15 and α η represents the gradient of the fitted curve corresponding to fig 16 exponential relationships between coefficients α h α η and the slopes are obtained with bottom slopes lower than 1 10 the coefficients α h α η are increasing rapidly however for steeper slopes the variations of the coefficients are nearly constant likewise the relationships between the intercepts of the fitted curves and the corresponding slopes are shown in fig 18 where b h represents the intercept of the fitted curves corresponding to fig 15 and b η represents the intercept of the fitted lines corresponding to fig 16 as is evident reasonable exponential relationships between the coefficients b h b η and the slopes are obtained also a formulation to predict extreme events is now presented the first cut formulations are given by 19 h m h s 0 0058 e 40 08 β 0 0075 w m 0 81 e 58 89 β 0 234 20 η c h s 0 0055 e 29 90 β 0 0068 w m 0 62 e 48 54 β 0 059 these equations have been generated via fitting of the data using the least square method to an exponential curve to minimize the number of false negatives extreme events that we fail to predict a conservative prediction threshold is given first the sensitivity of different thresholds is tested thresholds are varied from 1 0 to 0 75 that is if w m reaches 75 100 of the extreme event threshold then we predict that an extreme event will occur it is noted that in addition to the previous bottom slopes 1 3 1 5 and 1 10 other slope bottoms 1 4 1 8 and 1 12 are also included for each bottom slope 30 realizations are simulated with the total simulation time 300 s for each case prediction statistics for extreme waves according to the criteria h max h s 2 and η c h s 1 25 over different slopes with respect to different thresholds are shown in fig 19 and fig 20 respectively as mentioned false negatives denote extreme events which the method fails to predict on the other hand false positives are predicted extreme events that do not occur for the thresholds larger than 0 85 eg 0 9 0 95 and 1 0 both the probability of false negatives and false positives vary rapidly whereas when the thresholds are smaller than 0 85 the probability of false negatives and false positives are reasonably stable therefore to predict almost all the extreme waves low rate of false negatives with reasonably low false positive rates it is rational to choose the threshold of 0 85 therefore the above formulations i e eqs 19 and 20 are altered to 21 h m h s 0 0058 e 40 08 β 0 0075 0 85 w m 0 81 e 58 89 β 0 234 22 η c h s 0 0055 e 29 90 β 0 0068 0 85 w m 0 62 e 48 54 β 0 059 furthermore to demonstrate the wide application of the above prediction method for different significant wave heights another two significant wave heights 0 02 m and 0 035 m are chosen nearly 1500 wave groups are analyzed for each significant wave height then the relationship between w m and the non dimensional maximum wave heights h max h s and the relationship between w m and the maximum wave crests η c h s over different slopes are investigated it is found that for different significant wave heights linear correlations to the data distributions are all satisfied however the gradients of each fitted line are different ratios of gradients for different significant wave heights are almost identical to those of wave steepness ε which is defined as k p h s 2 where k p is the peak wave number in an offshore region and h s is the initial significant wave height next the corresponding wave steepness for the w m are multiplied and the fitted lines for different significant wave heights are determined to be almost the same examples of the relationship between w m ε and the non dimensionalized maximum wave height h max h s for different significant wave heights along sloped bottoms 1 3 and 1 10 are shown in fig 21 fitted lines are obtained using all points based on the three significant wave heights it is found that most points for the different significant wave heights overlap demonstrating the robustness of the precursor w m ε note that these fitted lines have little difference with those calculated by h s 0 03 m i e gradients of the lines are almost equal to the gradients of the fitted lines divided by the wave steepness in figs 15 and 16 therefore the formulations to predict extreme waves for different significant wave heights are further altered to 23 h m h s 0 0058 e 40 08 β 0 0075 0 85 w m ε ε 0 0 81 e 58 89 β 0 234 24 η c h s 0 0055 e 29 90 β 0 0068 0 85 w m ε ε 0 0 62 e 48 54 β 0 059 where ε is the wave steepness of the predicted waves ε 0 is the wave steepness for the wave case corresponding to figs 16 and 17 and where the wave peak period is t p 1 5 s the significant wave height is h s 0 03 m and the offshore depth is 0 045 m to summarize the above procedure to predict freak waves over 2d sloping bottoms in detail the entire process is illustrated in fig 22 in the method as the waves are propagating primarily in shallow water dispersion is very weak and therefore the wave groups interaction is not considered in the wave evolution the prediction process can be described by three primary steps first wave groups in the initial location are segregated based on the wavelet method and the maximum nsnwp of each isolated wave group w m is obtained second using eq 23 and eq 24 the minimum nsnwp w mt corresponding to the extreme waves are calculated by the threshold criterion of freak waves h max h s 2 and η c h s 1 25 then the values of w m for each isolated wave group and the w mt are compared if w m of the wave group is larger than the w mt extreme waves in the wave group are predicted to occur on the crest of bars to demonstrate the wide applicability and robustness of the above formulation extreme waves with different frequency bandwidths and significant wave heights are predicted for each bottom slope three peak enhancement factors γ 1 0 3 3 and 7 0 and significant wave heights from 0 02 m to 0 035 m are chosen for each wave case 30 realizations are simulated with a total simulation time 300 s for each prediction statistics for rogue waves with different frequency bandwidths and significant wave heights according to the criteria h h s 2 and η c h s 1 25 are shown in fig 23 and fig 24 for most wave cases false negatives are less than 0 2 and false positives are less than 0 3 for the same significant wave heights with narrower spectra widths false negatives decrease and even reach zero for some wave cases which means that the method could predict all wave groups with reasonably low false positive rates additionally for different significant wave heights variations of prediction errors are small compared to the criteria h h s 2 0 both false negatives are smaller according to the criteria η c h s 1 25 this is due to an increase in the number of freak waves for η c h s 1 25 therefore it seems that more robust and reliable prediction results are obtained for η c h s 1 25 thus the formulation could predict most of the extreme waves for different spectral widths and significant wave heights next to test the applicability of eqs 23 and 24 to different distances between the locations of discriminating wave groups and occurring extreme waves the initial location was varied from x 0 m to x 8 0 m the length of the offshore region is 8 0 m x 0 m is the location of wave maker x 8 m is the edge of the offshore region bottom slopes chosen are 1 3 1 5 and 1 10 for each bottom slope the peak enhancement factor implemented is γ 3 3 and the significant wave height used is 0 03 m prediction statistics for rogue waves with different distances between discriminating wave groups and occurring extreme waves according to the criteria h h s 2 and η c h s 1 25 are shown in fig 25 and fig 26 overall both false negatives and positives are relatively stable indicating that eqs 23 and 24 are robust for different distances in more detail false negatives slightly decrease but false positives increase as the distance decreases this may be due to further evolution the maximum nsnwp w m slightly decreases considering energy dissipation hence the threshold of w m occurring for extreme waves decreases as the distance decreases in conclusion eqs 23 and 24 could be applied to various distances between the locations of discriminating wave groups and occurring extreme waves if energy dissipation is weak in the following an example to predict an extreme event with a spectrum with a significant wave height 0 03 m γ 3 3 and along a slope of 1 4 is presented according to eqs 23 and 24 the threshold w m is 200 16 based on the h max h s 2 whereas the threshold w m is 148 88 based on the η c h s 1 25 fig 27 shows identified wave groups of the time series at the offshore location x 0 m at around t 127 s w m is 213 6 exceeding the threshold of 200 16 based on h max h s 2 and 148 88 based on η c h s 1 25 therefore a freak wave is predicted to occur on the crest of the bar by using eq 23 and eq 24 the predicted maximum non dimensionalized wave height is 2 12 on the other hand the predicted maximum non dimensionalized sea surface is 1 77 fig 28 shows the actual numerical evolution of the surface time series by tracing the wave group on the crest of the bar x 10 m at around t 135 s a freak wave is seen to occur the actual non dimensionalized wave height 2 14 and the non dimensionalized wave surface 1 85 which are quite close to the predicted values demonstrating the accuracy of the prediction method for the wave evolution over sloping bathymetry in addition at the initial location around t 136 s in the seventh wave group w m is 196 4 exceeding the threshold of 148 88 based on η c h s 1 25 but less than the threshold of 200 16 based on h max h s 2 therefore a large wave satisfied η c h s 1 25 but did not satisfy h max h s 2 on the crest of the bar using eq 24 the predicted maximum non dimensionalized sea surface is 1 62 by tracing the wave group on the crest of the bar x 10 m at around t 145 s in fig 28 the actual non dimensionalized wave surface is 1 52 while the non dimensionalized wave height is 1 97 both values are quite close to the predicted values therefore the prediction method for the wave evolution over sloping bathymetry would have provided reliable results 6 conclusions a new method to identify wave groups among random waves is proposed based on the wavelet transform the approach effectively decreases the sensitivity caused by artificial definitions and circumvents limitations to the shape of the wave groups subsequently this method is used to discriminate wave groups over varying bathymetry a large number of realizations of unidirectional random waves over a wide range of trapezoidal shaped bars with slopes from 1 3 through 1 80 are simulated by a fully non hydrostatic wave model probabilities of freak waves over different bottom slopes show that freak waves are almost always formed on the crest immediately following the seaward side of the bar with the slope steeper the probabilities of freak waves are increased and concurrently the statistical moments kurtosis and skewness also increase furthermore a new precursor the maximum non dimensional scale non uniformity wavelet power nsnwp is formulated to predict extreme events on the basis of the detected wave groups the indicator exhibits a good linear correlation with the maximum wave heights then formulations to predict freak waves over bottom slopes are constructed furthermore to predict waves with spectra of different significant wave heights the indicator multiplying the wave steepness is adopted after testing the applicability of the method with different wave steepness and spectral widths it is found that for most wave cases false negatives are less than 0 2 and false positives are less than 0 3 demonstrating that the precursor would have predicted most of the freak waves for different significant wave heights variations of prediction errors are not large further demonstrating the wide applicability and robustness of the prediction method for the same significant wave heights with narrower spectral widths false negatives decrease and even reach zero for some wave cases which indicates that the method would have predicted all of wave groups with reasonably low false positive rates therefore the precursor predicts most of the freak waves effectively credit authorship contribution statement ruili fu

20823,a novel magnetic bistable device mbd is proposed to improve the efficiency of energy harvesting of a point absorber wave energy converter wec by decreasing the potential barrier of the bistable energy absorber the novel mbd is mainly composed of two pairs of coaxial permanent magnet rings with different sizes for the permanent magnet rings one pair has the same magnetic field direction to provide negative stiffness and the other magnet rings have nonlinear positive stiffness property with a reverse magnetic field direction the nonlinear dynamic model is established by adopting the state space model approach during solving the convolution integral of radiation force the capture width ratio of the wec with the novel mbd is studied with the change of design parameters in regular wave then the effect of structural parameters for the novel mbd on the wave energy capture ratio is discussed the results indicate that using the novel mbd can significantly improve the performance of point absorber wec especially under low wave excitations in comparison with that of the wec with traditional mbd keywords wave energy point absorber efficiency bistable nonlinear response nomenclature

which promotes social development at a pace never seen before in human history but causes some severe environmental disasters such as the greenhouse effect acid rain air pollution soil contamination and so on in the same time wang et al 2011 widely known wave energy has some advantages including renewability cleanliness predictability and so on folley 2017 pérez collazo et al 2015 franzitta et al 2017 at the meantime the wave energy has natural advantages to be used in some remote areas rusu and onea 2016 wave energy is one of the largest reservoir of energy on the earth and its global potential reserve has been estimated to be in the order of 1 tw approximately equal to 1012w falnes 2007 after the oil crisis in 1970s wave energy has attracted the attention of an increasingly large number of scholars and engineers all over the world rusu 2009 many methods have been proposed to achieve wave power generation effectively several categories of wave energy converters wecs including oscillating water column wec point absorber wec over topping convertor rotating mass device attenuator and so on younesian and alam 2017 the point absorber wecs due to the feature of simplicity in manufacturing and installation have become one of the most promising wecs jahangir et al 2018 although the point absorber wecs have been investigated by many scholars theoretically and experimentally zhu et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 the typical linear point absorber wec has not been extensively commercialized due to some limitations and challenges he et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 one of the evident drawbacks is the lower efficiency of wave energy conversion di dio et al 2013 it is no doubt that the traditional linear system could have a good performance only in a relatively narrow frequency band as the excitation frequency is exceedingly close to the natural frequency of the linear device when the wave excitation frequency is slightly deviated from the natural frequency of the wec the efficiency of absorbing wave energy will reduce significantly furthermore the realistic incident waves have the characteristics of irregular wave spectrum that the dominant frequencies may change from time to time yang and towfighian 2017 thus the linear wec cannot draw energy from all frequencies equally well and will produce very much lower efficiency in complex ocean conditions in order to solve this problem for a point absorbing wec some active control technologies have been applied to enhance the efficiency of the wecs oscar et al barambones and durana 2015 proposed a sliding model control technology for a point absorber wave power generation plant and their simulation results showed that the control scheme was robust for the uncertainties in the real sea babarit et al 2004 investigated the latching control applied to a heaving wave energy device under random seas and the results indicated that it can magnify the amplitude of the motion effectively when the wave frequencies apart from the natural frequency fan et al 2016 designed a fuzzy controller to adjust the condition of a hydraulic motor to control the output energy for a point absorber wec the results revealed that the conversion efficiency of the wec can be enhanced as the output torque of the motor is controlled although some of these methods have been carried out in laboratories or even sea test ranges to validate the effectiveness of the control strategies there are still some limitations and challenges for the practical applications first of all the premise for most of the control strategies performed well is that the controller should know the predicted information of wave excitations the performance of control approach would be powerless for the observed information do not match well with the real sea nguyen and tona 2018 and then many of the control devices will consume additional absorbed energy in addition the wave energy converter with control devices could be more difficult to install and maintain which reduce the adaptability and increase the cost of the wec younesian and alam 2017 apart from above active methods to enhance the conversion efficiency nonlinear capture mechanism is one of the most promising passive strategies rijnsdorp et al 2019 harne and wang 2013 zhou et al 2017 among them the bistable mechanism is one of the most effective approaches to broaden the frequency band and enhance the efficiency of energy conversion pellegrini et al 2013 different from the mechanism of the linear systems the bistable mechanism has a feature with double well potential energy as shown in fig 1 the bistable system has two stable equilibrium points and one unstable equilibrium point there are three possible forms of motions depending on different excitation conditions the first possible motion form is an intra well oscillation with small motion amplitude shown in fig 1 a under a relatively small input amplitude of excitation force with the increase of the excitation amplitude the second form with a chaotic mixed intra and inter well oscillation occurs as shown in fig 1 b with blue dash line and the last one is an inter well oscillation under the condition of larger excitation force amplitude than the chaotic intra well oscillation in fig 1 c it is obvious that the inter well oscillations with large displacement and velocity amplitudes are what the researchers eagerly want to explore in the performance of vibration energy harvesting few researchers and experts have adopted bistable mechanisms to the point absorber wecs to further improve the capture efficiency of wave energy zhang et al zhang et al 2014 zhang and yang 2015 first applied the classical bistable device with two symmetrically oblique springs to a point absorber wec and the performances for the nonlinear wec in regular and irregular sea conditions were investigated in comparison with that of the corresponding linear wec their results showed that the snap through phenomenon of the bistable mechanism could remarkably improve the efficiency of power absorption in low frequency range using the same structural configuration todal shaug et al todalshaug et al 2016 replaced the two linear springs with two pneumatic machinery components to construct a negative stiffness machinery named as wave spring the experimental investigation for a point absorber wec with the wave spring device in irregular waves was carried out and the results showed that the wave spring bistable mechanism can increase the output power three times harne et al 2014 designed a novel bistable magnetic generator that could convert the motion at low frequency to the available energy at high frequency referencing the mechanism of the bistable devices davood et al younesian and alam 2017 designed a multi stable mechanism which consists of two oblique rigid links and two oblique linear springs via adjusting the angle of inclined springs and rigid links it can achieve in different multi stable states from the bistable to four stable their results indicated that the mechanism can significantly enhance the absorption efficiency of a point absorber wec meanwhile the width of frequency band of wave power generation would be widened although several bitable mechanisms have been applied to the energy conversion systems there are still some unsatisfactory in their performance zhou et al 2014 one of most noticeable issues is that there are many difficulties in maintaining the high energy inter well motion state under arbitrary excitation levers for the traditional bistable energy conversion systems pellegrini et al 2013 in order to enhance the energy capture efficiency by the bistable system the large distance z 0 between the stable equilibrium point and unstable equilibrium point shown in fig 1 is needed to obtain a large vibration amplitude meanwhile the threshold criteria δ u p should be properly small to be easily overcome masana and daqaq 2011 however a large number of research results indicated that there remains a conundrum about the two determining factors z 0 and δ u p which means that the threshold criteria δ u p would increase accordingly with the increase of distance z 0 shan et al 2018 therefore for the lower wave amplitude conditions there is an inherent disadvantage for the traditional bistable system that the efficiency of energy absorption could be reduced even less than that of the linear wec zhao et al 2020 because the nonlinear mechanism cannot overcome the potential barrier and be trapped in the intra well oscillations under small excitations zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 in this study a novel magnetic bistable device mbd is proposed to enhance the capture efficiency of a point absorber wec by reducing the potential barrier of the bistable absorber the novel mbd mainly consists of two pairs of permanent magnetic rings installed with reverse field direction and different sizes the magnetic rings with same field direction provide the negative stiffness and the other rings offer the positive stiffness for the device the configuration of the novel magnetic bistable device can meet the functional requirement of increasing distance between two wells and lowering potential barrier a method refer to the ref hulme 1982 has been used to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave excitation force of the spherical floating body the dynamic model of system is built and the governing equation in the time domain is established based on cummins equation cummins 1962 where the radiation force represented by convolution integral is replaced by the state space model method and then the governing equation is solved by taking the 4th order runge kutta method the statics analysis of the bistable device is carried out for diverse nonlinear parameters the capture width ratio of the novel mbd wec is studied in comparison with that of the corresponding traditional mbd and liner wecs 2 the dynamic model of a point absorber wec fig 2 shows a schematic of a point absorber wec with a mbd a power take off pto connected with a mbd by a rigid rod and a spherical floating structure with radius r in the end of the rigid rod the floating structure is moored on the sea bed by a mooring cable the origin of cartesian coordinate system coincides exactly with the center of the spherical buoy the z axis points upwards and the x axis is at undisturbed water free surface the heave motion of buoy is only considered for the study of wave energy absorption in this paper 2 1 mechanical characteristics of the novel mbd fig 3 shows the traditional mbd proposed in the ref zhang et al 2019 and the novel type from fig 3 a the traditional bistable device mainly consists of a pair of main magnetic rings mmrs with the same magnetic field direction the internal magnetic ring 5 is fixed to the rigid rod 1 through the ring flanges 4 and the out magnetic ring 6 is bound with the hoop 7 each end of the hoop 7 is connected with an end cap 3 the rigid rod 1 is restrained by the end cap 3 and two linear bearings 2 which guide the rigid rod 1 can only move in the axis direction the two ends of the rigid rod 1 are connected to the spherical floating and the linear pto respectively a pair of auxiliary magnetic rings amrs 10 11 with reverse magnetic field are added to the traditional bistable device to build a novel mbd as shown in fig 3 b the lower internal magnetic ring 10 and lower external magnetic ring 11 of the auxiliary magnets are separated by using the external back up ring 9 and internal back up ring 8 respectively a section view of the novel mbd is shown in fig 4 a the geometric parameters of the main magnetic rings and auxiliary magnetic rings are the same except for the height of the rings l is the width of the permanent magnetic ring r is the radius of the internal magnetic ring and δ is the air gap between the external and internal magnetic rings h is the height of the mmrs and h 0 is the height of the amrs fig 4 b illustrates the equilibrium characteristics of the bistable device when the inner and the outer magnetic rings are at the same height of the novel mbd the system is in the unstable equilibrium state as the rigid rod moves up or down to a certain position the negative stiffness force provided by the novel mbd could be balanced by the hydrostatic restoring force of the floating structure which is the stable states correspondingly the nonlinear force of the novel mbd at heave displacement z of the floating structure can be written as zhou et al 2018 1 f m σ 2 r m μ 2 φ z φ z h φ z h σ 2 r m μ 2 φ z φ z h 0 φ z h 0 where σ j n is the magnetic pole surface density j is the magnetic polarization vector and

proposed in this study the frequency domain method is not suitable for solving the governing equation of motion for a nonlinear wec the governing equation of a point absorber wec system based on cummins equations for heave motion in the time domain is presented as follows 3 m a z t t h z t τ z τ ⅆ τ c z t f s f m f e t where z is the displacement for the heave motion m and a denote the mass of buoy and the limiting value of the added mass for ω respectively the mass m for a hemisphere is satisfied with m 2 3 ρ π r 3 according to static equilibrium and the added mass is given by a 0 5 m more detailed description can refer to hulme 1982 the pto is simplified as a linear damper with damping coefficient c the convolution integral in the above equation represents the radiation force of the wave and the impulse response function h z t can be obtained by the radiation damping coefficient b z ω as follows taghipour et al 2008 4 h z t 0 b z ω cos ω t ⅆ ω the hydrostatic restoring force can be represented as f s k s z and the constant coefficient k s ρ g π r 2 under the assumption of small heave motion for a buoy where ρ and g are water density and the gravity acceleration respectively f m denotes the magnetic force of the novel mbd the time varying wave excitation force f e t for regular incident wave can be expressed in the following equation 5 f r t a f ω sin ω t where ω and a are the wave frequency and amplitude and f ω denotes the wave excitation force coefficient which can be represented in the following about an axisymmetric floating structure oscillating in heave direction in deep water mccormick 2003 6 f ω 2 g 3 ρ b z ω ω 3 the added mass a z ω and the radiation damping b z ω can be determined by using the method in ref hulme 1982 in which the asymptotic expressions of a floating hemisphere oscillating in deep water in the heave direction was derived 2 3 state space model method it is inconvenient and time consuming for the researcher to calculate the convolution integral directly in eq 3 for this reason the state space model method is utilized to replace the convolution integral and this approach has been identified that is almost eight times faster than solving the convolution integral directly taghipour et al 2008 considering the governing equation in eq 3 the input is the heave velocity z t and the impulse function is the kernel function h z t then the state space model is used to approximately represent the convolution integral as follows 16 x t a x t b z t y z t c x t where y z t t h z t τ z τ d τ is the radiation force due to the memory effect of the sea water in the time domain then the next work is to confirm the coefficient matrices a b and c referring to the solving method proposed by taghipour et al 2008 firstly we have calculated the hydrodynamic data of the floating structure under a series of wave frequency then the frequency domain identification method without considering the infinite frequency added mass is used in our derivation 2 4 absorption efficiency of wave energy in regular wave the expression of the average wave power absorbed by the pto due to the work of damping force can be obtained in the following expression 19 e r 1 t 0 t t t 0 c z 2 ⅆ t where t 0 is the time interval of the calculation based on the linear wave theory and considering the regular wave condition with infinite water depth then the incident wave power under the condition of per meter of wave front length can be solved by mccormick 2003 20 e 0 r 1 2 ρ g a 2 g 2 ω generally the capture width of energy absorption is widely used to evaluate the property of a wec which can be denoted by 21 c w e r e 0 r it is worthy noticing that the viscous forces and nonlinear wave forces are not considered in this study the capture width obtained in this study is overestimated 3 results and discussions 3 1 parameters and numerical model validation in this study the magnetic pole surface density is given by σ 1

for the hydrodynamic coefficients from fig 5 we can see that the fourth order identification results can agree well with the original data which can guarantee the reliability of the identification results considering the buoy system without the bistable device and pto the response of the buoy is calculated both in the frequency domain by using the original hydrodynamic coefficient and in the time domain with the state space model method replaced the results of the response amplitude frequency curves are shown in fig 6 which indicates that the nonlinear numerical model is feasible in this study 3 2 static analysis of the novel mbd in this section the static characteristics of the novel mbd are investigated and then the impact of the geometric parameters on the nonlinear characteristics is studied the potential energy u p of the resorting force f r f s f m is determined as 24 u p 0 z f r ζ ⅆ ζ 1 2 k s z 2 σ 2 r m μ 0 2 ψ z ψ z h ψ z h 2 ψ 0 ψ h ψ h σ r m μ 0 2 ψ z ψ z h 0 ψ z h 0 2 ψ

2 a 2 l δ 2 ln l δ 2 a 2 1 4 δ 2 a 2 ln δ 2 a 2 1 2 a 2 ln l δ 2 c where c is a constant and the global equivalent stiffness can be derived as 26 k e f r z k s σ 2 r m μ 2 ϕ z ϕ z h ϕ z h σ 2 r m μ 2 ϕ z ϕ z h 0 ϕ z h 0 the expression of function ϕ is as follows 27 ϕ a 2 a 2 a 2 l δ 2 1 2 ln 2 l δ 2 a 2 δ 2 a 2 l δ 4 similarly the potential energy and restoring stiffness are also nondimensionalized as follows 28 u p u p 1 2 ρgπ r 4 k e k e k s for the novel mbd the heights of the two pair of magnetic rings are the key parameters to affect the performance of the bistable wec thus the other structural parameters are chosen as the relative optimum values which were explored in our recent work zhang et al 2019 for r 0 04 l 1 δ 2 the potential energy curves of the novel mbd under different height parameters of the permanent magnetic rings is shown in fig 7 the black line denotes the potential energy curve of the linear system the red star dotted line indicates the mbd with h 4 h 0 0 45 the blue triangle and yellow circle dotted lines show the different mbds with h 5 h 0 0 45 and h 5 respectively comparing the blue triangle curve of mbd under h 5 h 0 0 45 with the yellow circle curve of mbd under h 5 after adding the amrs with h 0 0 45 on the basis of mmrs with h 5 the potential energy barrier δ u p of the novel mbd with h 5 h 0 0 45 decreased significantly while the distance z 0 between the stable equilibrium point and unstable equilibrium point remained basically unchanged comparing the blue triangle curve of mbd under h 5 h 0 0 45 with the red star curve of mbd under h 4 h 0 0 45 it is obvious that the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 both increased by the change of the height of mmrs from h 4 to h 5 the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 are the most critical factors for the bistable system combined with the discussion in fig 7 therefore the influence study of structural parameters on the bistable characteristics can be transformed into the influence research of parameters h h 0 on the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 of the bistable system in the parameter space h h 0 two contours of the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 between the stable and unstable equilibrium points are illustrated in fig 8 a and fig 8 b respectively there are three different colored lines in fig 8 in which the red line l1 represents the parameter separation line for monostable and bistable system in the upper left of the red line l1 shown with the dark blue region the potential energy barrier δ u p and the stable equilibrium point position are both equal to zero which indicates that the nonlinear wec with parameters h h 0 set in this region is a monostable system the reason for this phenomenon is that the negative stiffness provided by the bistable device is not enough to offset the positive hydrostatic restoring stiffness to the contrary the bottom right area of the red line l1 denotes the bistable parameter range with δ u p 0 and z 0 0 when we examine fig 8 a and 8 b in this bistable region carefully it is marked that the evolutions for the gradients of the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance between the stable and unstable equilibrium points are different which indicates that the desired potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 can be obtained by adjusting the parameters h h 0 to illustrate the superiority of the novel bistable device in details the parameters set h h 0 of the bistable device satisfied with the same distance z 0 0 16 between the stable and unstable equilibrium points is chosen marked with pink line l2 in fig 8 and the corresponding potential energy surface and equivalent restoring stiffness surfaces for these parameters set under the change of heave motions are shown in fig 9 in fig 9 the axis representing the height h 0 denotes the parameter set h h 0 satisfied with the distance z 0 0 16 from the potential energy u p diagram shown in fig 9 a the potential energy barrier decreases gradually in the condition of unchanged distance z 0 with the increase in the height h 0 the above phenomenon reveals that the novel mbd can overcome the contradiction between decreasing potential barrier δ u p and enlarge distance z 0 between the stable and unstable equilibrium points of the bistable device from the systematic equivalent stiffness k e diagram in fig 9 b the equivalent stiffness k e changes rapidly near the unstable equilibrium point z 0 the value of negative stiffness decreases rapidly as the height h 0 increases actually the large potential energy barrier δ u p is induced by the negative stiffness while the amrs with reverse magnetic field directions can provide positive stiffness to offset the positive stiffness of mmrs it is worthy noticing that the stiffness of the amrs is nonlinear as shown in fig 9 c and the large stiffness values around the unstable equilibrium can offset the negative stiffness of the main magnetic rings while the small values far from the unstable equilibrium point do not affect the stable equilibrium point position similarly we selected a set of h h 0 which satisfied the condition that δ u p 0 003 marked with black line l3 in fig 8 the influence of the distance z 0 between the stable and unstable equilibrium points will be studied in the next step fig 10 shows the potential energy diagram and stiffness diagram that satisfy the condition δ u p 0 003 we can find that the distance z 0 increases with the increase of the parameter h 0 and the flat region around unstable equilibrium enlarges in the same time the effect of negative stiffness reduced near the unstable equilibrium point and its two sides basically remain unchanged from that discussion above a larger z 0 and a lower δ u p could be reached by the novel mbd 3 3 results analysis of absorption efficiency in regular wave considering the effect of the novel mbd on the efficiency of wave energy absorption for a point absorber wec the capture width ratio c w of the linear point absorber wec has been calculated firstly in the parameter space ω c shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the linear point absorber wec performs well in the resonance condition with the optimal damping c 0 25 and the resonance frequency ω 1 which is corresponding to the nature period t 4 58 s for a spherical floating body with r 5 m in other words this linear point absorber wec could show a good better performance under a relatively high frequency wave actually the main wave frequency is concentrated in 0 7 1 rad s in realistic ocean the nature frequency of a linear point absorber wec can be decreased by increasing the size of floating structure but it will induce other engineering challenges in order to illustrate the advantages of the novel mbd wec three different forms of wecs have been investigated and their capture width ratio c w curves versus wave excitation frequency are drawn in fig 12 the system damping is set as the optimal damping value c 0 25 of linear point absorber wec firstly as shown in fig 12 a with the wave amplitude a 0 2 the capture width ratio of linear point absorber wec shows a fine performance around resonance frequency ω 1 there are some obvious differences between the linear wec and other two wecs with bistable characteristics compared with linear wec these wecs with different mbds have higher capture width ratios visibly in the range 0 1 ω 0 8 and the peak frequency corresponding to the optimal capture width ratio have a clear decreasing trend from ω 1 to ω 0 78 its reason is that the equivalent stiffness of system is reduced with the function of negative stiffness provided by the mbd in comparison with the conventional mbd wec h 2 8 h 0 0 and novel mbd wec h 4 5 h 0 0 739 there is weak difference for the relative large incident wave amplitude for the fig 12 b with the wave amplitude a 0 04 the capture width ratio c w curves of the three type wecs mentioned above are totally different under the change of wave excitation frequency considering the wave energy capture ratio under the lower frequency range 0 1 ω 0 8 the novel mbd wec shows an optimal effect than the linear wec and the conventional mbd wec has a worst performance on wave energy conversion that is due to the difference of potential energy barrier for these three types of wec under a lower wave amplitude it is worthy noticing that the capture width ratio larger than 1 is overestimated because the viscous forces are not considered in this study nevertheless the performance of the novel mbd wec is superior in comparison with linear and tradition mbd wecs meanwhile the novel mbd wec has nearly same tendency as linear wec for wave energy capture ratio at higher frequency condition but the performance of conventional mbd wec is very poor and its capture width ratio is almost close to zero from the above results discussions there are two main concerned points for the novel mbd wec with reasonable parameters to be concerned about one is that it can reduce the natural frequency of the wec for the effect of negative stiffness and the frequency band is broaden for effectively enhancing the efficiency of wave energy conversion the other is that the capture property of the novel mbd wec is better than others under lower wave amplitudes and lower frequency range as shown in fig 13 we figure out some phase diagrams of the three different wecs under various conditions considering the condition with the wave amplitude a 0 2 as shown in fig 13 a the amplitude of motion for the linear wec is maximum in resonance frequency ω 1 and its capture width ratio is best at this condition as well the other two bistable wecs show the inter well oscillations between two wells at ω 0 78 with largest response amplitude than another frequency point under the wave amplitude a 0 2 notice that the fig 13 b with the lower wave amplitude a 0 04 only the novel mbd wec has inter well oscillations with large amplitude for ω 0 46 with incredible capture performance while other two wecs both carry on the intra well oscillations under small response amplitudes fig 14 shows the system potential energy u p and equivalent stiffness k e curves under the change of different wecs as illustrated in fig 12 from the system potential energy curves in fig 14 a we can see that all the two wecs have the same distance z 0 0 16 between the stable equilibrium point and unstable equilibrium point the potential energy barrier u p of the two type wecs are totally different compared with the conventional mbd wec with h 2 8 h 0 0 the potential energy barrier of the novel mbd wec with h 4 5 h 0 0 739 is obviously much lower combining with the results indicated in fig 13 b we can infer that the novel mbd wec is easy to cross the barrier for the small incident wave amplitude a 0 04 as we can see the stiffness curves in fig 14 b the stiffness of linear device is equal to hydrostatic restoring stiffness which is constant considering the equivalent stiffness k e near the stable equilibrium point of these nonlinear devices we can find that the equivalent stiffness of the novel mbd wec is k e 0 7805 while the conventional mbd wec is largest k e 1 673 which is larger than that of the linear wec thus the equivalent natural frequency for the intra well oscillations with small amplitude of the novel mbd wec is smaller than the natural frequency of the linear wec and the equivalent natural frequency of the conventional mbd wec is the largest when the two nonlinear devices have intra well oscillations under very weak wave excitations the novel mbd wec has better capture width ratio c w than that of the conventional mbd wec because the equivalent resonance frequency is much lower this phenomenon can be verified in fig 15 c from the results discussed above we can recognize that the amrs can provide nonlinear positive stiffness for the bistable mechanism it is highly effective to reduce the potential energy barrier u p under the proper parameter conditions of the novel mbd wec in order to illustrate the advantage of the novel mbd wec under the condition of lower wave excitations the capture width ratio c w contours for different wecs in the parameter space ω a are shown in fig 15 from fig 15 a the capture width ratio of the linear wec does not dependent on the wave amplitude a the reason for this is the incident wave energy and absorption energy for linear system are all proportional to the square of wave amplitude the peak frequency of the capture width ratio c w for the linear wec is always in the natural frequency in comparison with the fig 15 a and b there is a visible difference for the conventional mbd wec that the frequency band of effective wave energy capture width has been broadened to the lower frequency furthermore the capture width ratio has been enhanced in the main frequency region as well considering the conventional mbd wec and novel mbd wec shown in fig 15 b and c two capture width contours roughly have the same trends with the change of parameters space ω a for relatively large wave amplitudes the discontinuities of the capture width in the parametric space are happened which is common phenomena in nonlinear system zhang et al 2015 the response states of the buoy change on both sides of the critical point jumping point which have been revealed and explained in fig 13 however the biggest difference between the conventional mbd wec and novel mbd wec is that the latter has a higher capture width ratio c w than the former when the excitation wave amplitude a 0 12 in other words the novel mbd wec has better adaptability and stability than the conventional mbdwec under smaller wave excitation it is worth noticing that the capture width ratio c w for the novel mbd wec is also better than that of the linear wec even if the excitation wave amplitude is extremely small about a 0 02 as show in fig 15 c which can be explained by the discussion of the equivalent natural frequency in fig 14 b for the bistable wec from the discussions above in fig 1 it is important to note that the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 of the system are important for the energy absorption efficiency in the following the effects of the above two parameters on the capture width ratio c w are investigated the two index maximum wave energy capture width ratio c w m and corresponding peak frequency ω p as shown in fig 16 a are chosen to evaluate the performance of the bistable wecs the coordinate symbol h 0 in fig 16 is on behalf of the parameter group h h 0 which satisfy the condition z 0 0 16 shown by black line l3 in fig 8 fig 16 b shows that the potential energy barrier δ u p decreases with the increases in the height h 0 fig 16 c and d illustrate clearly the relationship between the maximum capture width ratio c w m and peak frequency ω p with the potential energy barrier δ u p under the change of wave amplitude fig 16 c indicates that with the decrease of the potential energy barrier δ u p corresponding with increase of the height h 0 the wec may obtain large capture width ratio c w m in the wide region of the wave excitation amplitude a in comparison with fig 16 c and d the larger capture width ratio and the lower peak frequency close to low wave frequency band can be achieved at the same time as shown in the top right region of fig 16 c and d in these two figures there is a color mutation for capture width ratio and the peak frequency under a certain wave amplitude which is the jump phenomenon caused by nonlinear effect of the bistable system younesian and alam 2017 xu et al 2014 after the study about the effect of the potential energy barrier δ u p another case of the variation of the distance z 0 between the unstable and stable equilibrium points under the same potential energy barrier δ u p 0 003 described as the pink line l2 in fig 8 which has been investigated as shown in fig 17 from fig 17 a we find that the distance z 0 increases with the increase of the height h 0 focus on the fig 17 b c the band of wave amplitudes with the prime capture width ratio c w m increases continuously with the increases of z 0 and the corresponding band of peak frequency in low frequency gets broaden sequentially as well as the wave amplitude a increases the maximum of capture width ratio c w m decreases while the band of peak frequency gets wider and the frequency value gets bigger in comparison with figs 16 and 17 it can be concluded that the impact of the potential energy barrier on the capture width ratio c w is larger than that of the distance z 0 above results are obtained under the optimum damping coefficient about the linear wec while the optimum damping coefficient may be different for the nonlinear wec fig 18 illustrates the capture width ratio c w in the parameter space ω c in comparison with the capture width ratio of the linear wec in the parameter space ω c as shown in fig 10 there are several distinct features of the novel mbd wec firstly the peak of capture width ratio of the novel mbd wec has a clear tendency to shift to lower frequency ω from 1 to 0 5 at two different wave amplitudes secondly the peak value of capture width ratio of the novel mbd wec is significantly higher than that of the linear wec however the value range of corresponding damping c is basically unchanged and mostly between 0 1 and 1 5 4 conclusions the present paper puts forward a novel mbd it can be used to improve the efficiency of energy harvesting for a point absorber wec the most important components of the bistable device are two pairs of permanent magnetic rings installed with reverse field directions one magnetic ring with same field direction provide the negative stiffness and the other rings offer the positive stiffness for the device the governing equation of heave motion for the bistable wec is established in the time domain referred to cummins equation the state space model method is used to replace the convolution integral for calculating the radiation force and then the systems of partial differential equations is solved by taking the classical 4th order runge kutta approach the capture width ratio of different types of wecs is studied in regular wave the results we can learn mainly from this paper are summarized as follows 1 the novel mbd can availably increase the efficiency of a point absorber wec under ordinary sea conditions 2 the peak frequency of capture width can be shifted to the lower frequency band which is covered by the dominant frequency band of the realistic wave spectrum 3 the novel mbd can enlarge the frequency band of the wave energy absorption at smaller wave amplitude conditions 4 in contrast with the linear system or conventional bistable system the point absorber wec with a novel mbd shows a wonderful performance on capture wave energy under the low wave excitation 5 even if the novel mbd wec has inter well oscillations under extremely weak wave excitations the performance of the nonlinear wec is still better than that of the linear wec in this study the viscous forces are not considered which may result in some unrealistic results next owing to the limitation of the linear wave theory about the assumption of the constant wetted surface all these numerical methods may overestimate the responses when large motions occur all these topics should be considered in our future works and experiment validations also should be conducted credit authorship contribution statement ru xi investigation caculation formal analysis writing original draft

20823,a novel magnetic bistable device mbd is proposed to improve the efficiency of energy harvesting of a point absorber wave energy converter wec by decreasing the potential barrier of the bistable energy absorber the novel mbd is mainly composed of two pairs of coaxial permanent magnet rings with different sizes for the permanent magnet rings one pair has the same magnetic field direction to provide negative stiffness and the other magnet rings have nonlinear positive stiffness property with a reverse magnetic field direction the nonlinear dynamic model is established by adopting the state space model approach during solving the convolution integral of radiation force the capture width ratio of the wec with the novel mbd is studied with the change of design parameters in regular wave then the effect of structural parameters for the novel mbd on the wave energy capture ratio is discussed the results indicate that using the novel mbd can significantly improve the performance of point absorber wec especially under low wave excitations in comparison with that of the wec with traditional mbd keywords wave energy point absorber efficiency bistable nonlinear response nomenclature

which promotes social development at a pace never seen before in human history but causes some severe environmental disasters such as the greenhouse effect acid rain air pollution soil contamination and so on in the same time wang et al 2011 widely known wave energy has some advantages including renewability cleanliness predictability and so on folley 2017 pérez collazo et al 2015 franzitta et al 2017 at the meantime the wave energy has natural advantages to be used in some remote areas rusu and onea 2016 wave energy is one of the largest reservoir of energy on the earth and its global potential reserve has been estimated to be in the order of 1 tw approximately equal to 1012w falnes 2007 after the oil crisis in 1970s wave energy has attracted the attention of an increasingly large number of scholars and engineers all over the world rusu 2009 many methods have been proposed to achieve wave power generation effectively several categories of wave energy converters wecs including oscillating water column wec point absorber wec over topping convertor rotating mass device attenuator and so on younesian and alam 2017 the point absorber wecs due to the feature of simplicity in manufacturing and installation have become one of the most promising wecs jahangir et al 2018 although the point absorber wecs have been investigated by many scholars theoretically and experimentally zhu et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 the typical linear point absorber wec has not been extensively commercialized due to some limitations and challenges he et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 one of the evident drawbacks is the lower efficiency of wave energy conversion di dio et al 2013 it is no doubt that the traditional linear system could have a good performance only in a relatively narrow frequency band as the excitation frequency is exceedingly close to the natural frequency of the linear device when the wave excitation frequency is slightly deviated from the natural frequency of the wec the efficiency of absorbing wave energy will reduce significantly furthermore the realistic incident waves have the characteristics of irregular wave spectrum that the dominant frequencies may change from time to time yang and towfighian 2017 thus the linear wec cannot draw energy from all frequencies equally well and will produce very much lower efficiency in complex ocean conditions in order to solve this problem for a point absorbing wec some active control technologies have been applied to enhance the efficiency of the wecs oscar et al barambones and durana 2015 proposed a sliding model control technology for a point absorber wave power generation plant and their simulation results showed that the control scheme was robust for the uncertainties in the real sea babarit et al 2004 investigated the latching control applied to a heaving wave energy device under random seas and the results indicated that it can magnify the amplitude of the motion effectively when the wave frequencies apart from the natural frequency fan et al 2016 designed a fuzzy controller to adjust the condition of a hydraulic motor to control the output energy for a point absorber wec the results revealed that the conversion efficiency of the wec can be enhanced as the output torque of the motor is controlled although some of these methods have been carried out in laboratories or even sea test ranges to validate the effectiveness of the control strategies there are still some limitations and challenges for the practical applications first of all the premise for most of the control strategies performed well is that the controller should know the predicted information of wave excitations the performance of control approach would be powerless for the observed information do not match well with the real sea nguyen and tona 2018 and then many of the control devices will consume additional absorbed energy in addition the wave energy converter with control devices could be more difficult to install and maintain which reduce the adaptability and increase the cost of the wec younesian and alam 2017 apart from above active methods to enhance the conversion efficiency nonlinear capture mechanism is one of the most promising passive strategies rijnsdorp et al 2019 harne and wang 2013 zhou et al 2017 among them the bistable mechanism is one of the most effective approaches to broaden the frequency band and enhance the efficiency of energy conversion pellegrini et al 2013 different from the mechanism of the linear systems the bistable mechanism has a feature with double well potential energy as shown in fig 1 the bistable system has two stable equilibrium points and one unstable equilibrium point there are three possible forms of motions depending on different excitation conditions the first possible motion form is an intra well oscillation with small motion amplitude shown in fig 1 a under a relatively small input amplitude of excitation force with the increase of the excitation amplitude the second form with a chaotic mixed intra and inter well oscillation occurs as shown in fig 1 b with blue dash line and the last one is an inter well oscillation under the condition of larger excitation force amplitude than the chaotic intra well oscillation in fig 1 c it is obvious that the inter well oscillations with large displacement and velocity amplitudes are what the researchers eagerly want to explore in the performance of vibration energy harvesting few researchers and experts have adopted bistable mechanisms to the point absorber wecs to further improve the capture efficiency of wave energy zhang et al zhang et al 2014 zhang and yang 2015 first applied the classical bistable device with two symmetrically oblique springs to a point absorber wec and the performances for the nonlinear wec in regular and irregular sea conditions were investigated in comparison with that of the corresponding linear wec their results showed that the snap through phenomenon of the bistable mechanism could remarkably improve the efficiency of power absorption in low frequency range using the same structural configuration todal shaug et al todalshaug et al 2016 replaced the two linear springs with two pneumatic machinery components to construct a negative stiffness machinery named as wave spring the experimental investigation for a point absorber wec with the wave spring device in irregular waves was carried out and the results showed that the wave spring bistable mechanism can increase the output power three times harne et al 2014 designed a novel bistable magnetic generator that could convert the motion at low frequency to the available energy at high frequency referencing the mechanism of the bistable devices davood et al younesian and alam 2017 designed a multi stable mechanism which consists of two oblique rigid links and two oblique linear springs via adjusting the angle of inclined springs and rigid links it can achieve in different multi stable states from the bistable to four stable their results indicated that the mechanism can significantly enhance the absorption efficiency of a point absorber wec meanwhile the width of frequency band of wave power generation would be widened although several bitable mechanisms have been applied to the energy conversion systems there are still some unsatisfactory in their performance zhou et al 2014 one of most noticeable issues is that there are many difficulties in maintaining the high energy inter well motion state under arbitrary excitation levers for the traditional bistable energy conversion systems pellegrini et al 2013 in order to enhance the energy capture efficiency by the bistable system the large distance z 0 between the stable equilibrium point and unstable equilibrium point shown in fig 1 is needed to obtain a large vibration amplitude meanwhile the threshold criteria δ u p should be properly small to be easily overcome masana and daqaq 2011 however a large number of research results indicated that there remains a conundrum about the two determining factors z 0 and δ u p which means that the threshold criteria δ u p would increase accordingly with the increase of distance z 0 shan et al 2018 therefore for the lower wave amplitude conditions there is an inherent disadvantage for the traditional bistable system that the efficiency of energy absorption could be reduced even less than that of the linear wec zhao et al 2020 because the nonlinear mechanism cannot overcome the potential barrier and be trapped in the intra well oscillations under small excitations zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 in this study a novel magnetic bistable device mbd is proposed to enhance the capture efficiency of a point absorber wec by reducing the potential barrier of the bistable absorber the novel mbd mainly consists of two pairs of permanent magnetic rings installed with reverse field direction and different sizes the magnetic rings with same field direction provide the negative stiffness and the other rings offer the positive stiffness for the device the configuration of the novel magnetic bistable device can meet the functional requirement of increasing distance between two wells and lowering potential barrier a method refer to the ref hulme 1982 has been used to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave excitation force of the spherical floating body the dynamic model of system is built and the governing equation in the time domain is established based on cummins equation cummins 1962 where the radiation force represented by convolution integral is replaced by the state space model method and then the governing equation is solved by taking the 4th order runge kutta method the statics analysis of the bistable device is carried out for diverse nonlinear parameters the capture width ratio of the novel mbd wec is studied in comparison with that of the corresponding traditional mbd and liner wecs 2 the dynamic model of a point absorber wec fig 2 shows a schematic of a point absorber wec with a mbd a power take off pto connected with a mbd by a rigid rod and a spherical floating structure with radius r in the end of the rigid rod the floating structure is moored on the sea bed by a mooring cable the origin of cartesian coordinate system coincides exactly with the center of the spherical buoy the z axis points upwards and the x axis is at undisturbed water free surface the heave motion of buoy is only considered for the study of wave energy absorption in this paper 2 1 mechanical characteristics of the novel mbd fig 3 shows the traditional mbd proposed in the ref zhang et al 2019 and the novel type from fig 3 a the traditional bistable device mainly consists of a pair of main magnetic rings mmrs with the same magnetic field direction the internal magnetic ring 5 is fixed to the rigid rod 1 through the ring flanges 4 and the out magnetic ring 6 is bound with the hoop 7 each end of the hoop 7 is connected with an end cap 3 the rigid rod 1 is restrained by the end cap 3 and two linear bearings 2 which guide the rigid rod 1 can only move in the axis direction the two ends of the rigid rod 1 are connected to the spherical floating and the linear pto respectively a pair of auxiliary magnetic rings amrs 10 11 with reverse magnetic field are added to the traditional bistable device to build a novel mbd as shown in fig 3 b the lower internal magnetic ring 10 and lower external magnetic ring 11 of the auxiliary magnets are separated by using the external back up ring 9 and internal back up ring 8 respectively a section view of the novel mbd is shown in fig 4 a the geometric parameters of the main magnetic rings and auxiliary magnetic rings are the same except for the height of the rings l is the width of the permanent magnetic ring r is the radius of the internal magnetic ring and δ is the air gap between the external and internal magnetic rings h is the height of the mmrs and h 0 is the height of the amrs fig 4 b illustrates the equilibrium characteristics of the bistable device when the inner and the outer magnetic rings are at the same height of the novel mbd the system is in the unstable equilibrium state as the rigid rod moves up or down to a certain position the negative stiffness force provided by the novel mbd could be balanced by the hydrostatic restoring force of the floating structure which is the stable states correspondingly the nonlinear force of the novel mbd at heave displacement z of the floating structure can be written as zhou et al 2018 1 f m σ 2 r m μ 2 φ z φ z h φ z h σ 2 r m μ 2 φ z φ z h 0 φ z h 0 where σ j n is the magnetic pole surface density j is the magnetic polarization vector and

proposed in this study the frequency domain method is not suitable for solving the governing equation of motion for a nonlinear wec the governing equation of a point absorber wec system based on cummins equations for heave motion in the time domain is presented as follows 3 m a z t t h z t τ z τ ⅆ τ c z t f s f m f e t where z is the displacement for the heave motion m and a denote the mass of buoy and the limiting value of the added mass for ω respectively the mass m for a hemisphere is satisfied with m 2 3 ρ π r 3 according to static equilibrium and the added mass is given by a 0 5 m more detailed description can refer to hulme 1982 the pto is simplified as a linear damper with damping coefficient c the convolution integral in the above equation represents the radiation force of the wave and the impulse response function h z t can be obtained by the radiation damping coefficient b z ω as follows taghipour et al 2008 4 h z t 0 b z ω cos ω t ⅆ ω the hydrostatic restoring force can be represented as f s k s z and the constant coefficient k s ρ g π r 2 under the assumption of small heave motion for a buoy where ρ and g are water density and the gravity acceleration respectively f m denotes the magnetic force of the novel mbd the time varying wave excitation force f e t for regular incident wave can be expressed in the following equation 5 f r t a f ω sin ω t where ω and a are the wave frequency and amplitude and f ω denotes the wave excitation force coefficient which can be represented in the following about an axisymmetric floating structure oscillating in heave direction in deep water mccormick 2003 6 f ω 2 g 3 ρ b z ω ω 3 the added mass a z ω and the radiation damping b z ω can be determined by using the method in ref hulme 1982 in which the asymptotic expressions of a floating hemisphere oscillating in deep water in the heave direction was derived 2 3 state space model method it is inconvenient and time consuming for the researcher to calculate the convolution integral directly in eq 3 for this reason the state space model method is utilized to replace the convolution integral and this approach has been identified that is almost eight times faster than solving the convolution integral directly taghipour et al 2008 considering the governing equation in eq 3 the input is the heave velocity z t and the impulse function is the kernel function h z t then the state space model is used to approximately represent the convolution integral as follows 16 x t a x t b z t y z t c x t where y z t t h z t τ z τ d τ is the radiation force due to the memory effect of the sea water in the time domain then the next work is to confirm the coefficient matrices a b and c referring to the solving method proposed by taghipour et al 2008 firstly we have calculated the hydrodynamic data of the floating structure under a series of wave frequency then the frequency domain identification method without considering the infinite frequency added mass is used in our derivation 2 4 absorption efficiency of wave energy in regular wave the expression of the average wave power absorbed by the pto due to the work of damping force can be obtained in the following expression 19 e r 1 t 0 t t t 0 c z 2 ⅆ t where t 0 is the time interval of the calculation based on the linear wave theory and considering the regular wave condition with infinite water depth then the incident wave power under the condition of per meter of wave front length can be solved by mccormick 2003 20 e 0 r 1 2 ρ g a 2 g 2 ω generally the capture width of energy absorption is widely used to evaluate the property of a wec which can be denoted by 21 c w e r e 0 r it is worthy noticing that the viscous forces and nonlinear wave forces are not considered in this study the capture width obtained in this study is overestimated 3 results and discussions 3 1 parameters and numerical model validation in this study the magnetic pole surface density is given by σ 1

for the hydrodynamic coefficients from fig 5 we can see that the fourth order identification results can agree well with the original data which can guarantee the reliability of the identification results considering the buoy system without the bistable device and pto the response of the buoy is calculated both in the frequency domain by using the original hydrodynamic coefficient and in the time domain with the state space model method replaced the results of the response amplitude frequency curves are shown in fig 6 which indicates that the nonlinear numerical model is feasible in this study 3 2 static analysis of the novel mbd in this section the static characteristics of the novel mbd are investigated and then the impact of the geometric parameters on the nonlinear characteristics is studied the potential energy u p of the resorting force f r f s f m is determined as 24 u p 0 z f r ζ ⅆ ζ 1 2 k s z 2 σ 2 r m μ 0 2 ψ z ψ z h ψ z h 2 ψ 0 ψ h ψ h σ r m μ 0 2 ψ z ψ z h 0 ψ z h 0 2 ψ

2 a 2 l δ 2 ln l δ 2 a 2 1 4 δ 2 a 2 ln δ 2 a 2 1 2 a 2 ln l δ 2 c where c is a constant and the global equivalent stiffness can be derived as 26 k e f r z k s σ 2 r m μ 2 ϕ z ϕ z h ϕ z h σ 2 r m μ 2 ϕ z ϕ z h 0 ϕ z h 0 the expression of function ϕ is as follows 27 ϕ a 2 a 2 a 2 l δ 2 1 2 ln 2 l δ 2 a 2 δ 2 a 2 l δ 4 similarly the potential energy and restoring stiffness are also nondimensionalized as follows 28 u p u p 1 2 ρgπ r 4 k e k e k s for the novel mbd the heights of the two pair of magnetic rings are the key parameters to affect the performance of the bistable wec thus the other structural parameters are chosen as the relative optimum values which were explored in our recent work zhang et al 2019 for r 0 04 l 1 δ 2 the potential energy curves of the novel mbd under different height parameters of the permanent magnetic rings is shown in fig 7 the black line denotes the potential energy curve of the linear system the red star dotted line indicates the mbd with h 4 h 0 0 45 the blue triangle and yellow circle dotted lines show the different mbds with h 5 h 0 0 45 and h 5 respectively comparing the blue triangle curve of mbd under h 5 h 0 0 45 with the yellow circle curve of mbd under h 5 after adding the amrs with h 0 0 45 on the basis of mmrs with h 5 the potential energy barrier δ u p of the novel mbd with h 5 h 0 0 45 decreased significantly while the distance z 0 between the stable equilibrium point and unstable equilibrium point remained basically unchanged comparing the blue triangle curve of mbd under h 5 h 0 0 45 with the red star curve of mbd under h 4 h 0 0 45 it is obvious that the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 both increased by the change of the height of mmrs from h 4 to h 5 the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 are the most critical factors for the bistable system combined with the discussion in fig 7 therefore the influence study of structural parameters on the bistable characteristics can be transformed into the influence research of parameters h h 0 on the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 of the bistable system in the parameter space h h 0 two contours of the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 between the stable and unstable equilibrium points are illustrated in fig 8 a and fig 8 b respectively there are three different colored lines in fig 8 in which the red line l1 represents the parameter separation line for monostable and bistable system in the upper left of the red line l1 shown with the dark blue region the potential energy barrier δ u p and the stable equilibrium point position are both equal to zero which indicates that the nonlinear wec with parameters h h 0 set in this region is a monostable system the reason for this phenomenon is that the negative stiffness provided by the bistable device is not enough to offset the positive hydrostatic restoring stiffness to the contrary the bottom right area of the red line l1 denotes the bistable parameter range with δ u p 0 and z 0 0 when we examine fig 8 a and 8 b in this bistable region carefully it is marked that the evolutions for the gradients of the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance between the stable and unstable equilibrium points are different which indicates that the desired potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 can be obtained by adjusting the parameters h h 0 to illustrate the superiority of the novel bistable device in details the parameters set h h 0 of the bistable device satisfied with the same distance z 0 0 16 between the stable and unstable equilibrium points is chosen marked with pink line l2 in fig 8 and the corresponding potential energy surface and equivalent restoring stiffness surfaces for these parameters set under the change of heave motions are shown in fig 9 in fig 9 the axis representing the height h 0 denotes the parameter set h h 0 satisfied with the distance z 0 0 16 from the potential energy u p diagram shown in fig 9 a the potential energy barrier decreases gradually in the condition of unchanged distance z 0 with the increase in the height h 0 the above phenomenon reveals that the novel mbd can overcome the contradiction between decreasing potential barrier δ u p and enlarge distance z 0 between the stable and unstable equilibrium points of the bistable device from the systematic equivalent stiffness k e diagram in fig 9 b the equivalent stiffness k e changes rapidly near the unstable equilibrium point z 0 the value of negative stiffness decreases rapidly as the height h 0 increases actually the large potential energy barrier δ u p is induced by the negative stiffness while the amrs with reverse magnetic field directions can provide positive stiffness to offset the positive stiffness of mmrs it is worthy noticing that the stiffness of the amrs is nonlinear as shown in fig 9 c and the large stiffness values around the unstable equilibrium can offset the negative stiffness of the main magnetic rings while the small values far from the unstable equilibrium point do not affect the stable equilibrium point position similarly we selected a set of h h 0 which satisfied the condition that δ u p 0 003 marked with black line l3 in fig 8 the influence of the distance z 0 between the stable and unstable equilibrium points will be studied in the next step fig 10 shows the potential energy diagram and stiffness diagram that satisfy the condition δ u p 0 003 we can find that the distance z 0 increases with the increase of the parameter h 0 and the flat region around unstable equilibrium enlarges in the same time the effect of negative stiffness reduced near the unstable equilibrium point and its two sides basically remain unchanged from that discussion above a larger z 0 and a lower δ u p could be reached by the novel mbd 3 3 results analysis of absorption efficiency in regular wave considering the effect of the novel mbd on the efficiency of wave energy absorption for a point absorber wec the capture width ratio c w of the linear point absorber wec has been calculated firstly in the parameter space ω c shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the linear point absorber wec performs well in the resonance condition with the optimal damping c 0 25 and the resonance frequency ω 1 which is corresponding to the nature period t 4 58 s for a spherical floating body with r 5 m in other words this linear point absorber wec could show a good better performance under a relatively high frequency wave actually the main wave frequency is concentrated in 0 7 1 rad s in realistic ocean the nature frequency of a linear point absorber wec can be decreased by increasing the size of floating structure but it will induce other engineering challenges in order to illustrate the advantages of the novel mbd wec three different forms of wecs have been investigated and their capture width ratio c w curves versus wave excitation frequency are drawn in fig 12 the system damping is set as the optimal damping value c 0 25 of linear point absorber wec firstly as shown in fig 12 a with the wave amplitude a 0 2 the capture width ratio of linear point absorber wec shows a fine performance around resonance frequency ω 1 there are some obvious differences between the linear wec and other two wecs with bistable characteristics compared with linear wec these wecs with different mbds have higher capture width ratios visibly in the range 0 1 ω 0 8 and the peak frequency corresponding to the optimal capture width ratio have a clear decreasing trend from ω 1 to ω 0 78 its reason is that the equivalent stiffness of system is reduced with the function of negative stiffness provided by the mbd in comparison with the conventional mbd wec h 2 8 h 0 0 and novel mbd wec h 4 5 h 0 0 739 there is weak difference for the relative large incident wave amplitude for the fig 12 b with the wave amplitude a 0 04 the capture width ratio c w curves of the three type wecs mentioned above are totally different under the change of wave excitation frequency considering the wave energy capture ratio under the lower frequency range 0 1 ω 0 8 the novel mbd wec shows an optimal effect than the linear wec and the conventional mbd wec has a worst performance on wave energy conversion that is due to the difference of potential energy barrier for these three types of wec under a lower wave amplitude it is worthy noticing that the capture width ratio larger than 1 is overestimated because the viscous forces are not considered in this study nevertheless the performance of the novel mbd wec is superior in comparison with linear and tradition mbd wecs meanwhile the novel mbd wec has nearly same tendency as linear wec for wave energy capture ratio at higher frequency condition but the performance of conventional mbd wec is very poor and its capture width ratio is almost close to zero from the above results discussions there are two main concerned points for the novel mbd wec with reasonable parameters to be concerned about one is that it can reduce the natural frequency of the wec for the effect of negative stiffness and the frequency band is broaden for effectively enhancing the efficiency of wave energy conversion the other is that the capture property of the novel mbd wec is better than others under lower wave amplitudes and lower frequency range as shown in fig 13 we figure out some phase diagrams of the three different wecs under various conditions considering the condition with the wave amplitude a 0 2 as shown in fig 13 a the amplitude of motion for the linear wec is maximum in resonance frequency ω 1 and its capture width ratio is best at this condition as well the other two bistable wecs show the inter well oscillations between two wells at ω 0 78 with largest response amplitude than another frequency point under the wave amplitude a 0 2 notice that the fig 13 b with the lower wave amplitude a 0 04 only the novel mbd wec has inter well oscillations with large amplitude for ω 0 46 with incredible capture performance while other two wecs both carry on the intra well oscillations under small response amplitudes fig 14 shows the system potential energy u p and equivalent stiffness k e curves under the change of different wecs as illustrated in fig 12 from the system potential energy curves in fig 14 a we can see that all the two wecs have the same distance z 0 0 16 between the stable equilibrium point and unstable equilibrium point the potential energy barrier u p of the two type wecs are totally different compared with the conventional mbd wec with h 2 8 h 0 0 the potential energy barrier of the novel mbd wec with h 4 5 h 0 0 739 is obviously much lower combining with the results indicated in fig 13 b we can infer that the novel mbd wec is easy to cross the barrier for the small incident wave amplitude a 0 04 as we can see the stiffness curves in fig 14 b the stiffness of linear device is equal to hydrostatic restoring stiffness which is constant considering the equivalent stiffness k e near the stable equilibrium point of these nonlinear devices we can find that the equivalent stiffness of the novel mbd wec is k e 0 7805 while the conventional mbd wec is largest k e 1 673 which is larger than that of the linear wec thus the equivalent natural frequency for the intra well oscillations with small amplitude of the novel mbd wec is smaller than the natural frequency of the linear wec and the equivalent natural frequency of the conventional mbd wec is the largest when the two nonlinear devices have intra well oscillations under very weak wave excitations the novel mbd wec has better capture width ratio c w than that of the conventional mbd wec because the equivalent resonance frequency is much lower this phenomenon can be verified in fig 15 c from the results discussed above we can recognize that the amrs can provide nonlinear positive stiffness for the bistable mechanism it is highly effective to reduce the potential energy barrier u p under the proper parameter conditions of the novel mbd wec in order to illustrate the advantage of the novel mbd wec under the condition of lower wave excitations the capture width ratio c w contours for different wecs in the parameter space ω a are shown in fig 15 from fig 15 a the capture width ratio of the linear wec does not dependent on the wave amplitude a the reason for this is the incident wave energy and absorption energy for linear system are all proportional to the square of wave amplitude the peak frequency of the capture width ratio c w for the linear wec is always in the natural frequency in comparison with the fig 15 a and b there is a visible difference for the conventional mbd wec that the frequency band of effective wave energy capture width has been broadened to the lower frequency furthermore the capture width ratio has been enhanced in the main frequency region as well considering the conventional mbd wec and novel mbd wec shown in fig 15 b and c two capture width contours roughly have the same trends with the change of parameters space ω a for relatively large wave amplitudes the discontinuities of the capture width in the parametric space are happened which is common phenomena in nonlinear system zhang et al 2015 the response states of the buoy change on both sides of the critical point jumping point which have been revealed and explained in fig 13 however the biggest difference between the conventional mbd wec and novel mbd wec is that the latter has a higher capture width ratio c w than the former when the excitation wave amplitude a 0 12 in other words the novel mbd wec has better adaptability and stability than the conventional mbdwec under smaller wave excitation it is worth noticing that the capture width ratio c w for the novel mbd wec is also better than that of the linear wec even if the excitation wave amplitude is extremely small about a 0 02 as show in fig 15 c which can be explained by the discussion of the equivalent natural frequency in fig 14 b for the bistable wec from the discussions above in fig 1 it is important to note that the potential energy barrier δ u p and the distance z 0 of the system are important for the energy absorption efficiency in the following the effects of the above two parameters on the capture width ratio c w are investigated the two index maximum wave energy capture width ratio c w m and corresponding peak frequency ω p as shown in fig 16 a are chosen to evaluate the performance of the bistable wecs the coordinate symbol h 0 in fig 16 is on behalf of the parameter group h h 0 which satisfy the condition z 0 0 16 shown by black line l3 in fig 8 fig 16 b shows that the potential energy barrier δ u p decreases with the increases in the height h 0 fig 16 c and d illustrate clearly the relationship between the maximum capture width ratio c w m and peak frequency ω p with the potential energy barrier δ u p under the change of wave amplitude fig 16 c indicates that with the decrease of the potential energy barrier δ u p corresponding with increase of the height h 0 the wec may obtain large capture width ratio c w m in the wide region of the wave excitation amplitude a in comparison with fig 16 c and d the larger capture width ratio and the lower peak frequency close to low wave frequency band can be achieved at the same time as shown in the top right region of fig 16 c and d in these two figures there is a color mutation for capture width ratio and the peak frequency under a certain wave amplitude which is the jump phenomenon caused by nonlinear effect of the bistable system younesian and alam 2017 xu et al 2014 after the study about the effect of the potential energy barrier δ u p another case of the variation of the distance z 0 between the unstable and stable equilibrium points under the same potential energy barrier δ u p 0 003 described as the pink line l2 in fig 8 which has been investigated as shown in fig 17 from fig 17 a we find that the distance z 0 increases with the increase of the height h 0 focus on the fig 17 b c the band of wave amplitudes with the prime capture width ratio c w m increases continuously with the increases of z 0 and the corresponding band of peak frequency in low frequency gets broaden sequentially as well as the wave amplitude a increases the maximum of capture width ratio c w m decreases while the band of peak frequency gets wider and the frequency value gets bigger in comparison with figs 16 and 17 it can be concluded that the impact of the potential energy barrier on the capture width ratio c w is larger than that of the distance z 0 above results are obtained under the optimum damping coefficient about the linear wec while the optimum damping coefficient may be different for the nonlinear wec fig 18 illustrates the capture width ratio c w in the parameter space ω c in comparison with the capture width ratio of the linear wec in the parameter space ω c as shown in fig 10 there are several distinct features of the novel mbd wec firstly the peak of capture width ratio of the novel mbd wec has a clear tendency to shift to lower frequency ω from 1 to 0 5 at two different wave amplitudes secondly the peak value of capture width ratio of the novel mbd wec is significantly higher than that of the linear wec however the value range of corresponding damping c is basically unchanged and mostly between 0 1 and 1 5 4 conclusions the present paper puts forward a novel mbd it can be used to improve the efficiency of energy harvesting for a point absorber wec the most important components of the bistable device are two pairs of permanent magnetic rings installed with reverse field directions one magnetic ring with same field direction provide the negative stiffness and the other rings offer the positive stiffness for the device the governing equation of heave motion for the bistable wec is established in the time domain referred to cummins equation the state space model method is used to replace the convolution integral for calculating the radiation force and then the systems of partial differential equations is solved by taking the classical 4th order runge kutta approach the capture width ratio of different types of wecs is studied in regular wave the results we can learn mainly from this paper are summarized as follows 1 the novel mbd can availably increase the efficiency of a point absorber wec under ordinary sea conditions 2 the peak frequency of capture width can be shifted to the lower frequency band which is covered by the dominant frequency band of the realistic wave spectrum 3 the novel mbd can enlarge the frequency band of the wave energy absorption at smaller wave amplitude conditions 4 in contrast with the linear system or conventional bistable system the point absorber wec with a novel mbd shows a wonderful performance on capture wave energy under the low wave excitation 5 even if the novel mbd wec has inter well oscillations under extremely weak wave excitations the performance of the nonlinear wec is still better than that of the linear wec in this study the viscous forces are not considered which may result in some unrealistic results next owing to the limitation of the linear wave theory about the assumption of the constant wetted surface all these numerical methods may overestimate the responses when large motions occur all these topics should be considered in our future works and experiment validations also should be conducted credit authorship contribution statement ru xi investigation caculation formal analysis writing original draft

20824,a numerical model containing density stratified layers of liquid oil and water in a rectangular tank is modeled to interact with a rigid porous structure in the form of a t shaped baffle under sloshing conditions the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method is used to track the evolution of the interfacial and free surface wave with the navier stokes and brinkman s equations governing the incompressible fluid flow and the flow through the porous region respectively a series of setup cases are simulated with interest in observing the interaction of the layered fluid and the interfacial wave with a porous structure the effect of the porous structure and its efficacy in damping associated sloshing waves and impact pressure on the tank walls is analyzed under various setup configurations 1 introduction sloshing is associated with the movement of a fluid having a free surface within confinement this confinement could be a partially filled liquid storage or transportation tank in open water bodies in semi closed harbors or lakes in the form of seiche action due to the formation of standing waves the study of sloshing dynamics is important to understand the associated loadings exerted on the fluid structure boundary of the confinement as in the case of tank walls containing a sloshing fluid the dynamic loadings on the tank walls can cause structural damage as well as undermine the safety conditions and stability of vessels carrying liquid cargo the study of layering in sloshing considers the fluid domain as a multiphase fluid stratified by density this enables the further understanding of scenarios wherein fluids of various densities are confined in the same tank to undergo sloshing and how these layers interact with one another experimental studies have greatly improved our understanding of sloshing kim and lee 2008 studied optimization design techniques that would reduce sloshing they used genetic algorithms to develop an optimization algorithm for the tank design parameters their study presented an optimal design for sloshing reduction fluid impact pressure due to the periodic motion of a tank was studied experimentally by song et al 2013 by corresponding the local flow velocities with the corresponding pressure they derived an impact coefficient that could be used in developing tanks to withstand a designed impact pressure model scaled tanks and the effect of the tank scale factor on sloshing were compared in the experimental study of kim et al 2012 sloshing impact pressures were measured and compared their study showed how scale factors cause slight variations in the derived results sloshing control methods for cylindrical tanks were studied experimentally by anderson et al 2001 in their study the use of dumbbell type slosh controllers was found to be more effective in wave amplitude suppression as compared to the other approaches used in their study the effect of wind induced instabilities by the use of passive dampers and their relation to energy dissipation of a sloshing liquid was studied by modi and seto 1997 their results showed that their numerical approach was able to study this system based on the shallow water equation effectively sloshing due to the collapse of a centralized water column inside a cylindrical tank was studied experimentally by vorobyev et al 2011 their study provided a benchmark analysis for accident analysis related to sloshing in especially nuclear reactors non resonant sloshing with large amplitude oscillation was studied experimentally by moo et al 2012 their study characterized the sloshing behavior into a couple of significant peculiar sloshing motions for the flow physics of non resonant sloshing a series of laboratory experiments were carried out by xue et al 2016 containing a rectangular tank on a shaker table subjected to motion by an irregular wavemaker pressure sensors and wave gauges fitted at specific positions were able to estimate the pressure

point considerations in tank design processes the slosh damping effects of deformable baffles were studied by zhang et al 2020 by coupling a smoothed finite element method and a decoupled finite particle method their study concluded that complex geometrical orientations and positions of elastic baffles proved effective in damping sloshing pressure their findings provide a valuable understanding of reducing sloshing impact pressures in engineering systems fluid structure interaction in a tank with elastic walls was studied using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method by jamalabadi 2020 the results of his study show the simplicity of the sph method for the analytical analysis of a coupled fluid system zhang et al 2019 studied the effect of floating foams in mitigating sloshing their study showed that the use of foams has an effect in reducing sloshing waves and pressure tsukamoto et al 2020 studied the effect of bottom and sidewall stiffeners in damping sloshing the results of this study provided an estimation for sloshing loads in tanks with small stiffeners studies on the effect of the shape of the tank on sloshing pressure distribution were studied by xue et al 2019 the study showed that tank shape configurations had an effect on sloshing pressures and that an optimization of the configuration of the shape can be used as a slosh damping mechanism bellezi et al 2019 did studies on perforated bulkheads for sloshing mitigation their findings showed the effectiveness of perforated bulkheads in sloshing mitigation the use of dual circular or arc

porous slat screens placed at the center of a sloshing tank altered the resonance frequency of the sloshing tank as well as dissipating energy of the fluid through the slat screen yu et al 2019 studied the effect of slat screen numbers and their configuration in optimizing sloshing mitigation their results showed that the number of slat screens does not necessarily always reduce sloshing amplitude but that the sloshing amplitude reduction is enhanced by the positioning of the slat screen in the tank xue et al 2020a numerically studied the effects of a porous material layer in mitigating sloshing in a membrane lng tank their study showed that the porous material shifted the natural frequency of the tanks and that tanks with optimized porous material layers were very effective in sloshing mitigation multiphase sloshing or layered sloshing is a relatively less studied area in sloshing related studies however some interesting research has been done in this area by a number of researchers kargbo et al 2019 did numerical investigations on the fluid structure interaction of a fixed block in a tank with a layered fluid undergoing sloshing their study highlighted the effect of the block on the interfacial wave wu 2011 studied the sloshing of an inviscid layered fluid in a rectangular tank his study showed that the stratification density had minimal effect on the natural frequencies but also discovered that new natural frequencies appeared as a result of its effect xue et al 2013 conducted a layered or multiphase sloshing experiment driven by a wavemaker their experiment compared pressure distributions on the tank walls with an in house cfd code based on the improved volume of fluid method ivof and the results matched satisfactorily la rocca et al 2005 performed a theoretical and experimental investigation on a two liquid system with a layered surface the experiment consists of two immiscible fluids oscillating in a tank whereas the mathematical model utilizes a lagrangian variational approach to the potential formulation of the fluid motion the results of the experiment and model were in good agreement an earlier study on the dynamic behaviour of a layered fluid in a rectangular tank subject to vibration was conducted by hashimoto and sudo 1985 both theoretically and experimentally their study theoretically developed a boundary chart of the wave occurrence on the free surface and interface sloshing mitigation has been a vital area of research for a host of reasons including safety and design considerations of tanks just to name a few previous studies have looked at various methods in reducing sloshing which has broadened our understanding of this concept most studies have however focused on single layered liquids interacting with porous structures and there is room for more studies looking at layered or multiphase liquids this study will look at sloshing by considering two immiscible liquids interacting with a porous t shaped baffle the approach of this study is intended to give a further understanding of how a multiphase or layered liquid interacts with a porous structure and how this impacts sloshing mitigation 2 mathematical model and numerical method 2 1 governing equation the fluid domain is governed by the incompressible navier stokes equation 1 ρ u t ρ u u p i η u u t f 2 u 0 the velocity is represented by u the pressure given by p with the fluid density represented by ρ the dynamic viscosity and the body force are given by η and f respectively with the diagonal matrix represented by i 2 2 numerical method in this study the model developed is based on the incompressible navier stokes equation and the fluid interface deformations are being tracked by the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method xue et al 2020b the fluid in the porous region is governed by brinkman s equation this model is developed using the cfd module of comsol which is based on the finite element method fem the steady laminar equations in the domain ω with non slip and zero normal stress conditions on the boundaries γ 0 and γ n respectively in the component form are 3 p u j u i j p i μ u i j u j i j i n ω u i j 0 in ω u i 0 on γ 0 p n i μ u i j u j i n j 0 on γ n a test function v i is chosen from the momentum equation in such v i 0 on γ 0 a test function z is chosen in the case of the continuity

j v j i d v 9 ω u i i z d v 0 the non slip boundary condition on γ 0 is enforced explicitly on the fem functions with an appropriate selection of the function space the zero normal stress boundary condition on γ n is implicitly enforced through the variational form p1 p1 discretization which applies separate discretization for the velocity and pressure is done using the continuous piecewise linear elements for both variables 2 2 1 boundary conditions the model consists of solid walls and a free surface the slip boundary for the navier stokes equation is 10 u n 0 where n nx ny t is the boundary normal equation 14 is applied to the walls which are modeled with slip boundary condition the normal vector is dependent on the degrees of freedom of the moving mesh hence weak constraints are used to remedy constraining forces on the fluid equations and mesh weak constraints are used to enforce the slip boundary condition without a constraint force acting on the moving mesh equations 11 λ ˆ u n λ u ˆ n for some lagrange multiplier variable λ where λ ˆ and u ˆ denote test functions the fluid is free to move in the top boundary neglecting the stress in the surrounding environment the stress continuity equation on the free surface is given by 12 p i η u t n p 0 n where p 0 is the surrounding constant pressure and η is the viscosity of the fluid without loss of generality p 0 0 for this model 2 2 2 boundary condition for mesh to follow the fluid motion in relation to the mesh motion it is conventional in most cases to couple the mesh motion to the fluid motion normal to the surface the coupling is not done in the tangential direction as it will soon lead the solution to non convergence due to excessive deformation of the mesh the boundary condition for the mesh on the free surface is thus given by 13 x t y t t n u n where n is the boundary normal to x t y t t the velocity mesh for this boundary condition with the weak constraints activated the moving mesh interface adds the weak expression 14 λ ˆ x t y t t u λ x ˆ y ˆ y n this is added to ensure that there are no constraint forces acting on the fluid equations the moving mesh is not constrained in the tangential direction on the sidewall at the side to enable it to follow the motion of the fluid here again λ denotes some lagrange multiplier variable not the same as before and x ˆ y ˆ and λ ˆ denote test functions 2 2 3 free surface and interfacial tracking method the free and interfacial surface boundaries of the computational domain are moving and deformed with time as a result of the motion and physical parameters of the computational domain the motion of these surfaces is tracked by a deformed moving mesh which moves in conformity with the deformation computation domain with a new mesh being generated for each configuration of the boundaries this technique of movement which is also referred to as the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is used to track the free and interfacial surface of this model consider a mesh at time tn the velocity field is computed for the time tn 1 on this same mesh the new free and interfacial surface is then computed with the lagrangian formula 15 x n 1 x n u δ t the partial differential equation governing the displacement field of the mesh is given by 16 d i v σ 0 the cauchy stress tensor is σ the mass of the fluid is considered in the domain and as such the mesh is considered incompressible we consider a linear elasticity model given by the constitutive relation 17 σ c ε the constitutive matrix c is element dependent the constitutive matrix elements are also inversely proportional to the element size in order to solve the mesh equation equation 15 for free surface boundary conditions it is assumed that no fluid particle can cross the free surface this condition is expressed by setting the normal mesh velocity at the free surface equal to the normal fluid velocity 18 v v m e s h n 0 the fluid velocity is given by v is and n is the unit normal vector 3 model verification and validation 3 1 mesh convergence analysis mesh analysis was conducted using three different mesh parameters in the model as described in table 1 the tank motion was governed by 19 x t a c o s ω t where a 0 01m and ω 7 57 rad s are the excitation amplitude and frequency respectively the normal mesh was compared to both coarse and fine meshes as can be seen plotted in fig 2 from the comparison it is seen that the coarse mesh has a large divergence from the normal mesh with the divergence of the fine mesh to the normal mesh being relatively smaller the normal mesh was hence observed to have a better convergence with the fine mesh results and in order to save computational cost and still maintain a high degree of accuracy the normal mesh was used in this study 3 2 layered sloshing in a tank an experimental setup of a layered fluid in a tank is set up on a shaker table as described in fig 1 which can be also found in our previous work xue et al 2020b the length of the tank l 0 57m wave probes and pressure sensors are attached to record the wave displacement and dynamic pressure exerted on the tank walls respectively the layered fluid in the tank consists of oil and water referred to as fluid 1 and fluid 2 respectively the densities of oil and water in the experiment are densities ρ 1 846 2 k g m 3 and ρ 2 1000 k g m 3 respectively with heights of oil and water being h ρ 1 0 05 m and h ρ 2 0 1 m respectively the table s motion function is given by equation 16 the motion amplitude and frequency of the shaker table are a 0 01 m and ω 4 24 and ω 7 57 r a d s respectively time series plots of the interfacial wave and dynamic pressure on the tank walls between the experimental case and the numerical model are compared as is seen fig 3 and fig 4 for the interfacial wave and dynamic pressure respectively screenshots of the sloshing tank were also compared for the experimental and numerical cases as is seen in fig 5 the results were in good agreement 3 3 sloshing interaction with a porous structure it is considered that a baffled tank with baffle porosity of ϕ 0 represented a solid or non porous baffle in a tank a baffled tank with a baffle of porosity ϕ 1 represented a tank without a baffle a tank of length l 1m fill level h 1m with baffle positioned at b 0 1m and baffle length of 0 3m is considered as shown in fig 6 the model was in this way tested for maximum and minimum values of porosity the model was contrasted with results from the investigation of kumar and sinhamahapatra 2013 the tank arrangement is as presented in fig 6 the movement of the tank is given by u u 0 cos ω t with amplitude and frequency of 0 001m and 5 57 rad s respectively the results of the comparison between present numerical results and those of kumar and sinhamahapatra 2013 are as presented in fig 7 and fig 8 for different porosity values they were in acceptable agreement 4 sloshing tank with a porous t shaped baffle 4 1 tank setup the setup is as shown in fig 9 it consists of a rectangular tank of length l with layered fluids of water which is fluid 1 and oil which is fluid 2 of heights h1 and h2 respectively the tank is rotated by a sinusoidal pitching excitation the maximum rotation of the pitching of the tank is given as θ 4 with axis of rotation at the bottom center of the tank as shown in fig 9 a porous t shaped baffle is rigidly fixed at the bottom of the tank along the axis of rotation the height and span of the t shaped baffle are as described in table 2 for the three case studies the porous t shaped baffle has material properties of the porosity ratio ϕ 0 4 and permeability k 1e 7m2 wave probes labeled probe 2 and probe 3 are attached at the right and left tank walls respectively with wave probe 1 attached along the center of the tank pressure sensors p1 p2 and p3 are attached along the left tank wall at positions shown in fig 9 case studies were considered with porous baffle parameters as described in table 2 the height of the fluids in the tank being h1 0 05m and h2 0 25m were constant for all cases the frequency range of the study was 0 2 hz 1 2 hz 4 2 wave and pressure frequency response of sloshing interaction with a t shaped porous baffle frequency response analysis was conducted to observe the maximum response over a frequency range of 0 2 hz 1 2 hz the porous t shaped baffle setups as described in table 2 were studied over the frequency range from the frequency response of the free surface and interfacial layer shown in fig 10 it is seen that the span of the porous t shaped baffle lt affected the maximum and interfacial layer height values maximum values are seen in the absence of a porous baffle as is seen in the case of t000 at lower frequencies it is observed that the maximum free surface wave height varied in value for all cases as can be seen in fig 10 and the differences in maximum wave height value for t000 t015 t023 and t046 increased as the excitation frequency increased this showed that the porous t shaped baffle has a more significant effect for higher excitation frequencies the porous t shaped baffle of case t046 is seen to have the highest damping feature for the free surface waves as well as a good damping output for the interfacial wave the longer span of the t shaped baffle lt thus improved the sloshing damping capabilities as can be seen in fig 10 for the interfacial wave maximum heights it is seen that the presence of the t shaped baffle was effective in damping the maximum wave height especially for higher excitation frequencies as can also be seen in fig 10 it is seen that at higher frequencies the t shaped baffles proved more effective in damping the dynamic pressure recorded at probes p1 p2 and p3 as is seen in fig 11 and table 3 table 4 table 5 and table 6 furthermore the maximum wave and dynamic pressure values at various frequencies can more clearly be observed for maximum wave and dynamic pressure of cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 respectively from table 3 table 4 table 5 and table 6 it can be observed that the free surface wave displacement was higher than the interfacial wave displacement at the same excitation frequency for all cases the case with porous baffle which is t015 t023 t046 can also be seen to damp the maximum dynamic pressure when compared to case t000 where a porous baffle is absent the dynamic pressure exerted at p1 and p2 also varied it is mostly observed that at p1the dynamic pressure was greater than that recorded at p2 for the cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 this also showed that even though the porous t shaped baffle was able to damp the dynamic pressure the position of the pressure sensor also determined the amount of dynamic pressure exerted at that point it is seen that pressure sensors closer to the surface record higher dynamic pressure as wave and dynamic sloshing activity of the fluid is greater closest to the free surface 4 3 effect of the size of t shaped porous baffle on wave time series and spectral density wave time series of the free surface and interfacial wave were compared for cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 as presented fig 12 and fig 14 represent free surface waves for excitation frequencies of 0 7hz and 1 1hz respectively whereas fig 13 and fig 15 represent the interfacial wave time series at 0 7hz and 1 1hz respectively for the free surface it is seen that at the center of the tank the wave oscillation is minimal with smaller wave displacements from the free surface as recorded by probe 1 greater wave displacements are observed at probe 2 and probe 3 at the right and left tank walls respectively this can be observed in figs 12 and 13 it is observed that at a higher frequency the porous t shaped baffle is more effective in damping sloshing waves of the free surface this can be seen in fig 14 especially at probe 2 and probe 3 at an excitation frequency of 1 1hz at a lower excitation frequency of 0 7hz as is shown in fig 12 the porous t shaped baffle was comparatively less effective in damping sloshing waves this further shows that at higher frequencies the porous t shaped baffle proved to be more effective in damping sloshing at the free surface it is observed in fig 14 that at the center of the tank as recorded by probe 1 the free surface wave for case t000 had a relatively larger displacement as compared to case t015 t023 and t046 the crest however was similar for all cases this showed that at the center of the tank the presence of the porous baffles damped the height of the trough of the free surface wave at the center of the tank as is seen in fig 14 as recorded by probe 1 for the interfacial layer at an excitation frequency of 0 7hz as seen in fig 13 it is seen that at the center of the tank at probe 1 the case of t015 the interfacial wave is observed to have a comparatively higher crest height as compared to the other cases whereas the case t000 had a comparatively higher through height the configuration of the porous t shaped baffle and its properties could be attributed to these different characteristics of the interfacial wave at the center of the tank at a higher excitation frequency of 1 1hz in fig 14 it is seen at the center of the tank at probe 1 that the interfacial wave for case t015 had a very large wave height compared to the other cases t010 t023 and t046 it is thus seen that larger frequencies created an interfacial wave with a larger through in case t015 this could be due to the fact that the size of the baffle for t015 altered the natural frequency of the tank and brought it closer to the excitation frequency the porous t shaped baffle is thus seen to damp the interfacial wave height at the center of the tank for cases t023 and t046 the interfacial wave as recorded at the tank walls by probe 2 and probe 3 showed that the t shaped baffles acted in damping the interfacial wave height at the tank walls especially for higher excitation frequency values as can be seen in fig 15 where the excitation frequency is 1 1hz 4 4 spectral analysis of interfacial wave time series spectral analysis was conducted using the time series of the interfacial wave at probe 2 for cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 in fig 16 the fft spectral analysis shows that the spectral profile for the case without a t shaped baffle for case t000 had two significant peak frequencies of high amplitude the significant peak frequencies observed were 0 86hz and 1 10hz for both free surface and interfacial layer for case t000 as is seen in fig 16 on the other hand for cases t015 t023 and t046 the only significant peak frequencies are observed at 1 1hz the peak frequency of 1 1hz seen in fig 16 also coincided with the excitation frequency which is also 1 1hz it is also seen that even though a 1 1hz peak frequency occurred in t000 t015 t023 and t046 the amplitude is slightly being reduced as the ht or span of the t shaped porous baffle is increased thus case t046 is seen to have a slightly smaller amplitude at the 1 1hz peak frequency in comparison to the other cases as is seen in fig 16 it is also seen in fig 16 that the amplitude of the peak frequency of 1 1hz was slightly higher for the free surface as compared to the interfacial layer wavelet analysis of the time series of the interfacial wave for cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 are presented for excitation frequencies of 1 1hz and 0 7hz respectively in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively the wavelet analysis enabled us to see the frequency response as a function of time this enables the comparison of how the porous baffle impacted the frequency time domain of the interfacial layer for cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 in fig 17 the wavelet analysis shows that for case t000 near the regions closer to the excitation frequency circular high response frequency fields are seen in the plot this shows that the response frequency oscillates from higher to lower frequency values with a high frequency response in the red color circular regions depicting a high frequency response according to the color key of fig 17 this is observed for both free surface and interfacial layer as is seen in fig 17 for case t000 and is seen also in case t000 in fig 18 however in fig 18 a wave like high frequency response layer is seen for case t00 as compared to circular high frequency response as is the case in fig 18 the wavelet response is thus observed to be dependent on the excitation frequency the wavelet for the cases t015 t023 and t046 were seen to have similar plots as can be seen in figs 17 and 18 and the wavelet results showed a different pattern as compared to case t000 this also showed that the presence of the porous t shaped baffle impacted the frequency as a function of time 4 5 effect of t shaped porous baffle on fluid velocity streamline and vorticity profile to visualize the interaction of the layered fluid with a t shaped baffle screenshots are presented for various time frames to compare the effect of a non porous t shaped baffle with a porous t shaped baffle the case setup used is that of t0046 comparisons were carried out for the velocity field the streamline and the vorticity field as is seen in fig 19 fig 20 and fig 21 respectively the velocity screenshots as seen in fig 19 shows that for the porous baffle the fluid velocity is high under the t shape of the baffle as the fluid passes through the porous material of the baffle whereas on the other hand for the non porous baffle the fluid velocity under the t shape of the baffle is low since the fluid does not pass through the non porous baffle the baffle serves as a solid wall and the velocity of the fluid in this region is markedly reduced as can be seen in fig 19 it is also observed that the area between the t shape of the baffle and the free surface has a higher fluid velocity for both porous and non porous t baffled cases the fluid velocity distribution is thus seen to be higher around the porous t shaped baffle in comparison to the non porous t shaped baffle as can be seen in fig 19 the streamline snapshots presented in fig 20 show the flow path of the fluid particles it is seen that the flow path of the fluid particles is different for the porous t shaped baffle when compared to a non porous t shaped baffle as is seen in the screenshots in fig 20 the fluid path is not blocked by the non porous baffle as the fluid is able to pass through it as the fluid sloshes on the other hand the non porous t shaped baffle acts as a barrier to the flow of the fluid this barrier thus causes the fluid to create a circular or curved path under the t shaped span of the porous baffle and in some cases created fluid paths that looked like vortices as can be seen in fig 20 and more so at 29 6 s this also shows that the non porous baffle creates a turbulent flow as it damps the fluid from sloshing the porous baffle on the other hand serves in damping the fluid without creating an excessively turbulent flow the porous baffle can thus be used as a mechanism for damping fluid sloshing and still not create too much turbulence in the fluid screenshots of the vorticity magnitude for porous and non porous t shaped baffles are shown in fig 21 it is seen that there is higher vorticity around the t shaped span or vertical section of the baffle for both porous and non porous cases the presence of the t shaped baffle thus created high vorticity magnitudes in regions close to the vertical section or span of the baffle for both porous and non porous cases there is also a slightly higher vorticity magnitude on the vertical section of the porous t shaped baffle which is visibly absent for the non porous case as is seen in the screenshots of fig 21 this showed that the porous material was also responsible for creating more vorticity in the flowing fluid 5 conclusion a numerical model was set up to study single and layered sloshing wave interaction with porous structures the porous t shaped baffle is seen to interact with the fluid by creating some turbulence and high velocity field patterns which may be associated with energy dissipation in the system and hence slosh damping free surface wave displacement was found to be higher than the interfacial wave displacement at the same excitation frequency with dynamic pressure on the tank walls being higher at pressure sensors closer to the free surface the porous t shaped baffle was found to be effective in damping sloshing with an increased damping ability observed at higher excitation frequencies as well as effective slosh damping with the reduced turbulent fluid flow as compared to non porous t shaped baffle cases fluid flow was relatively more turbulent due to interaction with the solid baffle in the non porous t shaped baffle and less turbulent when considering a porous t shaped baffle the porous t shaped baffle has a lesser effect in altering the natural frequency of the fluid tank setup as compared to a solid t shaped baffle fluid velocity observed under the span of the porous t shaped baffle was higher in comparison to the non porous t shaped baffle the study of the

20824,a numerical model containing density stratified layers of liquid oil and water in a rectangular tank is modeled to interact with a rigid porous structure in the form of a t shaped baffle under sloshing conditions the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method is used to track the evolution of the interfacial and free surface wave with the navier stokes and brinkman s equations governing the incompressible fluid flow and the flow through the porous region respectively a series of setup cases are simulated with interest in observing the interaction of the layered fluid and the interfacial wave with a porous structure the effect of the porous structure and its efficacy in damping associated sloshing waves and impact pressure on the tank walls is analyzed under various setup configurations 1 introduction sloshing is associated with the movement of a fluid having a free surface within confinement this confinement could be a partially filled liquid storage or transportation tank in open water bodies in semi closed harbors or lakes in the form of seiche action due to the formation of standing waves the study of sloshing dynamics is important to understand the associated loadings exerted on the fluid structure boundary of the confinement as in the case of tank walls containing a sloshing fluid the dynamic loadings on the tank walls can cause structural damage as well as undermine the safety conditions and stability of vessels carrying liquid cargo the study of layering in sloshing considers the fluid domain as a multiphase fluid stratified by density this enables the further understanding of scenarios wherein fluids of various densities are confined in the same tank to undergo sloshing and how these layers interact with one another experimental studies have greatly improved our understanding of sloshing kim and lee 2008 studied optimization design techniques that would reduce sloshing they used genetic algorithms to develop an optimization algorithm for the tank design parameters their study presented an optimal design for sloshing reduction fluid impact pressure due to the periodic motion of a tank was studied experimentally by song et al 2013 by corresponding the local flow velocities with the corresponding pressure they derived an impact coefficient that could be used in developing tanks to withstand a designed impact pressure model scaled tanks and the effect of the tank scale factor on sloshing were compared in the experimental study of kim et al 2012 sloshing impact pressures were measured and compared their study showed how scale factors cause slight variations in the derived results sloshing control methods for cylindrical tanks were studied experimentally by anderson et al 2001 in their study the use of dumbbell type slosh controllers was found to be more effective in wave amplitude suppression as compared to the other approaches used in their study the effect of wind induced instabilities by the use of passive dampers and their relation to energy dissipation of a sloshing liquid was studied by modi and seto 1997 their results showed that their numerical approach was able to study this system based on the shallow water equation effectively sloshing due to the collapse of a centralized water column inside a cylindrical tank was studied experimentally by vorobyev et al 2011 their study provided a benchmark analysis for accident analysis related to sloshing in especially nuclear reactors non resonant sloshing with large amplitude oscillation was studied experimentally by moo et al 2012 their study characterized the sloshing behavior into a couple of significant peculiar sloshing motions for the flow physics of non resonant sloshing a series of laboratory experiments were carried out by xue et al 2016 containing a rectangular tank on a shaker table subjected to motion by an irregular wavemaker pressure sensors and wave gauges fitted at specific positions were able to estimate the pressure distribution on the tank walls as well as the free surface displacement for various excitation frequencies of the shaker table their results showed that an upper mounted vertical baffle in the tank was an effective tool in mitigating sloshing effects an experimental setup was developed by zheng et al 2013 to study sloshing of a fluid in a rectangular tank subjected to irregular excitation jonswap spectrum by the use of an irregular wavemaker their study concluded on the effectiveness of baffles in damping sloshing magnitude for both dynamic pressure and free surface elevation analytical solutions for studying sloshing in tanks were developed and utilized by faltinsen and timokha 2012 in approximating the natural sloshing modes for spherical shaped tanks their method satisfied the laplace equation and the boundary conditions on the wetted tank surface and satisfactorily estimated natural sloshing nodes for spherical tanks a method based on the linearized potential theory was developed to study three dimensional sloshing by hasheminejad and soleimani 2017 their results concluded that the rate of change of sloshing frequency with the fill depth progressively increased with mode number particularly in tanks with near empty conditions various studies have looked at sloshing mitigation and methods of improving our understanding of sloshing behavior qin et al 2019 in their study considered hydroelasticity in the structural response in sloshing tanks with baffles their work derived structural responses of sloshing tanks which could be helpful for safety point considerations in tank design processes the slosh damping effects of deformable baffles were studied by zhang et al 2020 by coupling a smoothed finite element method and a decoupled finite particle method their study concluded that complex geometrical orientations and positions of elastic baffles proved effective in damping sloshing pressure their findings provide a valuable understanding of reducing sloshing impact pressures in engineering systems fluid structure interaction in a tank with elastic walls was studied using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method by jamalabadi 2020 the results of his study show the simplicity of the sph method for the analytical analysis of a coupled fluid system zhang et al 2019 studied the effect of floating foams in mitigating sloshing their study showed that the use of foams has an effect in reducing sloshing waves and pressure tsukamoto et al 2020 studied the effect of bottom and sidewall stiffeners in damping sloshing the results of this study provided an estimation for sloshing loads in tanks with small stiffeners studies on the effect of the shape of the tank on sloshing pressure distribution were studied by xue et al 2019 the study showed that tank shape configurations had an effect on sloshing pressures and that an optimization of the configuration of the shape can be used as a slosh damping mechanism bellezi et al 2019 did studies on perforated bulkheads for sloshing mitigation their findings showed the effectiveness of perforated bulkheads in sloshing mitigation the use of dual circular or arc shaped porous structures in cylindrical tanks for slosh mitigation was studied by ye et al 2018 using a semi analytical solution with the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem the model s effectiveness in studying key sloshing parameters was presented the effect of a porous screen placed at the center of a tank for sloshing control was studied by poguluri and cho 2019 the local free surface effects of the screen on the fluid were analyzed the presence of the screen is found to shift the sloshing tank s natural period slightly and further showed that slat screens if designed properly can effectively reduce sloshing an experimental study was conducted by xue et al 2017 to compare the effect of various baffle configurations in damping sloshing pressures on tank walls for the different baffle configurations used in their study it was observed that the perforated vertical baffle proved effective in damping sloshing impact pressure the effect of horizontal porous baffles on slosh mitigation was studied experimentally by cho et al 2017 the porous baffles were found to be effective in damping violent resonant sloshing poguluri and cho 2020 in their study observed that porous slat screens placed at the center of a sloshing tank altered the resonance frequency of the sloshing tank as well as dissipating energy of the fluid through the slat screen yu et al 2019 studied the effect of slat screen numbers and their configuration in optimizing sloshing mitigation their results showed that the number of slat screens does not necessarily always reduce sloshing amplitude but that the sloshing amplitude reduction is enhanced by the positioning of the slat screen in the tank xue et al 2020a numerically studied the effects of a porous material layer in mitigating sloshing in a membrane lng tank their study showed that the porous material shifted the natural frequency of the tanks and that tanks with optimized porous material layers were very effective in sloshing mitigation multiphase sloshing or layered sloshing is a relatively less studied area in sloshing related studies however some interesting research has been done in this area by a number of researchers kargbo et al 2019 did numerical investigations on the fluid structure interaction of a fixed block in a tank with a layered fluid undergoing sloshing their study highlighted the effect of the block on the interfacial wave wu 2011 studied the sloshing of an inviscid layered fluid in a rectangular tank his study showed that the stratification density had minimal effect on the natural frequencies but also discovered that new natural frequencies appeared as a result of its effect xue et al 2013 conducted a layered or multiphase sloshing experiment driven by a wavemaker their experiment compared pressure distributions on the tank walls with an in house cfd code based on the improved volume of fluid method ivof and the results matched satisfactorily la rocca et al 2005 performed a theoretical and experimental investigation on a two liquid system with a layered surface the experiment consists of two immiscible fluids oscillating in a tank whereas the mathematical model utilizes a lagrangian variational approach to the potential formulation of the fluid motion the results of the experiment and model were in good agreement an earlier study on the dynamic behaviour of a layered fluid in a rectangular tank subject to vibration was conducted by hashimoto and sudo 1985 both theoretically and experimentally their study theoretically developed a boundary chart of the wave occurrence on the free surface and interface sloshing mitigation has been a vital area of research for a host of reasons including safety and design considerations of tanks just to name a few previous studies have looked at various methods in reducing sloshing which has broadened our understanding of this concept most studies have however focused on single layered liquids interacting with porous structures and there is room for more studies looking at layered or multiphase liquids this study will look at sloshing by considering two immiscible liquids interacting with a porous t shaped baffle the approach of this study is intended to give a further understanding of how a multiphase or layered liquid interacts with a porous structure and how this impacts sloshing mitigation 2 mathematical model and numerical method 2 1 governing equation the fluid domain is governed by the incompressible navier stokes equation 1 ρ u t ρ u u p i η u u t f 2 u 0 the velocity is represented by u the pressure given by p with the fluid density represented by ρ the dynamic viscosity and the body force are given by η and f respectively with the diagonal matrix represented by i 2 2 numerical method in this study the model developed is based on the incompressible navier stokes equation and the fluid interface deformations are being tracked by the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method xue et al 2020b the fluid in the porous region is governed by brinkman s equation this model is developed using the cfd module of comsol which is based on the finite element method fem the steady laminar equations in the domain ω with non slip and zero normal stress conditions on the boundaries γ 0 and γ n respectively in the component form are 3 p u j u i j p i μ u i j u j i j i n ω u

j v j i d v 9 ω u i i z d v 0 the non slip boundary condition on γ 0 is enforced explicitly on the fem functions with an appropriate selection of the function space the zero normal stress boundary condition on γ n is implicitly enforced through the variational form p1 p1 discretization which applies separate discretization for the velocity and pressure is done using the continuous piecewise linear elements for both variables 2 2 1 boundary conditions the model consists of solid walls and a free surface the slip boundary for the navier stokes equation is 10 u n 0 where n nx ny t is the boundary normal equation 14 is applied to the walls which are modeled with slip boundary condition the normal vector is dependent on the degrees of freedom of the moving mesh hence weak constraints are used to remedy constraining forces on the fluid equations and mesh weak constraints are used to enforce the slip boundary condition without a constraint force acting on the moving mesh equations 11 λ ˆ u n λ u ˆ n for some lagrange multiplier variable λ where λ ˆ and u ˆ denote test functions the fluid is free to move in the top boundary neglecting the stress in the surrounding environment the stress continuity equation on the free surface is given by 12 p i η u t n p 0 n where p 0 is the surrounding constant pressure and η is the viscosity of the fluid without loss of generality p 0 0 for this model 2 2 2 boundary condition for mesh to follow the fluid motion in relation to the mesh motion it is conventional in most cases to couple the mesh motion to the fluid motion normal to the surface the coupling is not done in the tangential direction as it will soon lead the solution to non convergence due to excessive deformation of the mesh the boundary condition for the mesh on the free surface is thus given by 13 x t y t t n u n where n is the boundary normal to x t y t t the velocity mesh for this boundary condition with the weak constraints activated the moving mesh interface adds the weak expression 14 λ ˆ x t y t t u λ x ˆ y ˆ y n this is added to ensure that there are no constraint forces acting on the fluid equations the moving mesh is not constrained in the tangential direction on the sidewall at the side to enable it to follow the motion of the fluid here again λ denotes some lagrange multiplier variable not the same as before and x ˆ y ˆ and λ ˆ denote test functions 2 2 3 free surface and interfacial tracking method the free and interfacial surface boundaries of the computational domain are moving and deformed with time as a result of the motion and physical parameters of the computational domain the motion of these surfaces is tracked by a deformed moving mesh which moves in conformity with the deformation computation domain with a new mesh being generated for each configuration of the boundaries this technique of movement which is also referred to as the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is used to track the free and interfacial surface of this model consider a mesh at time tn the velocity field is computed for the time tn 1 on this same mesh the new free and interfacial surface is then computed with the lagrangian formula 15 x n 1 x n u δ t the partial differential equation governing the displacement field of the mesh is given by 16 d i v σ 0 the cauchy stress tensor is σ the mass of the fluid is considered in the domain and as such the mesh is considered incompressible we consider a linear elasticity model given by the constitutive relation 17 σ c ε the constitutive matrix c is element dependent the constitutive matrix elements are also inversely proportional to the element size in order to solve the mesh equation equation 15 for free surface boundary conditions it is assumed that no fluid particle can cross the free surface this condition is expressed by setting the normal mesh velocity at the free surface equal to the normal fluid velocity 18 v v m e s h n 0 the fluid velocity is given by v is and n is the unit normal vector 3 model verification and validation 3 1 mesh convergence analysis mesh analysis was conducted using three different mesh parameters in the model as described in table 1 the tank motion was governed by 19 x t a c o s ω t where a 0 01m and ω 7 57 rad s are the excitation amplitude and frequency respectively the normal mesh was compared to both coarse and fine meshes as can be seen plotted in fig 2 from the comparison it is seen that the coarse mesh has a large divergence from the normal mesh with the divergence of the fine mesh to the normal mesh being relatively smaller the normal mesh was hence observed to have a better convergence with the fine mesh results and in order to save computational cost and still maintain a high degree of accuracy the normal mesh was used in this study 3 2 layered sloshing in a tank an experimental setup of a layered fluid in a tank is set up on a shaker table as described in fig 1 which can be also found in our previous work xue et al 2020b the length of the tank l 0 57m wave probes and pressure sensors are attached to record the wave displacement and dynamic pressure exerted on the tank walls respectively the layered fluid in the tank consists of oil and water referred to as fluid 1 and fluid 2 respectively the densities of oil and water in the experiment are densities ρ 1 846 2 k g m 3 and ρ 2 1000 k g m 3 respectively with heights of oil and water being h ρ 1 0 05 m and h ρ 2 0 1 m respectively the table s motion function is given by equation 16 the motion amplitude and frequency of the shaker table are a 0 01 m and ω 4 24 and ω 7 57 r a d s respectively time series plots of the interfacial wave and dynamic pressure on the tank walls between the experimental case and the numerical model are compared as is seen fig 3 and fig 4 for the interfacial wave and dynamic pressure respectively screenshots of the sloshing tank were also compared for the experimental and numerical cases as is seen in fig 5 the results were in good agreement 3 3 sloshing interaction with a porous structure it is considered that a baffled tank with baffle porosity of ϕ 0 represented a solid or non porous baffle in a tank a baffled tank with a baffle of porosity ϕ 1 represented a tank without a baffle a tank of length l 1m fill level h 1m with baffle positioned at b 0 1m and baffle length of 0 3m is considered as shown in fig 6 the model was in this way tested for maximum and minimum values of porosity the model was contrasted with results from the investigation of kumar and sinhamahapatra 2013 the tank arrangement is as presented in fig 6 the movement of the tank is given by u u 0 cos ω t with amplitude and frequency of 0 001m and 5 57 rad s respectively the results of the comparison between present numerical results and those of kumar and sinhamahapatra 2013 are as presented in fig 7 and fig 8 for different porosity values they were in acceptable agreement 4 sloshing tank with a porous t shaped baffle 4 1 tank setup the setup is as shown in fig 9 it consists of a rectangular tank of length l with layered fluids of water which is fluid 1 and oil which is fluid 2 of heights h1 and h2 respectively the tank is rotated by a sinusoidal pitching excitation the maximum rotation of the pitching of the tank is given as θ 4 with axis of rotation at the bottom center of the tank as shown in fig 9 a porous t shaped baffle is rigidly fixed at the bottom of the tank along the axis of rotation the height and span of the t shaped baffle are as described in table 2 for the three case studies the porous t shaped baffle has material properties of the porosity ratio ϕ 0 4 and permeability k 1e 7m2 wave probes labeled probe 2 and probe 3 are attached at the right and left tank walls respectively with wave probe 1 attached along the center of the tank pressure sensors p1 p2 and p3 are attached along the left tank wall at positions shown in fig 9 case studies were considered with porous baffle parameters as described in table 2 the height of the fluids in the tank being h1 0 05m and h2 0 25m were constant for all cases the frequency range of the study was 0 2 hz 1 2 hz 4 2 wave and pressure frequency response of sloshing interaction with a t shaped porous baffle frequency response analysis was conducted to observe the maximum response over a frequency range of 0 2 hz 1 2 hz the porous t shaped baffle setups as described in table 2 were studied over the frequency range from the frequency response of the free surface and interfacial layer shown in fig 10 it is seen that the span of the porous t shaped baffle lt affected the maximum and interfacial layer height values maximum values are seen in the absence of a porous baffle as is seen in the case of t000 at lower frequencies it is observed that the maximum free surface wave height varied in value for all cases as can be seen in fig 10 and the differences in maximum wave height value for t000 t015 t023 and t046 increased as the excitation frequency increased this showed that the porous t shaped baffle has a more significant effect for higher excitation frequencies the porous t shaped baffle of case t046 is seen to have the highest damping feature for the free surface waves as well as a good damping output for the interfacial wave the longer span of the t shaped baffle lt thus improved the sloshing damping capabilities as can be seen in fig 10 for the interfacial wave maximum heights it is seen that the presence of the t shaped baffle was effective in damping the maximum wave height especially for higher excitation frequencies as can also be seen in fig 10 it is seen that at higher frequencies the t shaped baffles proved more effective in damping the dynamic pressure recorded at probes p1 p2 and p3 as is seen in fig 11 and table 3 table 4 table 5 and table 6 furthermore the maximum wave and dynamic pressure values at various frequencies can more clearly be observed for maximum wave and dynamic pressure of cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 respectively from table 3 table 4 table 5 and table 6 it can be observed that the free surface wave displacement was higher than the interfacial wave displacement at the same excitation frequency for all cases the case with porous baffle which is t015 t023 t046 can also be seen to damp the maximum dynamic pressure when compared to case t000 where a porous baffle is absent the dynamic pressure exerted at p1 and p2 also varied it is mostly observed that at p1the dynamic pressure was greater than that recorded at p2 for the cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 this also showed that even though the porous t shaped baffle was able to damp the dynamic pressure the position of the pressure sensor also determined the amount of dynamic pressure exerted at that point it is seen that pressure sensors closer to the surface record higher dynamic pressure as wave and dynamic sloshing activity of the fluid is greater closest to the free surface 4 3 effect of the size of t shaped porous baffle on wave time series and spectral density wave time series of the free surface and interfacial wave were compared for cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 as presented fig 12 and fig 14 represent free surface waves for excitation frequencies of 0 7hz and 1 1hz respectively whereas fig 13 and fig 15 represent the interfacial wave time series at 0 7hz and 1 1hz respectively for the free surface it is seen that at the center of the tank the wave oscillation is minimal with smaller wave displacements from the free surface as recorded by probe 1 greater wave displacements are observed at probe 2 and probe 3 at the right and left tank walls respectively this can be observed in figs 12 and 13 it is observed that at a higher frequency the porous t shaped baffle is more effective in damping sloshing waves of the free surface this can be seen in fig 14 especially at probe 2 and probe 3 at an excitation frequency of 1 1hz at a lower excitation frequency of 0 7hz as is shown in fig 12 the porous t shaped baffle was comparatively less effective in damping sloshing waves this further shows that at higher frequencies the porous t shaped baffle proved to be more effective in damping sloshing at the free surface it is observed in fig 14 that at the center of the tank as recorded by probe 1 the free surface wave for case t000 had a relatively larger displacement as compared to case t015 t023 and t046 the crest however was similar for all cases this showed that at the center of the tank the presence of the porous baffles damped the height of the trough of the free surface wave at the center of the tank as is seen in fig 14 as recorded by probe 1 for the interfacial layer at an excitation frequency of 0 7hz as seen in fig 13 it is seen that at the center of the tank at probe 1 the case of t015 the interfacial wave is observed to have a comparatively higher crest height as compared to the other cases whereas the case t000 had a comparatively higher through height the configuration of the porous t shaped baffle and its properties could be attributed to these different characteristics of the interfacial wave at the center of the tank at a higher excitation frequency of 1 1hz in fig 14 it is seen at the center of the tank at probe 1 that the interfacial wave for case t015 had a very large wave height compared to the other cases t010 t023 and t046 it is thus seen that larger frequencies created an interfacial wave with a larger through in case t015 this could be due to the fact that the size of the baffle for t015 altered the natural frequency of the tank and brought it closer to the excitation frequency the porous t shaped baffle is thus seen to damp the interfacial wave height at the center of the tank for cases t023 and t046 the interfacial wave as recorded at the tank walls by probe 2 and probe 3 showed that the t shaped baffles acted in damping the interfacial wave height at the tank walls especially for higher excitation frequency values as can be seen in fig 15 where the excitation frequency is 1 1hz 4 4 spectral analysis of interfacial wave time series spectral analysis was conducted using the time series of the interfacial wave at probe 2 for cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 in fig 16 the fft spectral analysis shows that the spectral profile for the case without a t shaped baffle for case t000 had two significant peak frequencies of high amplitude the significant peak frequencies observed were 0 86hz and 1 10hz for both free surface and interfacial layer for case t000 as is seen in fig 16 on the other hand for cases t015 t023 and t046 the only significant peak frequencies are observed at 1 1hz the peak frequency of 1 1hz seen in fig 16 also coincided with the excitation frequency which is also 1 1hz it is also seen that even though a 1 1hz peak frequency occurred in t000 t015 t023 and t046 the amplitude is slightly being reduced as the ht or span of the t shaped porous baffle is increased thus case t046 is seen to have a slightly smaller amplitude at the 1 1hz peak frequency in comparison to the other cases as is seen in fig 16 it is also seen in fig 16 that the amplitude of the peak frequency of 1 1hz was slightly higher for the free surface as compared to the interfacial layer wavelet analysis of the time series of the interfacial wave for cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 are presented for excitation frequencies of 1 1hz and 0 7hz respectively in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively the wavelet analysis enabled us to see the frequency response as a function of time this enables the comparison of how the porous baffle impacted the frequency time domain of the interfacial layer for cases t000 t015 t023 and t046 in fig 17 the wavelet analysis shows that for case t000 near the regions closer to the excitation frequency circular high response frequency fields are seen in the plot this shows that the response frequency oscillates from higher to lower frequency values with a high frequency response in the red color circular regions depicting a high frequency response according to the color key of fig 17 this is observed for both free surface and interfacial layer as is seen in fig 17 for case t000 and is seen also in case t000 in fig 18 however in fig 18 a wave like high frequency response layer is seen for case t00 as compared to circular high frequency response as is the case in fig 18 the wavelet response is thus observed to be dependent on the excitation frequency the wavelet for the cases t015 t023 and t046 were seen to have similar plots as can be seen in figs 17 and 18 and the wavelet results showed a different pattern as compared to case t000 this also showed that the presence of the porous t shaped baffle impacted the frequency as a function of time 4 5 effect of t shaped porous baffle on fluid velocity streamline and vorticity profile to visualize the interaction of the layered fluid with a t shaped baffle screenshots are presented for various time frames to compare the effect of a non porous t shaped baffle with a porous t shaped baffle the case setup used is that of t0046 comparisons were carried out for the velocity field the streamline and the vorticity field as is seen in fig 19 fig 20 and fig 21 respectively the velocity screenshots as seen in fig 19 shows that for the porous baffle the fluid velocity is high under the t shape of the baffle as the fluid passes through the porous material of the baffle whereas on the other hand for the non porous baffle the fluid velocity under the t shape of the baffle is low since the fluid does not pass through the non porous baffle the baffle serves as a solid wall and the velocity of the fluid in this region is markedly reduced as can be seen in fig 19 it is also observed that the area between the t shape of the baffle and the free surface has a higher fluid velocity for both porous and non porous t baffled cases the fluid velocity distribution is thus seen to be higher around the porous t shaped baffle in comparison to the non porous t shaped baffle as can be seen in fig 19 the streamline snapshots presented in fig 20 show the flow path of the fluid particles it is seen that the flow path of the fluid particles is different for the porous t shaped baffle when compared to a non porous t shaped baffle as is seen in the screenshots in fig 20 the fluid path is not blocked by the non porous baffle as the fluid is able to pass through it as the fluid sloshes on the other hand the non porous t shaped baffle acts as a barrier to the flow of the fluid this barrier thus causes the fluid to create a circular or curved path under the t shaped span of the porous baffle and in some cases created fluid paths that looked like vortices as can be seen in fig 20 and more so at 29 6 s this also shows that the non porous baffle creates a turbulent flow as it damps the fluid from sloshing the porous baffle on the other hand serves in damping the fluid without creating an excessively turbulent flow the porous baffle can thus be used as a mechanism for damping fluid sloshing and still not create too much turbulence in the fluid screenshots of the vorticity magnitude for porous and non porous t shaped baffles are shown in fig 21 it is seen that there is higher vorticity around the t shaped span or vertical section of the baffle for both porous and non porous cases the presence of the t shaped baffle thus created high vorticity magnitudes in regions close to the vertical section or span of the baffle for both porous and non porous cases there is also a slightly higher vorticity magnitude on the vertical section of the porous t shaped baffle which is visibly absent for the non porous case as is seen in the screenshots of fig 21 this showed that the porous material was also responsible for creating more vorticity in the flowing fluid 5 conclusion a numerical model was set up to study single and layered sloshing wave interaction with porous structures the porous t shaped baffle is seen to interact with the fluid by creating some turbulence and high velocity field patterns which may be associated with energy dissipation in the system and hence slosh damping free surface wave displacement was found to be higher than the interfacial wave displacement at the same excitation frequency with dynamic pressure on the tank walls being higher at pressure sensors closer to the free surface the porous t shaped baffle was found to be effective in damping sloshing with an increased damping ability observed at higher excitation frequencies as well as effective slosh damping with the reduced turbulent fluid flow as compared to non porous t shaped baffle cases fluid flow was relatively more turbulent due to interaction with the solid baffle in the non porous t shaped baffle and less turbulent when considering a porous t shaped baffle the porous t shaped baffle has a lesser effect in altering the natural frequency of the fluid tank setup as compared to a solid t shaped baffle fluid velocity observed under the span of the porous t shaped baffle was higher in comparison to the non porous t shaped baffle the study of the interaction of porous structures with a layered fluid sloshing in a rectangular tank under various model setup conditions and their efficacy in slosh damping was studied credit authorship contribution
