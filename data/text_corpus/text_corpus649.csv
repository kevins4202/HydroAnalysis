3245,cities across the world are implementing green infrastructure gi retrofits to manage stormwater but limited research has been performed to quantify the hydrologic impact of these efforts at the watershed scale to fill this knowledge gap this study aimed to monitor and evaluate the impact of gi stormwater control measures scms on sewershed scale runoff hydrology across multiple treatment sewersheds with varying gi implementation a paired watershed approach was applied in which a control i e no gi and three treatment sewersheds 208 bioretention cells and 8 400 m2 of permeable pavement in total were monitored from 2016 to 2019 in columbus ohio usa further infrastructure changes such as lining sanitary sewer laterals to prevent infiltration and inflow of stormwater were anticipated to counterbalance the hydrologic improvements provided by the gi retrofits by routing more stormwater to the storm sewers significant decreases in runoff depths and peak flow rates 35 62 and 40 58 respectively and increases in lag to peak 6 64 were observed in the treatment sewersheds following the installation of gi retrofits compared to the control sewershed the treatment sewersheds had slight increases 1 3 mm in runoff thresholds and lower runoff coefficients post gi following additional infrastructure changes increases in volume and rate of flows were observed but hydrologic indicators did not significantly differ from pre gi levels i e no net impact of the overall project on runoff hydrology these responses indicated that sewershed scale gi implementation successfully mitigated peak flow rates however the additional infrastructure improvement projects appear to have neutralized volume reductions by routing additional stormwater to the gi results confirm the impacts of sewershed scale gi retrofits however research investigating the optimization of gi retrofit location climate change impacts and gi design construction and maintenance to maximize benefits of

reductions in interception and evapotranspiration following the removal of vegetation results in increased runoff volumes conveyed at higher flow rates to receiving waters shuster et al 2005 historically sewer networks were employed to quickly drain runoff from cities vietz et al 2016 while this reduced localized flooding it compounded effects on downstream communities and severely degraded water quality booth et al 2016 walsh et al 2005 these hydrologic shifts result in impacts to channel cross sections bed forms and the sediment transport dynamic equilibrium booth and jackson 1997 davis 2008 wilby 2007 the negative effects of urbanization on surface waters led to regulations and standards for stormwater management in the us us epa 1972 stormwater control measures scms such as wet and dry ponds were some of the first catchment scale systems recognized in the us to reliably detain stormwater with the primary goal of flood mitigation national research council 2009 detention based scms are often large and centrally located within a catchment to facilitate complete capture and release of flows from design storm events making them a good fit for developed areas with larger parcels of available land hale 2016 scms have since evolved to take up less space and provide improved stormwater quality by treating the first flush of pollution peter et al 2020 using processes including as filtration sorption plant uptake and microbially mediated breakdown of pollutants studies documenting the effectiveness of scms vary in scale from analyzing single scms kadlec et al 2020 mallin et al 2002 schwartz et al 2017 to connected networks of scms managing runoff from a catchment gagrani et al 2014 loperfido et al 2014 walsh et al 2016 hydrologic benefits at the individual scm scale include decreased runoff volumes and flow rates however several studies identified the need for proper construction and continued maintenance of scms to promote long term hydrological benefits e g emerson et al 2010 erickson et al 2010 flynn et al 2012 merriman and hunt 2014 of the research investigating scms at the catchment scale observed hydrologic impacts varied and were often a function of the location and density of scms installed greater runoff reductions tended to result from more densely installed scms to treat a greater portion of the impervious cover of a catchment goff and gentry 2006 loperfido et al 2014 meierdiercks et al 2010 goff and gentry 2006 also found that the directly connected impervious area which are impervious surfaces directly connected to the sewer and drainage system boyd et al 1993 and the shape of the watershed influence the efficacy of scms to reducing peak flow rates this was further corroborated by bell et al 2016 who found within 16 watersheds that total imperviousness of a catchment was the best predictor of hydrologic response with scm related metrics i e type number etc being ancillary predictors challenges in reliably discerning hydrologic benefits of scms at the sewershed scale were reviewed by jefferson et al 2017 who found that differences generated by watershed characteristics such as capacitance or prior land use often led to greater variability in hydrologic performance across otherwise similar scm installations this finding was highlighted by the results of 23 included empirically monitored studies where detention and infiltration based scms often did not discernably change sewershed scale hydrology jefferson et al 2017 when the clean water act cwa amendments of 1990 were released sanitary sewer overflows ssos and storm sewer discharges became regulated under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes us epa 2014 in response cities such as philadelphia new york city seattle and columbus ohio created multi faceted long term control plans for ssos combining traditional sewer infrastructure improvements with low impact development lid hopkins et al 2018 traditional sewer infrastructure improvements often limit flow pathways that may have arisen over time such as replacing old or failing sewer pipe or sealing cracks along sanitary sewer laterals resulting in less inflow and infiltration i i into storm and sanitary sewers bocarro et al 2007 a central tenet of lid is the disconnection of impervious surfaces to limit the detrimental effects associated with parking lots rooftops and roads on receiving waters and mimic pre development hydrology fletcher et al 2015 walsh et al 2005 several studies have documented the effectiveness of downspout disconnection which releases water to pervious areas where subsequent infiltration can lead to reduced stormwater flows taguchi et al 2019 in contrast redirecting downspouts to storm sewers as well as sump pump installations within residential and commercial developments can reduce i i and increase the total stormwater flows when directed directly into the storm sewer or streetside scms another set of practices commonly implemented to achieve lid goals focuses on decentralized infiltration based scms also known as green infrastructure gi gi scms such as bioretention cells brcs permeable pavement pp bioswales etc temporarily detain stormwater before releasing it at reduced rates or permanently abstracting stormwater through exfiltration into native soils evapotranspiration or other pathways which divert runoff from the storm sewer thus decreasing the volume and flashiness of flows in the receiving stream brcs are planted depressional areas with sandy soil media optimized for infiltration that have been shown by numerous studies to reduce runoff at the site scale e g hunt et al 2008 mangangka et al 2015 winston et al 2016a pp which may consist of interlocking brick pavers or a highly porous concrete asphalt allow stormwater to infiltrate the pavement and depending on design and site conditions infiltrate into the underlying soil scholz and grabowiecki 2007 tirpak et al 2021 field research into the hydrological performance of brcs and pp often focuses on one or two scms treating a small drainage area e g collins et al 2008 hunt et al 2006 2008 jayakaran et al 2019 mangangka et al 2015 winston et al 2016a b wide variability in gi performance exists in the literature including runoff volume mitigation 35 98 and peak flow mitigation 40 99 collins et al 2008 davis 2008 debusk and wynn 2011 hunt et al 2012 schlea et al 2014 winston et al 2015 variability in gi performance is related to site and design characteristics such as directly connected impervious area surface to drainage area ratio presence of underdrains and ponding and media depths hunt et al 2012 li et al 2009 with proper maintenance being crucial to long term function bean et al 2007 winston et al 2016b simpson et al 2021 variability in reported hydrologic mitigation can also be attributed to scm design specifications which are based on capturing a design water quality volume e g retaining runoff from the 90th percentile event on site and allowing runoff from larger events to bypass treatment in contrast to other scms few studies particularly field monitoring efforts have been performed to date which demonstrate the effectiveness of gi when implemented at the catchment or sewershed scale li et al 2017 jefferson et al 2017 a selection of these studies have been summarized in table 1 while previous sewershed scale gi field studies have often focused on brc retrofits three studies monitored new developments where gi was included hood et al 2007 loperfido et al 2014 woznicki et al 2018 and three featured rain gardens shallower brcs without underdrains connecting to the storm sewer system and rain barrels as opposed to brcs or pps burns et al 2016 jarden et al 2016 mayer et al 2012 significant reductions in runoff volumes 33 80 were observed from gi sewersheds compared to control sewersheds with traditional drainage infrastructure table 1 additionally gi was found to significantly reduce peak flow rates by 20 40 and increase lag to peak times table 1 some studies found significant differences in gi scm performance as a function of storm depth with better reductions occurring for smaller lower intensity storm events table 1 hood et al 2007 loperfido et al 2014 woznicki et al 2018 jarden et al 2016 observed limited hydrologic benefits i e 30 reduction in runoff volume at the sub catchment scale which was attributed to the placement design and construction of retrofitted practices within the sewersheds mayer et al 2012 did not observe significance from anovas within their before after control impact study but noted significant small effects and impacts at a neighborhood scale when modeled with a reduced versus full model test this was due to the placement within parcels diversion of runoff from disconnected impervious surfaces and proximity to other impervious surfaces mayer et al 2012 uncalibrated modeling of these types of gi networks is also relatively common in practice and the literature damodaram et al 2010 moriasi et al 2012 jefferson et al 2017 of which the accuracy is highly related to the underlying model assumptions paired watershed studies are a standard approach to evaluate the statistical significance of management changes implemented the sewershed scale table 1 where two or more watersheds are monitored before and after the management change is implemented clausen and spooner 1993 gi or other modifications are added at a discrete moment in time to a treatment watershed while the control watershed is unchanged to determine the impacts on hydrology following the change loftis et al 2001 to address the need to enhance the scientific understanding of large scale retrofitted gi performance the paired watershed approach was used to compare stormwater discharges from three treatment sewersheds 10 5 47 7 and 61 3 ha with an adjacent control sewershed 111 5 ha in the clintonville neighborhood of columbus ohio usa previous studies on gi retrofits included 20 brcs installed in a 75 ha or smaller drainage area table 1 in contrast the sewersheds herein were retrofitted with 208 brcs and over 8 400 m2 of pp in 232 ha of existing residential development furthermore additional infrastructure improvements such as sanitary sewer lateral lining and downspout redirections were also completed runoff depth peak flow rate and runoff thresholds from the sewersheds were monitored and compared in three distinct periods 1 pre gi 2 post gi and 3 post all infrastructure improvements post ai2 following the completion sanitary sewer lateral lining sump pump installation and downspout disconnection it was hypothesized that runoff volumes and peak flow rates for the treatment sewersheds would 1 decrease from the pre gi to post gi periods due to gi implementation and 2 remain from pre gi to post ai2 periods due other sewershed modifications in the post ai2 period which increase total flows into the storm sewer system results from this study can inform the impacts of large scale gi retrofit and assist communities in understanding the potential effects of multiple stages of infrastructure retrofits on sewershed hydrology 2 methods 2 1 site descriptions and experimental design blueprint columbus is an effort by the city of columbus ohio to improve sewer infrastructure and reduce sso occurrences and volumes the project targets four changes to existing infrastructure 1 lining of sanitary sewer laterals to reduce infiltration and inflow of stormwater 2 installation of sump pumps 3 redirection of downspouts to gi and 4 gi retrofits though the approach will target numerous neighborhoods throughout columbus the first phase of blueprint columbus activities was implemented in the clintonville neighborhood a 1500 ha residential area with a population of 30 000 located 16 km north of downtown the city s goal for blueprint columbus was to have no net change in runoff hydrology compared to pre project levels four storm sewer outfalls draining separate portions of the clintonville neighborhood were instrumented to measure runoff hydrology from 2016 to 2019 in the blenheim glencoe bg indian springs is and cooke glenmont cg sewersheds gi was retrofitted into the existing residential neighborhoods beginning in 2017 fig 1 the beechwold bw sewershed received minimal infrastructure retrofits and served as the experimental control existing land uses in each sewershed were predominately small single family residential lots cg 100 bg 89 is 75 and bw 96 the remaining area in the bg and bw sewersheds was institutional e g churches and schools fig 2 the remaining area in the is sewershed was institutional 17 4 and commercial 7 6 native soils in the project areas were mapped as cardington and bennington silt loam soils hydrologic soil group c with hydraulic conductivities ranging from 1 2 to 5 2 mm h nrcs 2020 between 2017 and 2019 a total of 437 brcs and five pp streets were retrofitted in clintonville of the 437 brcs 208 were installed in the three treatment sewersheds and four of the five pp installations 6 000 m2 were located exclusively in is table 2 fig 2 ten brcs and one pp cul du sac 2 400 m2 were installed in the southern boundary of the bw sewershed which treated only 2 of the sewershed area despite the construction of these brcs it was determined that bw could still serve as a control sewershed for the study because no significant differences in runoff hydrology were detected prior to and following the installation of the gi see section 3 1 in contrast gi treated 23 44 of the treatment sewershed areas the surface area and added storage volumes of gi were highly varied due to some being installed in existing vegetated areas receiving runoff from larger areas and others installed along residential streets treating relatively small areas table 2 while bg was larger in sewershed area 61 ha the brcs were much smaller in surface area mean 12 5 m2 than those in cg mean 145 m2 all of the brcs were installed in city owned easements either behind or in front of the curb or along roads with the exception of cg where two 200 m2 regional brcs were constructed to replace city owned green spaces the brcs were designed to store a 19 mm storm event in their surface storage zone the city of columbus 2017 despite multiple firms contributing to gi design in different project areas the cross sections of the brcs and pps were similar across all treatment sewersheds fig 2 due to the low infiltration rates of native soils all gi featured an underdrain 10 20 cm perforated pvc surrounded by approximately 20 cm of astm no 8 or no 57 aggregate the city of columbus 2017 fig 2 media blends were sourced similarly across the brcs used in the project all were high sand content mixtures 80 90 with a loamy sand classification and between 2 and 5 organic material by weight the city of columbus 2017 fig 2 brcs were planted with native plant species mostly consisting of forbs and grasses across the three sewersheds with plant coverage at the time of as built surveys varying from 15 to 80 depending on the growing season and time since initial planting while underdrains were utilized iws zones were not utilized in design similarly if designs featured flow limiting devices e g ball valve they were not utilized to create an iws zone in the media profile 2 2 data collection tipping bucket 0 25 mm resolution davis rain collector and standard rain gauges were located near the sampled storm sewer outfalls in areas free of overhead obstructions fig 1 gauges were secured to 2 m tall wooden posts and rainfall data were recorded on hobo pendant loggers at 1 minute intervals onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts monitoring began at each storm sewer outfall in june 2016 either teledyne isco 6712 or 3700 series automated samplers were used with area velocity sensors attached to the bottom of each pipe which measure velocity using the doppler effect and water level using a pressure transducer sites were visited after events 5 mm of precipitation occurred to recalibrate the stage measurement monitor battery usage and perform preventative maintenance such as clearing debris upstream of the area velocity sensor or refreshing desiccant to remove excess moisture sites were decommissioned in the winter months late december early march to protect the equipment from freezing temperatures hydrologic data were collected by the area velocity sensors and stored on a 1 minute interval to the automated samplers data were downloaded and managed in flowlink version 5 1 teledyne isco lincoln nebraska except for cg all storm sewers had baseflow during inter event periods separation of wet weather events from baseflow was completed using the usgs local minima method sloto and crouse 1996 wherein for each hydrograph the lowest discharges are connected linearly to estimate baseflow 2 3 project timeline blueprint columbus was implemented in clintonville in two phases 1 the gi construction phase and 2 the all infrastructure improvements ai2 phase consisting of downspout redirections and sanitary sewer lateral lining fig 3 sump pumps were installed on a rolling basis in each sewershed with the majority installed in 2018 for is and 2019 for cg and bg sump pump installations are expected to continue through 2021 the gi construction phase encompassed the three periods construction planting and establishment during the establishment phase runoff was routed away from the brc inlets to provide a period for plant roots to become established the construction phases of both gi and ai2 phases were omitted from the analysis for cg and bg due to the use of flow diversions around constructed scms as construction throughout the sewershed continued to limit excess sediment accumulation unlike the other treatment sewersheds the ai2 construction phase in is began immediately after the gi construction phase therefore the post gi retrofit period for is included the ai2 construction phase fig 3 during which the inlets of the gi were temporarily blocked while construction was occurring nearby construction in is was fully completed at the end of august 2019 at which point the post ai2 period began 2 4 data analysis a modified paired watershed approach was used to account for gi construction which occurred over several months instead of at a single change point the hydrological responses of the three treatment sewersheds were compared to the control sewershed in a pair wise fashion to account for differences implemented between time periods i e pre vs post gi or pre vs post ai2 fig 3 the kruskal wallis test was used to test for significant differences in precipitation characteristics i e rainfall depth peak 5 minute rainfall intensity and the number of storms exceeding the 19 mm event depth used to design the brcs between project periods kruskal and wallis 1952 each rainfall event was separated by a minimum antecedent dry period of six hours and minimum depth of 2 5 mm measured runoff volume was normalized by sewershed area to determine the runoff depth for each storm other flow metrics obtained for each storm event included area normalized peak flow rate lag to peak defined as the time between the start of rainfall and the time of peak discharge and flow duration kruskal wallis tests comparing pre gi to post gi periods for bw were completed to determine whether it was a suitable control since it had 2 of its 111 ha sewershed treated by 10 brcs fig 3 no significant differences were observed for runoff depths peak flow rates and lag to peak among pre and post gi periods p 0 19 for all comparisons similar to smith 2020 these comparisons confirmed that bw was an appropriate control for this study linear regression and analysis of covariance ancova were used to examine hydrological changes in the monitored sewersheds across the project periods i e pre gi post gi and post ai2 fig 3 linear regression models comparing runoff to rainfall depth were used to determine how the runoff thresholds and runoff coefficients changed over project periods the runoff threshold rot the rainfall depth at which incipient runoff was generated was determined as the x intercept for each runoff depth versus rainfall plot the runoff coefficient cr was defined as the quotient of total runoff depth to total rainfall depth ancova analyses were used to control for variation in rainfall over different periods data collected at the bw sewershed outfall used as the covariate and plotted against hydrologic data from each treatment sewershed analyses were conducted to determine significance in the change in responses slope and intercepts of the regression equations between project periods percent reductions of runoff depth and peak flow rate as well as percent increases in lag to peak were calculated through a ratio of least square means eq 1 clausen and spooner 1993 page et al 2015a b where lsmpost reflects the post gi or post ai2 lsm and lsmpre equals the pre gi lsm for that sewershed all data were log transformed as needed to meet the normality assumptions as determined by the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1972 d i f f e r e n c e 10 ls m post 10 ls m pre 1 100 2 5 simulated storm testing despite having the same bioretention media differences in hydraulic function during rain events were visually observed between individual brcs thus to determine an estimated field infiltration rate ifr of the brc media 10 simulated storm tests were performed at six different brcs in the treatment sewersheds the tests consisted of a known volume of water 1 5 m3 applied via gravity to each brc from a tank to determine single event performance where both the inlet and underdrain outlet were monitored using methods similar to schlea et al 2014 briefly inflow and outflow hydrographs were determined through the use of a water meter inflow or graduated pan outflow from which volumes peak flow rates and lag times were calculated using these measured data field ifr cm hr was determined by taking the volume into the brc vin m3 and dividing it by the brc surface area abrc m2 and the time for the entire volume to infiltrate the media layer tin hr using eq 2 these field derived ifr values may be lower than the actual ifr of the media as complete wetting of brc area likely did not occur during testing 2 i f r v in a brc t in 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitored rainfall events between 119 and 142 rainfall events were observed in the sewersheds during the 42 month monitoring period june 2016 december 2019 table 4 no significant differences in rainfall characteristics were observed across monitored sewersheds likely due to the proximity maximum distance of 2 km of the rain gauges and sewersheds the monitored rainfall events across the control sewershed observed depths ranging between 3 3 and 47 2 mm 5th 95th percentiles this range was similar across the treatment sewersheds the return periods for these storm events ranged from 1 year to the 2 year for the median rainfall duration 6 hr observed during the study no significant differences in rainfall depths were observed across the project periods significantly lower peak 5 minute rainfall intensities occurred in the post gi and post ai2 periods compared to pre gi periods for each sewershed bg p 0 01 cg p 0 018 and is p 0 004 table 3 3 2 changes in runoff depth and volume 3 2 1 rainfall and runoff regressions runoff depth was positively correlated to rainfall depth in each sewershed 0 51 r2 0 98 figs 4 6 similar runoff generation patterns were observed pre gi for bg and is slopes of 0 36 and 0 37 respectively figs 4 and 6 while bg had greater total imperviousness compared to is 44 3 and 40 respectively table 2 the large areas of connected imperviousness in is attributable in part to the institutional and commercial land uses were likely contributors to greater similarities in overall runoff generation lim and welty 2017 pappas et al 2008 schuster et al 2005 the shallowest pre gi rainfall runoff linear regression slope was observed in cg fig 5 which is characterized by relatively low density residential land use and had the lowest imperviousness similar results were reported by hood et al 2007 who observed slopes of 0 21 and 0 37 for regressions between rainfall and runoff depths from two residential developments in connecticut other primarily residential urban catchments around the world have been characterized with slopes ranging from 0 33 in france to 0 58 in italy boyd et al 1993 and 0 36 0 61 in minnesota ebrahimian et al 2016 similar to the minnesota study higher regression slopes were correlated to greater connected imperviousness within the sewersheds pre gi ebrahimian et al 2016 regression slopes were observed to decrease for all treatment sewersheds in the post gi period compared to pre gi with bg exhibiting the greatest decrease 0 36 to 0 02 followed by cg 0 27 to 0 23 fig 4 5 and 6 these results indicate that the amount of runoff generated in each sewershed decreased following the installation of gi regression slopes at is increased between the pre gi 0 37 and post gi 0 53 periods fig 4 likely due to the ongoing construction efforts to improve other infrastructure which occurred during the period further these activities coincided with the use of temporary sediment controls to block flow from entering the brcs and added additional stormwater into the sewer system through sanitary sewer lateral lining i e reducing infiltration and inflow of stormwater into the sanitary sewer at is post ai2 the slope decreased to 0 38 fig 4c nearly equaling the pre gi phase and indicating that once construction was completed the gi was able to mitigate the additional stormwater inputs resulting in modest changes to catchment scale hydrology results of comparisons of runoff depth between treatment and control sewersheds using linear regression with rainfall as a covariant are presented in fig 7 statistical significance in this model would indicate that the hydrologic response in the treatment sewersheds was significantly different than responses observed in the control over the same period the regression equations and median values for each of the hydrologic variables are included for each sewershed and period in the supplementary material table a1 results of percent change in least square means lsm for runoff depth peak flow rate and lag to peak derived from ancova models are summarized in table 4 and are indicative of results from all monitored storm events table 3 completion of gi in bg and all infrastructure improvements in is resulted in significant decreases in runoff depth post gi construction in is and cg resulted in significant decreases in peak flow rate see section 3 4 similarly gi and infrastructure improvements retrofitted into cg and is resulted in increases in lag to peak for the post gi and post ai2 periods see section 3 5 significant decreases 48 96 in slope of the runoff response indicate that runoff was being generated differently in the bg and is compared to the control during the post gi and post ai2 periods respectively table a1 because of the robust nature of the paired watershed design these effects can be attributed to the addition of gi and other infrastructure improvements runoff reductions of 37 and 62 were observed in the is and bg sewersheds during the post ai2 and post gi periods respectively table 4 other sewershed scale studies observed runoff volume decreases of 40 80 following the installation of gi e g barr engineering 2006 bedan and clausen 2009 page et al 2015a b unh stormwater center city of dover 2017 conclusions from bg and is post ai2 should however be kept in context as only 15 storm events post gi were compared against 118 and 63 pre gi storm events respectively these 15 storm events were also significantly less intense median peak 5 minute intensity 8 4 mm hr compared to 19 8 mm hr table 3 which likely contributed to the enhanced runoff reduction observed during this period no significant differences in runoff depth were observed in the post gi periods in cg and is compared to the control table 4 a smaller number of storm events were monitored at the cg sewershed during the pre gi period which may have impacted these results the lack of significance at is between the pre and post gi periods could be attributed to the ongoing construction of other infrastructure improvements table 2 fig 3 and the temporary blocking of brc inlets to prevent sediment accumulation which occurred during the post gi period the high ifr of the media determined from field tests which ranged from 23 5 to 51 6 cm hr paired with high rainfall intensity events which were common in the post gi periods table 3 likely caused the brcs in cg and is to function as filters and may have limited opportunities for runoff reduction in addition to high infiltration rates within the media lack of iws zones or use of flow limiting devices e g ball valves resulted in much of the runoff volumes to pass through the gi into the existing storm sewer system proper usage and placement of flow limiters can create an internal water storage layer iws which has be shown to increase the runoff volume reduction of brcs over a variety of soil types brown and hunt 2011a hunt et al 2012 winston et al 2016a in addition post construction surveys revealed that the height of overflow structures and thus potential ponding depths were reduced by approximately one third compared to design specifications i e actual mean height of 10 cm compared to desired 30 5 cm storage depth in over half of the brcs increased instances of overflow have been linked to undersized brcs i e those with lower as built surface storage compared to designed volumes decreasing the potential hydrological benefits of these systems brown and hunt 2011b the lack of iws coupled with lower overflow structures in the blueprint brc designs likely impacted the runoff reductions or lack thereof observed in the treatment sewersheds 3 3 runoff thresholds and coefficients runoff thresholds were found to increase in the post gi period indicating that greater amounts of rainfall were necessary to initiate runoff within treatment sewersheds following gi implementation table 5 between the pre and post gi period rot increased between 0 8 and 1 25 mm in the treatment sewersheds runoff thresholds ranged from 1 5 to 4 6 mm and 1 5 4 8 mm in the pre gi and post gi periods respectively page et al 2015a and hood et al 2007 found similar rot for residential neighborhoods in wilmington nc 3 3 mm and waterford ct 2 8 mm respectively conversely the rot in the control sewershed bw decreased during the pre and post gi phases of the bg and is sewersheds by 3 and 2 mm respectively these increases in rot for the treatment sewershed would be expected to be due in part to reduction in effective impervious area brought on by the gi retrofits in the sewersheds however the lack of significant differences in runoff depth table 4 suggests the marginal increases or decreases 1mm difference observed in rot are likely due to other factors beyond gi e g rainfall characteristics peak 5 minute and average rainfall intensity as well as antecedent soil moisture conditions also influence runoff generation from pervious surfaces horton 1933 which are not considered in the determination of rot runoff coefficients from the four sewersheds varied from 0 2 to 0 33 in the pre gi period table 6 similar to two residential neighborhoods in waterford ct 0 19 0 24 hood et al 2007 line and white 2007 reported a cr of 0 55 for a residential development on moderate slopes and in clayey soils in north carolina whereas page et al 2015b found a cr of 0 38 for a coastal north carolina residential development both line and white 2007 and page et al 2015b studied watersheds with higher imperviousness than those studied herein the changes to cr between the pre and post gi phases in the treatment sewersheds were similar to those observed in the control sewershed table 7 this was particularly true for the longer operational gi sewersheds i e cg and is where the differences between the pre to post gi changes in cr were 0 and 0 02 respectively when compared to the control sewershed conversely page et al 2015a reported far higher reductions in cr following the installation of gi in wilmington nc from 0 38 to 0 18 while impervious disconnection was achieved by the installation of gi retrofits in the treatment sewersheds there are many aspects of the local soil profiles and hydrological cycle that could impact the runoff generation in the sewersheds which are not accounted for in cr calculations the underlying soils in the treatment sewersheds have low infiltration rates 5 mm hr limiting exfiltration and potential runoff volume reduction furthermore iws or restrictions to flow on the underdrains were not employed in the current study in contrast the gi in north carolina was constructed over sandy subsoils 50 mm hr which influenced runoff reduction and likely led to the observed reduction in cr page et al 2015a similar to calculations of rot rainfall characteristics have been recognized as important drivers in stormwater generation as they dictate the volume and rate at which water can be infiltrated into pervious surfaces without being accounted for in runoff coefficient analyses horton 1933 ran et al 2012 3 4 normalized peak flow rate response significant differences in normalized peak flow rate were observed for all treatment sewersheds except bg table 4 fig 8 attributable to the addition of gi in the sewersheds the post ai2 phase for is also had slightly significant reductions p 0 10 in peak flow rate vis à vis the control sewershed this result could be attributed to the additional infrastructure improvements that added stormwater into the sewer network peak flow mitigations for other sewershed scale gi studies ranged from 20 to 44 bedan and clausen 2009 page et al 2015a jarden et al 2016 with larger reductions occurring for smaller storm events peak flow mitigations between 40 and 58 were observed in the treatment sewersheds table 5 table a2 with potential differences compared to previous literature potentially due to differences in gi design or density of scms further the elevated hydraulic conductivity of the media resulted in substantial available storage during the peak of the runoff hydrograph aiding in peak 1270091440000flow mitigation a linear relationship with peak rainfall intensity explained approximately 67 8 of the variance in the peak flow rates across the four sewersheds for the pre gi period table a2 after gi was implemented the variability of the normalized peak flow rates increased the post gi and post ai2 periods were explained by lower r2 linear relationships with a greater standard deviation between the sewersheds 50 33 variability of peak flow rate responses likely depended on available gi storage at the occurrence of peak rainfall intensity if the brc was partially or completely full at the time of peak rainfall intensity overflow directly into the storm sewer may result which would decrease peak flow mitigation this trend was observed by winston et al 2016a in three brcs in northern ohio where a greater degree of peak flow rate mitigation 53 corresponded to peak rainfall intensities which occurred prior to the hyetograph centroid the increased variability of peak flow rate reductions has also been supported by hunt et al 2012 who concluded that restrictions on depressional storage depths limit brcs peak flow mitigation capabilities 3 5 lag to peak response lag to peak increased by 6 64 during the post gi compared to the pre gi period indicating that additions of gi delayed runoff conveyance to the monitored outfalls table 4 table a3 significant increases were observed in the slope of the lag to peak response between the pre gi to post gi periods in is p 0 045 and cg p 0 003 table a3 fig 9 changes in lag to peak ranged from 0 3 h ispost gi to 3 1 h cg post gi a significant decrease in is slope post ai2 was observed corresponding to the increased stormwater volumes generated for each storm event once the additional infrastructure improvements were installed which could impact the timing of peak flow at the monitored outfall previous studies of individual brcs have observed lag to peak times ranging from 40 to 530 min depending on the drainage area to brc area ratio media depth composition and underdrain configuration schlea et al 2014 liu and fassman beck 2017 hood et al 2007 found gi increased lag to peak times were between 8 and 10 times greater i e 4 min to 40 min than traditionally managed sewersheds the smaller changes in lag to peak observed in the treatment sewersheds herein could be a function of the percentage of sewershed treated by gi as well as the gi design parameters mentioned above the lack of significant differences in lag to peak observed at bg could be attributed to the small number of storm events captured during the post gi period in addition the smaller surface areas of the brcs 80 of the brcs were 9 m2 when compared to the gi in the other two treatment sewersheds 28 in is and 0 in cg could have influenced this result the density and placement of gi in relation to the sewershed outlet and the amount of storage capacity created by the gi are design elements which could also impact the lag to peak ancova results fig 9c produced a model similar to the retrofitted catchment studied by page et al 2015a who also observed an intersection of regression lines the north carolina study observed brc abstraction farther from the sewer outfall this led to the remaining i e untreated stormwater to reach the monitoring point more rapidly page et al 2015a 3 6 conclusions this paired watershed study was performed to verify the sewershed scale impacts of 200 individual gi practices installed in the clintonville neighborhood of columbus ohio usa results showed significant decreases in peak flow rate 40 58 as well as increases in lag to peak 6 60 resulting from gi retrofits installed in three treatment sewersheds compared to a control runoff volume and depth reductions varied across treatment sewersheds with significant reductions observed 37 and 65 for project periods with smaller numbers of monitored storm events 20 that were significantly less intense than those in other project periods the high infiltration rates of the bioretention media derived from simulated storm testing and lack of iws zones implemented in the brcs led to lower than anticipated runoff reductions particularly during high intensity large rainfall events where the cells functioned more as filters instead of retaining runoff results presented herein may have been improved if gi practices were specifically designed for targeted hydrological mitigation in the post ai2 period for the indian springs sewershed which included the completion of other infrastructure improvements associated with the retrofit effort e g implementation of sump pumps sanitary sewer lateral lining and downspout redirections hydrologic responses more closely resembled the pre gi period due to the additional stormwater volumes conveyed to the gi regression slopes of peak flow rate and lag to peak significantly increased post ai2 often reverting to values near the pre gi period this indicated that the blueprint projects effectively directed more stormwater to the gi and ultimately the storm sewer system however the gi provided effective mitigation of the additional stormwater introduced to the sewershed with the completion of these infrastructure improvements returning the hydrologic response to pre retrofit conditions this study demonstrates the benefits of large scale implementation of gi in a developed urban area further exploration into the importance of gi design placement and functionality of the practices within the greater sewershed hydrology with a particular focus on runoff volume reductions is recommended this study found that while significant peak flow reductions and increased lag to peak times were observed in all treatment sewersheds the ability to retain and reduce the overall volumes leaving each practice was limited these results contribute key knowledge about sewershed scale impacts of gi to aid engineers and city planners to improve the design of gi retrofits to optimize stormwater management credit authorship

3245,cities across the world are implementing green infrastructure gi retrofits to manage stormwater but limited research has been performed to quantify the hydrologic impact of these efforts at the watershed scale to fill this knowledge gap this study aimed to monitor and evaluate the impact of gi stormwater control measures scms on sewershed scale runoff hydrology across multiple treatment sewersheds with varying gi implementation a paired watershed approach was applied in which a control i e no gi and three treatment sewersheds 208 bioretention cells and 8 400 m2 of permeable pavement in total were monitored from 2016 to 2019 in columbus ohio usa further infrastructure changes such as lining sanitary sewer laterals to prevent infiltration and inflow of stormwater were anticipated to counterbalance the hydrologic improvements provided by the gi retrofits by routing more stormwater to the storm sewers significant decreases in runoff depths and peak flow rates 35 62 and 40 58 respectively and increases in lag to peak 6 64 were observed in the treatment sewersheds following the installation of gi retrofits compared to the control sewershed the treatment sewersheds had slight increases 1 3 mm in runoff thresholds and lower runoff coefficients post gi following additional infrastructure changes increases in volume and rate of flows were observed but hydrologic indicators did not significantly differ from pre gi levels i e no net impact of the overall project on runoff hydrology these responses indicated that sewershed scale gi implementation successfully mitigated peak flow rates however the additional infrastructure improvement projects appear to have neutralized volume reductions by routing additional stormwater to the gi results confirm the impacts of sewershed scale gi retrofits however research investigating the optimization of gi retrofit location climate change impacts and gi design construction and maintenance to maximize benefits of

department of economic and social affairs and population division 2019 leads to the construction of impermeable surfaces e g roads buildings etc that inhibit infiltration into soils which coupled with reductions in interception and evapotranspiration following the removal of vegetation results in increased runoff volumes conveyed at higher flow rates to receiving waters shuster et al 2005 historically sewer networks were employed to quickly drain runoff from cities vietz et al 2016 while this reduced localized flooding it compounded effects on downstream communities and severely degraded water quality booth et al 2016 walsh et al 2005 these hydrologic shifts result in impacts to channel cross sections bed forms and the sediment transport dynamic equilibrium booth and jackson 1997 davis 2008 wilby 2007 the negative effects of urbanization on surface waters led to regulations and standards for stormwater management in the us us epa 1972 stormwater control measures scms such as wet and dry ponds were some of the first catchment scale systems recognized in the us to reliably detain stormwater with the primary goal of flood mitigation national research council 2009 detention based scms are often large and centrally located within a catchment to facilitate complete capture and release of flows from design storm events making them a good fit for developed areas with larger parcels of available land hale 2016 scms have since evolved to take up less space and provide improved stormwater quality by treating the first flush of pollution peter et al 2020 using processes including as filtration sorption plant uptake and microbially mediated breakdown of pollutants studies documenting the effectiveness of scms vary in scale from analyzing single scms kadlec et al 2020 mallin et al 2002 schwartz et al 2017 to connected networks of scms managing runoff from a catchment gagrani et al 2014 loperfido et al 2014 walsh et al 2016 hydrologic benefits at the individual scm scale include decreased runoff volumes and flow rates however several studies identified the need for proper construction and continued maintenance of scms to promote long term hydrological benefits e g emerson et al 2010 erickson et al 2010 flynn et al 2012 merriman and hunt 2014 of the research investigating scms at the catchment scale observed hydrologic impacts varied and were often a function of the location and density of scms installed greater runoff reductions tended to result from more densely installed scms to treat a greater portion of the impervious cover of a catchment goff and gentry 2006 loperfido et al 2014 meierdiercks et al 2010 goff and gentry 2006 also found that the directly connected impervious area which are impervious surfaces directly connected to the sewer and drainage system boyd et al 1993 and the shape of the watershed influence the efficacy of scms to reducing peak flow rates this was further corroborated by bell et al 2016 who found within 16 watersheds that total imperviousness of a catchment was the best predictor of hydrologic response with scm related metrics i e type number etc being ancillary predictors challenges in reliably discerning hydrologic benefits of scms at the sewershed scale were reviewed by jefferson et al 2017 who found that differences generated by watershed characteristics such as capacitance or prior land use often led to greater variability in hydrologic performance across otherwise similar scm installations this finding was highlighted by the results of 23 included empirically monitored studies where detention and infiltration based scms often did not discernably change sewershed scale hydrology jefferson et al 2017 when the clean water act cwa amendments of 1990 were released sanitary sewer overflows ssos and storm sewer discharges became regulated under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes us epa 2014 in response cities such as philadelphia new york city seattle and columbus ohio created multi faceted long term control plans for ssos combining traditional sewer infrastructure improvements with low impact development lid hopkins et al 2018 traditional sewer infrastructure improvements often limit flow pathways that may have arisen over time such as replacing old or failing sewer pipe or sealing cracks along sanitary sewer laterals resulting in less inflow and infiltration i i into storm and sanitary sewers bocarro et al 2007 a central tenet of lid is the disconnection of impervious surfaces to limit the detrimental effects associated with parking lots rooftops and roads on receiving waters and mimic pre development hydrology fletcher et al 2015 walsh et al 2005 several studies have documented the effectiveness of downspout disconnection which releases water to pervious areas where subsequent infiltration can lead to reduced stormwater flows taguchi et al 2019 in contrast redirecting downspouts to storm sewers as well as sump pump installations within residential and commercial developments can reduce i i and increase the total stormwater flows when directed directly into the storm sewer or streetside scms another set of practices commonly implemented to achieve lid goals focuses on decentralized infiltration based scms also known as green infrastructure gi gi scms such as bioretention cells brcs permeable pavement pp bioswales etc temporarily detain stormwater before releasing it at reduced rates or permanently abstracting stormwater through exfiltration into native soils evapotranspiration or other pathways which divert runoff from the storm sewer thus decreasing the volume and flashiness of flows in the receiving stream brcs are planted depressional areas with sandy soil media optimized for infiltration that have been shown by numerous studies to reduce runoff at the site scale e g hunt et al 2008 mangangka et al 2015 winston et al 2016a pp which may consist of interlocking brick pavers or a highly porous concrete asphalt allow stormwater to infiltrate the pavement and depending on design and site conditions infiltrate into the underlying soil scholz and grabowiecki 2007 tirpak et al 2021 field research into the hydrological performance of brcs and pp often focuses on one or two scms treating a small drainage area e g collins et al 2008 hunt et al 2006 2008 jayakaran et al 2019 mangangka et al 2015 winston et al 2016a b wide variability in gi performance exists in the literature including runoff volume mitigation 35 98 and peak flow mitigation 40 99 collins et al 2008 davis 2008 debusk and wynn 2011 hunt et al 2012 schlea et al 2014 winston et al 2015 variability in gi performance is related to site and design characteristics such as directly connected impervious area surface to drainage area ratio presence of underdrains and ponding and media depths hunt et al 2012 li et al 2009 with proper maintenance being crucial to long term function bean et al 2007 winston et al 2016b simpson et al 2021 variability in reported hydrologic mitigation can also be attributed to scm design specifications which are based on capturing a design water quality volume e g retaining runoff from the 90th percentile event on site and allowing runoff from larger events to bypass treatment in contrast to other scms few studies particularly field monitoring efforts have been performed to date which demonstrate the effectiveness of gi when implemented at the catchment or sewershed scale li et al 2017 jefferson et al 2017 a selection of these studies have been summarized in table 1 while previous sewershed scale gi field studies have often focused on brc retrofits three studies monitored new developments where gi was included hood et al 2007 loperfido et al 2014 woznicki et al 2018 and three featured rain gardens shallower brcs without underdrains connecting to the storm sewer system and rain barrels as opposed to brcs or pps burns et al 2016 jarden et al 2016 mayer et al 2012 significant reductions in runoff volumes 33 80 were observed from gi sewersheds compared to control sewersheds with traditional drainage infrastructure table 1 additionally gi was found to significantly reduce peak flow rates by 20 40 and increase lag to peak times table 1 some studies found significant differences in gi scm performance as a function of storm depth with better reductions occurring for smaller lower intensity storm events table 1 hood et al 2007 loperfido et al 2014 woznicki et al 2018 jarden et al 2016 observed limited hydrologic benefits i e 30 reduction in runoff volume at the sub catchment scale which was attributed to the placement design and construction of retrofitted practices within the sewersheds mayer et al 2012 did not observe significance from anovas within their before after control impact study but noted significant small effects and impacts at a neighborhood scale when modeled with a reduced versus full model test this was due to the placement within parcels diversion of runoff from disconnected impervious surfaces and proximity to other impervious surfaces mayer et al 2012 uncalibrated modeling of these types of gi networks is also relatively common in practice and the literature damodaram et al 2010 moriasi et al 2012 jefferson et al 2017 of which the accuracy is highly related to the underlying model assumptions paired watershed studies are a standard approach to evaluate the statistical significance of management changes implemented the sewershed scale table 1 where two or more watersheds are monitored before and after the management change is implemented clausen and spooner 1993 gi or other modifications are added at a discrete moment in time to a treatment watershed while the control watershed is unchanged to determine the impacts on hydrology following the change loftis et al 2001 to address the need to enhance the scientific understanding of large scale retrofitted gi performance the paired watershed approach was used to compare stormwater discharges from three treatment sewersheds 10 5 47 7 and 61 3 ha with an adjacent control sewershed 111 5 ha in the clintonville neighborhood of columbus ohio usa previous studies on gi retrofits included 20 brcs installed in a 75 ha or smaller drainage area table 1 in contrast the sewersheds herein were retrofitted with 208 brcs and over 8 400 m2 of pp in 232 ha of existing residential development furthermore additional infrastructure improvements such as sanitary sewer lateral lining and downspout redirections were also completed runoff depth peak flow rate and runoff thresholds from the sewersheds were monitored and compared in three distinct periods 1 pre gi 2 post gi and 3 post all infrastructure improvements post ai2 following the completion sanitary sewer lateral lining sump pump installation and downspout disconnection it was hypothesized that runoff volumes and peak flow rates for the treatment sewersheds would 1 decrease from the pre gi to post gi periods due to gi implementation and 2 remain from pre gi to post ai2 periods due other sewershed modifications in the post ai2 period which increase total flows into the storm sewer system results from this study can inform the impacts of large scale gi retrofit and assist communities in understanding the potential effects of multiple stages of infrastructure retrofits on sewershed hydrology 2 methods 2 1 site descriptions and experimental design blueprint columbus is an effort by the city of columbus ohio to improve sewer infrastructure and reduce sso occurrences and volumes the project targets four changes to existing infrastructure 1 lining of sanitary sewer laterals to reduce infiltration and inflow of stormwater 2 installation of sump pumps 3 redirection of downspouts to gi and 4 gi retrofits though the approach will target numerous neighborhoods throughout columbus the first phase of blueprint columbus activities was implemented in the clintonville neighborhood a 1500 ha residential area with a population of 30 000 located 16 km north of downtown the city s goal for blueprint columbus was to have no net change in runoff hydrology compared to pre project levels four storm sewer outfalls draining separate portions of the clintonville neighborhood were instrumented to measure runoff hydrology from 2016 to 2019 in the blenheim glencoe bg indian springs is and cooke glenmont cg sewersheds gi was retrofitted into the existing residential neighborhoods beginning in 2017 fig 1 the beechwold bw sewershed received minimal infrastructure retrofits and served as the experimental control existing land uses in each sewershed were predominately small single family residential lots cg 100 bg 89 is 75 and bw 96 the remaining area in the bg and bw sewersheds was institutional e g churches and schools fig 2 the remaining area in the is sewershed was institutional 17 4 and commercial 7 6 native soils in the project areas were mapped as cardington and bennington silt loam soils hydrologic soil group c with hydraulic conductivities ranging from 1 2 to 5 2 mm h nrcs 2020 between 2017 and 2019 a total of 437 brcs and five pp streets were retrofitted in clintonville of the 437 brcs 208 were installed in the three treatment sewersheds and four of the five pp installations 6 000 m2 were located exclusively in is table 2 fig 2 ten brcs and one pp cul du sac 2 400 m2 were installed in the southern boundary of the bw sewershed which treated only 2 of the sewershed area despite the construction of these brcs it was determined that bw could still serve as a control sewershed for the study because no significant differences in runoff hydrology were detected prior to and following the installation of the gi see section 3 1 in contrast gi treated 23 44 of the treatment sewershed areas the surface area and added storage volumes of gi were highly varied due to some being installed in existing vegetated areas receiving runoff from larger areas and others installed along residential streets treating relatively small areas table 2 while bg was larger in sewershed area 61 ha the brcs were much smaller in surface area mean 12 5 m2 than those in cg mean 145 m2 all of the brcs were installed in city owned easements either behind or in front of the curb or along roads with the exception of cg where two 200 m2 regional brcs were constructed to replace city owned green spaces the brcs were designed to store a 19 mm storm event in their surface storage zone the city of columbus 2017 despite multiple firms contributing to gi design in different project areas the cross sections of the brcs and pps were similar across all treatment sewersheds fig 2 due to the low infiltration rates of native soils all gi featured an underdrain 10 20 cm perforated pvc surrounded by approximately 20 cm of astm no 8 or no 57 aggregate the city of columbus 2017 fig 2 media blends were sourced similarly across the brcs used in the project all were high sand content mixtures 80 90 with a loamy sand classification and between 2 and 5 organic material by weight the city of columbus 2017 fig 2 brcs were planted with native plant species mostly consisting of forbs and grasses across the three sewersheds with plant coverage at the time of as built surveys varying from 15 to 80 depending on the growing season and time since initial planting while underdrains were utilized iws zones were not utilized in design similarly if designs featured flow limiting devices e g ball valve they were not utilized to create an iws zone in the media profile 2 2 data collection tipping bucket 0 25 mm resolution davis rain collector and standard rain gauges were located near the sampled storm sewer outfalls in areas free of overhead obstructions fig 1 gauges were secured to 2 m tall wooden posts and rainfall data were recorded on hobo pendant loggers at 1 minute intervals onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts monitoring began at each storm sewer outfall in june 2016 either teledyne isco 6712 or 3700 series automated samplers were used with area velocity sensors attached to the bottom of each pipe which measure velocity using the doppler effect and water level using a pressure transducer sites were visited after events 5 mm of precipitation occurred to recalibrate the stage measurement monitor battery usage and perform preventative maintenance such as clearing debris upstream of the area velocity sensor or refreshing desiccant to remove excess moisture sites were decommissioned in the winter months late december early march to protect the equipment from freezing temperatures hydrologic data were collected by the area velocity sensors and stored on a 1 minute interval to the automated samplers data were downloaded and managed in flowlink version 5 1 teledyne isco lincoln nebraska except for cg all storm sewers had baseflow during inter event periods separation of wet weather events from baseflow was completed using the usgs local minima method sloto and crouse 1996 wherein for each hydrograph the lowest discharges are connected linearly to estimate baseflow 2 3 project timeline blueprint columbus was implemented in clintonville in two phases 1 the gi construction phase and 2 the all infrastructure improvements ai2 phase consisting of downspout redirections and sanitary sewer lateral lining fig 3 sump pumps were installed on a rolling basis in each sewershed with the majority installed in 2018 for is and 2019 for cg and bg sump pump installations are expected to continue through 2021 the gi construction phase encompassed the three periods construction planting and establishment during the establishment phase runoff was routed away from the brc inlets to provide a period for plant roots to become established the construction phases of both gi and ai2 phases were omitted from the analysis for cg and bg due to the use of flow diversions around constructed scms as construction throughout the sewershed continued to limit excess sediment accumulation unlike the other treatment sewersheds the ai2 construction phase in is began immediately after the gi construction phase therefore the post gi retrofit period for is included the ai2 construction phase fig 3 during which the inlets of the gi were temporarily blocked while construction was occurring nearby construction in is was fully completed at the end of august 2019 at which point the post ai2 period began 2 4 data analysis a modified paired watershed approach was used to account for gi construction which occurred over several months instead of at a single change point the hydrological responses of the three treatment sewersheds were compared to the control sewershed in a pair wise fashion to account for differences implemented between time periods i e pre vs post gi or pre vs post ai2 fig 3 the kruskal wallis test was used to test for significant differences in precipitation characteristics i e rainfall depth peak 5 minute rainfall intensity and the number of storms exceeding the 19 mm event depth used to design the brcs between project periods kruskal and wallis 1952 each rainfall event was separated by a minimum antecedent dry period of six hours and minimum depth of 2 5 mm measured runoff volume was normalized by sewershed area to determine the runoff depth for each storm other flow metrics obtained for each storm event included area normalized peak flow rate lag to peak defined as the time between the start of rainfall and the time of peak discharge and flow duration kruskal wallis tests comparing pre gi to post gi periods for bw were completed to determine whether it was a suitable control since it had 2 of its 111 ha sewershed treated by 10 brcs fig 3 no significant differences were observed for runoff depths peak flow rates and lag to peak among pre and post gi periods p 0 19 for all comparisons similar to smith 2020 these comparisons confirmed that bw was an appropriate control for this study linear regression and analysis of covariance ancova were used to examine hydrological changes in the monitored sewersheds across the project periods i e pre gi post gi and post ai2 fig 3 linear regression models comparing runoff to rainfall depth were used to determine how the runoff thresholds and runoff coefficients changed over project periods the runoff threshold rot the rainfall depth at which incipient runoff was generated was determined as the x intercept for each runoff depth versus rainfall plot the runoff coefficient cr was defined as the quotient of total runoff depth to total rainfall depth ancova analyses were used to control for variation in rainfall over different periods data collected at the bw sewershed outfall used as the covariate and plotted against hydrologic data from each treatment sewershed analyses were conducted to determine significance in the change in responses slope and intercepts of the regression equations between project periods percent reductions of runoff depth and peak flow rate as well as percent increases in lag to peak were calculated through a ratio of least square means eq 1 clausen and spooner 1993 page et al 2015a b where lsmpost reflects the post gi or post ai2 lsm and lsmpre equals the pre gi lsm for that sewershed all data were log transformed as needed to meet the normality assumptions as determined by the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1972 d i f f e r e n c e 10 ls m post 10 ls m pre 1 100 2 5 simulated storm testing despite having the same bioretention media differences in hydraulic function during rain events were visually observed between individual brcs thus to determine an estimated field infiltration rate ifr of the brc media 10 simulated storm tests were performed at six different brcs in the treatment sewersheds the tests consisted of a known volume of water 1 5 m3 applied via gravity to each brc from a tank to determine single event performance where both the inlet and underdrain outlet were monitored using methods similar to schlea et al 2014 briefly inflow and outflow hydrographs were determined through the use of a water meter inflow or graduated pan outflow from which volumes peak flow rates and lag times were calculated using these measured data field ifr cm hr was determined by taking the volume into the brc vin m3 and dividing it by the brc surface area abrc m2 and the time for the entire volume to infiltrate the media layer tin hr using eq 2 these field derived ifr values may be lower than the actual ifr of the media as complete wetting of brc area likely did not occur during testing 2 i f r v in a brc t in 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitored rainfall events between 119 and 142 rainfall events were observed in the sewersheds during the 42 month monitoring period june 2016 december 2019 table 4 no significant differences in rainfall characteristics were observed across monitored sewersheds likely due to the proximity maximum distance of 2 km of the rain gauges and sewersheds the monitored rainfall events across the control sewershed observed depths ranging between 3 3 and 47 2 mm 5th 95th percentiles this range was similar across the treatment sewersheds the return periods for these storm events ranged from 1 year to the 2 year for the median rainfall duration 6 hr observed during the study no significant differences in rainfall depths were observed across the project periods significantly lower peak 5 minute rainfall intensities occurred in the post gi and post ai2 periods compared to pre gi periods for each sewershed bg p 0 01 cg p 0 018 and is p 0 004 table 3 3 2 changes in runoff depth and volume 3 2 1 rainfall and runoff regressions runoff depth was positively correlated to rainfall depth in each sewershed 0 51 r2 0 98 figs 4 6 similar runoff generation patterns were observed pre gi for bg and is slopes of 0 36 and 0 37 respectively figs 4 and 6 while bg had greater total imperviousness compared to is 44 3 and 40 respectively table 2 the large areas of connected imperviousness in is attributable in part to the institutional and commercial land uses were likely contributors to greater similarities in overall runoff generation lim and welty 2017 pappas et al 2008 schuster et al 2005 the shallowest pre gi rainfall runoff linear regression slope was observed in cg fig 5 which is characterized by relatively low density residential land use and had the lowest imperviousness similar results were reported by hood et al 2007 who observed slopes of 0 21 and 0 37 for regressions between rainfall and runoff depths from two residential developments in connecticut other primarily residential urban catchments around the world have been characterized with slopes ranging from 0 33 in france to 0 58 in italy boyd et al 1993 and 0 36 0 61 in minnesota ebrahimian et al 2016 similar to the minnesota study higher regression slopes were correlated to greater connected imperviousness within the sewersheds pre gi ebrahimian et al 2016 regression slopes were observed to decrease for all treatment sewersheds in the post gi period compared to pre gi with bg exhibiting the greatest decrease 0 36 to 0 02 followed by cg 0 27 to 0 23 fig 4 5 and 6 these results indicate that the amount of runoff generated in each sewershed decreased following the installation of gi regression slopes at is increased between the pre gi 0 37 and post gi 0 53 periods fig 4 likely due to the ongoing construction efforts to improve other infrastructure which occurred during the period further these activities coincided with the use of temporary sediment controls to block flow from entering the brcs and added additional stormwater into the sewer system through sanitary sewer lateral lining i e reducing infiltration and inflow of stormwater into the sanitary sewer at is post ai2 the slope decreased to 0 38 fig 4c nearly equaling the pre gi phase and indicating that once construction was completed the gi was able to mitigate the additional stormwater inputs resulting in modest changes to catchment scale hydrology results of comparisons of runoff depth between treatment and control sewersheds using linear regression with rainfall as a covariant are presented in fig 7 statistical significance in this model would indicate that the hydrologic response in the treatment sewersheds was significantly different than responses observed in the control over the same period the regression equations and median values for each of the hydrologic variables are included for each sewershed and period in the supplementary material table a1 results of percent change in least square means lsm for runoff depth peak flow rate and lag to peak derived from ancova models are summarized in table 4 and are indicative of results from all monitored storm events table 3 completion of gi in bg and all infrastructure improvements in is resulted in significant decreases in runoff depth post gi construction in is and cg resulted in significant decreases in peak flow rate see section 3 4 similarly gi and infrastructure improvements retrofitted into cg and is resulted in increases in lag to peak for the post gi and post ai2 periods see section 3 5 significant decreases 48 96 in slope of the runoff response indicate that runoff was being generated differently in the bg and is compared to the control during the post gi and post ai2 periods respectively table a1 because of the robust nature of the paired watershed design these effects can be attributed to the addition of gi and other infrastructure improvements runoff reductions of 37 and 62 were observed in the is and bg sewersheds during the post ai2 and post gi periods respectively table 4 other sewershed scale studies observed runoff volume decreases of 40 80 following the installation of gi e g barr engineering 2006 bedan and clausen 2009 page et al 2015a b unh stormwater center city of dover 2017 conclusions from bg and is post ai2 should however be kept in context as only 15 storm events post gi were compared against 118 and 63 pre gi storm events respectively these 15 storm events were also significantly less intense median peak 5 minute intensity 8 4 mm hr compared to 19 8 mm hr table 3 which likely contributed to the enhanced runoff reduction observed during this period no significant differences in runoff depth were observed in the post gi periods in cg and is compared to the control table 4 a smaller number of storm events were monitored at the cg sewershed during the pre gi period which may have impacted these results the lack of significance at is between the pre and post gi periods could be attributed to the ongoing construction of other infrastructure improvements table 2 fig 3 and the temporary blocking of brc inlets to prevent sediment accumulation which occurred during the post gi period the high ifr of the media determined from field tests which ranged from 23 5 to 51 6 cm hr paired with high rainfall intensity events which were common in the post gi periods table 3 likely caused the brcs in cg and is to function as filters and may have limited opportunities for runoff reduction in addition to high infiltration rates within the media lack of iws zones or use of flow limiting devices e g ball valves resulted in much of the runoff volumes to pass through the gi into the existing storm sewer system proper usage and placement of flow limiters can create an internal water storage layer iws which has be shown to increase the runoff volume reduction of brcs over a variety of soil types brown and hunt 2011a hunt et al 2012 winston et al 2016a in addition post construction surveys revealed that the height of overflow structures and thus potential ponding depths were reduced by approximately one third compared to design specifications i e actual mean height of 10 cm compared to desired 30 5 cm storage depth in over half of the brcs increased instances of overflow have been linked to undersized brcs i e those with lower as built surface storage compared to designed volumes decreasing the potential hydrological benefits of these systems brown and hunt 2011b the lack of iws coupled with lower overflow structures in the blueprint brc designs likely impacted the runoff reductions or lack thereof observed in the treatment sewersheds 3 3 runoff thresholds and coefficients runoff thresholds were found to increase in the post gi period indicating that greater amounts of rainfall were necessary to initiate runoff within treatment sewersheds following gi implementation table 5 between the pre and post gi period rot increased between 0 8 and 1 25 mm in the treatment sewersheds runoff thresholds ranged from 1 5 to 4 6 mm and 1 5 4 8 mm in the pre gi and post gi periods respectively page et al 2015a and hood et al 2007 found similar rot for residential neighborhoods in wilmington nc 3 3 mm and waterford ct 2 8 mm respectively conversely the rot in the control sewershed bw decreased during the pre and post gi phases of the bg and is sewersheds by 3 and 2 mm respectively these increases in rot for the treatment sewershed would be expected to be due in part to reduction in effective impervious area brought on by the gi retrofits in the sewersheds however the lack of significant differences in runoff depth table 4 suggests the marginal increases or decreases 1mm difference observed in rot are likely due to other factors beyond gi e g rainfall characteristics peak 5 minute and average rainfall intensity as well as antecedent soil moisture conditions also influence runoff generation from pervious surfaces horton 1933 which are not considered in the determination of rot runoff coefficients from the four sewersheds varied from 0 2 to 0 33 in the pre gi period table 6 similar to two residential neighborhoods in waterford ct 0 19 0 24 hood et al 2007 line and white 2007 reported a cr of 0 55 for a residential development on moderate slopes and in clayey soils in north carolina whereas page et al 2015b found a cr of 0 38 for a coastal north carolina residential development both line and white 2007 and page et al 2015b studied watersheds with higher imperviousness than those studied herein the changes to cr between the pre and post gi phases in the treatment sewersheds were similar to those observed in the control sewershed table 7 this was particularly true for the longer operational gi sewersheds i e cg and is where the differences between the pre to post gi changes in cr were 0 and 0 02 respectively when compared to the control sewershed conversely page et al 2015a reported far higher reductions in cr following the installation of gi in wilmington nc from 0 38 to 0 18 while impervious disconnection was achieved by the installation of gi retrofits in the treatment sewersheds there are many aspects of the local soil profiles and hydrological cycle that could impact the runoff generation in the sewersheds which are not accounted for in cr calculations the underlying soils in the treatment sewersheds have low infiltration rates 5 mm hr limiting exfiltration and potential runoff volume reduction furthermore iws or restrictions to flow on the underdrains were not employed in the current study in contrast the gi in north carolina was constructed over sandy subsoils 50 mm hr which influenced runoff reduction and likely led to the observed reduction in cr page et al 2015a similar to calculations of rot rainfall characteristics have been recognized as important drivers in stormwater generation as they dictate the volume and rate at which water can be infiltrated into pervious surfaces without being accounted for in runoff coefficient analyses horton 1933 ran et al 2012 3 4 normalized peak flow rate response significant differences in normalized peak flow rate were observed for all treatment sewersheds except bg table 4 fig 8 attributable to the addition of gi in the sewersheds the post ai2 phase for is also had slightly significant reductions p 0 10 in peak flow rate vis à vis the control sewershed this result could be attributed to the additional infrastructure improvements that added stormwater into the sewer network peak flow mitigations for other sewershed scale gi studies ranged from 20 to 44 bedan and clausen 2009 page et al 2015a jarden et al 2016 with larger reductions occurring for smaller storm events peak flow mitigations between 40 and 58 were observed in the treatment sewersheds table 5 table a2 with potential differences compared to previous literature potentially due to differences in gi design or density of scms further the elevated hydraulic conductivity of the media resulted in substantial available storage during the peak of the runoff hydrograph aiding in peak 1270091440000flow mitigation a linear relationship with peak rainfall intensity explained approximately 67 8 of the variance in the peak flow rates across the four sewersheds for the pre gi period table a2 after gi was implemented the variability of the normalized peak flow rates increased the post gi and post ai2 periods were explained by lower r2 linear relationships with a greater standard deviation between the sewersheds 50 33 variability of peak flow rate responses likely depended on available gi storage at the occurrence of peak rainfall intensity if the brc was partially or completely full at the time of peak rainfall intensity overflow directly into the storm sewer may result which would decrease peak flow mitigation this trend was observed by winston et al 2016a in three brcs in northern ohio where a greater degree of peak flow rate mitigation 53 corresponded to peak rainfall intensities which occurred prior to the hyetograph centroid the increased variability of peak flow rate reductions has also been supported by hunt et al 2012 who concluded that restrictions on depressional storage depths limit brcs peak flow mitigation capabilities 3 5 lag to peak response lag to peak increased by 6 64 during the post gi compared to the pre gi period indicating that additions of gi delayed runoff conveyance to the monitored outfalls table 4 table a3 significant increases were observed in the slope of the lag to peak response between the pre gi to post gi periods in is p 0 045 and cg p 0 003 table a3 fig 9 changes in lag to peak ranged from 0 3 h ispost gi to 3 1 h cg post gi a significant decrease in is slope post ai2 was observed corresponding to the increased stormwater volumes generated for each storm event once the additional infrastructure improvements were installed which could impact the timing of peak flow at the monitored outfall previous studies of individual brcs have observed lag to peak times ranging from 40 to 530 min depending on the drainage area to brc area ratio media depth composition and underdrain configuration schlea et al 2014 liu and fassman beck 2017 hood et al 2007 found gi increased lag to peak times were between 8 and 10 times greater i e 4 min to 40 min than traditionally managed sewersheds the smaller changes in lag to peak observed in the treatment sewersheds herein could be a function of the percentage of sewershed treated by gi as well as the gi design parameters mentioned above the lack of significant differences in lag to peak observed at bg could be attributed to the small number of storm events captured during the post gi period in addition the smaller surface areas of the brcs 80 of the brcs were 9 m2 when compared to the gi in the other two treatment sewersheds 28 in is and 0 in cg could have influenced this result the density and placement of gi in relation to the sewershed outlet and the amount of storage capacity created by the gi are design elements which could also impact the lag to peak ancova results fig 9c produced a model similar to the retrofitted catchment studied by page et al 2015a who also observed an intersection of regression lines the north carolina study observed brc abstraction farther from the sewer outfall this led to the remaining i e untreated stormwater to reach the monitoring point more rapidly page et al 2015a 3 6 conclusions this paired watershed study was performed to verify the sewershed scale impacts of 200 individual gi practices installed in the clintonville neighborhood of columbus ohio usa results showed significant decreases in peak flow rate 40 58 as well as increases in lag to peak 6 60 resulting from gi retrofits installed in three treatment sewersheds compared to a control runoff volume and depth reductions varied across treatment sewersheds with significant reductions observed 37 and 65 for project periods with smaller numbers of monitored storm events 20 that were significantly less intense than those in other project periods the high infiltration rates of the bioretention media derived from simulated storm testing and lack of iws zones implemented in the brcs led to lower than anticipated runoff reductions particularly during high intensity large rainfall events where the cells functioned more as filters instead of retaining runoff results presented herein may have been improved if gi practices were specifically designed for targeted hydrological mitigation in the post ai2 period for the indian springs sewershed which included the completion of other infrastructure improvements associated with the retrofit effort e g implementation of sump pumps sanitary sewer lateral lining and downspout redirections hydrologic responses more closely resembled the pre gi period due to the additional stormwater volumes conveyed to the gi regression slopes of peak flow rate and lag to peak significantly increased post ai2 often reverting to values near the pre gi period this indicated that the blueprint projects effectively directed more stormwater to the gi and ultimately the storm sewer system however the gi provided effective mitigation of the additional stormwater introduced to the sewershed with the completion of these infrastructure improvements returning the hydrologic response to pre retrofit conditions this study demonstrates the benefits of large scale implementation of gi in a developed urban area further exploration into the importance of gi design placement and functionality of the practices within the greater sewershed hydrology with a particular focus on runoff volume reductions is recommended this study found that while significant peak flow reductions and increased lag to peak times were observed in all treatment sewersheds the ability to retain and reduce the overall volumes leaving each practice was limited these results contribute key knowledge about sewershed scale impacts of gi to aid engineers and city planners to improve the design of gi retrofits to optimize stormwater management credit authorship

3246,the rapid conversion of tropical rainforests into monoculture plantations of rubber hevea brasiliensis in southeast asia sea necessitates understanding of rubber tree physiology under local climatic conditions frequent fog immersion in the montane regions of sea may affect the water and carbon budgets of the rubber trees and the plantation ecosystems we studied the effect of fog on various plant physiological parameters in a mature rubber plantation in southwest china over 3 years during the study period an average of 141 fog events occurred every year and the majority occurred during the dry season when the temperature was relatively low in addition to the low temperature fog events were also associated with low vapor pressure deficit atmospheric water potential relative humidity and frequent wet canopy conditions we divided the dry season into cool dry november february and hot dry march april seasons and classified days into foggy fg and non foggy non fg days during the fg days of the cool dry season the physiological activities of the rubber trees were suppressed where carbon assimilation and evapotranspiration showed reductions of 4 and 15 respectively compared to the cool dry non fg days importantly the unequal declines in carbon assimilation and evapotranspiration led to enhanced crop water productivity wpc on cool dry fg days but insignificant wpc values were found between fg and non fg days of the hot dry season our results suggest that by regulating plant physiology fog events during the cool dry season significantly reduce water demand and alleviate water stress for the trees through improved wpc keywords canopy conductance evapotranspiration eddy covariance net ecosystem co2 exchange sap flow transpiration 1 introduction the montane areas 300 m elevation of southeast asia sea are rich in natural resources and considered to be one of the global biodiversity hotspots and important regions of primary forest carbon stock fox et al 2014 blagodatsky et al 2016 however in recent decades these areas have been experiencing severe biodiversity loss and environmental risks due to the conversion of natural tropical rainforests into monoculture plantations of rubber hevea brasiliensis myers et al 2000 tan et al 2011 zakari et al 2020 for example in the southwest edge of china xishuangbanna rubber trees were first introduced in the late 1950s and its land coverage reached 22 by 2010 forming a new non traditional environmental area zhu et al 2004 xu et al 2014 giambelluca et al 2016 such large scale changes in land use patterns in natural forests have led to serious environmental problems that have affected the regional and local forest carbon blagodatsky et al 2016 warren thomas et al 2018 and water balances tan et al 2011 pfeifer et al 2016 predominantly the rubber plantations reduce groundwater recharge due to the high rainwater runoff ma et al 2019 and also introduce pollution due to fertilizer and pesticide applications zakari et al 2020 further owing to their larger xylem vessels and comprehensive root system rubber trees consume more water than rainforest trees isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 tan et al 2011 yang et al 2020 making them more vulnerable to drought consequently a much higher rate of canopy evapotranspiration etc was found in rubber plantations than in the local natural ecosystems guardiola claramonte et al 2010 tan et al 2011 giambelluca et al 2016 the etc was significantly lower during the dry season than in the wet season due to drought and defoliation patterns isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 kobayashi et al 2014 niu et al 2017 hardanto et al 2017 lin et al 2018a b röll et al 2019 during the dry season fog events occur frequently in xishuangbanna as in many mountainous ecosystems bruijnzeel 2001 the moisture input from the fog is believed to partially relieve the stresses from lower temperatures and drought of the dry season zhang et al 2014 fu et al 2016 thereby allowing high rubber production in this region priyadarshan 2011 these fog events can influence the carbon water and energy budgets of the ecosystem in various ways for example the fog maintains water in plants and soils by reducing transpiration through frequent leaf wetting bruijnzeel 2001 alvarado barrientos et al 2014 berry et al 2014 gerlein safdi et al 2018a at the same time the foliar uptake of fog water can diminish the leaf water deficit and enhance leaf gas exchange rates berry et al 2014 baguskas et al 2017 which in turn lead to ecosystem rehydration in a dry environment eller et al 2013 the foggy fg days can enhance the ecosystem productivity because the fog diffused light can be used by plants for photosynthesis mercado et al 2009 berry et al 2014 however some studies also reported that leaf wetting can weaken photosynthetic carbon assimilation during a dense fog event even under the presence of adequate sunlight zhang et al 2014 gerlein safdi et al 2018b bittencourt et al 2019 furthermore changes in the environmental conditions such as air temperature tair net radiation rn photosynthetically active radiation par relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd during fog events can also have a substantial influence on ecosystem water use and productivity ritter et al 2009 2017 baguskas et al 2018 overall the responses of both carbon uptake and evapotranspiration to fog can vary among ecosystems with different tree species for rubber plantations it is still not clear how changes in productivity and evapotranspiration during fog events affect the ecosystem water use efficiency which to a large extent defines their vulnerability to drought stress during the dry season the importance of fog in forest ecosystems has been recognized and debated for centuries hales 1757 stone 1957 but it is only in recent years that the development of new techniques such as high precision gas exchange measurements xylem sap flow and stable isotopes has allowed us to investigate the effect of fog on water and carbon processes in different ecosystems bruijnzeel et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 alvarado barrientos et al 2014 chu et al 2014 gotsch et al 2014 baguskas et al 2018 gerlein safdi et al 2018a b bittencourt et al 2019 however the extent to which the leaves of rubber plants can maintain net co2 assimilation in the fog season is not known we need to study the degree of rubber plant physiology responses to different fog and cloud regimes from fg to cloudy and non foggy non fg days in a systematic manner therefore our goal was to understand the effects of fog occurrence on net ecosystem co2 exchange nee gross primary production gpp etc ecosystem level crop water productivity wpc canopy conductance gs and stand

xishuangbanna rubber plantations reveal changes in environmental conditions as the fog occurs and compare nee gpp etc wpc gs and tc under fg and non fg days of cool and hot dry seasons to reveal the impact of fog on these carbon and water processes the present study has great implications for the study of the effect of fog on water and carbon cycle in rubber plantations in wide areas of sea 2

november february and hot dry season march april with winds from the southeastern direction tan et al 2010 the cold air from the southern edges of the subtropical jet streams dominates the dry season cao et al 1996 tan et al 2010 causing frequent fog events particularly at night and in the early morning liu et al 2004 fog events are less frequent in the wet season due to deep orographic convection which has been seen in several mountain ecosystems around the world eugster et al 2006 garcía santos and bruijnzeel 2011 alvarado barrientos et al 2014 the mean annual rainfall was 1 492 mm over the

and they face severe soil drought in the subsoil layer particularly during the late dry season vogel et al 1995 chen and cao 2008 liu et al 2014a 2 2 fog detection fog events were detected using a present weather sensor pws100 campbell scientific inc logan ut united states which is a laser based sensor capable of determining atmospheric visibility its visibility ranges from 0 m to a maximum saturating distance of 20 000 m the data were recorded every minute by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut united states following the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 1995 fog events are defined as occasions when visibility is 1 000 m and mist or light fog event as occasions when visibility is between 1 000 and 2 000 m vautard et al 2009 dense fog occurs when visibility is 400 m witiw and ladochy 2008 the identification of fog events was first introduced by tardif and rasmussen 2007 and fog events are defined as occasions during which atmospheric visibility of 2 000 m is recorded for at least 3 h within 5 sequential h with a visibility of 1 000 m recorded at least once in this time period thus occasions with visibilities 2 000 m lasting 2 h were not included in our study as fog events we compared the visibility data with precipitation data to distinguish rainfall from fog events we excluded occasions when visibility was 2 000 m with rainfall 0 5 mm h 1 as well as occasions when visibility was 1 000 m while rainfall was 0 1 mm h 1 it is noted that fog events occurred mostly during the dry season when rainfall is relatively scarce

rubber trees to measure the sap flow rate js using the heat dissipation method following granier 1985 1987 fig s2 each sap flow probe setup consisted of two cylindrical metal needle probes length 20 mm diameter 2 mm sap flow probes were inserted radially into the outermost 2 cm of the stem at breast height 1 4 m with a distance of approximately 10 cm between the two sensor probes to avoid thermal

interestingly wpc increased significantly by 12 3 during cool fg compared with cool non fg days p 0 01 but insignificant during hot fg and hot non fg days we found that for most of the dry season except january 2015 p etc was 0 mm which indicates water deficit fig 7 a the sm in the top soil layer 5 cm showed distinct seasonal variations with the values ranging from 22 december 2014 to 34 august 2014 and the values were generally lower during the dry season 27 7 3 than during the wet season 29 4 2 8 fig 7b overall the ecosystem was exposed to soil water stress from the beginning of

events with higher accuracy laser based sensor is an important first step in understanding how fog influences the tropical rubber tree s function the fog occurrence in xishuangbanna region was more frequent during the dry season than during the wet season table s1 the fog mainly forms around 3 00 a m and dissipates 1 2 h after sunrise in most fog events 80 of the year figs 2 3 however our data 141 12 fog events annually indicates that fog events were much fewer than the earlier reported values 258 58 fog events annually liu et al 2004 and this could be due to the large scale deforestation of tropical rainforests and conversion into monoculture rubber plantations in xishuangbanna in the past decade zhang et al 2014 the rubber plantations have a lower lai than tropical rainforest rusli and majid 2014 thus canopy alteration increases the albedo higher radiation reflection ratio which reduces the overall clouds fog in the region hauser et al 2015 our results suggest that the highly frequent dense fog events were of the radiation fog type tardif and rasmussen 2007 and occurred in the cool dry season november february the dense fog events reduce chilling damage to tropical plants including rubber trees and help maintain the tropical rainforests as well as agricultural crops of the region zongdao and xueqin 1983 zhang et al 2014 4 2 fog events enhance crop water productivity we found significant improvement 12 3 in ecosystem wpc in fg days in the cool dry season even with the deciduous nature of rubber trees intense leaf shedding from january to february fig s6 but not in the hot dry season fig 6 this enhanced wpc was mainly induced by the reduction in etc while nee and gpp showed no significant changes on cool dry fg days when compared with cool dry non fg days the difference in etc was mainly due to the decreased evaporation during cool dry fg days whereas no significant changes of tc was noticed as rubber trees are less active during this period due to leaf senescence after the short rubber trees started to actively transpire as new leaves grew in hot dry season leading to no etc difference between fg and non fg days fig 6 the low evapotranspiration during fog events is associated with low vpd which reduces atmospheric water stress ritter et al 2009 alvarado barrientos et al 2014 the enhanced wpc found on cool dry fg days in this study is consistent with other observations for example in a strawberry crop field baguskas et al 2018 2021 the water stressed crops can also use dew as a water resource in semi arid maize fields resulting in greater wpc yokoyama et al 2021 in contrast to our study the wpc increase under fg conditions was driven by reductions in both etc and nee with sharper drops in etc than in nee gerlein safdi et al 2018b baguskas et al 2018 whereas we found no changes in nee of the rubber plantation on cool dry fg days compared with cool dry non fg days fig 6 the dry season represents the driest period with little rainfall in xishuangbanna the net carbon uptake is the lowest during the cool dry season fig 5 which could make the trees vulnerable to the drought stress the foggy conditions in the cool dry season enhance ecosystem wpc via evaporation reduction and decrease water loss from the system which could be an important mechanism to mitigate the plant physiological stress and impairment in response to the drought during the period the high carbon uptake rates of the rubber plantation were mainly linked to the timing of the fog events which can affect plant physiological functions bittencourt et al 2019 in most studies the fog events occur from morning to afternoon which limits the transpiration and plant productivity ritter et al 2009 baguskas et al 2018 2021 at our site most of the fog events 80 lasted from midnight to early morning and fog usually dissipated within 2 h of sunrise consequently the canopy remained wet for 8 8 h till mid day fig 3c driving leaf water uptake and the rehydration of plant tissues which resulted in the overall reduction of transpiration eller et al 2013 chu et al 2014 alvarado barrientos et al 2015 at the same time dissipated fog did not significantly affect the light availability on fg days fig 4f consequently rubber trees can still maintain a high carbon uptake rate on fg days considering the trade off between water loss and carbon uptake our study suggests that fog events help increase the efficiency of plant water use which enhances the tolerance of rubber trees to drought stress during the dry season 4 3 foggy days suppress tc and etc we found insignificant changes in tc over cool dry season are due to the intense defoliation and low temperature which suppressed the transpirations rate january to february fig 6 s6 which is inconsistent with findings from other forests and crop fields with frequent fog occurrences for example tree transpiration was suppressed which ranged from 25 to 40 under fg conditions when compared with non fg conditions in various forest ecosystems hutley et al 1997 ritter et al 2009 gerlein safdi et al 2018b similarly several studies also highlighted that the presence of fog affects the microclimatic conditions and reduces evapotranspiration in tropical montane cloud forest ecosystems hildebrandt et al 2007 bruijnzeel et al 2011 bittencourt et al 2019 potato farm ramírez et al 2018 and also in a strawberry farm baguskas et al 2021 which is consistent with our findings that etc 15 rates ecosystem water loss were significantly suppressed during cool dry fog events fig 6 most of these studies suggest that the suppressed tc and etc during fog events is likely related to the associated changes in tair vpd ψatm lower radiation and frequent canopy wetting ritter et al 2009 baguskas et al 2018 we also obtained evidence that the fog reduced the tair and vpd which were significantly p 0 001 correlated to tc and etc in fg days table 1 fig 8 this could be due to lower tair and vpd which lead to a reduced evaporative demand fig 4 and lower the water stress during the dry season fig 7 the fog events subsequently should enhance the leaf and stem water potential that reduces the water demand in the dry season which was also evidenced from the study of fu et al 2016 who demonstrated that fog is an important water source for woody plants in the asian tropical karst forest of xishuangbanna thus it is likely that rubber trees utilize fog as additional source of water through foliar water uptake during leaf wetting events eller et al 2013 2016 berry et al 2014 this pathway can be particularly important to alleviate drought stress during prolonged dry season elliott et al 2006 fu et al 2016 at the same time the increased ψatm also facilitated rehydration for plants under conditions of soil water deficit baguskas et al 2018 we suggest that leaf wetting events which enhance leaf surface vaporization and minimize tc rates can be a major driver for the etc for the rubber plantation and should be considered in future studies regarding tropical fog overall frequent leaf wetting and reduced atmospheric water stress due to fog events could be important water sources for tropical crops particularly in the dry season the magnitude of transpiration largely depends on soil water status as well as atmospheric water demand teuling and troch 2005 the sharp sm decrease in the dry season was due to the shortage of rainfall fig 7b the high vpd in the dry season is expected to reduce soil water content through increased soil surface evaporation yang et al 2020 the rubber plantations showed larger etc than p during most of the dry season indicating water deficit fig 7a moreover sm was not a key driver for etc and tc at our site fig 7 and other rubber plantation sites around the world guardiola claramonte et al 2008 george et al 2009 gonkhamdee et al 2010 kobayashi et al 2014 niu et al 2017 several investigations revealed that rubber trees efficiently use the available water in the deep root zone to avoid severe water stress during the dry season guardiola claramonte et al 2010 liu et al 2014a b kumagai et al 2015 importantly soil water is extracted from deep layers at the rubber site but is not released by transpiration until new foliage is grown therefore we suggest that sm is not the main water source for trees during the dry season but sm increase during the fg season can become crucial in extreme drought events when deep soil water is depleted and should be considered in future studies 5 conclusion fog events and meteorological parameters during fg and non fg days of cool and hot dry seasons as well as concurring tc and wpc of mature rubber h brasiliensis plantations were studied in detail the analysis of 3 years of continuous observation showed that fog occurred during 42 of the total study period during the highly frequent dense fog events in the dry season tair often dropped below 5 c which triggered leaf shedding of rubber trees and thus they became physiologically less active compared with cool dry non fg days the presence of fog was associated with lower etc rates 15 lower in addition net carbon uptake rate is generally low during cool dry season the dense fg days did not affect gpp but decreased etc leading to an enhanced wpc during the fg days compared with the non fg days of the cool dry season whereas no significant changes of wpc were noticed between fg and non fg days of the hot dry season statistical analysis demonstrated that physiological parameters nee gpp etc wpc gs and tc were mainly regulated by the concomitant changes of tair and vpd during cool dry fg days the study suggests that low fog occurrence would cause greater dry season demand for groundwater in rubber plantations and decrease ecosystem wpc these results highlight the importance of fog and the relevant processes need to be included in ecosystem modeling long term study is essential to understand local fog climatology sustainable management plans should be balanced against the ecological as well as the socioeconomic benefits of rubber plantations which provide livelihoods to smallholders and their employees tropical asia particularly sea is most likely to face water scarcity and water demand with future droughts linked to large scale deforestation and global warming ismail and go 2021 which will increase vulnerability to water scarcity for rubber plantations as well as agricultural crops in montane areas of sea drought in the dry season can be partially relieved by fog occurrence our study highlights that during fg days the rubber plantation utilized less water and thus increased the wpc therefore the rubber farmers should implement etc based adaptive irrigation management systems for better yield particularly during the dry season of the non fg season finally we also suggest that the irrigation schedule be minimized for other agricultural crops of the region on fg days which will also help in conserving water to sustain agriculture during the dry season credit authorship contribution statement palingamoorthy gnanamoorthy conceptualization

3246,the rapid conversion of tropical rainforests into monoculture plantations of rubber hevea brasiliensis in southeast asia sea necessitates understanding of rubber tree physiology under local climatic conditions frequent fog immersion in the montane regions of sea may affect the water and carbon budgets of the rubber trees and the plantation ecosystems we studied the effect of fog on various plant physiological parameters in a mature rubber plantation in southwest china over 3 years during the study period an average of 141 fog events occurred every year and the majority occurred during the dry season when the temperature was relatively low in addition to the low temperature fog events were also associated with low vapor pressure deficit atmospheric water potential relative humidity and frequent wet canopy conditions we divided the dry season into cool dry november february and hot dry march april seasons and classified days into foggy fg and non foggy non fg days during the fg days of the cool dry season the physiological activities of the rubber trees were suppressed where carbon assimilation and evapotranspiration showed reductions of 4 and 15 respectively compared to the cool dry non fg days importantly the unequal declines in carbon assimilation and evapotranspiration led to enhanced crop water productivity wpc on cool dry fg days but insignificant wpc values were found between fg and non fg days of the hot dry season our results suggest that by regulating plant physiology fog events during the cool dry season significantly reduce water demand and alleviate water stress for the trees through improved wpc keywords canopy conductance evapotranspiration eddy covariance net ecosystem co2 exchange sap flow transpiration 1 introduction the montane areas 300 m elevation of southeast asia sea are rich in natural resources and considered to be one of the global biodiversity hotspots and important regions of primary forest carbon stock fox et al 2014 blagodatsky et al 2016 however in recent decades these areas have been experiencing severe biodiversity loss and environmental risks due to the conversion of natural tropical rainforests into monoculture plantations of rubber hevea brasiliensis myers et al 2000 tan et al 2011 zakari et al 2020 for example in the southwest edge of china xishuangbanna rubber trees were first introduced in the late 1950s and its land coverage reached 22 by 2010 forming a new non traditional environmental area zhu et al 2004 xu et al 2014 giambelluca et al 2016 such large scale changes in land use patterns in natural forests have led to serious environmental problems that have affected the regional and local forest carbon blagodatsky et al 2016 warren thomas et al 2018 and water balances tan et al 2011 pfeifer et al 2016 predominantly the rubber plantations reduce groundwater recharge due to the high rainwater runoff ma et al 2019 and also introduce pollution due to fertilizer and pesticide applications zakari et al 2020 further owing to their larger xylem vessels and comprehensive root system rubber trees consume more water than rainforest trees isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 tan et al 2011 yang et al 2020 making them more vulnerable to drought consequently a much higher rate of canopy evapotranspiration etc was found in rubber plantations than in the local natural ecosystems guardiola claramonte et al 2010 tan et al 2011 giambelluca et al 2016 the etc was significantly lower during the dry season than in the wet season due to drought and defoliation patterns isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 kobayashi et al 2014 niu et al 2017 hardanto et al 2017 lin et al 2018a b röll et al 2019 during the dry season fog events occur frequently in xishuangbanna as in many mountainous ecosystems bruijnzeel 2001 the moisture input from the fog is believed to partially relieve the stresses from lower temperatures and drought of the dry season zhang et al 2014 fu et al 2016 thereby allowing high rubber production in this region priyadarshan 2011 these fog events can influence the carbon water and energy budgets of the ecosystem in various ways for example the fog maintains water in plants and soils by reducing transpiration through frequent leaf wetting bruijnzeel 2001 alvarado barrientos et al 2014 berry et al 2014 gerlein safdi et al 2018a at the same time the foliar uptake of fog water can diminish the leaf water deficit and enhance leaf gas exchange rates berry et al 2014 baguskas et al 2017 which in turn lead to ecosystem rehydration in a dry environment eller et al 2013 the foggy fg days can enhance the ecosystem productivity because the fog diffused light can be used by plants for photosynthesis mercado et al 2009 berry et al 2014 however some studies also reported that leaf wetting can weaken photosynthetic carbon assimilation during a dense fog event even under the presence of adequate sunlight zhang et al 2014 gerlein safdi et al 2018b bittencourt et al 2019 furthermore changes in the environmental conditions such as air temperature tair net radiation rn photosynthetically active radiation par relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd during fog events can also have a substantial influence on ecosystem water use and productivity ritter et al 2009 2017 baguskas et al 2018 overall the responses of both carbon uptake and evapotranspiration to fog can vary among ecosystems with different tree species for rubber plantations it is still not clear how changes in productivity and evapotranspiration during fog events affect the ecosystem water use efficiency which to a large extent defines their vulnerability to drought stress during the dry season the importance of fog in forest ecosystems has been recognized and debated for centuries hales 1757 stone 1957 but it is only in recent years that the development of new techniques such as high precision gas exchange measurements xylem sap flow and stable isotopes has allowed us to investigate the effect of fog on water and carbon processes in different ecosystems bruijnzeel et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 alvarado barrientos et al 2014 chu et al 2014 gotsch et al 2014 baguskas et al 2018 gerlein safdi et al 2018a b bittencourt et al 2019 however the extent to which the leaves of rubber plants can maintain net co2 assimilation in the fog season is not known we need to study the degree of rubber plant physiology responses to different fog and cloud regimes from fg to cloudy and non foggy non fg days in a systematic manner therefore our

cao et al 1996 tan et al 2010 causing frequent fog events particularly at night and in the early morning liu et al 2004 fog events are less frequent in the wet season due to deep orographic convection

saturating distance of 20 000 m the data were recorded every minute by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut united states following the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 1995 fog events are defined as occasions when visibility is 1 000 m and mist or light fog event as occasions when visibility is between 1 000 and 2 000 m vautard et al 2009 dense fog occurs when visibility is 400 m witiw and ladochy 2008 the identification of fog events was first introduced by tardif and rasmussen 2007 and fog events are defined as occasions during which atmospheric visibility of 2 000 m is recorded for at least 3 h within 5 sequential h with a visibility of 1 000 m recorded at least once in this time period thus occasions with visibilities 2 000 m lasting 2 h were not included in our study as fog events we compared the visibility data with precipitation data to distinguish rainfall from fog events we excluded occasions when visibility was 2 000 m with rainfall 0 5 mm h 1 as well as occasions when visibility was 1 000 m while rainfall was 0 1 mm h 1 it is noted that fog events occurred mostly during the dry season when rainfall is relatively scarce

rubber trees to measure the sap flow rate js using the heat dissipation method following granier 1985 1987 fig s2 each sap flow probe setup consisted of two cylindrical metal needle probes length 20 mm diameter 2 mm sap flow probes were inserted radially into the outermost 2 cm of the stem at breast height 1 4 m with a distance of approximately 10 cm between the two sensor probes to avoid thermal interference lin et al 2018b the probes of each unit were sealed with insulating silicone and the whole system was covered with an aluminum reflector to protect it from solar radiation temperature

small ludwig et al 2006 especially under low vpd in fg days dawson et al 2007 the empirical parameter α was 119 g m 2 s 1 and the dimensionless parameter β was set to 1 231 according to granier 1985

by zhao et al 2014 2 6 statistical analysis the turbulence regime is normally well developed between 06 00 and 21 00 in hilly regions mildenberger et al 2009 since this study mainly focuses on processes that occur during the daytime i e ecosystem co2 uptake and wpc only data between 06 00 and 21 00 were used given that ecosystem respiration were not significantly different between fg and non fg days during both the cool and hot dry seasons fig s5 excluding nighttime data does not affect our comparison of co2 fluxes between fg and non fg days the daily mean values of physiological nee gpp etc wpc gs and tc and micrometeorological tair vpd and par variables were computed and compared between the fg and non fg days during the cool and hot dry seasons we performed one way analysis of

p occurred during the wet season of the study period fig 2c during the fog events the minimum atmospheric visibility was within 100 400 m dense fog 500 800 m and 900 1 000 m in 44 25 and 31 occasions respectively fig 3 a fog occurred mostly in the early morning hours 02 00 10 00 and dissipated 1 2 h after sunrise fig 3b the leaf wetting i e leaf wetness drops below 0 15 mω events due to fog were also frequent in the early morning hours and dry seasonal canopy wet conditions lasted on average for 8 8 h day in fg days fig 3c 3 2 changes in micrometeorological factors on foggy days compared with non fg days in the cool dry season we observed an 5 p 0 01 reduction in tair on cool dry fg days particularly in the months of december and january the average tair was 16 c and 16 5 c on cool dry fg and non fg days respectively fig 4 a whereas average tair was found to be similar level during the fg 22 6 c and non fg 22 7 c days of hot dry season further we observed no significant changes in vpd ψatm and rh on fg days relative to non fg days in both cool and hot dry seasons fig 4 b c e a 192 p 0 01 increases in leaf wetness were found on fg days when compared with non fg days of both cool and

fg days fig 4f 3 3 physiological effects of fog on rubber plantations the nee gpp etc wpc gs and tc were generally higher in the wet season than during the dry season fig 5 a f in the middle of february during the dry season there was a brief but sharp drop in gpp and wpc due to leaf shedding of the rubber tree which recovered after new leaves began to sprout in march the nee cool dry p 0 47

the etc and gs reduced by 15 and 38 respectively in fg days relative to non fg days in the cool dry season p 0 01 but they were not different between the fg and non fg days in the hot dry season interestingly wpc increased significantly by 12 3 during cool fg compared with cool non fg days p 0 01 but insignificant during hot fg and hot non fg days we found that for most of the dry season except january 2015 p etc was 0 mm which indicates water deficit fig 7 a the sm in the top soil layer 5 cm showed distinct seasonal variations with the values ranging from 22 december 2014 to 34 august 2014 and the values were generally lower during the dry season 27 7 3 than during the wet season 29 4 2 8 fig 7b overall the ecosystem was exposed to soil water stress from the beginning of october to the end of april 3 4 dependence of physiology on meteorological variables multiple linear regression models explained 40 48 30 26 53 and 41 of the nee gpp etc wpc gs and tc variances respectively during cool dry fg days table 1 the vpd p 0 001 was the most important factor in explaining the nee 60 gpp 75 and wpc 60 models while tair had the highest contributions in the etc 86 gs

models on cool dry non fg days finally on both cool dry fg and non fg days tair and vpd were the significant factors in most models table 1 the vpd p 0 001 was the most important factor in explaining the nee 60 gpp 58 and wpc 73 models while tair had the highest contributions in the etc 86 and tc 62 models for hot dry fg days the par had the highest influences in the gs 65 models for hot dry fg days in contrast with hot dry fg days tair p 0 001 had significant contribution in the nee 84 gpp 89 wpc 41 and tc 91 models while par and vpd had the highest contributions in the etc 44 and gs 76 respectively in hot dry non fg days finally we were not found any similar kind of most significant factors in both hot dry fg and non fg days table 1 on both cool dry fg and non fg days the nee increased linearly with vpd slope 0 69 r2 0 30 p 0 001 and slope 0 36 r2 0 14 p 0 001 respectively fig 8 a however cool dry fg days showed higher positive relationship than the cool dry non fg days the gpp generally decreased with increasing vpd slope 0 77 r2 0 40 p 0 001 on cool dry fg days but on the cool dry non fg days relationships were significantly lower than the cool dry fg days vpd

fg days of cool dry season slope 0 86 r2 0 27 p 0 001 fig 8f 4 discussion 4 1 variations in fog occurrence seasonal fog is a common phenomenon in montane regions bruijnzeel et al 2011 to monitor fog events with higher accuracy laser based sensor is an important first step in understanding how fog influences the tropical rubber tree s function the fog occurrence in xishuangbanna region was more frequent during the dry season than during the wet season table s1 the fog mainly forms around 3 00 a m and dissipates 1 2 h after sunrise in most fog events 80 of the year figs 2 3 however our data 141 12 fog events annually indicates that fog events were much fewer than the earlier reported values 258 58 fog events annually liu et al 2004 and this could be due to the large scale deforestation of tropical rainforests and conversion into monoculture rubber plantations in xishuangbanna in the past decade zhang et al 2014 the rubber plantations have a lower lai than tropical rainforest rusli and majid 2014 thus canopy alteration increases the albedo higher radiation reflection ratio which reduces the overall clouds fog in the region hauser et al 2015 our results suggest that the highly frequent dense fog events were of the radiation fog type tardif and rasmussen 2007 and occurred in the cool dry season november february the dense fog events reduce chilling damage to tropical plants including rubber trees and help maintain the tropical rainforests as well as agricultural crops of the region zongdao and xueqin 1983 zhang et al 2014 4 2 fog events enhance crop water productivity we found significant improvement 12 3 in ecosystem wpc in fg days in the cool dry season even with the deciduous nature of rubber trees intense leaf shedding from january to february fig s6 but not in the hot dry season fig 6 this enhanced wpc was mainly induced by the reduction in etc while nee and gpp showed no significant changes on cool dry fg days when compared with cool dry non fg days the difference in etc was mainly due to the decreased evaporation during cool dry fg days whereas no significant changes of tc was noticed as rubber trees are less active during this period due to leaf senescence after the short rubber trees started to actively transpire as new leaves grew in hot dry season leading to no etc difference between fg and non fg days fig 6 the low evapotranspiration during fog events is associated with low vpd which reduces atmospheric water stress ritter et al 2009 alvarado barrientos et al 2014 the enhanced wpc found on cool dry fg days in this study is consistent with other observations for example in a strawberry crop field baguskas et al 2018 2021 the water stressed crops can also use dew as a water resource in semi arid maize fields resulting in greater wpc yokoyama et al 2021 in contrast to our study the wpc increase under fg conditions was driven by reductions in both etc and nee with sharper drops in etc than in nee gerlein safdi et al 2018b baguskas et al 2018 whereas we found no changes in nee of the rubber plantation on cool dry fg days compared with cool dry non fg days fig 6 the dry season represents the driest period with little rainfall in xishuangbanna the net carbon uptake is the lowest during the cool dry season fig 5 which could make the trees vulnerable to the drought stress the foggy conditions in the cool dry season enhance ecosystem wpc via evaporation reduction and decrease water loss from the system which could be an important mechanism to mitigate the plant physiological stress and impairment in response to the drought during the period the high carbon uptake rates of the rubber plantation were mainly linked to the timing of the fog events which can affect plant physiological functions bittencourt et al 2019 in most studies the fog events occur from morning to afternoon which limits the transpiration and plant productivity ritter et al 2009 baguskas et al 2018 2021 at our site most of the fog events 80 lasted from midnight to early morning and fog usually dissipated within 2 h of sunrise consequently the canopy remained wet for 8 8 h till mid day fig 3c driving leaf water uptake and the rehydration of plant tissues which resulted in the overall reduction of transpiration eller et al 2013 chu et al 2014 alvarado barrientos et al 2015 at the same time dissipated fog did not significantly affect the light availability on fg days fig 4f consequently rubber trees can still maintain a high carbon uptake rate on fg days considering the trade off between water loss and carbon uptake our study suggests that fog events help increase the efficiency of plant water use which enhances the tolerance of rubber trees to drought stress during the dry season 4 3 foggy days suppress tc and etc we found insignificant changes in tc over cool dry season are due to the intense defoliation and low temperature which suppressed the transpirations rate january to february fig 6 s6 which is inconsistent with findings from other forests and crop fields with frequent fog occurrences for example tree transpiration was suppressed which ranged from 25 to 40 under fg conditions when compared with non fg conditions in various forest ecosystems hutley et al 1997 ritter et al 2009 gerlein safdi et al 2018b similarly several studies also highlighted that the presence of fog affects the microclimatic conditions and reduces evapotranspiration in tropical montane cloud forest ecosystems hildebrandt et al 2007 bruijnzeel et al 2011 bittencourt et al 2019 potato farm ramírez et al 2018 and also in a strawberry farm baguskas et al 2021 which is consistent with our findings that etc 15 rates ecosystem water loss were significantly suppressed during cool dry fog events fig 6 most of these studies suggest that the suppressed tc and etc during fog events is likely related to the associated changes in tair vpd ψatm lower radiation and frequent canopy wetting ritter et al 2009 baguskas et al 2018 we also obtained evidence that the fog reduced the tair and vpd which were significantly p 0 001 correlated to tc and etc in fg days table 1 fig 8 this could be due to lower tair and vpd which lead to a reduced evaporative demand fig 4 and lower the water stress during the dry season fig 7 the fog events subsequently should enhance the leaf and stem water potential that reduces the water demand in the dry season which was also evidenced from the study of fu et al 2016 who demonstrated that fog is an important water source for woody plants in the asian tropical karst forest of xishuangbanna thus it is likely that rubber trees utilize fog as additional source of water through foliar water uptake during leaf wetting events eller et al 2013 2016 berry et al 2014 this pathway can be particularly important to alleviate drought stress during prolonged dry season elliott et al 2006 fu et al 2016 at the same time the increased ψatm also facilitated rehydration for plants under conditions of soil water deficit baguskas et al 2018 we suggest that leaf wetting events which enhance leaf surface vaporization and minimize tc rates can be a major driver for the etc for the rubber plantation and should be considered in future studies regarding tropical fog overall frequent leaf wetting and reduced atmospheric water stress due to fog events could be important water sources for tropical crops particularly in the dry season the magnitude of transpiration largely depends on soil water status as well as atmospheric water demand teuling and troch 2005 the sharp sm decrease in the dry season was due to the shortage of rainfall fig 7b the high vpd in the dry season is expected to reduce soil water content through increased soil surface evaporation yang et al 2020 the rubber plantations showed larger etc than p during most of the dry season indicating water deficit fig 7a moreover sm was not a key driver for etc and tc at our site fig 7 and other rubber plantation sites around the world guardiola claramonte et al 2008 george et al 2009 gonkhamdee et al 2010 kobayashi et al 2014 niu et al 2017 several investigations revealed that rubber trees efficiently use the available water in the deep root zone to avoid severe water stress during the dry season guardiola claramonte et al 2010 liu et al 2014a b kumagai et al 2015 importantly soil water is extracted from deep layers at the rubber site but is not released by transpiration until new foliage is grown therefore we suggest that sm is not the main water source for trees during the dry season but sm increase during the fg season can become crucial in extreme drought events when deep soil water is depleted and should be considered in future studies 5 conclusion fog events and meteorological parameters during fg and non fg days of cool and hot dry seasons as well as concurring tc and wpc of mature rubber h brasiliensis plantations were studied in detail the analysis of 3 years of continuous observation showed that fog occurred during 42 of the total study period during the highly frequent dense fog events in the dry season tair often dropped below 5 c which triggered leaf shedding of rubber trees and thus they became physiologically less active compared with cool dry non fg days the presence of fog was associated with lower etc rates 15 lower in addition net carbon uptake rate is generally low during cool dry season the dense fg days did not affect gpp but decreased etc leading to an enhanced wpc during the fg days compared with the non fg days of the cool dry season whereas no significant changes of wpc were noticed between fg and non fg days of the hot dry season statistical analysis demonstrated that physiological parameters nee gpp etc wpc gs and tc were mainly regulated by the concomitant changes of tair and vpd during cool dry fg days the study suggests that low fog occurrence would cause greater dry season demand for groundwater in rubber plantations and decrease ecosystem wpc these results highlight the importance of fog and the relevant processes need to be included in ecosystem modeling long term study is essential to understand local fog climatology sustainable management plans should be balanced against the ecological as well as the socioeconomic benefits of rubber plantations which provide livelihoods to smallholders and their employees tropical asia particularly sea is most likely to face water scarcity and water demand with future droughts linked to large scale deforestation and global warming ismail and go 2021 which will increase vulnerability to water scarcity for rubber plantations as well as agricultural crops in montane areas of sea drought in the dry season can be partially relieved by fog occurrence our study highlights that during fg days the rubber plantation utilized less water and thus increased the wpc therefore the rubber farmers should implement etc based adaptive irrigation management systems for better yield particularly during the dry season of the non fg season finally we also suggest that the irrigation schedule be minimized for other agricultural crops of the region on fg days which will also help in conserving water to sustain agriculture during the dry season credit authorship contribution statement palingamoorthy gnanamoorthy conceptualization

3247,although the growing number of synthetic aperture radar sar satellites has increased their application in flood extent mapping predictive models for the analysis of flood dynamics that are independent of sensor characteristics must be developed to fully extract information from sar images for flood mitigation this study aimed to develop hybrid machine learning models for flood mapping in the ahvaz region iran based on sar data each hybrid model consists of a support vector machine svm algorithm coupled with one of the following metaheuristic optimization procedures grey wolf optimization gwo differential evolution and the imperialist competitive algorithm sentinel 1 acquired sar images before and during flooding between 20 march and 26 may of 2019 the goodness of fit level and predictive capability of each model were scrutinized using overall accuracy producer accuracy and user accuracy the svm gwo approach yielded the highest accuracy with overall accuracies of 96 07 and 93 39 in the training and validation steps respectively furthermore this hybrid model provided the most accurate classification of water inundation class based on producer accuracy 96 67 and user accuracy 95 05 the results highlight that wetland is the last land use land cover type to return to normal conditions due to the many previously dry oxbow lakes that could trap water for a long time furthermore the nine most suitable sites for flood protection structures e g embankments and levees were identified based on floodwater distribution analysis this work describes a robust data

mason et al 2014 flood mapping using observational data provides useful basic information about flood extent over large floodplains and can support decision making and planning for flood mitigation cian et al 2018 mohammadi et al 2017 however predicting spatiotemporal flood dynamics with regard to meandering rivers and flood inundation in river floodplains using hydraulic principles remains challenging due to the recession of flood waves through complex hydro morphodynamic processes guan et al 2015 recently several studies have noted that providing rapid information for flood mitigation is one of the most important factors for effective floodplain management although in situ measurements i e hydrological gauge data underpin the current understanding of flood temporal dynamics temporal patterns of discharge they cannot provide sufficient information about the spatial dynamics of flood inundation in floodplains papa et al 2008 in addition hydrological gauges are sometimes destroyed during the flood storm surge remote sensing technology has strengths in quantifying the spatial and temporal patterns of flooding at a large scale providing tools for measuring the responses

data for flood inundation mapping in an urban environment and indicated that sar data could reveal important information on flood extent combining a developed hydraulic and hydrologic model with remote sensing and geographic information system gis data has been used to improve flood detection accuracy in integrated water resource management zeng et al 2020 for example woodbridge et al 2016 applied flood extents obtained using long term recorded remote sensing data park and latrubesse 2017 assessed the hydrological conditions and hydro geomorphologic complexity of the lower amazon river floodplain using remote sensing and field control data pontes et al 2017 monitored changes in floodplain river systems using mgb iph a hydrologic and hydraulic model coupled with gis capolongo et al 2019 combined sar and optical landsat 8 images and geomorphology data with hydrological models for long term monitoring of flood dynamics in past flood events recently dasgupta et al 2018 developed an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system model for flood analysis based on sar images of the clarence catchment of new south wales australia their results demonstrated that the proposed approach could obtain the most useful information for flood analysis from sar images with drastically reduced errors compared to the other approaches tested machine learning algorithms represent a multidisciplinary approach as they build upon concepts and ideas from computer science statistics and optimization methods they are widely used in remote sensing image classification to separate data from a given dataset into desired classes usually land use land cover types cervantes et al 2020 du et al 2019 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 tian et al 2020 xie and sun 2020 previous studies have established the advantages of machine learning approaches and demonstrated their contribution to improvements in the spatiotemporal analysis of flood dynamics however questions remain with respect to whether coupling machine learning models with metaheuristic algorithms would affect the accuracy of dynamic analysis of floodwater spread using sar images support vector machine svm is one of the best known machine learning techniques and has been effectively applied in many disciplines and fields especially in flood susceptibility mapping insom et al 2015 sahana et al 2020 tang et al 2019 tehrany et al 2014 svm establishes a classification hyperplane as the decision surface which maximizes the correct transformation of raw data to determine the land cover and whether a pixel is a flood point allowing prediction of the probability of flood occurrence wang et al 2020a yu and lu 2018 however despite the benefits of svm its parameters require optimization which is often time consuming lin et al 2020 qu et al 2020 wang et al 2020b the limitations of commonly used svm models have been discussed in this context and practical options to improve the accuracy and robustness of maps have been offered such as coupling a standalone svm with metaheuristic algorithms the objectives of the study were to understand spatiotemporal flood dynamics using sar data and a hybrid machine learning approach compare the prediction performance of the developed models and identify suitable locations for flood protection structures based on the flood distribution pattern to our knowledge this is the first application of a hybrid approach to monitoring flood dynamics using sentinel 1 images each hybrid model consists of a svm algorithm coupled with one of the following metaheuristic optimization procedures differential evolution de grey wolf optimization gwo and the imperialist competitive algorithm ica the proposed framework seeks to improve the understanding of large scale spatiotemporal patterns of water distribution after flooding which will benefit flood management in addition this framework can reproduce flood dynamics and support flood modeling in areas with meandering rivers based on our results svm can be combined with metaheuristic algorithms to better extract information from sar images for exploring spatiotemporal flood dynamics 2 study area the study area is located north of ahvaz city a large city in iran with a population of around 1 4 million the boundary coordinates are 48 35 55ʹʹ e and 31 20 45ʹʹ n fig 1 here there is an important river named karoon our case study covers 90 km of this river with a floodplain area of 1216 km2 the lithology of the study area is the quaternary unit including low level piedmont fan and valley terrace deposits yousefi et al 2018 according to köppen s climate classification the study area has a subtropical hot desert climate with cool short winters and long hot summers the average annual precipitation is 230 mm the annual temperature during summer is 42 45 c with many dust storms in winter the minimum temperature is 5 c annually the long term average annual discharge of the river at the ahvaz gauging station is 575 m3s 1 and the maximum annual discharge is 2995 m3s 1 previous studies indicated that the channel width of the river has been significantly affected by floods during past decades and severe erosion sedimentation interactions in the meandering reaches and high mobilization of channel sediments can be seen in the study area yousefi et al 2018 the meandering karoon river which has the widest catchment area and highest discharge among all rivers in iran originates in the zard kuh mountains in the zagros region with an elevation of 4548 m a s l and receives many tributaries such as the kuhrang and the dez before passing through ahvaz city the capital of khuzestan province in iran before emptying into the arvand rud river at an elevation of 12 m a s l agriculture is the major land use in the study area occupying 82 8 of the total area the karoon river plays a vital role in supplying water for agricultural activities orchards and farming in khuzestan province one of the most important agricultural provinces of iran woodbridge et al 2016 yousefi et al 2016 hence the floodplain of this river is highly populated 3 5 million people and under flood risk nourani and mano 2007 salarijazi 2012 tahmasbine et al 2012 the floodplain of the river has been considerably affected by human interventions such as mining sites land use changes and irrigation canals many large dams have been constructed on the river for various purposes including energy production the provision of drinking water and irrigation during the last four decades woodbridge et al 2016 yousefi et al 2016 the study area is highly susceptible to flooding with insurance companies claiming that flooding in 2019 destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure the agricultural sector suffered enormous damage and several people in the region died rajabizadeh et al 2020 fig 2 shows field photographs of floods that had occurred in the study area 3 methodology remote sensing data especially sar data can be integrated with machine learning algorithms to predict flood extents in the present study sar images from before the flood event were processed to generate a land cover map afterward for each land cover category reference point datasets were generated for training the models then sar images from the flood event were processed using standalone and hybrid models i e svm svm gwo svm ica and svm de to build land cover maps and determine the areas covered with water next the accuracy of the models in the training and validation steps were assessed using statistical methods finally suitable locations for flood control measures were determined fig 3 illustrates the adopted methodology in this study 3 1 sar data and pre processing sar is a key remote sensing method for flood monitoring under different weather conditions sentinel 1 acquired sar images before and during flooding between 20 march and 26 may of 2019 sar images were obtained based on the open data policy of the copernicus program which provides sar data for global earth monitoring by the scientific community unlike this dataset that is distributed online for free access to commercial images such as terrasar x is restricted for cost related reasons in developing countries first a pre processing step was implemented that includes geometric correction i e geocoding radiometric calibration i e calculation of backscatter values speckle filtering i e noise removal and the application of exclusion layers pre processing was executed using the open source sentinel application platform software the last pre processing step limits commission errors for example roads are man made flat surfaces that usually have low backscatter response and consequently can be confused with water grimaldi et al 2020 as suggested by walker et al 2011 a gamma filter with a 3 3 kernel size was considered at this stage to achieve noise reduction without omitting details heavy rainfall in the study area in april 2019 caused a widespread and long lasting flood between april and may of 2019 in this area the hybrid models proposed in this paper were tested on 12 sar images acquired in ascending orbit during the 2019 flood event according to hydrological interpretations it was a 1 in 120 year flood occurrence that took place along the karoon river and led to damages and human losses in the ahvaz region time series data with different polarizations were employed to produce land use maps table 1 from a polarimetry viewpoint sentinel 1 can collect a set of images from the same series of pulses to record specific polarizations simultaneously in other words it can transmit a signal with either vertical v or horizontal h polarization and then receive with both v and h polarizations in general the four combinations of transmitting and receiving polarizations are hh horizontal transmission and horizontal reception vv vertical transmission and vertical reception hv horizontal transmission and vertical reception and vh vertical transmission and horizontal reception the vv and hh polarization combinations are denoted like polarized whereas the hv and vh combinations are termed cross polarized abdikan et al 2016 showed that vv polarization vh polarization and their computed difference vv vh can be applied to classify land cover with high accuracy in this study for land cover classification level 1 ground range detected grd products of sentinel 1 with vv vh and vv vh polarizations were used for this purpose the grd sar data were multi looked and projected to ground range by applying the earth ellipsoid model sentinel 1 level 1 grd product data were calibrated and filtered using a 3 3 kernel applying the gamma map technique in addition terrain correction was done by resampling 25 m shuttle radar topography mission data farr and kobrick 2000 to a ground resolution pixel size of 20 m the digital number values of the sar data were converted into backscatter values on a decibel scale pre processing was done by employing the european space agency esa sentinel 1 toolbox s1tbx in the sentinel application platform provided by the esa after processing the sar images and determining the land cover land use classes i e water residential area agricultural area and bare land the reference point datasets were generated during field surveys for building models and validation purposes for each category 100 points were considered in binary form and divided randomly into two parts at a ratio of 70 30 for training and validation respectively lei et al 2021 li et al 2021 roy et al 2021 3 2 application of the standalone and hybrid models 3 2 1 svm svm as a supervised machine learning algorithm is based on statistical learning theory involving structural risk minimization it is a powerful means for linear and non linear classification as well as solving non linear regression problems svm differs from other classification algorithms in its capability for remarkable generalization performance another significant feature is its high accuracy in classifying data when the training dataset is limited consequently this method is highly applied in remote sensing studies abdikan et al 2016 mountrakis et al 2011 in svm a model is generated based on a functional margin and separation is carried out along the hyperplane with the maximum margin within the nearest training data sample abhang et al 2016 for non linear classification this algorithm employs a kernel function to transform inputs into high dimensional feature space it is worth mentioning that among various types of kernel functions the radial basis function is one of the more efficient and practical kernels used in developing an svm model liu et al 2021 sahana et al 2020 satarzadeh et al 2022 setting good svm hyper parameters plays a key role in classification accuracy therefore the ica gwo or the de algorithm was hybridized with svm to optimize the parameters detailed information about the svm algorithm and its equations can be found in previous literature cervantes et al 2020 cura 2020 geiß et al 2019 ghaddar and naoum sawaya 2018 lazri and ameur 2018 okwuashi and ndehedehe 2020 panahi et al 2021 and zhou et al 2018 3 2 2 svm gwo mirjalili et al 2014 proposed gwo a meta heuristic swarm intelligent algorithm that emulates the internal leadership hierarchy and hunting process of gray wolves the pyramid of gray wolf social hierarchy has four levels at the top of this pyramid is the leader called alpha α the alpha has the responsibility to lead and guide the group as well as decide the sleeping location hunting and sleeping time etc at the second and third levels are the betas β and deltas δ betas transfer the orders of the leader to the other group members deltas have critical roles in protecting the pack against enemies at the base of the pyramid omega ω wolves play a critical role in reducing infighting gupta and deep 2019 tu et al 2019 the main steps of mathematical modeling of gwo can be described as follows first to simulate the gray wolf social hierarchy structure the best fitting solution providing the maximum knowledge about prey positions is considered α then the second and third best fitting solutions are β and δ respectively the rest of the candidate solutions are categorized as ω luo and zhao 2019 in this algorithm the hunting process is controlled by α β and δ and ω follows these three groups while hunting gray wolves surround their prey to model this behavior the following equations are applied mirjalili et al 2014 1 d c x p t x t c 2 r 2 2 x t 1 x p t a d a 2 a r 1 a where t represents the current iteration of the algorithm and a and c are the coefficient vectors the value of α linearly decreases between 2 and 0 over the course of iterations x p is the vector representing prey position and x represents the gray wolf location vector in addition r 1 and r 2 are random vectors in the range of 0 1 notably c is one of the most important parameters in the search process and has the role of balancing the exploration and exploitation capabilities of this algorithm chen et al 2019 wang and li 2019 moreover a is another controlling parameter that plays a main role in the exploration process faris et al 2018 gao and zhao 2019 guha et al 2016 li et al 2021 niu et al 2018 finally to simulate the mathematics of the hunting step the top three solutions α β and δ are saved as the optimal solutions the rest of the wolves the ω wolves update their location based on the α β and δ locations sultana et al 2016 3 2 3 svm ica the ica designed based on human socio political evolution starts with random numbers of solutions in a search space called countries some of these solutions with minimum cost are called imperialists and the rest of the countries are colonies that are divided among the imperialists maheri and talezadeh 2018 in the next step imperialists compete with one another according to their strength to take more countries as their colonies therefore when a colony moves x units toward an imperialist the direction is represented by a vector from the colony to the imperialist x is a continuous random variable with uniform distribution determined by rabiee et al 2018 3 x u 0 β d where β is a number between 1 and 2 with uniform distribution and d represents the initial distance between a colony and an imperialist the total cost for an imperialist is dependent on the cost attributed to the imperialist itself and the average cost for its colonies which can be computed as follows aliniya and mirroshandel 2019 4 t c n c o s t i m p e r i a l i s t n ξ m e a n c o s t c olonies o f e m p i r e n where t c n is the total cost of the n th empire and ξ is a positive constant smaller than 1 zhang 2012 in the following iterations weaker empires will gradually lose their power during competition and be eliminated while stronger empires take over their colonies and increase their power after a while all empires except the most powerful will collapse and all colonies will go under the control of this empire which is considered the solution this algorithm continues until convergence and completion of all iterations occurs abdollahi et al 2013 kashani et al 2016 panahi et al 2022 for more detail on the ica refer to its main reference atashpaz gargari and lucas 2007 3 2 4 svm de de is an optimization algorithm introduced by storn and price 1997 this algorithm is powerful and quickly solves nonlinear and non differentiable optimization problems in continuous spaces the most important feature of this method is its high convergence speed and implementation simplicity sallam et al 2020 de is a population based approach and considered an evolutionary algorithm in this algorithm an initial random population is created according to eq 5 consisting of np vectors of x i where np is the number of members in a population as follows mohamed and almazyad 2017 5 x ij 0 x j l r a n d j x j u x j l where ran d j is a uniformly distributed number within 0 1 and x j l and x j u indicate the lower and upper bounds of x i respectively then for each target vector a mutant vector is yielded dhanalakshmy et al 2019 in the third step the target vector and mutant vector are mixed until a trial vector is generated in the final step the selection step every part of the population has an equal chance to be selected in a way that the fitness of each is evaluated based on an objective function further information about the de algorithm can be found in previous literature du et al 2016 elaziz et al 2020 hu et al 2021 nguyen trang et al 2019 opara and arabas 2019 özyön 2020 wu et al 2018 and yu et al 2020 3 3 post processing and evaluation strategy validation is one of the main parts of standard remote sensing analysis müller 2014 the quality of flood inundation maps created using remote sensing techniques must be evaluated brenning 2012 and forgoing detailed evaluation can impede successful practical application stehman and foody 2019 evaluation performance metrics were calculated using an error matrix also called the contingency or confusion matrix that included the proportion of the area of each class based on the validation data here referred to as reference data table 2 the accuracy of the hybrid and standalone models was evaluated by comparing the sar derived flood maps with real binary flood data retrieved from field surveys despite the widespread use of the kappa coefficient for classification accuracy assessment there are some concerns with its application in comparing the performance of models foody 2020 the most robust and common evaluation performance metric is overall accuracy oa in addition producer accuracy pa and user accuracy ua can be used to evaluate the classification accuracy for each class separately oa pa and ua can be calculated based on the following equations 6 oa n 1 n 4 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 7 pa n 1 n 1 n 3 8 ua n 1 n 1 n 2 where n 1 n 2 n 3 and n 4 are components of the error matrix explained in table 2 the oa metric denotes the proportion of reference samples that was classified correctly pa represents model accuracy and is calculated based on real features i e ground truthed that are correctly shown on the classified map it is also a complement of omission error ua reflects how many pixels in a given class on the classified map are present on the ground yuan et al 2005 ua is also the complement of commission error i e ua 100 commission error 100 points as the flood location data recorded during field surveys in march 2019 were used to create a reference flood map for calibration and validation purposes this in situ dataset provides the most reliable reference for assessing the robustness and accuracy of the presented models in this study the goodness of fit and predictive performance of all standalone svm and hybrid i e svm de svm gwo svm ica models were assessed based on oa pa and ua 3 4 statistical comparison of the models friedman and wilcoxon signed rank tests are common methods for statistically comparing the accuracy of models brardinoni et al 2003 smith et al 2002 tien bui et al 2016 the friedman test a non parametric method is a robust multiple comparison statistical test for recognizing significant differences across many models the null hypothesis h 0 in the friedman test is that there is no significant difference between the performance of all models the comparison is based on two parameters the p value and chi square χ 2 statistic the null hypothesis is rejected when the p value is less than the significance level α 0 05 and the chi square value is higher than the standard value i e 3 841 the friedman test only compares all models together in terms of significant differences but cannot provide a pairwise comparison of models to fill this gap the wilcoxon signed rank test is a suitable method that allows comparing models pair by pair hence in this study the wilcoxon signed rank test was also performed like the friedman test it is a non parametric method that assesses the significance of differences between two models based on two statistical factors the z value and p value after a pairwise comparison if the p value is less than 0 05 and the z value is out of the critical range 1 96 to 1 96 the null hypothesis is rejected and the two models are different importantly both friedman and wilcoxon signed rank tests assume neither homogeneity of variance nor normal distributions resulting in the generality and realism of these tests hernandez and maldonado correa 2017 3 5 identifying suitable locations for flood protection structures spatial prioritization for the construction of flood protection structures is pivotal for achieving optimal low cost and effective flood management gomez cunya et al 2020 therefore considering the broad scale of floodplains a logical approach is needed to identify suitable locations for flood protection measures qi et al 2022 this study proposed a procedure based on the observed flood pattern that allows managerial flexibility based on socio economic criteria in this analytical approach areas where river water overflows are designated as potential sites for constructing flood protection structures 4 results 4 1 application of the standalone and hybrid models in this study a standalone svm and three hybrid models were used for land use land cover classification of sar images fig 4 shows the original image of the study area a and the results of land use land cover classification of this image using the svm b svm de c svm ica d and svm gwo e models the results of goodness of fit assessment based on different evaluation metrics including oa pa and ua are shown in table s1 the standalone svm model had an overall accuracy of 89 29 in addition the pa and ua were 85 71 and 95 24 for the water inundation class respectively in other words the omission and commission errors for water inundated areas were 14 29 and 4 76 respectively the pa for other classes varied from 84 29 to 95 whereas the ua ranged from 83 13 to 96 72 among the hybrid models svm gwo outperformed the other models with an oa of 96 07 followed by svm ica 95 05 and svm de 93 04 importantly the highest pa 97 86 and ua 97 16 for the water inundation class were observed in the svm gwo and svm ica outputs respectively however goodness of fit analysis only explains the fit of the model to the training dataset and cannot evaluate model capabilities in terms of generalization and predictive performance in the validation step the results indicated that all hybrid models had a higher oa compared to the standalone svm model table 3 similar to the training step svm gwo was the best model based on oa 93 39 followed by svm de 92 47 and svm ica 91 67 the standalone svm model had the lowest predictive performance and generalizability based on oa 87 76 additionally svm gwo exhibited the highest pa 96 67 and ua 95 05 for identifying water inundated areas based on validation analysis of the svm gwo output the pas for the residential area wetland and agriculture classes were 92 86 95 71 and 97 86 whereas the uas were 98 49 97 10 and 91 95 respectively the output of the svm gwo model also had the lowest omission error 3 33 for water inundated area 8 33 for residential area 8 06 for wetland 5 for agricultural area and commission error 4 95 for water inundated area 3 51 for residential area 6 56 for wetland 10 94 for agricultural area although svm de was the second best model based on oa based on pa svm ica 96 67 low omission error had a better classification performance in terms of identifying water inundated areas compared to svm de 95 by contrast based on ua svm de 95 performed better than did svm ica 93 55 in classifying water inundated areas according to the above mentioned results svm gwo was selected as the best model based on all three evaluation metrics for investigating flood dynamics in the study area 4 2 statistical comparison of models the results of the friedman test are shown in table 4 the null hypothesis was rejected confirming that the models were significantly different the results of the wilcoxon signed rank test for pairwise comparison are summarized in table 5 this test clearly showed that the hybrid models performed differently thus each can be considered a distinct method 4 3 flood inundation dynamics in the study area twelve sar images acquired between 20 march and 26 may of 2019 were classified using the svm gwo model to delineate flood inundation locations in the study area fig 5 first the calculate geometry tool of arcgis software was used to calculate areas of different land use land cover classes on 20 march 2019 pre flood subsequently using the same approach land use land cover class areas were calculated from images captured during the flood event 27 march 2019 to 26 may 2019 fig 5 shows the changes in the areas of various land use land cover classes on different dates due to floodwaters entering the study area fig 5a depicts pre flood conditions on 20 march the area classified as water 3919 3 ha on this date represents permanent water bodies in the study area the residential wetland and agricultural areas were 3550 17 135 and 118 550 ha respectively floodwaters entered on 27 march 2019 submerging the study area under water fig 5b the water area rose to 6618 35 ha whereas the other land use land cover classes saw slight reductions residential 3530 ha wetland 15 610 ha agriculture 117 396 ha by 02 april fig 5c the water area had increased considerably to 17 992 ha whereas the residential wetland and agricultural areas had fallen to approximately 3392 14 070 and 107 702 ha respectively this trend continued fig 5d until the water area peaked at 57 439 ha on 14 april 2019 fig 5e and a dramatic increase in areas colored dark blue can be seen compared to the pre flood image fig 5a on this day the residential 2874 ha wetland 3294 ha and agricultural 79 547 ha areas reached their minimum values six days later on 20 april fig 5f the residential 3225 ha wetland 10 576 ha and agricultural 97 199 ha areas had increased whereas the water area fell significantly to 31 675 ha by 27 april 2019 the water area had fallen to 24 787 ha whereas the residential 3315 ha wetland 11 484 ha and agricultural 103 537 ha areas increased further fig 5g the water area fell by approximately 10 000 ha between 27 april and 02 may 2019 fig 5h whereas the other land use land cover areas increased by 08 may 2019 the water area had decreased to 11 113 33 ha and the areas of the other land use land cover classes increased moderately fig 5i on 14 may 2019 fig 5j water covered 10470 83 ha with 3507 46 14 568 09 and 114 784 97 ha of the study area classified as residential wetland and agricultural areas respectively the water area fell to 7633 ha by 20 may 2019 fig 5k on 26 may 2019 fig 5l 7564 41 ha of the study area was classified as water whereas 3543 15 069 and 117 051 ha were classified as residential wetland and agricultural areas respectively fig 6 indicates the proportion of inundated areas for various land use land cover classes on different dates overall although the total agricultural area 118 550 ha was larger than the total wetland area 17 135 ha a larger proportion of wetland was flooded compared to the agricultural and residential areas on 14 april 2019 when flooding peaked approximately 19 81 and 33 of the residential wetland and agricultural areas were flooded at this time the karoon river reached a peak water level bankfull of 5 3 m exceeding previous record levels from the two last decades subsequently the inundated areas began to decrease in all land use land cover classes with the proportions of inundated residential wetland and agricultural areas reaching 0 56 8 9 and 0 97 on 27 may 2019 and 0 2 12 and 1 2 on 26 may 2019 respectively the return of land use land cover types to normal status depends considerably on the natural characteristics of the land use land cover type geomorphological features and the geographical location wetland was the last land use land cover type to return to normal conditions see the yellow column in fig 5 from 14 may to 26 may this is primarily because most of the wetland area consisted of previously dry oxbow lakes that could retain water 4 4 suitable locations for flood protection structures based on the flood dynamics in the study area and the locations of areas that first began to be submerged suitable locations for flood protection structures such as embankments artificial levees are indicated in fig 7 nine locations are suggested for the construction of embankments embankments separate the floodplain from the river network and increases the river capacity preventing excess flood waters from leaving the river channel and submerging riparian zones 5 discussion 5 1 sar image analysis and classification performance of the models surface cover classification was mapped from sar images using svm and svm coupled with de the ica or gwo svm establishes a classification hyperplane directly from the raw data using minimal training data support vectors at the edge of class distributions and then finds optimal decision boundaries mountrakis et al 2011 each grid cell is considered a feature vector that contains information about different triggering factors which can be processed by svm and ensemble methods svm allowed efficient mapping of land use from sar images acquired on 20 march 2019 that covered the study area before flooding the svm model exhibited good predictive performance and predictive accuracy based on performance metrics for both the training and validation datasets as svm demonstrates superior classification accuracy of sar images compared to other machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks yu and lu 2018 with high computational efficiency and easy implementation svm shows good potential for use in multispectral classification problems such as land use classification as noted previously dasgupta et al 2018 joshi et al 2019 tang et al 2020 despite the good accuracy and classification performance of the svm model ensemble models featuring svm with three optimization algorithms outperformed the standalone method for sar analysis and land use classification several studies have reported that hybrid algorithms can outperform standalone models costache et al 2020 tien bui et al 2019 tikhamarine et al 2020 particularly model gwo combinations tikhamarine et al 2020 yu and lu 2018 kapoor et al 2017 reported the good performance of gwo in segmentation of satellite images the gwo algorithm achieves objective optimization by simulating actions such as tracking encircling and attacking prey in the hunting method used by gray wolf packs thus it is capable of efficiently balancing between exploration and exploitation and even better avoiding a large number of solutions in addition to providing rapid convergence stability and reliability high optimization precision and robust optimization ability tikhamarine et al 2020 yu and lu 2018 the accuracy assessment of the models adhered to protocols and was based on several performance metrics to achieve credible and rigorous comparisons previous studies combining feature extraction and reduction techniques such as the ica with svm have reported higher classification accuracies relative to the use of individual spectral bands bahari et al 2014 similar to our findings wang et al 2019 recorded improvements in flood susceptibility maps using the ica to optimize other machine learning methods the ica is based on social and human phenomena and is an algorithm that optimizes historical phenomena through mathematical modeling ghodousi et al 2016 it was previously used in bojnourd iran to analyze and prioritize citizens needs and satisfaction ghodousi et al 2016 however pourghasemi et al 2020 recorded higher accuracy levels with ensemble models using de rather than the ica for flood susceptibility mapping as recorded in our study the higher accuracy of de compared to the ica can be explained by their distinct calculation approaches the ica does not have an initial population but starts with a random response and is thus less accurate than other population approaches de also uses a population based stochastic search approach but it chooses the direction and distance of the current population from other members of the population to guide the search process in a desirable direction pourghasemi et al 2020 several machine learning algorithms have been used previously to reduce image speckle and false classification of land use for example dasgupta et al 2018 developed a neuro fuzzy flood mapping technique for texture enhancement of single sar images and improved the classification performance for different land cover classes shen et al 2019 used machine learning to derive near real time flood inundation products from satellites with high resolution sar sensors including sentinel 1 and envisat zeng et al 2020 used passive microwave remote sensing data combined with sar based flood mapping information to estimate flood extents li et al 2019 assessed the roles of sar intensity and interferometric coherence in urban flood detection by using a self learning convolution neural network framework to analyze multi temporal terrasar x data 5 2 remote sensing and dynamic flood monitoring remote sensing and sar in particular provide suitable spatiotemporal data for estimating floodwater distribution especially in large arid zone floodplains where inundation persists for weeks fig 4 however the accuracy is dependent on the revisit frequency and length of records as reported by previous authors mohammadi et al 2017 zeng et al 2020 according to dasgupta et al 2018 the growing number of sar satellites makes them the most reliable data resource currently for flood monitoring for the present analysis the 12 snapshots recorded by the satellite at various times between 20 march pre flood and 26 may 2019 in the ahvaz region of iran enabled a good characterization of different flood situations including flooded agricultural residential and wetland areas affected for more than 2 months although wetland was the most affected by the flood with 80 of the area inundated during the peak flooding observed on 14 april significant proportions of agricultural 25 and urban 20 areas were also affected fig 5 on 26 may 12 2 and 1 of the wetland agricultural and residential areas were still affected by the flood similar to this study zeng et al 2020 used a sequence of sar images to extract timely information on flooding in southern and central china in agricultural fields apart from the direct impact of inundation on crops poor aeration in flooded soils triggers changes in soil parameters e g structure redox potential decomposition rate of organic matter accumulation of toxic compounds such as those released by roots and plant parameters e g alterations in metabolic mechanisms and respiration that can adversely influence vegetation growth kozlowski and pallardy 1997 in extensive agricultural areas such as that at our study site 82 8 of the total area these consequences trigger major economic losses rajabizadeh et al 2020 particularly in fields inundated for long periods fig 4 floods are recognized as one of the main causes of soil degradation pourghasemi et al 2020 but flooding can also lead to the deposition of nutrient rich sediments and is thus considered the main source of plant productivity and a key ecological feature of arid and semi arid regions mohammadi et al 2017 mohammadi et al 2017 analyzed pixel based daily time series data from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer to assess inundated areas and the subsequent vegetation responses which provided important insight into arid zone floodplain behavior at our study site various residential areas were affected by floods with the overall affected area increasing from 27 march 2 to 14 april 20 and then decreasing until 26 may 2019 1 fig 5 the most affected zone was located on the east side of the study area fig 3 where people have settled close to the river this site is one of the most populated cities in iran so the flood affected many people fig 2 urban areas with a lower population density to the north of the city were affected to a smaller extent but over a longer period according to jahangir et al 2019 who investigated floods in the kan watershed tehran province by coupling machine learning with satellite images and other gis and hydrological modeling methodologies iran is one of several countries in the world facing severe problems with annual floods particularly in urban catchments urban areas that are very susceptible to flooding should be prioritized when it comes to flood prevention and remediation choubin et al 2019 the challenges related to flood assessment due to enhanced backscatter in sar data for urban areas have led to few studies using sar based flood mapping in urban areas li et al 2019 our study showed that the svm gwo hybrid method extracted useful information directly from sar images and was precise in distinguishing between water and land areas which is critical for assessing flood extent and persistence across distinct land use types including urban areas fig 4 considering the relatively high temporal resolution of sar often 6 16 days depending on the latitudinal location on earth zeng et al 2020 and other passive microwave remote sensing data with high frequency e g twice a day near real time flood maps could be produced for large flood events these would be useful in keeping emergency services informed and could provide timely decision support for emergency responders especially for issuing warnings or supporting evacuations from urban areas zeng et al 2020 fast targeted management in the highest priority areas is then possible thus decreasing the costs and damage caused by floods tehrany et al 2015 wang et al 2019 previous authors have highlighted the critical importance of remotely sensed images for the analysis of the spatial extent and temporal patterns of inundation for flood control and mitigation purposes particularly in areas where floods affect many people dense infrastructure and properties rahman and thakur 2018 zeng et al 2020 as discussed by dasgupta et al 2018 satellite derived flood extent maps have the potential to allow more accurate hydraulic model calibration and validation and thus improve flood forecasting long records of inundation maps based on satellite data can also provide important information to assist governments planners and researchers in other applications such as water and environmental management e g biodiversity conservation and urban planning choubin et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 several authors have demonstrated the advantages of combining machine learning models with common physically based hydrological models for mapping flood susceptibility chen et al 2020 li et al 2019 this is mainly because the machine learning approaches overcome the typical problems associated with physically based model inputs such as discharge and river morphology for which data are often scarce in remote areas and ungauged catchments as well as the non linear stochastic and non stationary behavior of streamflow tikhamarine et al 2020 5 3 identification of locations for flood protection structures the identification of flooding hotspots i e critical areas with high flood susceptibility is pivotal for the implementation of flood control measures as discussed by fernández and lutz 2010 and ouma and tateishi 2014 producing flood risk maps in data scarce regions using hydraulic models remains challenging in this study sar data and machine learning algorithms were combined to map flood extents at different times and provide a prioritization scheme for flood protection measures the pattern of floodwater distribution obtained with the hybrid svm gwo model constitutes a basic foundation upon which valuable guidance can be provided to policy makers the prioritization inventory can be used in future analyses to identify potential locations where flood protection structures e g embankments and levees could be preserved restored or constructed along different rivers in relation to current and future land use topography soil type and predicted increases in rainfall and runoff these potential locations identified by the svm gwo model serve as the first screen of favorable strategic locations within the floodplain this method can also be tested as a tool for more appropriate mitigation and management of floods and identifying the optimal locations for flood protection structures because the search space of possible flood protection structure locations within a floodplain is very large a first round of screening is needed to effectively guide the optimization process therefore according to qi et al 2022 this spatial prioritization for flood control structures based on the analysis of flood dynamics improves resource allocation efficiency especially in data scarce regions 6 conclusion flood monitoring using satellite images has a long history and its origins have paralleled the advent of remote sensing techniques that provide vital information for hydrologists and decision makers the application of advanced machine learning algorithms for analyzing flood dynamics has served well for two decades and may become standard practice in this study we developed three novel hybrid models svm ica svm gwo and svm de for exploring spatiotemporal flood dynamics using sar data and proposed a new approach for finding suitable locations for embankments model classification performance was evaluated using common evaluation criteria for the ahvaz region of iran based on the study s findings we can draw the following conclusions the hybrid models exhibited better goodness of fit and predictive performance compared to the standalone svm model for dynamic monitoring of changes in floodwater distribution in terms of accuracy svm gwo outperformed the other hybrid models and the standalone model yielding oas of 96 07 and 93 39 at the training and validation steps respectively furthermore this hybrid model classified water inundated areas most accurately based on its pa 96 67 and ua 95 05 these validation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the hybrid svm gwo model the proposed methodology improves the capability of the flood control community to accurately generate flood susceptibility maps and identify suitable sites for supporting emergency management based on the assessment of spatiotemporal flood dynamics in the study area nine locations were identified to have the largest contribution to river flooding and should be prioritized for the construction of flood control structures such as embankments this spatial prioritization of flood control structures improves resource allocation efficiency especially in data scarce regions the return of different land use land cover areas to normal status depends considerably on the natural characteristics of the land type geomorphological features and the geographical location wetland was the last land use land cover type to return to normal primarily because most of the wetland area consisted of many previously dry oxbow lakes that could retain water this study coupled the svm model with three metaheuristic optimization algorithms to understand the spatiotemporal pattern of floodwater movement and improve flood mitigation strategies however further investigation on other machine learning models and metaheuristic optimization algorithms is needed credit authorship contribution statement mahdi panahi conceptualization data curation methodology writing original draft omid rahmati conceptualization

3247,although the growing number of synthetic aperture radar sar satellites has increased their application in flood extent mapping predictive models for the analysis of flood dynamics that are independent of sensor characteristics must be developed to fully extract information from sar images for flood mitigation this study aimed to develop hybrid machine learning models for flood mapping in the ahvaz region iran based on sar data each hybrid model consists of a support vector machine svm algorithm coupled with one of the following metaheuristic optimization procedures grey wolf optimization gwo differential evolution and the imperialist competitive algorithm sentinel 1 acquired sar images before and during flooding between 20 march and 26 may of 2019 the goodness of fit level and predictive capability of each model were scrutinized using overall accuracy producer accuracy and user accuracy the svm gwo approach yielded the highest accuracy with overall accuracies of 96 07 and 93 39 in the training and validation steps respectively furthermore this hybrid model provided the most accurate classification of water inundation class based on producer accuracy 96 67 and user accuracy 95 05 the results highlight that wetland is the last land use land cover type to return to normal conditions due to the many previously dry oxbow lakes that could trap water for a long time furthermore the nine most suitable sites for flood protection structures e g embankments and levees were identified based on floodwater distribution analysis this work describes a robust data parsimonious approach that will benefit flood mitigation studies seeking to identify the most suitable locations for embankments based on spatio temporal flood dynamics keywords flooding natural disasters spatial prediction remote sensing 1 introduction floods are the most frequent and widespread natural disasters and can have catastrophic impacts on human society and the environment qi et al 2022 floods significantly affect floodplain ecosystems by changing river morphology transporting sediment and leaching minerals eslamian et al 2018a moghaddam et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 as well as changing the hydro morphodynamics of floodplain ecosystems guo et al 2021 wang et al 2022 floodplains have diverse ecosystems that respond quickly to flood conditions and extreme hydrological disturbances doering et al 2021 in arid and semi arid zones flooding occurs unexpectedly in time and space providing beneficial elements e g water and sediment to floodplain ecosystems at different and irregular intervals e g periodical and seasonal river flooding of floodplains in arid and semi arid regions can also affect bird migration fish breeding vegetation productivity and soil moisture and nutrients eslamian et al 2018b mohammadi et al 2017 torabi haghighi et al 2020 understanding the dynamic processes associated with flood duration and inundation areas is crucial for flood mapping mason et al 2014 flood mapping using observational data provides useful basic information about flood extent over large floodplains and can support decision making and planning for flood mitigation cian et al 2018 mohammadi et al 2017 however predicting spatiotemporal flood dynamics with regard to meandering rivers and flood inundation in river floodplains using hydraulic principles remains challenging due to the recession of flood waves through complex hydro morphodynamic processes guan et al 2015 recently several studies have noted that providing rapid information for flood mitigation is one of the most important factors for effective floodplain management although in situ measurements i e hydrological gauge data underpin the current understanding of flood temporal dynamics temporal patterns of discharge they cannot provide sufficient information about the spatial dynamics of flood inundation in floodplains papa et al 2008 in addition hydrological gauges are sometimes destroyed during the flood storm surge remote sensing technology has strengths in quantifying the spatial and temporal patterns of flooding at a large scale providing tools for measuring the responses of floodplain ecosystems as this natural disaster unfolds fatahi nafchi et al 2021 karimidastenaei et al 2020 sakamoto et al 2007 torabi haghighi et al 2018 zhan et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 flood dynamics can be monitored using remote sensing data which provide suitable spatiotemporal information for eco hydrological management in arid and semi arid regions where ground data may be scarce and the infrastructure limited asadzadeh jarihani et al 2013 grimaldi et al 2020 hosseini et al 2020 martinez and toan 2007 ogilvie et al 2015 ostad ali askar et al 2018 sahana and sajjad 2019 although remote sensing technology can provide cost efficient and timely overviews for flood mapping clouds and rainfall often limit the data that can be used li et al 2018 schumann et al 2011 contrary to optical imaging satellite based synthetic aperture radar sar not only operates in all weather and day night conditions but also penetrates through rainfall and cloud cover grimaldi et al 2020 mohammadi et al 2017 ouled sghaier et al 2018 therefore sar images enhance disaster management by providing near real time information schlaffer et al 2017 for example schumann et al 2011 used sar data for flood inundation mapping in an urban environment and indicated that sar data could reveal important information on flood extent combining a developed hydraulic and hydrologic model with remote sensing and geographic information system gis data has been used to improve flood detection accuracy in integrated water resource management zeng et al 2020 for example woodbridge et al 2016 applied flood extents obtained using long term recorded remote sensing data park and latrubesse 2017 assessed the hydrological conditions and hydro geomorphologic complexity of the lower amazon river floodplain using remote sensing and field control data pontes et al 2017 monitored changes in floodplain river systems using mgb iph a hydrologic and hydraulic model coupled with gis capolongo et al 2019 combined sar and optical landsat 8 images and geomorphology data with hydrological models for long term monitoring of flood dynamics in past flood events recently dasgupta et al 2018 developed an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system model for flood analysis based on sar images of the clarence catchment of new south wales australia their results demonstrated that the proposed approach could obtain the most useful information for flood analysis from sar images with drastically reduced errors compared to the other approaches tested machine learning algorithms represent a multidisciplinary approach as they build upon concepts and ideas from computer science statistics and optimization methods they are widely used in remote sensing image classification to separate data from a given dataset into desired classes usually land use land cover types cervantes et al 2020 du et al 2019 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 tian et al 2020 xie and sun 2020 previous studies have established the advantages of machine learning approaches and demonstrated their contribution to improvements in the spatiotemporal analysis of flood dynamics however questions remain with respect to whether coupling machine learning models with metaheuristic algorithms would affect the accuracy of dynamic analysis of floodwater spread using sar images support vector machine svm is one of the best known machine learning techniques and has been effectively applied in many disciplines and fields especially in flood susceptibility mapping insom et al 2015 sahana et al 2020 tang et al 2019 tehrany et al 2014 svm establishes a classification hyperplane as the decision surface which maximizes the correct transformation of raw data to determine the land cover and whether a pixel is a flood point allowing prediction of the probability of flood occurrence wang et al 2020a yu and lu 2018 however despite the benefits of svm its parameters require optimization which is often time consuming lin et al 2020 qu et al 2020 wang et al 2020b the limitations of commonly used svm models have been discussed in this context and practical options to improve the accuracy and robustness of maps have been offered such as coupling a standalone svm with metaheuristic algorithms the objectives of the study were to understand spatiotemporal flood dynamics using sar data and a hybrid machine learning approach compare the prediction performance of the developed models and identify suitable locations for flood protection structures based on the flood distribution pattern to our knowledge this is the first application of a hybrid approach to monitoring flood dynamics using sentinel 1 images each hybrid model consists of a svm algorithm coupled with one of the following metaheuristic optimization procedures differential evolution de grey wolf optimization gwo and the imperialist competitive algorithm ica the proposed framework seeks to improve the understanding of large scale spatiotemporal patterns of water distribution after flooding which will benefit flood management in addition this framework can reproduce flood dynamics and support flood modeling in areas with meandering rivers based on our results svm can be combined with metaheuristic algorithms to better extract information from sar images for exploring spatiotemporal flood dynamics 2 study area the study area is located north of ahvaz city a large city in iran with a population of around 1 4 million the boundary coordinates are 48 35 55ʹʹ e and 31 20 45ʹʹ n fig 1 here there is an important river named karoon our case study covers 90 km of this river with a floodplain area of 1216 km2 the lithology of the study area is the quaternary unit including low level piedmont fan and valley terrace deposits yousefi et al 2018 according to köppen s climate classification the study area has a subtropical hot desert climate with cool short winters and long hot summers the average annual precipitation is 230 mm the annual temperature during summer is 42 45 c with many dust storms in winter the minimum temperature is 5 c annually the long term average annual discharge of the river at the ahvaz gauging station is 575 m3s 1 and the maximum annual discharge is 2995 m3s 1 previous studies indicated that the channel width of the river has been significantly affected by floods during past decades and severe erosion sedimentation interactions in the meandering reaches and high mobilization of channel sediments can be seen in the study area yousefi et al 2018 the meandering karoon river which has the widest catchment area and highest discharge among all rivers in iran originates in the zard kuh mountains in the zagros region with an elevation of 4548 m a s l and receives many tributaries such as the kuhrang and the dez before passing through ahvaz city the capital of khuzestan province in iran before emptying into the arvand rud river at an elevation of 12 m a s l agriculture is the major land use in the study area occupying 82 8 of the total area the karoon river plays a vital role in supplying water for agricultural activities orchards and farming in khuzestan province one of the most important agricultural provinces of iran woodbridge et al 2016 yousefi et al 2016 hence the floodplain of this river is highly populated 3 5 million people and under flood risk nourani and mano 2007 salarijazi 2012 tahmasbine et al 2012 the floodplain of the river has been considerably affected by human interventions such as mining sites land use changes and irrigation canals many large dams have been constructed on the river for various purposes including energy production the provision of drinking water and irrigation during the last four decades woodbridge et al 2016 yousefi et al 2016 the study area is highly susceptible to flooding with insurance companies claiming that flooding in 2019 destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure the agricultural sector suffered enormous damage and several people in the region died rajabizadeh et al 2020 fig 2 shows field photographs of floods that had occurred in the study area 3 methodology remote sensing data especially sar data can be integrated with machine learning algorithms to predict flood extents in the present study sar images from before the flood event were processed to generate a land cover map afterward for each land cover category reference point datasets were generated for training the models then sar images from the flood event were processed using standalone and hybrid models i e svm svm gwo svm ica and svm de to build land cover maps and determine the areas covered with water next the accuracy of the models in the training and validation steps were assessed using statistical methods finally suitable locations for flood control measures were determined fig 3 illustrates the adopted methodology in this study 3 1 sar data and pre processing sar is a key remote sensing method for flood monitoring under different weather conditions sentinel 1 acquired sar images before and during flooding between 20 march and 26 may of 2019 sar images were obtained based on the open data policy of the copernicus program which provides sar data for global earth monitoring by the scientific community unlike this dataset that is distributed online for free access to commercial images such as terrasar x is restricted for cost related reasons in developing countries first a pre processing step was implemented that includes geometric correction i e geocoding radiometric calibration i e calculation of backscatter values speckle filtering i e noise removal and the application of exclusion layers pre processing was executed using the open source sentinel application platform software the last pre processing step limits commission errors for example roads are man made flat surfaces that usually have low backscatter response and consequently can be confused with water grimaldi et al 2020 as suggested by walker et al 2011 a gamma filter with a 3 3 kernel size was considered at this stage to achieve noise reduction without omitting details heavy rainfall in the study area in april 2019 caused a widespread and long lasting flood between april and may of 2019 in this area the hybrid models proposed in this paper were tested on 12 sar images acquired in ascending orbit during the 2019 flood event according to hydrological interpretations it was a 1 in 120 year flood occurrence that took place along the karoon river and led to damages and human losses in the ahvaz region time series data with different polarizations were employed to produce land use maps table 1 from a polarimetry viewpoint sentinel 1 can collect a set of images from the same series of pulses to record specific polarizations simultaneously in other words it can transmit a signal with either vertical v or horizontal h polarization and then receive with both v and h polarizations in general the four combinations of transmitting and receiving polarizations are hh horizontal transmission and horizontal reception vv vertical transmission and vertical reception hv horizontal transmission and vertical reception and vh vertical transmission and horizontal reception the vv and hh polarization combinations are denoted like polarized whereas the hv and vh combinations are termed cross polarized abdikan et al 2016 showed that vv polarization vh polarization and their computed difference vv vh can be applied to classify land cover with high accuracy in this study for land cover classification level 1 ground range detected grd products of sentinel 1 with vv vh and vv vh polarizations were used for this purpose the grd sar data were multi looked and projected to ground range by applying the earth ellipsoid model sentinel 1 level 1 grd product data were calibrated and filtered using a 3 3 kernel applying the gamma map technique in addition terrain correction was done by resampling 25 m shuttle radar topography mission data farr and kobrick 2000 to a ground resolution pixel size of 20 m the digital number values of the sar data were converted into backscatter values on a decibel scale pre processing was done by employing the european space agency esa sentinel 1 toolbox s1tbx in the sentinel application platform provided by the esa after processing the sar images and determining the land cover land use classes i e water residential area agricultural area and bare land the reference point datasets were generated during field surveys for building models and validation purposes for each category 100 points were considered in binary form and divided randomly into two parts at a ratio of 70 30 for training and validation respectively lei et al 2021 li et al 2021 roy et al 2021 3 2 application of the standalone and hybrid models 3 2 1 svm svm as a supervised machine learning algorithm is based on statistical learning theory involving structural risk minimization it is a powerful means for linear and non linear classification as well as solving non linear regression problems svm differs from other classification algorithms in its capability for remarkable generalization performance another significant feature is its high accuracy in classifying data when the training dataset is limited consequently this method is highly applied in remote sensing studies abdikan et al 2016 mountrakis et al 2011 in svm a model is generated based on a functional margin and separation is carried out along the hyperplane with the maximum margin within the nearest training data sample abhang et al 2016 for non linear classification this algorithm employs a kernel function to transform inputs into high dimensional feature space it is worth mentioning that among various types of kernel functions the radial basis function is one of the more efficient and practical kernels used in developing an svm model liu et al 2021 sahana et al 2020 satarzadeh et al 2022 setting good svm hyper parameters plays a key role in classification accuracy therefore the ica gwo or the de algorithm was hybridized with svm to optimize the parameters detailed information about the svm algorithm and its equations can be found in previous literature cervantes et al 2020 cura 2020 geiß et al 2019 ghaddar and naoum sawaya 2018 lazri and ameur 2018 okwuashi and ndehedehe 2020 panahi et al 2021 and zhou et al 2018 3 2 2 svm gwo mirjalili et al 2014 proposed gwo a meta heuristic swarm intelligent algorithm that emulates the internal leadership hierarchy and hunting process of gray wolves the pyramid of gray wolf social hierarchy has four levels at the top of this pyramid is the leader called alpha α the alpha has the responsibility to lead and guide the group as well as decide the sleeping location hunting and sleeping time etc at the second and third levels are the betas β and deltas δ betas transfer the orders of the leader to the other group members deltas have critical roles in protecting the pack against enemies at the base of the pyramid omega ω wolves play a critical role in reducing infighting gupta and deep 2019 tu et al 2019 the main steps of mathematical modeling of gwo can be described as follows first to simulate the gray wolf social hierarchy structure the best fitting solution providing the maximum knowledge about prey positions is considered α then the second and third best fitting solutions are β and δ respectively the rest of the candidate solutions are categorized as ω luo and zhao 2019 in this algorithm the hunting process is controlled by α β and δ and ω follows these three groups while hunting gray wolves surround their prey to model this behavior the following equations are applied mirjalili et al 2014 1 d c x p t x t c 2 r 2 2 x t 1 x p t a d a 2 a r 1 a where t represents the current iteration of the algorithm and a and c are the coefficient vectors the value of α linearly decreases between 2 and 0 over the course of iterations x p is the vector representing prey position and x represents the gray wolf location vector in addition r 1 and r 2 are random vectors in the range of 0 1 notably c is one of the most important parameters in the search process and has the role of balancing the exploration and exploitation capabilities of this algorithm chen et al 2019 wang and li 2019 moreover a is another controlling parameter that plays a main role in the exploration process faris et al 2018 gao and zhao 2019 guha et al 2016 li et al 2021 niu et al 2018 finally to simulate the mathematics of the hunting step the top three solutions α β and δ are saved as the optimal solutions the rest of the wolves the ω wolves update their location based on the α β and δ locations sultana et al 2016 3 2 3 svm ica the ica designed based on human socio political evolution starts with random numbers of solutions in a search space called countries some of these solutions with minimum cost are called imperialists and the rest of the countries are colonies that are divided among the imperialists maheri and talezadeh 2018 in the next step imperialists compete with one another according to their strength to take more countries as their colonies therefore when a colony moves x units toward an imperialist the direction is represented by a vector from the colony to the imperialist x is a continuous random variable with uniform distribution determined by rabiee et al 2018 3 x u 0 β d where β is a number between 1 and 2 with uniform distribution and d represents the initial distance between a colony and an imperialist the total cost for an imperialist is dependent on the cost attributed to the imperialist itself and the average cost for its colonies which can be computed as follows aliniya and mirroshandel 2019 4 t c n c o s t i m p e r i a l i s t n ξ m e a n c o s t c olonies o f e m p i r e n where t c n is the total cost of the n th empire and ξ is a positive constant smaller than 1 zhang 2012 in the following iterations weaker empires will gradually lose their power during competition and be eliminated while stronger empires take over their colonies and increase their power after a while all empires except the most powerful will collapse and all colonies will go under the control of this empire which is considered the solution this algorithm continues until convergence and completion of all iterations occurs abdollahi et al 2013 kashani et al 2016 panahi et al 2022 for more detail on the ica refer to its main reference atashpaz gargari and lucas 2007 3 2 4 svm de de is an optimization algorithm introduced by storn and price 1997 this algorithm is powerful and quickly solves nonlinear and non differentiable optimization problems in continuous spaces the most important feature of this method is its high convergence speed and implementation simplicity sallam et al 2020 de is a population based approach and considered an evolutionary algorithm in this algorithm an initial random population is created according to eq 5 consisting of np vectors of x i where np is the number of members in a population as follows mohamed and almazyad 2017 5 x ij 0 x j l r a n d j x j u x j l where ran d j is a uniformly distributed number within 0 1 and x j l and x j u indicate the lower and upper bounds of x i respectively then for each target vector a mutant vector is yielded dhanalakshmy et al 2019 in the third step the target vector and mutant vector are mixed until a trial vector is generated in the final step the selection step every part of the population has an equal chance to be selected in a way that the fitness of each is evaluated based on an objective function further information about the de algorithm can be found in previous literature du et al 2016 elaziz et al 2020 hu et al 2021 nguyen trang et al 2019 opara and arabas 2019 özyön 2020 wu et al 2018 and yu et al 2020 3 3 post processing and evaluation strategy validation is one of the main parts of standard remote sensing analysis müller 2014 the quality of flood inundation maps created using remote sensing techniques must be evaluated brenning 2012 and forgoing detailed evaluation can impede successful practical application stehman and foody 2019 evaluation performance metrics were calculated using an error matrix also called the contingency or confusion matrix that included the proportion of the area of each class based on the validation data here referred to as reference data table 2 the accuracy of the hybrid and standalone models was evaluated by comparing the sar derived flood maps with real binary flood data retrieved from field surveys despite the widespread use of the kappa coefficient for classification accuracy assessment there are some concerns with its application in comparing the performance of models foody 2020 the most robust and common evaluation performance metric is overall accuracy oa in addition producer accuracy pa and user accuracy ua can be used to evaluate the classification accuracy for each class separately oa pa and ua can be calculated based on the following equations 6 oa n 1 n 4 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 7 pa n 1 n 1 n 3 8 ua n 1 n 1 n 2 where n 1 n 2 n 3 and n 4 are components of the error matrix explained in table 2 the oa metric denotes the proportion of reference samples that was classified correctly pa represents model accuracy and is calculated based on real features i e ground truthed that are correctly shown on the classified map it is also a complement of omission error ua reflects how many pixels in a given class on the classified map are present on the ground yuan et al 2005 ua is also the complement of commission error i e ua 100 commission error 100 points as the flood location data recorded during field surveys in march 2019 were used to create a reference flood map for calibration and validation purposes this in situ dataset provides the most reliable reference for assessing the robustness and accuracy of the presented models in this study the goodness of fit and predictive performance of all standalone svm and hybrid i e svm de svm gwo svm ica models were assessed based on oa pa and ua 3 4 statistical comparison of the models friedman and wilcoxon signed rank tests are common methods for statistically comparing the accuracy of models brardinoni et al 2003 smith et al 2002 tien bui et al 2016 the friedman test a non parametric method is a robust multiple comparison statistical test for recognizing significant differences across many models the null hypothesis h 0 in the friedman test is that there is no significant difference between the performance of all models the comparison is based on two parameters the p value and chi square χ 2 statistic the null hypothesis is rejected when the p value is less than the significance level α 0 05 and the chi square value is higher than the standard value i e 3 841 the friedman test only compares all models together in terms of significant differences but cannot provide a pairwise comparison of models to fill this gap the wilcoxon signed rank test is a suitable method that allows comparing models pair by pair hence in this study the wilcoxon signed rank test was also performed like the friedman test it is a non parametric method that assesses the significance of differences between two models based on two statistical factors the z value and p value after a pairwise comparison if the p value is less than 0 05 and the z value is out of the critical range 1 96 to 1 96 the null hypothesis is rejected and the two models are different importantly both friedman and wilcoxon signed rank tests assume neither homogeneity of variance nor normal distributions resulting in the generality and realism of these tests hernandez and maldonado correa 2017 3 5 identifying suitable locations for flood protection structures spatial prioritization for the construction of flood protection structures is pivotal for achieving optimal low cost and effective flood management gomez cunya et al 2020 therefore considering the broad scale of floodplains a logical approach is needed to identify suitable locations for flood protection measures qi et al 2022 this study proposed a procedure based on the observed flood pattern that allows managerial flexibility based on socio economic criteria in this analytical approach areas where river water overflows are designated as potential sites for constructing flood protection structures 4 results 4 1 application of the standalone and hybrid models in this study a standalone svm and three hybrid models were used for land use land cover classification of sar images fig 4 shows the original image of the study area a and the results of land use land cover classification of this image using the svm b svm de c svm ica d and svm gwo e models the results of goodness of fit assessment based on different evaluation metrics including oa pa and ua are shown in table s1 the standalone svm model had an overall accuracy of 89 29 in addition the pa and ua were 85 71 and 95 24 for the water inundation class respectively in other words the omission and commission errors for water inundated areas were 14 29 and 4 76 respectively the pa for other classes varied from 84 29 to 95 whereas the ua ranged from 83 13 to 96 72 among the hybrid models svm gwo outperformed the other models with an oa of 96 07 followed by svm ica 95 05 and svm de 93 04 importantly the highest pa 97 86 and ua 97 16 for the water inundation class were observed in the svm gwo and svm ica outputs respectively however goodness of fit analysis only explains the fit of the model to the training dataset and cannot evaluate model capabilities in terms of generalization and predictive performance in the validation step the results indicated that all hybrid models had a higher oa compared to the standalone svm model table 3 similar to the training step svm gwo was the best model based on oa 93 39 followed by svm de 92 47 and svm ica 91 67 the standalone svm model had the lowest predictive performance and generalizability based on oa 87 76 additionally svm gwo exhibited the highest pa 96 67 and ua 95 05 for identifying water inundated areas based on validation analysis of the svm gwo output the pas for the residential area wetland and agriculture classes were 92 86 95 71 and 97 86 whereas the uas were 98 49 97 10 and 91 95 respectively the output of the svm gwo model also had the lowest omission error 3 33 for water inundated area 8 33 for residential area 8 06 for wetland 5 for agricultural area and commission error 4 95 for water inundated area 3 51 for residential area 6 56 for wetland 10 94 for agricultural area although svm de was the second best model based on oa based on pa svm ica 96 67 low omission error had a better classification performance in terms of identifying water inundated areas compared to svm de 95 by contrast based on ua svm de 95 performed better than did svm ica 93 55 in classifying water inundated areas according to the above mentioned results svm gwo was selected as the best model based on all three evaluation metrics for investigating flood dynamics in the study area 4 2 statistical comparison of models the results of the friedman test are shown in table 4 the null hypothesis was rejected confirming that the models were significantly different the results of the wilcoxon signed rank test for pairwise comparison are summarized in table 5 this test clearly showed that the hybrid models performed differently thus each can be considered a distinct method 4 3 flood inundation dynamics in the study area twelve sar images acquired between 20 march and 26 may of 2019 were classified using the svm gwo model to delineate flood inundation locations in the study area fig 5 first the calculate geometry tool of arcgis software was used to calculate areas of different land use land cover classes on 20 march 2019 pre flood subsequently using the same approach land use land cover class areas were calculated from images captured during the flood event 27 march 2019 to 26 may 2019 fig 5 shows the changes in the areas of various land use land cover classes on different dates due to floodwaters entering the study area fig 5a depicts pre flood conditions on 20 march the area classified as water 3919 3 ha on this date represents permanent water bodies in the study area the residential wetland and agricultural areas were 3550 17 135 and 118 550 ha respectively floodwaters entered on 27 march 2019 submerging the study area under water fig 5b the water area rose to 6618 35 ha whereas the other land use land cover classes saw slight reductions residential 3530 ha wetland 15 610 ha agriculture 117 396 ha by 02 april fig 5c the water area had increased considerably to 17 992 ha whereas the residential wetland and agricultural areas had fallen to approximately 3392 14 070 and 107 702 ha respectively this trend continued fig 5d until the water area peaked at 57 439 ha on 14 april 2019 fig 5e and a dramatic increase in areas colored dark blue can be seen compared to the pre flood image fig 5a on this day the residential 2874 ha wetland 3294 ha and agricultural 79 547 ha areas reached their minimum values six days later on 20 april fig 5f the residential 3225 ha wetland 10 576 ha and agricultural 97 199 ha areas had increased whereas the water area fell significantly to 31 675 ha by 27 april 2019 the water area had fallen to 24 787 ha whereas the residential 3315 ha wetland 11 484 ha and agricultural 103 537 ha areas increased further fig 5g the water area fell by approximately 10 000 ha between 27 april and 02 may 2019 fig 5h whereas the other land use land cover areas increased by 08 may 2019 the water area had decreased to 11 113 33 ha and the areas of the other land use land cover classes increased moderately fig 5i on 14 may 2019 fig 5j water covered 10470 83 ha with 3507 46 14 568 09 and 114 784 97 ha of the study area classified as residential wetland and agricultural areas respectively the water area fell to 7633 ha by 20 may 2019 fig 5k on 26 may 2019 fig 5l 7564 41 ha of the study area was classified as water whereas 3543 15 069 and 117 051 ha were classified as residential wetland and agricultural areas respectively fig 6 indicates the proportion of inundated areas for various land use land cover classes on different dates overall although the total agricultural area 118 550 ha was larger than the total wetland area 17 135 ha a larger proportion of wetland was flooded compared to the agricultural and residential areas on 14 april 2019 when flooding peaked approximately 19 81 and 33 of the residential wetland and agricultural areas were flooded at this time the karoon river reached a peak water level bankfull of 5 3 m exceeding previous record levels from the two last decades subsequently the inundated areas began to decrease in all land use land cover classes with the proportions of inundated residential wetland and agricultural areas reaching 0 56 8 9 and 0 97 on 27 may 2019 and 0 2 12 and 1 2 on 26 may 2019 respectively the return of land use land cover types to normal status depends considerably on the natural characteristics of the land use land cover type geomorphological features and the geographical location wetland was the last land use land cover type to return to normal conditions see the yellow column in fig 5 from 14 may to 26 may this is primarily because most of the wetland area consisted of previously dry oxbow lakes that could retain water 4 4 suitable locations for flood protection structures based on the flood dynamics in the study area and the locations of areas that first began to be submerged suitable locations for flood protection structures such as embankments artificial levees are indicated in fig 7 nine locations are suggested for the construction of embankments embankments separate the floodplain from the river network and increases the river capacity preventing excess flood waters from leaving the river channel and submerging riparian zones 5 discussion 5 1 sar image analysis and classification performance of the models surface cover classification was mapped from sar images using svm and svm coupled with de the ica or gwo svm establishes a classification hyperplane directly from the raw data using minimal training data support vectors at the edge of class distributions and then finds optimal decision boundaries mountrakis et al 2011 each grid cell is considered a feature vector that contains information about different triggering factors which can be processed by svm and ensemble methods svm allowed efficient mapping of land use from sar images acquired on 20 march 2019 that covered the study area before flooding the svm model exhibited good predictive performance and predictive accuracy based on performance metrics for both the training and validation datasets as svm demonstrates superior classification accuracy of sar images compared to other machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks yu and lu 2018 with high computational efficiency and easy implementation svm shows good potential for use in multispectral classification problems such as land use classification as noted previously dasgupta et al 2018 joshi et al 2019 tang et al 2020 despite the good accuracy and classification performance of the svm model ensemble models featuring svm with three optimization algorithms outperformed the standalone method for sar analysis and land use classification several studies have reported that hybrid algorithms can outperform standalone models costache et al 2020 tien bui et al 2019 tikhamarine et al 2020 particularly model gwo combinations tikhamarine et al 2020 yu and lu 2018 kapoor et al 2017 reported the good performance of gwo in segmentation of satellite images the gwo algorithm achieves objective optimization by simulating actions such as tracking encircling and attacking prey in the hunting method used by gray wolf packs thus it is capable of efficiently balancing between exploration and exploitation and even better avoiding a large number of solutions in addition to providing rapid convergence stability and reliability high optimization precision and robust optimization ability tikhamarine et al 2020 yu and lu 2018 the accuracy assessment of the models adhered to protocols and was based on several performance metrics to achieve credible and rigorous comparisons previous studies combining feature extraction and reduction techniques such as the ica with svm have reported higher classification accuracies relative to the use of individual spectral bands bahari et al 2014 similar to our findings wang et al 2019 recorded improvements in flood susceptibility maps using the ica to optimize other machine learning methods the ica is based on social and human phenomena and is an algorithm that optimizes historical phenomena through mathematical modeling ghodousi et al 2016 it was previously used in bojnourd iran to analyze and prioritize citizens needs and satisfaction ghodousi et al 2016 however pourghasemi et al 2020 recorded higher accuracy levels with ensemble models using de rather than the ica for flood susceptibility mapping as recorded in our study the higher accuracy of de compared to the ica can be explained by their distinct calculation approaches the ica does not have an initial population but starts with a random response and is thus less accurate than other population approaches de also uses a population based stochastic search approach but it chooses the direction and distance of the current population from other members of the population to guide the search process in a desirable direction pourghasemi et al 2020 several machine learning algorithms have been used previously to reduce image speckle and false classification of land use for example dasgupta et al 2018 developed a neuro fuzzy flood mapping technique for texture enhancement of single sar images and improved the classification performance for different land cover classes shen et al 2019 used machine learning to derive near real time flood inundation products from satellites with high resolution sar sensors including sentinel 1 and envisat zeng et al 2020 used passive microwave remote sensing data combined with sar based flood mapping information to estimate flood extents li et al 2019 assessed the roles of sar intensity and interferometric coherence in urban flood detection by using a self learning convolution neural network framework to analyze multi temporal terrasar x data 5 2 remote sensing and dynamic flood monitoring remote sensing and sar in particular provide suitable spatiotemporal data for estimating floodwater distribution especially in large arid zone floodplains where inundation persists for weeks fig 4 however the accuracy is dependent on the revisit frequency and length of records as reported by previous authors mohammadi et al 2017 zeng et al 2020 according to dasgupta et al 2018 the growing number of sar satellites makes them the most reliable data resource currently for flood monitoring for the present analysis the 12 snapshots recorded by the satellite at various times between 20 march pre flood and 26 may 2019 in the ahvaz region of iran enabled a good characterization of different flood situations including flooded agricultural residential and wetland areas affected for more than 2 months although wetland was the most affected by the flood with 80 of the area inundated during the peak flooding observed on 14 april significant proportions of agricultural 25 and urban 20 areas were also affected fig 5 on 26 may 12 2 and 1 of the wetland agricultural and residential areas were still affected by the flood similar to this study zeng et al 2020 used a sequence of sar images to extract timely information on flooding in southern and central china in agricultural fields apart from the direct impact of inundation on crops poor aeration in flooded soils triggers changes in soil parameters e g structure redox potential decomposition rate of organic matter accumulation of toxic compounds such as those released by roots and plant parameters e g alterations in metabolic mechanisms and respiration that can adversely influence vegetation growth kozlowski and pallardy 1997 in extensive agricultural areas such as that at our study site 82 8 of the total area these consequences trigger major economic losses rajabizadeh et al 2020 particularly in fields inundated for long periods fig 4 floods are recognized as one of the main causes of soil degradation pourghasemi et al 2020 but flooding can also lead to the deposition of nutrient rich sediments and is thus considered the main source of plant productivity and a key ecological feature of arid and semi arid regions mohammadi et al 2017 mohammadi et al 2017 analyzed pixel based daily time series data from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer to assess inundated areas and the subsequent vegetation responses which provided important insight into arid zone floodplain behavior at our study site various residential areas were affected by floods with the overall affected area increasing from 27 march 2 to 14 april 20 and then decreasing until 26 may 2019 1 fig 5 the most affected zone was located on the east side of the study area fig 3 where people have settled close to the river this site is one of the most populated cities in iran so the flood affected many people fig 2 urban areas with a lower population density to the north of the city were affected to a smaller extent but over a longer period according to jahangir et al 2019 who investigated floods in the kan watershed tehran province by coupling machine learning with satellite images and other gis and hydrological modeling methodologies iran is one of several countries in the world facing severe problems with annual floods particularly in urban catchments urban areas that are very susceptible to flooding should be prioritized when it comes to flood prevention and remediation choubin et al 2019 the challenges related to flood assessment due to enhanced backscatter in sar data for urban areas have led to few studies using sar based flood mapping in urban areas li et al 2019 our study showed that the svm gwo hybrid method extracted useful information directly from sar images and was precise in distinguishing between water and land areas which is critical for assessing flood extent and persistence across distinct land use types including urban areas fig 4 considering the relatively high temporal resolution of sar often 6 16 days depending on the latitudinal location on earth zeng et al 2020 and other passive microwave remote sensing data with high frequency e g twice a day near real time flood maps could be produced for large flood events these would be useful in keeping emergency services informed and could provide timely decision support for emergency responders especially for issuing warnings or supporting evacuations from urban areas zeng et al 2020 fast targeted management in the highest priority areas is then possible thus decreasing the costs and damage caused by floods tehrany et al 2015 wang et al 2019 previous authors have highlighted the critical importance of remotely sensed images for the analysis of the spatial extent and temporal patterns of inundation for flood control and mitigation purposes particularly in areas where floods affect many people dense infrastructure and properties rahman and thakur 2018 zeng et al 2020 as discussed by dasgupta et al 2018 satellite derived flood extent maps have the potential to allow more accurate hydraulic model calibration and validation and thus improve flood forecasting long records of inundation maps based on satellite data can also provide important information to assist governments planners and researchers in other applications such as water and environmental management e g biodiversity conservation and urban planning choubin et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 several authors have demonstrated the advantages of combining machine learning models with common physically based hydrological models for mapping flood susceptibility chen et al 2020 li et al 2019 this is mainly because the machine learning approaches overcome the typical problems associated with physically based model inputs such as discharge and river morphology for which data are often scarce in remote areas and ungauged catchments as well as the non linear stochastic and non stationary behavior of streamflow tikhamarine et al 2020 5 3 identification of locations for flood protection structures the identification of flooding hotspots i e critical areas with high flood susceptibility is pivotal for the implementation of flood control measures as discussed by fernández and lutz 2010 and ouma and tateishi 2014 producing flood risk maps in data scarce regions using hydraulic models remains challenging in this study sar data and machine learning algorithms were combined to map flood extents at different times and provide a prioritization scheme for flood protection measures the pattern of floodwater distribution obtained with the hybrid svm gwo model constitutes a basic foundation upon which valuable guidance can be provided to policy makers the prioritization inventory can be used in future analyses to identify potential locations where flood protection structures e g embankments and levees could be preserved restored or constructed along different rivers in relation to current and future land use topography soil type and predicted increases in rainfall and runoff these potential locations identified by the svm gwo model serve as the first screen of favorable strategic locations within the floodplain this method can also be tested as a tool for more appropriate mitigation and management of floods and identifying the optimal locations for flood protection structures because the search space of possible flood protection structure locations within a floodplain is very large a first round of screening is needed to effectively guide the optimization process therefore according to qi et al 2022 this spatial prioritization for flood control structures based on the analysis of flood dynamics improves resource allocation efficiency especially in data scarce regions 6 conclusion flood monitoring using satellite images has a long history and its origins have paralleled the advent of remote sensing techniques that provide vital information for hydrologists and decision makers the application of advanced machine learning algorithms for analyzing flood dynamics has served well for two decades and may become standard practice in this study we developed three novel hybrid models svm ica svm gwo and svm de for exploring spatiotemporal flood dynamics using sar data and proposed a new approach for finding suitable locations for embankments model classification performance was evaluated using common evaluation criteria for the ahvaz region of iran based on the study s findings we can draw the following conclusions the hybrid models exhibited better goodness of fit and predictive performance compared to the standalone svm model for dynamic monitoring of changes in floodwater distribution in terms of accuracy svm gwo outperformed the other hybrid models and the standalone model yielding oas of 96 07 and 93 39 at the training and validation steps respectively furthermore this hybrid model classified water inundated areas most accurately based on its pa 96 67 and ua 95 05 these validation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the hybrid svm gwo model the proposed methodology improves the capability of the flood control community to accurately generate flood susceptibility maps and identify suitable sites for supporting emergency management based on the assessment of spatiotemporal flood dynamics in the study area nine locations were identified to have the largest contribution to river flooding and should be prioritized for the construction of flood control structures such as embankments this spatial prioritization of flood control structures improves resource allocation efficiency especially in data scarce regions the return of different land use land cover areas to normal status depends considerably on the natural characteristics of the land type geomorphological features and the geographical location wetland was the last land use land cover type to return to normal primarily because most of the wetland area consisted of many previously dry oxbow lakes that could retain water this study coupled the svm model with three metaheuristic optimization algorithms to understand the spatiotemporal pattern of floodwater movement and improve flood mitigation strategies however further investigation on other machine learning models and metaheuristic optimization algorithms is needed credit authorship contribution statement mahdi panahi conceptualization data curation methodology writing original draft omid rahmati conceptualization

3248,aquifer heterogeneity is critical for predicting processes involved in the dissipation of pore water pressure consolidation and rebound the consolidation and rebound of aquifer systems should consider the spatiotemporal variation in the hydraulic and mechanical parameters of the aquifer and aquitard in this study a series of laboratory experiments was conducted to characterize the consolidation and rebound of the aquifer system and estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard the experimental results revealed that under multistage loading the compression in the upper part of the aquitard tended to decrease while the compression in the lower part of the aquitard tended to increase in addition the variation in hydraulic conductivity and deformation of the aquitard were closely related and reasonably matched at each stage moreover a one dimensional consolidation model was developed to simulate the variation in pore water pressure and compare it with the experimental pore water pressure reverse pore water pressure fluctuations occurred within a part of the aquitard away from the drainage boundary compared to the theoretical curves the experimental curves of the pore water pressure calculated from the initial and asymptotic hydraulic conductivities exhibited delayed and advanced effects these findings can help elucidate the characteristics of consolidation and rebound of aquifer systems and the spatiotemporal variation in hydraulic conductivity keywords aquitard heterogeneity reverse pore water pressure fluctuations hydraulic conductivity 1 introduction with the acceleration of economic development the scale of civil engineering construction is gradually expanding especially in coastal areas with complex aquifer systems neuman and witherspoon 1969 streltsova 1976 pope and burbey 2004 however this rapid expansion also leads to problems such as the non uniform subsidence of the aquitard liu et al 2015 yin et al 2016 complex distribution of pore water pressure sivakumar et al 2011 and insufficient consolidation tavenas et al 1983 shi et al 2008 the aquifer system is composed of layered aquifers and aquitards aquitards usually consist of fine grained sediments such as clays whereas aquifers typically consist of coarse grained sediments such as sand and gravel one of the challenges in aquifer systems research is the exploration of the properties of aquitards clayey grains have electric surface charge and form aggregates with pore sizes that are frequently larger than the grain diameter therefore aquitards tend to have greater compressibility freeze and cherry 1979 and higher storativity zhuang et al 2015 accurately predicting the deformation of aquitards in an aquifer system is critical for engineering management and safety konikow and neuzil 2007 luo et al 2020 therefore we must focus on the spatiotemporal distribution of the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard under complex loading to acquire an accurate prediction which is also the target of this study since the establishment of the one dimensional consolidation theory terzaghi 1925 researchers have made a series of improvements to the traditional consolidation theory taking into account the large strain heterogeneity and parameter variation gibson et al 1967 xie and leo 2004 initially the coefficient of compressibility was assumed to be constant and hydraulic conductivity was closely related to pore water pressure schiffman 1958 subsequently davis and raymond 1965 proposed a non linear consolidation theory which relies on the linear relationship between the void ratio e and the logarithm of pressure logp and found that the dissipation of pore water pressure is smaller than the traditional one dimensional consolidation theory at a higher pressure increment ratio gibson et al 1981 proposed a large strain consolidation theory that considers the deformation of the soil during consolidation that considers the void ratio as a variable and ignores the independent variation in hydraulic conductivity and coefficient of compressibility the heterogeneity of aquitards is frequently encountered in nature and engineering and is one of the main challenges associated with understanding the characteristics of aquitards rodrigues 1983 traditionally the hydraulic and mechanical parameters of an aquitard have been obtained from laboratory tests on small samples using permeameters and oedometers deng et al 2017 wei et al 2017 cao et al 2020 although the one dimensional consolidation experiments and test instruments have been further improved and optimized the key parameters obtained from laboratory tests of small scale samples are relatively insufficient to characterize the quantitative heterogeneity of different parts of the aquifer system lee 1979 shi and wen 2004 li et al 2017 quantifying aquitard heterogeneity is more challenging than characterizing aquifer heterogeneity because observational data regarding aquitards are typically rare other studies have considered the effect of complex soil layers on consolidation characteristics at a regional scale and analyzed the variation in the compression coefficient and void ratio cetin 2000 miao et al 2009 however these studies could not simultaneously monitor the pore water pressure deformation and water release of the aquitard with high density and accuracy in this study we designed an experimental methodology to measure hydraulic conductivity and examined the nonlinear consolidation of the aquitard along with understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of hydraulic conductivity the experimental findings contribute to the development of the consolidation theory several studies have further considered the boundary conditions loading patterns and variation of parameters in the consolidation theory li et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 however the boundary and initial conditions of the traditional one dimensional consolidation equation are insufficient because drainage and boundary conditions are very complicated in natural environments mei and chen 2013 research has proposed that the basic assumptions of the traditional consolidation theory deviate from the actual conditions neuman et al 1982 depending on the scale of the project and type of construction different time dependent loading patterns occur multistage and cyclic loading are the main types of loading encountered in geotechnical engineering zhu and yin 2001 geng 2009 xie et al 2010 some studies have reported consolidation tests under different loading patterns muthing et al 2016 proposed an analytical solution under haversine cyclic loading and analyzed the variation in pore water pressure and effective stress tian et al 2020 studied the one dimensional consolidation of soil under multistage loading and solved the excess pore water pressure and degree of consolidation using the superposition formula of excess pore water pressure in this study we focused on the case of multistage loading as an external condition the nonlinear variation of permeability and compressibility are important factors that affect the deformation characteristics of aquitards during the consolidation process the permeability and compressibility of the aquitard decreased when effective stress increased however there was no significant correlation between the two many studies have assumed that the ratio of hydraulic conductivity and the coefficient of compressibility is constant to simplify the calculations however the correct prediction method for soil consolidation should analyze the hydraulic conductivity and coefficient of compressibility separately rather than focusing only on the coefficient of consolidation pyrah 1996 therefore individual studies on the permeability and compressibility of aquitards are essential for the development of consolidation theory we analyzed the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard at different depths was calculated through a series of laboratory experiments and the spatiotemporal variation of hydraulic conductivity in this study we explored the dynamics of the pore water pressure deformation and hydraulic conductivity in different parts of an aquitard under multistage loading therefore we developed an experimental instrument and conducted a series of laboratory experiments we measured and recorded data on pore water pressure deformation and water release at different depths in the aquifer system and analyzed the correlation between these data at different loading stages of the aquifer system especially the aquitard moreover we developed a mathematical model based on terzaghi s consolidation theory and calculated the theoretical curves of the pore water pressure using this model comparing the theoretical curves of pore water pressure with the experimental curves of pore water pressure the results show that nonlinear variations in the deformation and hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard have profound effects on the consolidation process and the dissipation of pore water pressure of the aquifer system our findings can help in understanding the nonlinear consolidation characteristics of aquitards through an experimental study of aquifer systems and contribute to the development of the consolidation theory 2 methodology the one dimensional consolidation of the aquifer system is based on the schematic shown in fig 1 the thickness of the aquitard and the upper and lower aquifers are denoted as h h u and h b respectively using the lagrangian coordinate system the z axis was positive downwards and the coordinate system was established by setting the origin at the top of the aquitard there was a fixed water head at the top of the aquifer system the system was subjected to an external vertical uniform loading q t fig 2 where q 0 q 1 and q 2 are the designed loadings for stages i ii and iii respectively when t t 1 the loading increases from stage i to stage ii and remains stable for a period of time then the loading continues to increase and reaches stage iii at t t 2 and remains constant the top surface of the aquifer system was pervious whereas the bottom surface was pervious or impervious in this study we considered the boundary condition in which the aquifer system has a pervious top and an impervious bottom 2 1 laboratory apparatus and procedures the prototype of the experimental device is shown in fig 3 the designed device consisted of four parts a drive system water supply system soil column system and monitoring system the main components of the device include a plexiglass column stand motor deformation plates sealing plates displacement sensors pressure sensors and accessories for filtering soil particles and distinguishing between different soil layers during consolidation the soil column for the experiments was an acrylic cylinder with a height outer diameter and inner diameter of 60 cm 16 cm and 14 cm respectively this experimental instrument was equipped with several deformation plates pore water pressure sensors and drainage outlets to simultaneously monitor pore water pressure deformation and water release at different depths in the aquifer system according to the experimental requirements the plexiglass column consisted of three parts from top to bottom the upper aquifer was filled with sand middle aquitard with clay and lower part with incompressible gravel the thickness of the incompressible gravel layer was 22 cm aquitard was 20 cm and sand layer was 5 cm five pore water pressure sensors were evenly distributed on one side of the plexiglass column and five drainage outlets were symmetrically distributed on the other side the design heights of the pore water pressure sensors and drainage outlets were 8 16 24 32 and 40 cm from the bottom of the soil column for convenient measurements and recordings the five drainage outlets from top to bottom were named from no 1 to 5 the filter devices were set at the connection between the drainage outlets and soil column and the overflow outlet of the entire column was located 55 cm from the bottom the soil samples used in the experiments were silty clay wherein 100 of the particles were smaller than 0 035 mm and the liquid and plastic limits were 47 and 33 respectively routine consolidation tests were conducted on the silty clay samples before the experiments in this study the initial void ratio of the clay layer was 1 28 the plexiglass column is non deformable in the horizontal direction therefore the consolidation process of the aquifer system in this experiment occurred only in the vertical direction the entire aquifer system was hydrostatic prior to the start of the experiment throughout the experiments the upper boundary of the simulated aquifer system was permeable while the lower boundary was impermeable the water flow in the plexiglass column was one dimensional in the vertical direction in this study the deformation of individual soil particles and water was negligible the deformation pore water pressure and water release data of different parts of the aquifer system were recorded and measured in real time the specific steps are as follows step i first we ensured that all types of sensors could collect data properly and that the operating interface can properly control the start pause and finish of the drive system step ii we began to fill in the materials first the interior of the plexiglass column was cleaned a layer of vaseline was then applied to the inner wall of the plexiglass column airless water was injected into the plexiglass column through the bottom valve and the water surface slowly rose the bottom valve was closed to stop water injection when the water surface reached the design height the previously soaked gravel and sand samples were removed and then the gravel silty clay and sand were slowly filled into the plexiglass column during the water injection process it is necessary to consider bubble retention in the clay and gravel layers and it was avoided to the maximum extent a filter screen must be installed at the interface of adjacent soil layers to ensure that the loss of soil particles is reduced and that water can flow normally after the gravel layer was poured the two parts of the aquitard were filled plates i and ii were set at the top z 0 cm and middle z 10 cm of the aquitard respectively these plates must be kept at a level to ensure accurate measurement the aquitard was left to stand for 12 h for every 5 cm of filling before resuming filling step iii the sealing plate and plexiglass column were connected by bolts and the sealing ring was installed in the middle to ensure the sealing of the plexiglass column except for the exhaust valve all valves were closed and a vacuum pump was used to extract air from the plexiglass column the negative pressure in the plexiglass column increased sequentially from 0 02 to 0 04 0 06 0 08 and finally 0 1 mpa the time interval for each level was 6 h step iv after filling the soil sample the peristaltic pump was connected to the inlet valve to slowly inject water into the plexiglass column the free water surface was gradually increased to the overflow valve the overflow valve and data acquisition system were opened to allow excess water to flow out and record the initial pore water pressure and deformation data when the pore water pressure was consistent with the hydrostatic pressure and without deformation our experimental preparation phase was completed step v according to the multistage loading design the first loading stage was set to 0 50 kpa the stabilization of the load pressure was controlled by adjusting the power of the motor the pore water pressure and deformation data were recorded in real time using the monitoring system we considered that the aquifer system reached a stable state when the pore water pressure dissipation was complete and the deformation remained constant this process usually lasts for several days depending on the thickness of the aquitard once everything was ready the drainage outlets were opened at different locations the water release per unit time at a steady state was measured and the hydraulic conductivity in different parts of the aquitard was calculated step vi the different loading stages 50 100 kpa and 100 200 kpa were adjusted according to the experimental design and stage v was repeated the pore water pressure water release compression and rebound of the aquitard were recorded finally the experiments were terminated and the instrument was turned off 2 2 mathematical model in this section we describe the construction of a mathematical model based on terzaghi s theory to simulate the dissipation of pore water pressure at different depths except for the initial and boundary conditions the other basic assumptions made in terzaghi s theory are followed in this study the governing equation of this one dimensional consolidation problem is expressed as eq 1 1 k v 1 e γ w a 2 u z 2 u t 0 z l t 0 in this study we focused on the boundary condition of the aquifer system with an impervious bottom therefore the initial and boundary conditions are presented in eqs 2 4 2 u u h z q 0 z l t 0 3 u u h 0 z 0 0 t 4 u z 0 z l 0 t where k v is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 e is the

this study consisted of two aquifers and an aquitard the thickness of the middle silty clay layer was 20 cm which formed an aquitard the thicknesses of the upper and lower aquifers were 5 cm and 22 cm respectively during the experiments the computer controlled interface adjusted the motor power to precisely control loading the whole experimental process can be divided into four sequential stages stage i 0 50 kpa stage ii 50 100 kpa stage iii 100 200 kpa and the rebound stage 200 0 kpa the monitoring system can accurately obtain deformation and pore water pressure data for different parts of the aquifer system the measuring ranges of the deformation pore water pressure and pressure sensors were 20 mm 200 kpa and 500 kpa respectively 3 1 nonlinear consolidation of the aquitard 3 1 1 the pore water pressure change within the aquitard the dissipation curves of excess pore water pressure under multistage loading are shown in fig 4 the designed loadings for each stage were applied instantaneously to the top of the aquifer system at t 10 s and remained constant the three curves represent the pore water pressure at z 2 10 and 18 cm from the top of the aquitard at different loading stages according to the effective stress principle when a loading is applied immediately the pore water of the aquitard cannot be discharged in time the pore water of the aquitard bears the full pressure and the soil skeleton does not deform which causes a sudden increase in pore water pressure with the release of pore water in the aquitard and the reduction of pore water pressure the soil skeleton shares the loading pressure and causes consolidation and deformation of the aquitard as shown in fig 4 a part of aquitard near the drainage boundary consolidates first and completes the dissipation of pore water pressure at the earliest as the part of the aquitard near the drainage boundary gradually becomes denser and the hydraulic conductivity decreases it becomes more difficult for the excess pore water pressure at the far field from the top drainage boundary to dissipate as a result pore water pressure dissipation at the far field will also be longer than the near field from the drainage boundary fig 4c shows that the pore water pressure at z 2 cm of the aquitard became hydrostatic pressure and remained constant during the third loading stage the reason for this is the compression of the aquifer system which results in the upper sand replacing the clay at that depth fig 5 shows the pore water pressure isochrones at the different loading stages the dissipation rate of pore water pressure first increased and then decreased at different depths in the first stage the dissipation rate of the pore water pressure was rapid at the beginning of the consolidation the closer the part of the aquitard is to the drainage boundary the faster the dissipation rate of the excess pore water pressure as shown in fig 5a the dissipation rate at each depth reaches its peak between t 5 min and t 10 min in the second loading stage the pore water pressure dissipation rate increases slowly and the pore water pressure dissipation rate is basically the same at each depth of the aquitard in fig 5b the dissipation rate peaked between t 5 min and t 10 min at z 2 cm and the dissipation rate peaked at z 10 and 18 cm between t 15 min and t 20 min in the third loading stage the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure was slow in the first 20 min the pore water pressure away from the drainage boundary started to dissipate more rapidly than the pore water pressure near the drainage boundary between t 90 min and t 180 min according to fig 5c the dissipation rate of the pore water pressure at z 10 and 18 cm peaks between t 20 min and t 50 min from loading stages i to iii the time required for the excess pore water pressure dissipation rate to reach its peak gradually increased in summary the pore water pressure isochrones of the aquitard flattened progressively under multistage loading 3 1 2 nonlinear compression of the aquitard fig 6 shows the curves of compression and loading versus the loading time combined with fig 3 we can name the upper and lower parts of the aquitard as part i and part ii respectively table 1 lists the compression of different parts of the aquitard under multistage loading for the designed loading stages in this study the compressions in the upper part of the aquitard are 4 8 mm 3 0 mm and 1 4 mm while the compressions in the lower part of the aquitard are 2 1 mm 3 2 mm and 5 2 mm to represent the nonlinear consolidation of the aquitard more directly we calculated the strains in the upper and lower parts of the aquitard at the end of the different loading stages the strain can be calculated by ε δd h where δd is the compression of the aquitard and h is the initial thickness of the aquitard under multistage loading conditions the strains in the upper part of the aquitard were 0 048 0 030 and 0 014 while those in the lower part were 0 021 0 032 and 0 052 respectively fig 6 shows the significant nonlinear compression of the aquitard in the aquifer system under multistage loading in loading stage i the upper part of the aquitard began to drain and compress first and the compression of the upper part was larger than that of the lower part in stage ii the total compression in the upper part was essentially the same as that in the lower parts in the last loading stage compression of the aquitard occurred mainly in the lower part therefore there is a large variation in the compression in the upper and lower parts of the aquitard at different loading stages the difference between the total compression of different parts of the aquitard gradually decreased as the loading continued to increase in addition the compression at each loading stage was not directly proportional to the magnitude of the loading different loading conditions resulted in varying degrees of consolidation and void ratios in the different parts of the aquitard considering the consolidation and seepage the upper aquitard near the drainage boundary in the first stage starts to consolidate and deform first when the upper aquitard gradually becomes denser and the hydraulic conductivity decreases it becomes increasingly difficult for the lower aquitard to discharge the pore water and compress with the gradual increase in loading the pore volume of the upper aquitard gradually decreased whereas the lower aquitard still had a large pore volume the total compression of the upper and lower parts of the aquitard gradually became equal as loading continued to increase this result can also be analyzed from the perspective of nonlinear compression the void ratio of the aquitard has a complex spatiotemporal distribution under multistage loading conditions the complex nonlinear relationship between void ratio and coefficient compressibility resulted in the nonlinear compression in addition the friction between the aquifer system and the plexiglass column is also a possible cause of the nonlinear deformation 3 1 3 influence on the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard we first measured water release per unit time at different outlets the hydraulic conductivity of the different parts of the aquitard was calculated using darcy s law in this study we ignored the non vertical one dimensional and non darcy flows table 2 shows the calculated hydraulic conductivities of different parts of the aquitard after different loading stages the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 of the aquitard was 3 30 10 6 cm s the hydraulic conductivities calculated from the water release data of outlets no 2 and 3 are named as k 2 and k 3 respectively in addition we calculated the hydraulic conductivity of the overall aquitard k 4 based on the water release at the bottom of the aquitard through outlet no 4 in table 2 we can see that the rate of change of k 2 is greater than that of k 3 in the first and second stages k 3 rapidly decreases and its rate of change exceeds that of k 2 in the third stage in the final rebound stage k 3 increases by 23 and k 2 increases by 4 in each loading stage the values of k 4 are marginally larger compared to that of k 3 this variation and distribution of hydraulic conductivity correspond to the nonlinear deformation of the aquifer system under multistage loading therefore the calculation of hydraulic conductivity for each part of the aquitard after different loading stages can aid in understanding and describing the permeability of the aquitard at different depths during complex nonlinear deformations the mathematical model and solution under constant loading can be used to study the individual loading stages under multistage loading in this study we chose the first loading stage to compare the difference between experimental and theoretical values of excess pore water pressure we compiled the analytical solution of eq 6 and then plotted the curves of the theoretical pore water pressure versus the time factor t v at different depths of the aquitard the experimental pore water pressure curves at different depths versus time factor were obtained based on the calculated hydraulic conductivity before and after the experiment and pore water pressure data in fig 7 the three solid curves represent the theoretical standard pore water pressures at different depths and the three dashed curves and three dotted curves represent the experimental standard pore water pressures calculated from k 0 and k respectively the trends in the theoretical and experimental curves of the pore water pressure were consistent however the experimental results based on the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 and asymptotic hydraulic conductivity k have delayed and advanced effects compared to the theoretical pore water pressure dissipation process therefore the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard varied between k 0 and k during the consolidation of the aquifer system in addition the pore water pressure at z 10 and 18 cm of the aquitard initially increased slightly and then decreased continuously we found that there were reverse pore water pressure fluctuations in the far field of the aquitard from the top drainage boundary in the initial stage of the dissipation of excess pore water pressure kim and parizek 1997 berg et al 2015 the mandel cryer effect was discovered when solving consolidation problems through biot s consolidation theory which is an unusual phenomenon that occurs in three dimensional consolidation mckinley 1998 selvadurai and shirazi 2004 however this phenomenon was not observed in previous theories and experiments on one dimensional consolidation reverse pore water pressure fluctuations are caused when loading is applied to an aquifer system with a pervious top boundary resulting in the compression of the near field from the drainage boundary owing to the water release and increased total and effective stresses owing to the lateral limitations of the soil column and the delayed drainage of the far field from the drainage boundary the near field from the drainage boundary inevitably compresses the far field from the drainage boundary to ensure the overall deformation coordination of the aquifer system as a result the total stress in the far field from the drainage boundary exceeds the initial pressure and the pore water pressure in the far field from the drainage boundary also increases by compression 3 2 rebound test of the aquitard the curves of the pore water pressure under rebound versus time are shown in fig 8 the three solid curves represent the measured pore water pressure at different depths and the three dashed lines represent the means of the pore water pressure obtained before the beginning of the rebound fig 9 shows the deformation of the two parts of the aquitard during rebound it can be observed from the figures that the loading was released and remained unloaded at t 80 000 s the ranges of the deformation and pore water pressure sensors were selected based on the magnitude of the excess pore water pressure and the compression of the aquitard thus there can be some measurement error for monitoring smaller negative pressures and rebound the saturated aquitard generated negative pressure during the rebound stage and the rebound in the upper part of the aquitard part i was much smaller than that in the lower part of the aquitard part ii the value of negative pressure in part ii of the aquitard was greater than that in part i of the aquitard and the dissipation rate of negative pressure in part ii was slower than that in part i the data of the deformation sensors showed that the rebound of part i and part ii were 0 05 mm and 0 20 mm respectively the rebound stage of the aquifer system was divided into primary and secondary rebound phases the primary rebound phase occurred during unloading at t 80 000 s the rebound of part ii of the aquitard increased suddenly while the deformation of part i of the aquitard underwent a process of compression followed by a rebound this result can be attributed to the fact that the near field of the aquitard from the drainage boundary is denser than that in the far field the part i of the aquitard receives water from the drainage boundary while part ii of the aquitard absorbs water from part i at a faster rate in addition the second rebound phase occurred at approximately t 150 000 s the pore water pressure of the aquitard generated a series of negative pore water pressure fluctuations and smaller rebound fluctuations were generated throughout the aquitard the rebound mainly occurred in the aquitard away from the drainage boundary which corresponded to the variation in hydraulic conductivity in the rebound stage comparing the deformation data in the compression and rebound stages the deformation in the rebound stage was much smaller than that in the compression stage 4 summary and conclusions theoretically seepage and stress fields in a saturated aquitard are mutually restricted the pore water pressure generated by seepage alters the stress state of the aquitard in addition the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard changes with consolidation loading and deformation with an increase in multistage loading the pore water of the aquifer system is gradually discharged nonlinear deformation and pore water discharge eventually lead to continuous and complex changes in the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer system therefore studying the heterogeneity of consolidation and the nonlinear variation of key parameters is crucial for predicting the consolidation and rebound of the aquifer system the main conclusions are as follows in this study we designed a consolidation instrument for an aquifer system under multistage loading we can obtain data on pore water pressure deformation and water release at different locations of multiple soil layers simultaneously through a series of laboratory experiments we achieved a better understanding of the consolidation characteristics of the aquifer system moreover we estimated the hydraulic conductivity based on the water release data at different depths which contributed to our understanding of the spatiotemporal variation of the key parameters during consolidation in detail these findings can help develop the theory and model of consolidation under the designed multistage loading conditions the upper and lower parts of the aquitard exhibited obvious nonlinear deformation in the first loading stage the compression of part i was much greater than that of part ii in the second loading stage the compressions of parts i and ii were almost equal when the third stage loading was applied the compression of part ii developed more rapidly and exceeded that of part i of the aquitard in this study the strains of part i were 0 048 0 030 and 0 014 while those of part ii were 0 021 0 032 and 0 052 respectively by observing the compressions of each stage separately it can be found that there is a non direct correlation between the compressions of different parts of the aquitard and the magnitude of the loading however the compression difference between parts i and ii gradually decreased as the loading increased for the entire aquitard the hydraulic conductivity of different parts of the aquifer system under multistage loading presented different degrees of variation and corresponded to nonlinear deformation in the first and second loading stages the variation rate of k 2 was greater than that of k 3 in the third loading stage the value of k 3 decreased significantly and its variation rate exceeded that of k 2 the hydraulic conductivity increased only slightly in the rebound stage and rebound occurred mainly in the lower part of the aquitard in this study we ignored the effects of non vertical one dimensional and non darcy flows on the calculated hydraulic conductivity however these factors may cause errors in the calculation of the parameters which will be an interesting problem for future research the isochrones of pore water pressure gradually flattened under multistage loading the average dissipation rate of pore water pressure increased and the time to reach the peaks gradually increased comparing the pore water pressure calculated by the model in this study with the experimental pore water pressure the experimental results based on the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 and asymptotic hydraulic conductivity k have delayed and advanced effects compared to the theoretical curves therefore the pore water pressure curves based on the average of k 0 and k could better fit the theoretical curves in the process of pore water pressure dissipation reverse pore water pressure fluctuations occur in the aquitard away from the drainage boundary which cannot be described by traditional one dimensional consolidation theory improving and optimizing the consolidation theory to simultaneously reflect variations in hydraulic conductivity and reverse pore water pressure fluctuations will be an interesting direction

3248,aquifer heterogeneity is critical for predicting processes involved in the dissipation of pore water pressure consolidation and rebound the consolidation and rebound of aquifer systems should consider the spatiotemporal variation in the hydraulic and mechanical parameters of the aquifer and aquitard in this study a series of laboratory experiments was conducted to characterize the consolidation and rebound of the aquifer system and estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard the experimental results revealed that under multistage loading the compression in the upper part of the aquitard tended to decrease while the compression in the lower part of the aquitard tended to increase in addition the variation in hydraulic conductivity and deformation of the aquitard were closely related and reasonably matched at each stage moreover a one dimensional consolidation model was developed to simulate the variation in pore water pressure and compare it with the experimental pore water pressure reverse pore water pressure fluctuations occurred within a part of the aquitard away from the drainage boundary compared to the theoretical curves the experimental curves of the pore water pressure calculated from the initial and asymptotic hydraulic conductivities exhibited delayed and advanced effects these findings can help elucidate the characteristics of consolidation and rebound of aquifer systems and the spatiotemporal variation in hydraulic conductivity keywords aquitard heterogeneity reverse pore water pressure fluctuations hydraulic conductivity 1 introduction with the acceleration of economic development the scale of civil engineering construction is gradually expanding especially in coastal areas with complex aquifer systems neuman and witherspoon 1969 streltsova 1976 pope and burbey 2004 however this rapid expansion also leads to problems such as the non uniform subsidence of the aquitard liu et al 2015 yin et al 2016 complex distribution of pore water pressure sivakumar et al 2011 and insufficient consolidation tavenas et al 1983 shi et al 2008 the aquifer system is composed of layered aquifers and aquitards aquitards usually consist of fine grained sediments such as clays whereas aquifers typically consist of coarse grained sediments such as sand and gravel one of the challenges in aquifer systems research is the exploration of the properties of aquitards clayey grains have electric surface charge and form aggregates with pore sizes that are frequently larger than the grain diameter therefore aquitards tend to have greater compressibility freeze and cherry 1979 and higher storativity zhuang et al 2015 accurately predicting the deformation of aquitards in an aquifer system is critical for engineering management and safety konikow and neuzil 2007 luo et al 2020 therefore we must focus on the spatiotemporal distribution of the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard under complex loading to acquire an accurate prediction which is also the target of this study since the establishment of the one dimensional consolidation theory terzaghi 1925 researchers have made a series of improvements to the traditional consolidation theory taking into account the large strain heterogeneity and parameter variation gibson et al 1967 xie and leo 2004 initially the coefficient of compressibility was assumed to be constant and hydraulic conductivity was closely related to pore water pressure schiffman 1958 subsequently davis and raymond 1965 proposed a non linear consolidation theory which relies on the linear relationship between the void ratio e and the logarithm of pressure logp and found that the dissipation of pore water pressure is smaller than the traditional one dimensional consolidation theory at a higher pressure increment ratio gibson et al 1981 proposed a large strain consolidation theory that considers the deformation of the soil during consolidation that considers the void ratio as a variable and ignores the independent variation in hydraulic conductivity and coefficient of compressibility the heterogeneity of aquitards is frequently encountered in nature and engineering and is one of the main challenges associated with understanding the characteristics of aquitards rodrigues 1983 traditionally the hydraulic and mechanical parameters of an aquitard have been obtained from laboratory tests on small samples using permeameters and oedometers deng et al 2017 wei et al 2017 cao et al 2020 although the one dimensional consolidation experiments and test instruments have been further improved and optimized the key parameters obtained from laboratory tests of small scale samples are relatively insufficient to characterize the quantitative heterogeneity of different parts of the aquifer system lee 1979 shi and wen 2004 li et al 2017 quantifying aquitard heterogeneity is more challenging than characterizing aquifer heterogeneity because observational data regarding aquitards are typically rare other studies have considered the effect of complex soil layers on consolidation characteristics at a regional scale and analyzed the variation in the compression coefficient and void ratio cetin 2000 miao et al 2009 however these studies could not simultaneously monitor the pore water pressure deformation and water release of the aquitard with high density and accuracy in this study we designed an experimental methodology to measure hydraulic conductivity and examined the nonlinear consolidation of the aquitard along with understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of hydraulic conductivity the experimental findings contribute to the development of the consolidation theory several studies have further considered the boundary conditions loading patterns and variation of parameters in the consolidation theory li et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 however the boundary and initial conditions of the traditional one dimensional consolidation equation are insufficient because drainage and boundary conditions are very complicated in natural environments mei and chen 2013 research has proposed that the basic assumptions of the traditional consolidation theory deviate from the actual conditions neuman et al 1982 depending on the scale of the project and type of construction different time dependent loading patterns occur multistage and cyclic loading are the main types of loading encountered in geotechnical engineering zhu and yin 2001 geng 2009 xie et al 2010 some studies have reported consolidation tests under different loading patterns muthing et al 2016 proposed an analytical solution under haversine cyclic loading and analyzed the variation in pore water pressure and effective stress tian et al 2020 studied the one dimensional consolidation of soil under multistage loading and solved the excess pore water pressure and degree of consolidation using the superposition formula of excess pore water pressure in this study we focused on the case of multistage loading as an external condition the nonlinear variation of permeability and compressibility are important factors that affect the deformation characteristics of aquitards during the consolidation process the permeability and compressibility of the aquitard decreased when effective stress increased however there was no significant correlation between the two many studies have assumed that the ratio of hydraulic conductivity and the coefficient of compressibility is constant to simplify the calculations however the correct prediction method for soil consolidation should analyze the hydraulic conductivity and coefficient of compressibility separately rather than focusing only on the coefficient of consolidation pyrah 1996 therefore individual studies on the permeability and compressibility of aquitards are essential for the development of consolidation theory we analyzed the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard at different depths was calculated through a series of laboratory experiments and the spatiotemporal variation of hydraulic conductivity in this study we explored the dynamics of the pore water pressure deformation and hydraulic conductivity in different parts of an aquitard under multistage loading therefore we developed an experimental instrument and conducted a series of laboratory experiments we measured and recorded data on pore water pressure deformation and water release at different depths in the aquifer system and analyzed the correlation between these data at different loading stages of the aquifer system especially the aquitard moreover we developed a mathematical model based on terzaghi s consolidation theory and calculated the theoretical curves of the pore water pressure using this model comparing the theoretical curves of pore water pressure with the experimental curves of pore water pressure the results show that nonlinear variations in the deformation and hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard have profound effects on the consolidation process and the dissipation of pore water pressure of the aquifer system our findings can help in understanding the nonlinear consolidation characteristics of aquitards through an experimental study of aquifer systems and contribute to the development of the consolidation theory 2 methodology the one dimensional consolidation of the aquifer system is based on the schematic shown in fig 1 the thickness of the aquitard and the upper and lower aquifers are denoted as h h u and h b respectively using the lagrangian coordinate system the z axis was positive downwards and the coordinate system was established by setting the origin at the top of the aquitard there was a fixed water head at the top of the aquifer system the system was subjected to an external vertical uniform loading q t fig 2 where q 0 q 1 and q 2 are the designed loadings for stages i ii and iii respectively when t t 1 the loading increases from stage i to stage ii and remains stable for a period of time then the loading continues to increase and reaches stage iii at t t 2 and remains constant the top surface of the aquifer system was pervious whereas the bottom surface was pervious or impervious in this study we considered the boundary condition in which the aquifer system has a pervious top and an impervious bottom 2 1 laboratory apparatus and procedures the prototype of the experimental device is shown in fig 3 the designed device consisted of four parts a drive system water supply system soil column system and monitoring system the main components of the device include a plexiglass column stand motor deformation plates sealing plates displacement sensors pressure sensors and accessories for filtering soil particles and distinguishing between different soil layers during consolidation the soil column for the experiments was an acrylic cylinder with a height outer diameter and inner diameter of 60 cm 16 cm and 14 cm respectively this experimental instrument was equipped with several deformation plates pore water pressure sensors and drainage outlets to simultaneously monitor pore water pressure deformation and water release at different depths in the aquifer system according to the experimental requirements the plexiglass column consisted of three parts from top to bottom the upper aquifer was filled with sand middle aquitard with clay and lower part with incompressible gravel the thickness of the incompressible gravel layer was 22 cm aquitard was 20 cm and sand layer was 5 cm five pore water pressure sensors were evenly distributed on one side of the plexiglass column and five drainage outlets were symmetrically distributed on the other side the design heights of the pore water pressure sensors and drainage outlets were 8 16 24 32 and 40 cm from the bottom of the soil column for convenient measurements and recordings the five drainage outlets from top to bottom were named from no 1 to 5 the filter devices were set at the connection between the drainage outlets and soil column and the overflow outlet of the entire column was located 55 cm from the bottom the soil samples used in the experiments were silty clay wherein 100 of the particles were smaller than 0 035 mm and the liquid and plastic limits were 47 and 33 respectively routine consolidation tests were conducted on the silty clay samples before the experiments in this study the initial void ratio of the clay layer was 1 28 the plexiglass column is non deformable in the horizontal direction therefore the consolidation process of the aquifer system in this experiment occurred only in the vertical direction the entire aquifer system was hydrostatic prior to the start of the experiment throughout the experiments the upper boundary of the simulated aquifer system was permeable while the lower boundary was impermeable the water flow in the plexiglass column was one dimensional in the vertical direction in this study the deformation of individual soil particles and water was negligible the deformation pore water pressure and water release data of different parts of the aquifer system were recorded and measured in real time the specific steps are as follows step i first we ensured that all types of sensors could collect data properly and that the operating interface can properly control the start pause and finish of the drive system step ii we began to fill in the materials first the interior of the plexiglass column was cleaned a layer of vaseline was then applied to the inner wall of the plexiglass column airless water was injected into the plexiglass column through the bottom valve and the water surface slowly rose the bottom valve was closed to stop water injection when the water surface reached the design height the previously soaked gravel and sand samples were removed and then the gravel silty clay and sand were slowly filled into the plexiglass column during the water injection process it is necessary to consider bubble retention in the clay and gravel layers and it was avoided to the maximum extent a filter screen must be installed at the interface of adjacent soil layers to ensure that the loss of soil particles is reduced and that water can flow normally after the gravel layer was poured the two parts of the aquitard were filled plates i and ii were set at the top z 0 cm and middle z 10 cm of the aquitard respectively these plates must be kept at a level to ensure accurate measurement the aquitard was left to stand for 12 h for every 5 cm of filling before resuming filling step iii the sealing plate and plexiglass column were connected by bolts and the sealing ring was installed in the middle to ensure the sealing of the plexiglass column except for the exhaust valve all valves were closed and a vacuum pump was used to extract air from the plexiglass column the negative pressure in the plexiglass column increased sequentially from 0 02 to 0 04 0 06 0 08 and finally 0 1 mpa the time interval for each level was 6 h step iv after filling the soil sample the peristaltic pump was connected to the inlet valve to slowly inject water into the plexiglass column the free water surface was gradually increased to the overflow valve the overflow valve and data acquisition system were opened to allow excess water to flow out and record the initial pore water pressure and deformation data when the pore water pressure was consistent with the hydrostatic pressure and without deformation our experimental preparation phase was completed step v according to the multistage loading design the first loading stage was set to 0 50 kpa the stabilization of the load pressure was controlled by adjusting the power of the motor the pore water pressure and deformation data were recorded in real time using the monitoring system we considered that the aquifer system reached a stable state when the pore water pressure dissipation was complete and the deformation remained constant this process usually lasts for several days depending on the thickness of the aquitard once everything was ready the drainage outlets were opened at different locations the water release per unit time at a steady state was measured and the hydraulic conductivity in different parts of the aquitard was calculated step vi the different loading stages 50 100 kpa and 100 200 kpa were adjusted according to the experimental design and stage v was repeated the pore water pressure water release compression and rebound of the aquitard were recorded finally the experiments were terminated and the instrument was turned off 2 2 mathematical model in this section we describe the construction of a mathematical model based on terzaghi s theory to simulate the dissipation of pore water pressure at different depths except for the initial and boundary conditions the other basic assumptions made in terzaghi s theory are followed in this study the governing equation of this one dimensional consolidation problem is expressed as eq 1 1 k v 1 e γ w a 2 u z 2 u t 0 z l t 0 in this study we focused on the boundary condition of the aquifer system with an impervious bottom therefore the initial and boundary conditions are presented in eqs 2 4 2 u u h z q 0 z l t 0 3 u u h 0 z 0 0 t 4 u z 0 z l 0 t where k v is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 e is the initial void ratio dimensionless and γ w is the unit weight of water ml 2t 2 a is the coefficient of compressibility m 1lt2 u is the pore water pressure at time t and depth z in the saturated clay

this study consisted of two aquifers and an aquitard the thickness of the middle silty clay layer was 20 cm which formed an aquitard the thicknesses of the upper and lower aquifers were 5 cm and 22 cm respectively during the experiments the computer controlled interface adjusted the motor power to precisely control loading the whole experimental process can be divided into four sequential stages stage i 0 50 kpa stage ii 50 100 kpa stage iii 100 200 kpa and the rebound stage 200 0 kpa the monitoring system can accurately obtain deformation and pore water pressure data for different parts of the aquifer system the measuring ranges of the deformation pore water pressure and pressure sensors were 20 mm 200 kpa and 500 kpa respectively 3 1 nonlinear consolidation of the aquitard 3 1 1 the pore water pressure change within the aquitard the dissipation curves of excess pore water pressure under multistage loading are shown in fig 4 the designed loadings for each stage were applied instantaneously to the top of the aquifer system at t 10 s and remained constant the three curves represent the pore water pressure at z 2 10 and 18 cm from the top of the aquitard at different loading stages according to the effective stress principle when a loading is applied immediately the pore water of the aquitard cannot be discharged in time the pore water of the aquitard bears the full pressure and the soil skeleton does not deform which causes a sudden increase in pore water pressure with the release of pore water in the aquitard and the reduction of pore water pressure the soil skeleton shares the loading pressure and causes consolidation and deformation of the aquitard as shown in fig 4 a part of aquitard near the drainage boundary consolidates first and completes the dissipation of pore water pressure at the earliest as the part of the aquitard near the drainage boundary gradually becomes denser and the hydraulic conductivity decreases it becomes more difficult for the excess pore water pressure at the far field from the top drainage boundary to dissipate as a result pore water pressure dissipation at the far field will also be longer than the near field from the drainage boundary fig 4c shows that the pore water pressure at z 2 cm of the aquitard became hydrostatic pressure and remained constant during the third loading stage the reason for this is the compression of the aquifer system which results in the upper sand replacing the clay at that depth fig 5 shows the pore water pressure isochrones at the different loading stages the dissipation rate of pore water pressure first increased and then decreased at different depths in the first stage the dissipation rate of the pore water pressure was rapid at the beginning of the consolidation the closer the part of the aquitard is to the drainage boundary the faster the dissipation rate of the excess pore water pressure as shown in fig 5a the dissipation rate at each depth reaches its peak between t 5 min and t 10 min in the second loading stage the pore water pressure dissipation rate increases slowly and the pore water pressure dissipation rate is basically the same at each depth of the aquitard in fig 5b the dissipation rate peaked between t 5 min and t 10 min at z 2 cm and the dissipation rate peaked at z 10 and 18 cm between t 15 min and t 20 min in the third loading stage the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure was slow in the first 20 min the pore water pressure away from the drainage boundary started to dissipate more rapidly than the pore water pressure near the drainage boundary between t 90 min and t 180 min according to fig 5c the dissipation rate of the pore water pressure at z 10 and 18 cm peaks between t 20 min and t 50 min from loading stages i to iii the time required for the excess pore water pressure dissipation rate to reach its peak gradually increased in summary the pore water pressure isochrones of the aquitard flattened progressively under multistage loading 3 1 2 nonlinear compression of the aquitard fig 6 shows the curves of compression and loading versus the loading time combined with fig 3 we can name the upper and lower parts of the aquitard as part i and part ii respectively table 1 lists the compression of different parts of the aquitard under multistage loading for the designed loading stages in this study the compressions in the upper part of the aquitard are 4 8 mm 3 0 mm and 1 4 mm while the compressions in the lower part of the aquitard are 2 1 mm 3 2 mm and 5 2 mm to represent the nonlinear consolidation of the aquitard more directly we calculated the strains in the upper and lower parts of the aquitard at the end of the different loading stages the strain can be calculated by ε δd h where δd is the compression of the aquitard and h is the initial thickness of the aquitard under multistage loading conditions the strains in the upper part of the aquitard were 0 048 0 030 and 0 014 while those in the lower part were 0 021 0 032 and 0 052 respectively fig 6 shows the significant nonlinear compression of the aquitard in the aquifer system under multistage loading in loading stage i the upper part of the aquitard began to drain and compress first and the compression of the upper part was larger than that of the lower part in stage ii the total compression in the upper part was essentially the same as that in the lower parts in the last loading stage compression of the aquitard occurred mainly in the lower part therefore there is a large variation in the compression in the upper and lower parts of the aquitard at different loading stages the difference between the total compression of different parts of the aquitard gradually decreased as the loading continued to increase in addition the compression at each loading stage was not directly proportional to the magnitude of the loading different loading conditions resulted in varying degrees of consolidation and void ratios in the different parts of the aquitard considering the consolidation and seepage the upper aquitard near the drainage boundary in the first stage starts to consolidate and deform first when the upper aquitard gradually becomes denser and the hydraulic conductivity decreases it becomes increasingly difficult for the lower aquitard to discharge the pore water and compress with the gradual increase in loading the pore volume of the upper aquitard gradually decreased whereas the lower aquitard still had a large pore volume the total compression of the upper and lower parts of the aquitard gradually became equal as loading continued to increase this result can also be analyzed from the perspective of nonlinear compression the void ratio of the aquitard has a complex spatiotemporal distribution under multistage loading conditions the complex nonlinear relationship between void ratio and coefficient compressibility resulted in the nonlinear compression in addition the friction between the aquifer system and the plexiglass column is also a possible cause of the nonlinear deformation 3 1 3 influence on the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard we first measured water release per unit time at different outlets the hydraulic conductivity of the different parts of the aquitard was calculated using darcy s law in this study we ignored the non vertical one dimensional and non darcy flows table 2 shows the calculated hydraulic conductivities of different parts of the aquitard after different loading stages the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 of the aquitard was 3 30 10 6 cm s the hydraulic conductivities calculated from the water release data of outlets no 2 and 3 are named as k 2 and k 3 respectively in addition we calculated the hydraulic conductivity of the overall aquitard k 4 based on the water release at the bottom of the aquitard through outlet no 4 in table 2 we can see that the rate of change of k 2 is greater than that of k 3 in the first and second stages k 3 rapidly decreases and its rate of change exceeds that of k 2 in the third stage in the final rebound stage k 3 increases by 23 and k 2 increases by 4 in each loading stage the values of k 4 are marginally larger compared to that of k 3 this variation and distribution of hydraulic conductivity correspond to the nonlinear deformation of the aquifer system under multistage loading therefore the calculation of hydraulic conductivity for each part of the aquitard after different loading stages can aid in understanding and describing the permeability of the aquitard at different depths during complex nonlinear deformations the mathematical model and solution under constant loading can be used to study the individual loading stages under multistage loading in this study we chose the first loading stage to compare the difference between experimental and theoretical values of excess pore water pressure we compiled the analytical solution of eq 6 and then plotted the curves of the theoretical pore water pressure versus the time factor t v at different depths of the aquitard the experimental pore water pressure curves at different depths versus time factor were obtained based on the calculated hydraulic conductivity before and after the experiment and pore water pressure data in fig 7 the three solid curves represent the theoretical standard pore water pressures at different depths and the three dashed curves and three dotted curves represent the experimental standard pore water pressures calculated from k 0 and k respectively the trends in the theoretical and experimental curves of the pore water pressure were consistent however the experimental results based on the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 and asymptotic hydraulic conductivity k have delayed and advanced effects compared to the theoretical pore water pressure dissipation process therefore the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard varied between k 0 and k during the consolidation of the aquifer system in addition the pore water pressure at z 10 and 18 cm of the aquitard initially increased slightly and then decreased continuously we found that there were reverse pore water pressure fluctuations in the far field of the aquitard from the top drainage boundary in the initial stage of the dissipation of excess pore water pressure kim and parizek 1997 berg et al 2015 the mandel cryer effect was discovered when solving consolidation problems through biot s consolidation theory which is an unusual phenomenon that occurs in three dimensional consolidation mckinley 1998 selvadurai and shirazi 2004 however this phenomenon was not observed in previous theories and experiments on one dimensional consolidation reverse pore water pressure fluctuations are caused when loading is applied to an aquifer system with a pervious top boundary resulting in the compression of the near field from the drainage boundary owing to the water release and increased total and effective stresses owing to the lateral limitations of the soil column and the delayed drainage of the far field from the drainage boundary the near field from the drainage boundary inevitably compresses the far field from the drainage boundary to ensure the overall deformation coordination of the aquifer system as a result the total stress in the far field from the drainage boundary exceeds the initial pressure and the pore water pressure in the far field from the drainage boundary also increases by compression 3 2 rebound test of the aquitard the curves of the pore water pressure under rebound versus time are shown in fig 8 the three solid curves represent the measured pore water pressure at different depths and the three dashed lines represent the means of the pore water pressure obtained before the beginning of the rebound fig 9 shows the deformation of the two parts of the aquitard during rebound it can be observed from the figures that the loading was released and remained unloaded at t 80 000 s the ranges of the deformation and pore water pressure sensors were selected based on the magnitude of the excess pore water pressure and the compression of the aquitard thus there can be some measurement error for monitoring smaller negative pressures and rebound the saturated aquitard generated negative pressure during the rebound stage and the rebound in the upper part of the aquitard part i was much smaller than that in the lower part of the aquitard part ii the value of negative pressure in part ii of the aquitard was greater than that in part i of the aquitard and the dissipation rate of negative pressure in part ii was slower than that in part i the data of the deformation sensors showed that the rebound of part i and part ii were 0 05 mm and 0 20 mm respectively the rebound stage of the aquifer system was divided into primary and secondary rebound phases the primary rebound phase occurred during unloading at t 80 000 s the rebound of part ii of the aquitard increased suddenly while the deformation of part i of the aquitard underwent a process of compression followed by a rebound this result can be attributed to the fact that the near field of the aquitard from the drainage boundary is denser than that in the far field the part i of the aquitard receives water from the drainage boundary while part ii of the aquitard absorbs water from part i at a faster rate in addition the second rebound phase occurred at approximately t 150 000 s the pore water pressure of the aquitard generated a series of negative pore water pressure fluctuations and smaller rebound fluctuations were generated throughout the aquitard the rebound mainly occurred in the aquitard away from the drainage boundary which corresponded to the variation in hydraulic conductivity in the rebound stage comparing the deformation data in the compression and rebound stages the deformation in the rebound stage was much smaller than that in the compression stage 4 summary and conclusions theoretically seepage and stress fields in a saturated aquitard are mutually restricted the pore water pressure generated by seepage alters the stress state of the aquitard in addition the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard changes with consolidation loading and deformation with an increase in multistage loading the pore water of the aquifer system is gradually discharged nonlinear deformation and pore water discharge eventually lead to continuous and complex changes in the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer system therefore studying the heterogeneity of consolidation and the nonlinear variation of key parameters is crucial for predicting the consolidation and rebound of the aquifer system the main conclusions are as follows in this study we designed a consolidation instrument for an aquifer system under multistage loading we can obtain data on pore water pressure deformation and water release at different locations of multiple soil layers simultaneously through a series of laboratory experiments we achieved a better understanding of the consolidation characteristics of the aquifer system moreover we estimated the hydraulic conductivity based on the water release data at different depths which contributed to our understanding of the spatiotemporal variation of the key parameters during consolidation in detail these findings can help develop the theory and model of consolidation under the designed multistage loading conditions the upper and lower parts of the aquitard exhibited obvious nonlinear deformation in the first loading stage the compression of part i was much greater than that of part ii in the second loading stage the compressions of parts i and ii were almost equal when the third stage loading was applied the compression of part ii developed more rapidly and exceeded that of part i of the aquitard in this study the strains of part i were 0 048 0 030 and 0 014 while those of part ii were 0 021 0 032 and 0 052 respectively by observing the compressions of each stage separately it can be found that there is a non direct correlation between the compressions of different parts of the aquitard and the magnitude of the loading however the compression difference between parts i and ii gradually decreased as the loading increased for the entire aquitard the hydraulic conductivity of different parts of the aquifer system under multistage loading presented different degrees of variation and corresponded to nonlinear deformation in the first and second loading stages the variation rate of k 2 was greater than that of k 3 in the third loading stage the value of k 3 decreased significantly and its variation rate exceeded that of k 2 the hydraulic conductivity increased only slightly in the rebound stage and rebound occurred mainly in the lower part of the aquitard in this study we ignored the effects of non vertical one dimensional and non darcy flows on the calculated hydraulic conductivity however these factors may cause errors in the calculation of the parameters which will be an interesting problem for future research the isochrones of pore water pressure gradually flattened under multistage loading the average dissipation rate of pore water pressure increased and the time to reach the peaks gradually increased comparing the pore water pressure calculated by the model in this study with the experimental pore water pressure the experimental results based on the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 and asymptotic hydraulic conductivity k have delayed and advanced effects compared to the theoretical curves therefore the pore water pressure curves based on the average of k 0 and k could better fit the theoretical curves in the process of pore water pressure dissipation reverse pore water pressure fluctuations occur in the aquitard away from the drainage boundary which cannot be described by traditional one dimensional consolidation theory improving and optimizing the consolidation theory to simultaneously reflect variations in hydraulic conductivity and reverse pore water pressure fluctuations will be an interesting direction

3249,hydrologic exchange flows hefs of river aquifer systems are known to affect water flow but the quantitative influences of lateral hefs and the riparian zone s hydraulic conductivity k distribution on stream fluxes remain obscure under varying hydrologic conditions to fill this knowledge gap this study proposed a physical based distributed domain coupled open channel and groundwater flow model ddcm to quantify the effect of lateral hefs on hydrograph characteristics including especially the peak discharge and tailing decay which are practically important numerical experiments showed that 1 the interaction between the lateral hefs and river hydrodynamics reduced the peak discharge and flood flow rates 2 a heterogeneous k field of the riparian zone generated multi rate hefs which then changed flow response represented by the hydrographs with various declining rates varying from exponential to power law significantly expanding the flow process and 3 the probability density function of k also affected the tailing and peak of the hydrograph a preliminary test showed that the ddcm captured the overall pattern of hydrographs observed from a catchment in the wadi ahin west oman this study therefore provided a model based quantification of the mechanisms and factors of the lateral hefs affecting the hydrograph pattern in flood events and further applications are needed to test the applicability of the ddcm in capturing real world hydrographs affected by the lateral hefs keywords lateral hefs distributed domain coupling model spatial heterogeneity power law decay multi rate flow 1 introduction hydrologic exchange flows hefs affect solute transport in river riparian systems especially when the river stage fluctuates which in turn affects aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles brunke and gonser 1997 krause et al 2011 ward et al 2013 boano et al 2014 kiel and cardenas 2014 zimmer and lautz 2014 bernard jannin et al 2016 trauth and fleckenstein 2017 liang et al 2018 hefs involve bidirectional fluxes vertically and or laterally typically in hyporheic zones riverbanks and floodplains jung et al 2004 cardenas 2009a cardenas 2009b harvey and gooseff 2015 allgeier et al 2021 vertical hefs mainly refer to the interaction between river water and water in riverbed sediments while lateral hefs refer to the interaction between river water and groundwater in bank sediments cardenas 2009a cardenas 2009b kiel and cardenas 2014 hefs can prolong the contact time between river water and alluvium and further alter the residence time distribution of water traveling through the catchment eventually affecting water quality and quantity jones and mulholland 1999 kirchner et al 2000 cardenas 2008 hefs occurring between a river channel and riverbank can significantly affect hydrographs if the discharge condition changes especially under overbank flooding hunt 1990 doble et al 2012 francis et al 2015 liang et al 2020 hefs may also lead to a delayed streamflow response and solute retention haggerty et al 2002 cardenas et al 2004 kirchner and colin 2013 gomez velez et al 2017 the mechanisms of hefs affecting the peak and tailing behavior of hydrographs however have not been sufficiently explored especially under flood event conditions dudley southern and binley 2015 liang et al 2018 this knowledge gap motivated this study hefs are mainly influenced by the spatiotemporal variation of the hydraulic gradient and the distribution of hydraulic conductivity k within the river aquifer system cardenas et al 2004 harvey and gooseff 2015 liu et al 2020 shuai et al 2019 storey et al 2003 with a constant river discharge the hydraulic gradient is in steady state controlled by channel morphology including individual stream reaches wondzell 2006 channel sinuosity boano et al 2006 and bedform wörman et al 2002 with a changing river discharge the hydraulic gradient is mainly affected by river stage fluctuations a river stage higher than the riparian zone hydraulic head causes water to infiltrate into the riparian zone while a lower river stage leads to a return flow from the riparian zone to the river channel cardenas et al 2004 liang et al 2018 fig 1 the k distribution of the riparian zone which is mainly affected by the spatial heterogeneity of soil physical properties jiang et al 2015 zeleke and si 2005 zhang et al 2014 also influences the magnitude and paths of hefs currently many field studies focus on the impact of the system s heterogeneity on hyporheic exchange at the reach scale while few field experiments have been performed at the watershed scale for example anibas et al 2011 developed a thermal mapping method to study the surface water groundwater interaction in one section of the aa river belgium and found that the k of riverbed sediment is a crucial factor that affects hyporheic exchange wang et al 2017 applied darcian flux calculations and the vertical streambed temperature profile approach to study the spatial variability in streambed vertical k for three types of streambed morphologies they investigated the correlation between water flux k and hydraulic head at three sites in the beiluo river china in addition cardenas 2008 found that the spatial heterogeneity of the riparian hyporheic zone was associated with the late time tailing behavior of water flow and solute transport field experiments and numerical models provide common and reliable approaches to investigate the hef process under different flow conditions tonina and buffington 2007 cardenas 2009a cardenas 2009b some studies applied trace tests using chemicals and or temperature and the water balance approach to quantify hefs along rivers wondzell 2006 payn et al 2009 westhoff et al 2011 ward et al 2013 although field experiments provide direct data to analyze hefs these experiments if applied alone mainly produce case specific results rather than general implications reliable and testable numerical models can provide insights into hydrodynamic processes many modeling studies have been conducted to interpret the interaction between hefs and hydrographs åkesson et al 2015 for example pinder and sauer 1971 proposed a coupled model to simulate the river aquifer interaction which contains a one dimensional 1 d open channel flow equation and a 2 d transient groundwater flow equation their numerical results showed that the hydrologic exchange process attenuated the flood peak and could lead to a late time tailing behavior of the stream hydrograph harvey and bencala 1993 used a 2 d hydraulic model to investigate the influence of streambed topography on hefs and found that both the variation in stream water slope and the stepped bed morphology controlled the water and solute exchange between the stream and subsurface water schmadel et al 2016 developed a comprehensive model to simulate the hyporheic flux between the streams and hillslope under diel hydrologic fluctuation conditions and found that dynamic boundary conditions could extend the hyporheic flow path gomez velez et al 2017 employed both the 2 d boussinesq equation and the advection dispersion equation to investigate hot spots and moments within the hyporheic zone including the influence of channel sinuosity and k on hydrologic exchange they found that the inflow and outflow of the hyporheic zone showed power law tailing behaviors liang et al 2018 proposed an analytical model based on the boussinesq equation and studied the spatiotemporal variations in inflow and return flow under flooding conditions and their model demonstrated that the return flow exhibited power law attenuation after a flood event most of the studies reviewed above used the river stage or discharge as a known boundary condition to study the influence of the hydrodynamic process on hefs without considering the influence of hefs on the streamflow response in addition only a few modeling studies had investigated the influence of the watershed spatial heterogeneity on the hydrograph tailing behavior although this issue had been frequently mentioned and well documented in field studies kirchner et al 2000 cardenas 2008 kollet and maxwell 2008 in the literature reviewed right above it was often found that the hydrographs observed in the field presented tailing behavior but few studies used mathematical models for quantitative analysis in this current study a physical based distributed domain coupled open channel flow and groundwater flow model ddcm was proposed to quantitatively investigate the impact of the lateral hef process on the pattern of hydrographs under dynamic flow conditions the coupled processes of hydrologic exchange and river hydrodynamics were studied through a series of numerical experiments this study aimed to address the following key questions 1 how do river channel characteristics affect these coupled processes under flood event conditions 2 how does the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity affect the hydrograph 3 what factors will lead to a power law tailing behavior of a streamflow the remainder of this work is organized as follows

draws the final conclusions 2 model development and distribution function our model ddcm couples the open channel flow with the riparian groundwater dynamics a rectangular domain is considered which includes a river channel and aquifers on both sides of the river fig 2 the river flow direction is along the y axis the length and width of the river channel are l and b r respectively and the distance between the lateral groundwater boundary and the river channel is denoted as b the aquifers are assumed to be heterogeneous and isotropic the aquifer on each side is underlain by an aquitard and is connected to the river channel the river flow is described by the 1 d saint venant equation and the groundwater flow is described by the 2 d nonlinear boussinesq equation the dynamic hydrologic

and xie 2007 lapidus and pinder 1999 3 distribution function in this study the gamma and lognormal distributions are used to generate the hydraulic conductivity in the heterogeneous aquifers the two

river channel characteristics control the hydrograph pattern in the synthetic cases the total length and width of the river aquifer segment conceptualized in fig 2 are lt 10 km and bt 140 m respectively the river width is b r 40 m the coefficient of roughness is nc 0 02 and the water surface slope is j 0 002 the initial stage of the river equals the initial equivalent pressure head of groundwater z 0 hg 0 3 m the width of the aquifer is b 50 m and the specific yield is sy 0 1 these parameters can represent those for a regional scale river aquifer system which are also appropriate for the dimension of a numerical test site the space steps are δ x 2 m and δ y 50 m leading to 200 segments of river channel and 10 000 blocks of aquifer 5000 on each side of the river according to the manning formula u r 1 n c r 2 3 j 1 2 the background discharge is q 0 508 5 m 3 s and the discharges in the numerical results are background subtracted the hydrographs are calculated at the location of y 10 km i e the downstream boundary as shown above hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifers in this study follows the lognormal and gamma distributions in different numerical experiments which are two widely used probability density functions pdfs for hydrologic properties yue et al 2001 the distribution of k of the aquifers on both banks of the river is symmetrical i e the k values are mirrored we randomly assign k values which obey the lognormal or gamma distribution to some sub domains n 100 in one side of the study domain and then interpolate the distribution of k in this side of the study domain 25 200 5 000 using the simple kriging method without specific instructions we assume that the unit hydrograph of upstream discharge representing the boundary condition at the upstream location satisfies the following form tunas 2019 4a q t t t p e x p 1 t t p c 3 4b q t q p q t where q t dimensionless is the unit hydrograph tp t is the arrival time of the flood peak c 3 is the coefficient of the hydrograph shape q t l 3 t 1 is the upstream discharge and qp l 3 t 1 is the peak value of flood we conducted numerical experiments on the synthetic case described above to investigate the following three scenarios with increasing medium heterogeneity where the corresponding parameters are listed in table 1 scenario 1 with a homogeneous k field in this scenario we investigate the effects of river system characteristics i e k b r j and nc on the hydrograph in a homogenous k field k 0 0005 m s representing the typical k for sorted sand the incoming flow at the upstream location x 0 is a continuous source and satisfies the unit hydrograph formula 4 with tp 1800 s c 3 2 and qp 1000 m 3 s scenario 2 with one set of heterogeneous k fields in this scenario the effects of heterogeneous k of the aquifer on the hydrograph are studied the river channel is divided into 200 sub domains and the random hydraulic conductivities ki i 1 2 5000 are assumed to follow the gamma or lognormal distribution we explore the tailing behavior and peak portion of the hydrograph which both vary with the change in the relative standard deviation rsd of k the mean value of k is set as 0 0005 m s and the rsd varies from 0 to 1 5 the initial and boundary conditions are the same as those used for scenario 1 scenario 3 with multiple sets of heterogeneous k fields to identify the river system characteristics controlling the tailing behavior of the hydrograph we generated 100 sets of random ki for each case which satisfies the lognormal or gamma distribution with the rsd equal to 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in simulating the hydrographs effects of the ki distribution range and the variation of k on hydrograph patterns are analyzed the mean value of k is 0 0005 m s and the initial and boundary conditions are the same as those used for scenario 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 impacts of river system characteristics on hydrograph the main results from scenario 1 are presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3a when the lateral hefs are not considered i e k 0 the peak discharge downstream x 10 km is 937 7 m 3 s and the peak arrival time is 2960 s if k 0 0005 m s the peak discharge downstream is 408 7 m 3 s 56 4 deduction and the peak arrival time is 3800 s 28 4 delay fig 3a also indicates that with an increasing k the tail of hydrographs becomes heavier hence the hydrologic exchange effect can reduce the flood peak discharge and slow down the arrival time of the flood peak the reduced discharge in river is temporarily stored in the lateral hyporheic zone then it is slowly released if the river stage is lower than that of the hyporheic zone causing the discharge tailing behavior fig 3b shows that the flow peak decreases with a decrease of b r the reason is that for a given inflow discharge upstream the narrower the channel the more the water level changes this results in a greater hydrologic exchange rate and more river water entering the riparian zone therefore for a wider river section the contribution of lateral hefs on flow discharge will be smaller according to manning s formula it is expected that the flow peak decreases with the increasing nc and increases with the increase in j meanwhile as shown in fig 3c and 3d the tailing behavior of hydrographs becomes heavier with the increase in nc and the decrease in j in addition to the fact that a reduction of j or an increase of nc itself would lead to a decrease in flow velocity flow discharge it would also lead to an increasing exchange time between the river and the riparian zone which would further reduce the peak value and enhance the hydrograph tailing according to the analysis shown above due to the hydrologic exchange process riverbanks can reduce the peak discharge thus information on the permeability of the riparian zone within catchments can be important for flood control planning and flood forecasting hefs also change the river flow field and enhance the contact between contaminants and the alluvium thus affecting the fate and transport of contaminants in the river aquifer system 4 2 impacts of aquifer heterogeneity on hydrograph many real world observations have shown that the flood hydrograph has tailing characteristics payn et al 2009 jencso et al 2010 baartman et al 2012 ward et al 2013 these tailing behaviors vary from exponential decay to power law decay with a broad variation range based on scenario 2 the effect of hydrogeological heterogeneity on the hydrograph particularly its tailing behavior is investigated here by focusing on the commonly used gamma and lognormal distributions of k kirchner et al 2000 yue et al 2001 listed in section 2 fig 4 shows that when the rsd of k increases the long term tail of the hydrograph gradually shifts from exponential decay to power law decay the reason may be that the random hydraulic conductivity of each sub domain causes the hefs to exhibit multi rate characteristics when the flood recedes due to the contribution of multi rate return flows the hydrograph declines slowly in a power law form the numerical results also show that regardless of the pdf of k i e gamma or lognormal pdf the hydrograph tailing behavior tends to decay in a power law form when the rsd of k gradually increases in general the heterogeneous k of natural soil may be distributed according to the gamma or lognormal distribution soil heterogeneity tends to act as a converter by transforming the exponential decay process into the power law decay process this may explain the power law decay phenomenon often observed in hydrologic processes in natural media the distribution of k in the riparian zone affects both the magnitude and the kinematic wave velocity of the peak flow through a river reach it is shown that when k obeys the gamma or lognormal distribution the hydrograph peak tends to increase with the increase in the rsd of k it is our expectation that the increase of rsd will make the distribution of k more uneven which will reduce the flow connectivity of the riparian zone resulting in the decrease of the entire river riparian water exchange capacity 4 3 factors controlling the hydrograph tailing behavior the results shown above lead to the following two questions first if k satisfies the gamma or lognormal distribution with a large rsd does this scenario always lead to a power law decay for the hydrograph tail second why does the gamma distribution of k differ from the lognormal one in approaching the power law tailing behavior in the hydrograph scenario 3 addresses the two questions for the first question fig 5 shows that when the rsd of k increases from 0 5 to 1 5 the long term tail of the hydrographs gradually changes from exponential decay to power law decay and the duration of the power law decay increases however the power law decay of the hydrograph does not persist especially when k follows a lognormal distribution as illustrated in fig 5 an increase of the rsd of k increases the average slope of the hydrograph s late time tail when k satisfies the gamma distribution the hydrograph is more likely to exhibit a power law decay tail with a longer duration than that with a lognormal distribution of k our explanation is the larger the rsd the wider the distribution of the k and it is more likely to have multi rate return flows these return flows have different discharge and arrival times when reaching downstream which ultimately lead to the tailing behavior of the hydrograph to answer the second question we first analyzed the influence of the change of k to the hydrograph fig 6 a shows that the smaller the k the greater the influence of the change of k on the tailing behavior of the hydrograph what is important is that k affects two aspects of hydrograph tailing behaviors 1 the larger the k the heavier the tail and 2 the larger the k the earlier the tail will appear and the shorter the duration therefore a single k value is not sufficient to cause a power law decay for the late time hydrograph fig 6b shows the sensitivity q k of the peak discharge to k when the k is smaller the flood peak value is more sensitive to the change of k in general the hydrograph pattern is increasingly insensitive to the variation of k the spatial distributions of hefs qgr were then evaluated here for different k distributions the hydrograph tailing behavior is mainly affected by the return flow qgr 0 here we selected t 9000 s as the sampling time since the flood peak had passed through the downstream section and groundwater was recharging the river qgr 0 after this time as shown in fig 7 a 7c when k followed the gamma distribution rsd 1 5 the lognormal distribution rsd 1 5 and the uniform distribution rsd 0 the resultant range of qgr m 2 s was 8 4 10 14 3 5 10 4 2 1 10 14 5 4 10 4 and 3 8 10 5 1 2 10 4 respectively therefore the return flow presented a more pronounced multi rate distribution if k had a broader distribution fig 7d shows the return flow rates in the total of l d y 200 sections in descending order the gamma distribution of k produced more low velocity return flow regions 200 169 31 sections than that of the lognormal distribution 200 187 13 sections which might be more likely to cause power law decay of the hydrograph tail notably this assumption cannot be reliably proved by fig 7 since this figure shows only one snapshot i e at a specific moment of the hefs and the hef vectors including the magnitude and direction may also change spatiotemporally and thence complicates the hydrography tailing behavior finally we analyzed the distribution range of k generated by the gamma and lognormal distributions with different rsds fig 8 compares the range of k values generated by the gamma lognormal distribution when rsd 1 5 and k 0 0005 m s table 2 lists the distribution ranges of k with different rsds fig 8 shows that in the semi logarithmic coordinate the k generated by the gamma distribution has a wider or less uniform distribution than the k generated by the lognormal distribution especially in the small value range see also table 2 this may cause the hydrological exchange process to produce multi rate return flow ultimately leading to the power law tailing behavior of the hydrograph when k of the heterogeneous aquifer follows the gamma distribution notably the gamma distribution is the combination of the power law distribution and the exponential distribution therefore when the k of the aquifer satisfies the gamma distribution and the rsd is large the hydrograph s late time tail generated by multi rate hefs may be closer to the power law decay in conclusion the hydrograph pattern is mainly controlled by the following factors 1 the distribution range of k and the proportions of different distribution ranges and 2 whether the hydrograph s peak discharge and tail portion are sensitive to k some studies kirchner and colin 2013 zhang et al 2017 have shown that geological heterogeneity that exhibits multi scaling behaviors can be responsible for the power law tailing phenomenon of hydrological processes in catchments our study suggests that the spatially heterogeneous hefs lead to multi rate return flows between the riparian zone and river enhancing the hydrograph s late time tail different hydraulic conductivity distributions within the catchment lead to different late time tailing behaviors of the hydrograph these interacting hydrodynamic processes in the catchment system act as a filter that smooths the input signal e g inflow and chemistry from the upstream location in addition to the hefs other hydrological processes such as nutrients moving in streams affected by soil heterogeneity may also exhibit a power law decay phenomenon the modeling methods and conclusions of this work can also be extended to these hydrological processes 5 preliminary application as a preliminary test the ddcm proposed above is applied here to simulate the hydrographs induced by rainfall events in the wadi ahin west oman fig 9 the hourly flow and rainfall data were obtained from the hayl flow gauge and the seven rainfall gauges in the wadi ahin west catchment aisha al qurashi et al 2008 the wadi ahin west catchment situated in the north of oman has a drainage area of 734 km2 and low vegetation cover with the channels in this catchment consisting mainly of sands and gravel see aisha al qurashi et al 2008 for detailed hydrologic conditions of the study site nine rainfall events from 1996 to 1998 where rainfall durations were short and concentrated were simulated by the ddcm for the study site these nine rainfall events were named by their dates for example event 05 september 1998 the information of these nine rainfall events is listed in table 3 and the field data and the model results of the nine hydrographs are plotted in fig 10 the width br and slope of the channels j in the model were defined based on the data in aisha al qurashi et al 2008 the hydraulic conductivity k and manining s roughness coefficient nc were then calibrated we fixed the two parameters br and j determined above set different k and nc values for simulation and then calculated the coefficient of determination of the model results based on the field data this trial and error approach led to the best fit k and nc with the largest coefficient of determination the best fit manining s coefficient was 0 035 close to that 0 036 approximated by aisha al qurashi et al 2008 the hydraulic conductivity k was first assumed to be uniform and isotropic to check whether the simplified model can capture the general pattern of the hydrograph if not then a high resolution heterogeneous k distribution would be fitted the other reason for selecting a uniform k as the first fitting exercise was because of the limited hydrologic information of this study site including for example the coarse resolution rainfall data mentioned below which increased the uncertainty for a fine resolution model with a complex k distribution we also assumed that the rainfall recharge in the riparian zones flowed mainly to the corresponding river channels r1 r6 notably this assumption was not based on field observations which were not available but for application simplification to reduce the number of unknown parameters for each rainfall event simulation the four main parameters of the ddcm k nc j and br remained unchanged and hence the model applicability was partially validated for this study site the time step size was set as δ t 100 s and space step sizes were set as δ x 2 m and δ y 50 m as shown in fig 10 the initial river discharge of the 9 simulated rainfall runoff events was close to base flow hence the initial condition was selected as base flow and the calculated discharge was then subtracted by the initial discharge considering the large basin area 734 km2 the spatial distribution of rainfall has a great influence on the observed hydrographs but the actual spatial distribution of rainfall was unknown note that the seven gauges were not enough to provide a high resolution spatial distribution of rainfall needed for the fine resolution model therefore the following two rainfall patterns were considered to simulate the hydrographs 1 rainfall fell evenly within the catchment the corresponding model is abbreviated as ddcm e and 2 rainfall fell within a 5 km radius of the rainfall center the corresponding model is abbreviated as ddcm c the model input rainfall per unit time assigned for each sub catchment ri is calculated according to the runoff coefficient and rainfall intensity and area finally based on the river network information as shown in fig 9 the hydrodynamic process of each sub channel is connected to calculate the hydrograph at the downstream outlet which is then compared with the observed hydrograph fig 10 shows the data of these nine runoff events and the results of the model simulation in the two events 05 september 1998 and 07 august 1996 the left two plots on the top row although the rainfall was short and concentrated the observed hydrograph showed a bimodal phenomenon fig 10a and 10b in this case the simulation results of ddcm e were better than that of ddcm c this may be because the rainfall events were evenly distributed in the basin and river water from different tributaries reached downstream at different times resulting in a bimodal peak during the rainfall event 11 march 1996 there were two periods of relatively strong rainfall which lead to the bimodal phenomenon fig 10c at this time the ddcm e hydrograph was closer to the observed one but the model fit was still not satisfactory implying the complex spatiotemporal distribution of this rainfall event for other rainfall events such as 11 october 1997 13 september 1997 17 july 1998 20 july 1998 and 29 october 1997 see fig 9e 9i one flood peak was detected downstream the simulation results of ddcm c were closer to the observed data than those of ddcm e this indicates that the actual rainfall distribution might be concentrated near the rainfall centers while there was little rainfall in the tributary sub catchments table 4 shows the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of the 9 rainfall events because ddcm is a physical process based model it is sensitive to input conditions rainfall distribution when the rainfall distribution is known the ddcm can describe the downstream hydrograph as shown in fig 9a the real river has several curved sections and hence the simplification of the river network to the straight channel shown in fig 9b may affect the simulation results in at least two ways first compared with straight channels water flow slows downstream in the curved ones therefore the peak arrival time in the hydrograph simulated by the ddcm may be biased second the magnitude and pattern of hefs along the curved channel are different from those along the straight channel storey et al 2003 boano et al 2006 allgeier et al 2021 morén et al 2021 especially in the upstream part of the curved channel the water pressure is high which will promote the hefs to enter the riparian zone and part of the hefs will reach the downstream through the curved riparian zone these factors will affect the hydrograph pattern and need to be systematically evaluated in a future study using a field site with a finer resolution of hydrologic data notably this preliminary application only checked the applicability of the ddcm in simplifying complex river dynamics further applications are still needed to evaluate the ddcm s full capability in quantifying the impacts of the lateral hef and the aquifer heterogeneity on the nuance of the real world hydrograph especially its peak and tail it is also noteworthy that the impact of hefs on the hydrograph cannot be neglected in flood events although the rate of hefs can be several orders of magnitude lower than the flood discharge previous studies showed that the rate of lateral hefs significantly increased during flood events liu et al 2020 and the hefs occurred throughout the river network kiel and cardenas 2014 the ddcm proposed by this study considered the influence of lateral hefs on hydrograph our numerical results revealed the buffering effect of lateral hefs on flood hydrograph where the magnitude of this buffering effect is related to the riverbank sediment hydraulic conductivity channel characteristics and flow conditions as the flood flows over a long distance the river water is continuously forced to enter riparian zones and this accumulative discharge loss needs to be considered especially when k is large calculations in fig 10 also considered the effect of lateral hefs otherwise the model results would fit worse the observed hydrographs 5 1 influence of model parameters on rainfall runoff the above mentioned simulations revealed that input conditions rainfall or upstream flood in the hefs have dissimilar impacts on the resultant hydrograph pattern when the rainfall starts the initial river flow mainly consists of the rain that falls directly on the river surface and the amount of water that enters the channel rapidly after the rainfall event the flow in the channel is recharged by hefs which have a certain influence on the river discharge and flow velocity when the upstream flood arrives hefs can reduce the flood peak value and cause hydrograph tailing behavior however due to the large flood discharge and fast flow velocity the influence of hefs on flood velocity is limited based on the river channel data in section 5 shown in fig 9 we investigated the effects of the four ddcm parameters k b r j and nc on hydrograph under rainfall condition the simulation results are shown in fig 11 where base flow was subtracted from the river discharge as shown in fig 11a the increase of k increases the rate of hefs which reduces the discharge peak and causes the hydrograph tailing behavior in contrast to the flood condition the hydrograph tail is smoother and lasts longer under the rainfall condition the reason is that the rain falls directly on the riparian zone and raises the groundwater table which can provide long term hefs fig 11b shows that an increase of br may lead to a decrease in the mean flow velocity which is different from the results shown in fig 3b in this example the effect of rainfall was to raise the river stage and the hydraulic head of groundwater according to the manning s formula u r 1 n c r 2 3 j 1 2 r b r h r b r 2 h r when h r is the same the larger the b r the faster the river flow after the rainfall groundwater began to recharge the river and the wider the river channel the smaller the river stage rise caused by the same hefs this means that a larger channel width leads to a larger river flow velocity during the rainfall period while the river flow velocity with a wider channel will decline faster after the rainfall in this example the rainfall center is 25 km away from the downstream section the simulation results showed that a larger river width led to a longer time for the flow peak to reach the downstream section as shown in fig 11c j has a great influence on the flow velocity under the rainfall condition as expected contrarily for the case of upstream flood fig 3c j has a limited influence on the flow velocity as shown in fig 11d a large n c reduces the peak discharge and increases the peak arrival time which is consistent with the results under the upstream flood condition in conclusion the influence of hefs on hydrograph is not only related to hydrogeological parameters but also to the flow and rainfall conditions it is also noteworthy that the hydrograph can be influenced by many factors in addition to the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall the soil moisture and heterogeneity and the characteristics of the channel etc because the ddcm cannot capture the nuance of these factors it is difficult for ddcm to accurately predict the hydrograph the accuracy of experimental data also affects the model results for example the water surface slope data for each tributary only has an average value limiting the ddcm s capability in modeling the nuance of discharge however the ddcm can quickly predict the overall pattern of the hydrograph with limited hydrological data which can be practically useful for the field sites at a large scale with limited hydrological information 6 conclusion this study proposed a distributed domain model ddcm by coupling the river dynamic process and the hydrologic exchange process to quantify the influence of bidirectional hydrologic exchange flows hefs on hydrograph patterns a series of numerical experiments were conducted using a synthetic river aquifer case the influence of the channel characteristics including the sediment hydraulic conductivity k the river channel width br the hydraulic gradient j and the channel roughness nc on hydrograph patterns were analyzed moreover the impact of the hydraulic conductivity distribution on the falling limb of streamflow response was investigated by explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity in k the present ddcm was then applied to characterize the observed hydrographs the major conclusions of this study are as follows first the lateral hef can have a buffering effect on flood routing and at the same time cause the tailing phenomenon of the flood process the flow rate of lateral hef is mainly controlled by k when k is large the hydrologic exchange rate increases and the flood peak is significantly reduced meanwhile a large k leads to a heavy hydrograph tailing behavior at the late time with a short duration river channel characteristics including nc j and b r have a great influence on the downstream hydrograph the downstream flood encounters a greater dissipation with an increasing nc and decreasing j and b r these findings can be important for flood control second the spatial heterogeneity in k can have a significant impact on the shape of the hydrograph in general as the rsd of k increases the late time hydrograph tends to exhibit a power law decline because the spatially heterogeneous hefs between the riparian zone and the river channel can lead to multi rate return flows the hydrograph tailing behavior is mainly controlled by the following two factors 1 the distribution range of k and the proportions of different distribution ranges and 2 the sensitivity of hydrograph pattern to the variation of k this is the major mechanism of the power law tailing behavior of hydrographs revealed by this study third the influence of hefs to the hydrograph pattern is related to the channel characteristics the riparian zone permeability flow conditions and the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall fourth the ddcm proposed by this study can simulate the flood hydrographs observed at the hayl flow gauge in the wadi ahin west oman the rainfall distribution in the basin has a great influence on the hydrograph pattern it was expected that if the rainfall distribution can be reasonably captured ddcm may characterize better the observed hydrograph pattern further applications are needed to check the applicability of the ddcm in quantifying the impacts of the lateral hef and the aquifer heterogeneity on the nuance of real world hydrographs credit authorship contribution statement song wei methodology software validation writing original draft

solving the proposed ddcm model as shown in fig 2 the ddcm model simplified the river riparian system into a coupled 1d river channel and 2d groundwater hydrodynamic process due to the symmetry of both sides of the river only the riparian zone on one side needs to be calculated here although the hyporheic exchange on both sides of the river needs to be considered when quantifying the river flow hydrodynamics the river channel is divided into n sections n l δ y and the riparian zone is divided into n m sub areas where m b δ x where δ x and δ y are the spatial step sizes in the x and y directions respectively the total time of the model simulation is denoted as t and the total time step is n t t δ t where δ t is the time interval for simplification here we use superscripts to denote time and subscripts to denote space for example z r j k represents the numerical result of the river stage z r at time k δ t and position y j δ y and h g i j k represents the numerical result of the groundwater hydraulic head h g at time k δ t and position x y i δ x j δ y the ddcm model is solved numerically using the following three steps step ⅰ based on the water level information h k z r k and

iteration continues if the relative errors are less than the convergence criteria ε 1 ε 0 1 and ε 2 ε 0 2 the numerical result is considered to be stable and then move to step 1 to solve the next time

calculating the catchment scale hydrograph with rainfall events using ddcm when applying the ddcm method proposed by this study to calculate the hydrograph for a catchment the sub domain discretization and related hydrologic calculations are needed to reach this goal we proposed the following two step numerical strategy and applied it for solving the catchment scale hydrography with rainfall events in the wadi ahin west catchment shown in section 5 step ⅰ catchment separation and rainfall data processing 1 based on the characteristics of the river network mainly the sub drainage delineation the catchment is divided into sub domains 2 the rainfall received by each sub catchment is then calculated according to the intensity and spatial distribution of the rainfall and the area of the sub catchment these rainfall results are then allocated to each sub domain underlying each sub catchment for example for the wadi ahin west catchment discussed in section 5 six sub domains were identified and named as r1 r6 in fig 9b each of which contains the corresponding sub catchments no 1 20 shown in fig 9a specifically sub domain r1 contains sub catchments 2 6 11 and 12 sub domain r2 contains sub catchments 7 and 18 sub domain r3 contains sub catchments 8 and 9 sub domain r4 contains sub catchments 1 and 13 16 sub domain r5 contains sub catchments 10 and 20 and sub domain r6 contains sub catchments 17 and 19 the channel and riparian zones in each sub domain were discretized according to the method described in appendix a step 2 hydrodynamic calculation of the river network for a dendritic drainage basin such as the wadi ahin west catchment the hydrodynamic process of the tributaries is calculated first and then the mainstream during this calculation flows at the upstream channels are calculated first followed by the downstream channels meanwhile the discharge and water level at river confluences should satisfy the consistency equation for the wadi ahin west catchment hydrodynamic calculations for the 6 sub domains plotted in fig 9b were not independent but following step 2 mentioned above we also assumed that these six sub domains did not exchange water at the boundary with each other since field data about the possible water exchange between these sub domains were not available we emphasize here that the example shown in section 5 was mainly to check whether the ddcm method can roughly predict the hydrograph with limited field information an updated robust model can be built if the core hydrologic data are available for the study basin 
3249,hydrologic exchange flows hefs of river aquifer systems are known to affect water flow but the quantitative influences of lateral hefs and the riparian zone s hydraulic conductivity k distribution on stream fluxes remain obscure under varying hydrologic conditions to fill this knowledge gap this study proposed a physical based distributed domain coupled open channel and groundwater flow model ddcm to quantify the effect of lateral hefs on hydrograph characteristics including especially the peak discharge and tailing decay which are practically important numerical experiments showed that 1 the interaction between the lateral hefs and river hydrodynamics reduced the peak discharge and flood flow rates 2 a heterogeneous k field of the riparian zone generated multi rate hefs which then changed flow response represented by the hydrographs with various declining rates varying from exponential to power law significantly expanding the flow process and 3 the probability density function of k also affected the tailing and peak of the hydrograph a preliminary test showed that the ddcm captured the overall pattern of hydrographs observed from a catchment in the wadi ahin west oman this study therefore provided a model based quantification of the mechanisms and factors of the lateral hefs affecting the hydrograph pattern in flood events and further applications

law decay multi rate flow 1 introduction hydrologic exchange flows hefs affect solute transport in river riparian systems especially when the river stage fluctuates which in turn affects aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles brunke and gonser 1997 krause et al 2011 ward et al 2013 boano et al 2014 kiel and cardenas 2014 zimmer and lautz 2014 bernard jannin et al 2016 trauth and fleckenstein 2017 liang et al 2018 hefs involve bidirectional fluxes vertically and or laterally typically in hyporheic zones riverbanks and floodplains jung et al 2004 cardenas 2009a cardenas 2009b harvey and gooseff 2015 allgeier et al 2021 vertical hefs mainly refer to the interaction between river water and water in riverbed sediments while lateral hefs refer to the interaction between river water and groundwater in bank sediments cardenas 2009a cardenas 2009b kiel and cardenas 2014 hefs can prolong the contact time between river water and alluvium and further alter the residence time distribution of water traveling through the catchment eventually affecting water quality and quantity jones and mulholland 1999 kirchner et al 2000 cardenas 2008 hefs occurring between a river channel and riverbank can significantly affect hydrographs if the discharge condition changes especially under overbank flooding hunt 1990 doble et al 2012 francis et al 2015 liang et al 2020 hefs may also lead to a delayed streamflow response and solute retention haggerty et al 2002 cardenas et al 2004 kirchner and colin 2013 gomez velez et al 2017 the mechanisms of hefs affecting the peak and tailing behavior of hydrographs however have not been sufficiently explored especially under flood event conditions dudley southern and binley 2015 liang et al 2018 this knowledge gap motivated this study hefs are mainly influenced by the spatiotemporal variation of the hydraulic gradient and the distribution of hydraulic conductivity k within the river aquifer system cardenas et al 2004 harvey and gooseff 2015 liu et al 2020 shuai et al 2019 storey et al 2003 with a constant river discharge the hydraulic gradient is in steady state controlled by channel morphology including individual stream reaches wondzell 2006 channel sinuosity boano et al 2006 and bedform wörman et al 2002 with a changing river discharge the hydraulic gradient is mainly affected by river stage fluctuations a river stage higher than the riparian zone hydraulic head causes water to infiltrate into the riparian zone while a lower river stage leads to a return flow from the riparian zone to the river channel cardenas et al 2004 liang et al 2018 fig 1 the k distribution of the riparian zone which is mainly affected by the spatial heterogeneity of soil physical properties jiang et al 2015 zeleke and si 2005 zhang et al 2014 also influences the magnitude and paths of hefs currently many field studies focus on the impact of the system s heterogeneity on hyporheic exchange at the reach scale while few field experiments have been performed at the watershed scale for example anibas et al 2011 developed a thermal mapping method to study the surface water groundwater interaction in one section of the aa river belgium and found that the k of riverbed sediment is a crucial factor that affects hyporheic exchange wang et al 2017 applied darcian flux calculations and the vertical streambed temperature profile approach to study the spatial variability in streambed vertical k for three types of streambed morphologies they investigated the correlation between water flux k and hydraulic head at three sites in the beiluo river china in addition cardenas 2008 found that the spatial heterogeneity of the riparian hyporheic zone was associated with the late time tailing behavior of water flow and solute transport field experiments and numerical models provide common and reliable approaches to investigate the hef process under different flow conditions tonina and buffington 2007 cardenas 2009a cardenas 2009b some studies applied trace tests using chemicals and or temperature and the water balance approach to quantify hefs along rivers wondzell 2006 payn et al 2009 westhoff et al 2011 ward et al 2013 although field experiments provide direct data to analyze hefs these experiments if applied alone mainly produce case specific results rather than general implications reliable and testable numerical models can provide insights into hydrodynamic processes many modeling studies have been conducted to interpret the interaction between hefs and hydrographs åkesson et al 2015 for example pinder and sauer 1971 proposed a coupled model to simulate the river aquifer interaction which contains a one dimensional 1 d open channel flow equation and a 2 d transient groundwater flow equation their numerical results showed that the hydrologic exchange process attenuated the flood peak and could lead to a late time tailing behavior of the stream hydrograph harvey and bencala 1993 used a 2 d hydraulic model to investigate the influence of streambed topography on hefs and found that both the variation in stream water slope and the stepped bed morphology controlled the water and solute exchange between the stream and subsurface water schmadel et al 2016 developed a comprehensive model to simulate the hyporheic flux between the streams and hillslope under diel hydrologic fluctuation conditions and found that dynamic boundary conditions could extend the hyporheic flow path gomez velez et al 2017 employed both the 2 d boussinesq equation and the advection dispersion equation to investigate hot spots and moments within the hyporheic zone including the influence of channel sinuosity and k on hydrologic exchange they found that the inflow and outflow of the hyporheic zone showed power law tailing behaviors liang et al 2018 proposed an analytical model based on the boussinesq equation and studied the spatiotemporal variations in inflow and return flow under flooding conditions and their model demonstrated that the return flow exhibited power law attenuation after a flood event most of the studies reviewed above used the river stage or discharge as a known boundary condition to study the influence of the hydrodynamic process on hefs without considering the influence of hefs on the streamflow response in addition only a few modeling studies had investigated the influence of the watershed spatial heterogeneity on the hydrograph tailing behavior although this issue had been frequently mentioned and well documented in field studies kirchner et al 2000 cardenas 2008 kollet and maxwell 2008 in the literature reviewed right above it was often found that the hydrographs observed in the field presented tailing behavior but few studies used mathematical models for quantitative analysis in this current study a physical based distributed domain coupled open channel flow and groundwater flow model ddcm was proposed to quantitatively investigate the impact of the lateral hef process on the pattern of hydrographs under dynamic flow conditions the coupled processes of hydrologic exchange and river hydrodynamics were studied through a series of numerical experiments this study aimed to address the following key questions 1 how do river channel characteristics affect these coupled processes under flood event conditions 2 how does the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity affect the hydrograph 3 what factors will lead to a power law tailing behavior of a streamflow the remainder of this work is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 show the development of the new model and the synthetic scenarios respectively sections 4 and 5 discuss the numerical results and the preliminary application respectively section 6 draws the final conclusions 2 model development and distribution function our model ddcm couples the open channel flow with the riparian groundwater dynamics a rectangular domain is considered which includes a river channel and aquifers on both sides of the river fig 2 the river flow direction is along the y axis the length and width of the river channel are l and b r respectively and the distance between the lateral groundwater boundary and the river channel is denoted as b the aquifers are assumed to be heterogeneous and isotropic the aquifer on each side is underlain by an aquitard and is connected to the river channel the river flow is described by the 1 d saint venant equation and the groundwater flow is described by the 2 d nonlinear boussinesq equation the dynamic hydrologic exchange between the river and groundwater follows darcy s law 1 q gr k h h g z r dx where q gr represents the lateral hydrologic exchange flux from the groundwater to the river flow per unit length l

and xie 2007 lapidus and pinder 1999 3 distribution function in this study the gamma and lognormal distributions are used to generate the hydraulic conductivity in the heterogeneous aquifers the two parameter gamma distribution for a continuous random variable x is defined by a shape parameter α and a scale parameter β f g x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β x 0 the expected value of x following the gamma distribution is e x α β and the variance is v a r x α β 2 the bivariate lognormal distribution for the random variable x can be defined as follows f l x 1 x 2 π σ 2 e x p 1 2 l n x μ σ 2 x 0 where l n x n μ σ 2 is normally distributed with a mean μ and a standard deviation σ 3 synthetic case and numerical experiments in this section synthetic cases were used to test the ddcm and investigate how river channel characteristics control the hydrograph pattern in the synthetic cases the total length and width of the river aquifer segment conceptualized in fig 2 are lt 10 km and bt 140 m respectively the river width is b r 40 m the coefficient of roughness is nc 0 02 and the water surface slope is j 0 002 the initial stage of the river equals the initial equivalent pressure head of groundwater z 0 hg 0 3 m the width of the aquifer is b 50 m and the specific yield is sy 0 1 these parameters can represent those for a regional scale river aquifer system which are also appropriate for the dimension of a numerical test site the space steps are δ x 2 m and δ y 50 m leading to 200 segments of river channel and 10 000 blocks of aquifer 5000 on each side of the river according to the manning formula u r 1 n c r 2 3 j 1 2 the background discharge is q 0 508 5 m 3 s and the discharges in the numerical results are background subtracted the hydrographs are calculated at the location of y 10 km i e the downstream boundary as shown above hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifers in this study follows the lognormal and gamma distributions in different numerical experiments which are two widely used probability density functions pdfs for hydrologic properties yue et al 2001 the distribution of k of the aquifers on both banks of the river is symmetrical i e the k values are mirrored we randomly assign k values which obey the lognormal or gamma distribution to some sub domains n 100 in one side of the study domain and then interpolate the distribution of k in this side of the study domain 25 200 5 000 using the simple kriging method without specific instructions we assume that the unit hydrograph of upstream discharge representing the boundary condition at the upstream location satisfies the following form tunas 2019 4a q t t t p e x p 1 t t p c 3 4b q t q p q t where q t dimensionless is the unit hydrograph tp t is the arrival time of the flood peak c 3 is the coefficient of the hydrograph shape q t l 3 t 1 is the upstream discharge and qp l 3 t 1 is the peak value of flood we conducted numerical experiments on the synthetic case described above to investigate the following three scenarios with increasing medium heterogeneity where the corresponding parameters are listed in table 1 scenario 1 with a homogeneous k field in this scenario we investigate the effects of river system characteristics i e k b r j and nc on the hydrograph in a homogenous k field k 0 0005 m s representing the typical k for sorted sand the incoming flow at the upstream location x 0 is a continuous source and satisfies the unit hydrograph formula 4 with tp 1800 s c 3 2 and qp 1000 m 3 s scenario 2 with one set of heterogeneous k fields in this scenario the effects of heterogeneous k of the aquifer on the hydrograph are studied the river channel is divided into 200 sub domains and the random hydraulic conductivities ki i 1 2 5000 are assumed to follow the gamma or lognormal distribution we explore the tailing behavior and peak portion of the hydrograph which both vary with the change in the relative standard deviation rsd of k the mean value of k is set as 0 0005 m s and the rsd varies from 0 to 1 5 the initial and boundary conditions are the same as those used for scenario 1 scenario 3 with multiple sets of heterogeneous k fields to identify the river system characteristics controlling the tailing behavior of the hydrograph we generated 100 sets of random ki for each case which satisfies the lognormal or gamma distribution with the rsd equal to 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in simulating the hydrographs effects of the ki distribution range and the variation of k on hydrograph patterns are analyzed the mean value of k is 0 0005 m s and the initial and boundary conditions are the same as those used for scenario 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 impacts of river system characteristics on hydrograph the main results from scenario 1 are presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3a when the lateral hefs are not considered i e k 0 the peak discharge downstream x 10 km is 937 7 m 3 s and the peak arrival time is 2960 s if k 0 0005 m s the peak discharge downstream is 408 7 m 3 s 56 4 deduction and the peak arrival time is 3800 s 28 4 delay fig 3a also indicates that with an increasing k the tail of hydrographs becomes heavier hence the hydrologic exchange effect can reduce the flood peak discharge and slow down the arrival time of the flood peak the reduced discharge in river is temporarily stored in the lateral hyporheic zone then it is slowly released if the river stage is lower than that of the hyporheic zone causing the discharge tailing behavior fig 3b shows that the flow peak decreases with a decrease of b r the reason is that for a given inflow discharge upstream the narrower the channel the more the water level changes this results in a greater hydrologic exchange rate and more river water entering the riparian zone therefore for a wider river section the contribution of lateral hefs on flow discharge will be smaller according to manning s formula it is expected that the flow peak decreases with the increasing nc and increases with the increase in j meanwhile as shown in fig 3c and 3d the tailing behavior of hydrographs becomes heavier with the increase in nc and the decrease in j in addition to the fact that a reduction of j or an increase of nc itself would lead to a decrease in flow velocity flow discharge it would also lead to an increasing exchange time between the river and the riparian zone which would further reduce the peak value and enhance the hydrograph tailing according to the analysis shown above due to the hydrologic exchange process riverbanks can reduce the peak discharge thus information on the permeability of the riparian zone within catchments can be important for flood control planning and flood forecasting hefs also change the river flow field and enhance the contact between contaminants and the alluvium thus affecting the fate and transport of contaminants in the river aquifer system 4 2 impacts of aquifer heterogeneity on hydrograph many real world observations have shown that the flood hydrograph has tailing characteristics payn et al 2009 jencso et al 2010 baartman et al 2012 ward et al 2013 these tailing behaviors vary from exponential decay to power law decay with a broad variation range based on scenario 2 the effect of hydrogeological heterogeneity on the hydrograph particularly its tailing behavior is investigated here by focusing on the commonly used gamma and lognormal distributions of k kirchner et al 2000 yue et al 2001 listed in section 2 fig 4 shows that when the rsd of k increases the long term tail of the hydrograph gradually shifts from exponential decay to power law decay the reason may be that the random hydraulic conductivity of each sub domain causes the hefs to exhibit multi rate characteristics when the flood recedes due to the contribution of multi rate return flows the hydrograph declines slowly in a power law form the numerical results also show that regardless of the pdf of k i e gamma or lognormal pdf the hydrograph tailing behavior tends to decay in a power law form when the rsd of k gradually increases in general the heterogeneous k of natural soil may be distributed according to the gamma or lognormal distribution soil heterogeneity tends to act as a converter by transforming the exponential decay process into the power law decay process this may explain the power law decay phenomenon often observed in hydrologic processes in natural media the distribution of k in the riparian zone affects both the magnitude and the kinematic wave velocity of the peak flow through a river reach it is shown that when k obeys the gamma or lognormal distribution the hydrograph peak tends to increase with the increase in the rsd of k it is our expectation that the increase of rsd will make the distribution of k more uneven which will reduce the flow connectivity of the riparian zone resulting in the decrease of the entire river riparian water exchange capacity 4 3 factors controlling the hydrograph tailing behavior the results shown above lead to the following two questions first if k satisfies the gamma or lognormal distribution with a large rsd does this scenario always lead to a power law decay for the hydrograph tail second why does the gamma distribution of k differ from the lognormal one in approaching the power law tailing behavior in the hydrograph scenario 3 addresses the two questions for the first question fig 5 shows that when the rsd of k increases from 0 5 to 1 5 the long term tail of the hydrographs gradually changes from exponential decay to power law decay and the duration of the power law decay increases however the power law decay of the hydrograph does not persist especially when k follows a lognormal distribution as illustrated in fig 5 an increase of the rsd of k increases the average slope of the hydrograph s late time tail when k satisfies the gamma distribution the hydrograph is more likely to exhibit a power law decay tail with a longer duration than that with a lognormal distribution of k our explanation is the larger the rsd the wider the distribution of the k and it is more likely to have multi rate return flows these return flows have different discharge and arrival times when reaching downstream which ultimately lead to the tailing behavior of the hydrograph to answer the second question we first analyzed the influence of the change of k to the hydrograph fig 6 a shows that the smaller the k the greater the influence of the change of k on the tailing behavior of the hydrograph what is important is that k affects two aspects of hydrograph tailing behaviors 1 the larger the k the heavier the tail and 2 the larger the k the earlier the tail will appear and the shorter the duration therefore a single k value is not sufficient to cause a power law decay for the late time hydrograph fig 6b shows the sensitivity q k of the peak discharge to k when the k is smaller the flood peak value is more sensitive to the change of k in general the hydrograph pattern is increasingly insensitive to the variation of k the spatial distributions of hefs qgr were then evaluated here for different k distributions the hydrograph tailing behavior is mainly affected by the return flow qgr 0 here we selected t 9000 s as the sampling time since the flood peak had passed through the downstream section and groundwater was recharging the river qgr 0 after this time as shown in fig 7 a 7c when k followed the gamma distribution rsd 1 5 the lognormal distribution rsd 1 5 and the uniform distribution rsd 0 the resultant range of qgr m 2 s was 8 4 10 14 3 5 10 4 2 1 10 14 5 4 10 4 and 3 8 10 5 1 2 10 4 respectively therefore the return flow presented a more pronounced multi rate distribution if k had a broader distribution fig 7d shows the return flow rates in the total of l d y 200 sections in descending order the gamma distribution of k produced more low velocity return flow regions 200 169 31 sections than that of the lognormal distribution 200 187 13 sections which might be more likely to cause power law decay of the hydrograph tail notably this assumption cannot be reliably proved by fig 7 since this figure shows only one snapshot i e at a specific moment of the hefs and the hef vectors including the magnitude and direction may also change spatiotemporally and thence complicates the hydrography tailing behavior finally we analyzed the distribution range of k generated by the gamma and lognormal distributions with different rsds fig 8 compares the range of k values generated by the gamma lognormal distribution when rsd 1 5 and k 0 0005 m s table 2 lists the distribution ranges of k with different rsds fig 8 shows that in the semi logarithmic coordinate the k generated by the gamma distribution has a wider or less uniform distribution than the k generated by the lognormal distribution especially in the small value range see also table 2 this may cause the hydrological exchange process to produce multi rate return flow ultimately leading to the power law tailing behavior of the hydrograph when k of the heterogeneous aquifer follows the gamma distribution notably the gamma distribution is the combination of the power law distribution and the exponential distribution therefore when the k of the aquifer satisfies the gamma distribution and the rsd is large the hydrograph s late time tail generated by multi rate hefs may be closer to the power law decay in conclusion the hydrograph pattern is mainly controlled by the following factors 1 the distribution range of k and the proportions of different distribution ranges and 2 whether the hydrograph s peak discharge and tail portion are sensitive to k some studies kirchner and colin 2013 zhang et al 2017 have shown that geological heterogeneity that exhibits multi scaling behaviors can be responsible for the power law tailing phenomenon of hydrological processes in catchments our study suggests that the spatially heterogeneous hefs lead to multi rate return flows between the riparian zone and river enhancing the hydrograph s late time tail different hydraulic conductivity distributions within the catchment lead to different late time tailing behaviors of the hydrograph these interacting hydrodynamic processes in the catchment system act as a filter that smooths the input signal e g inflow and chemistry from the upstream location in addition to the hefs other hydrological processes such as nutrients moving in streams affected by soil heterogeneity may also exhibit a power law decay phenomenon the modeling methods and conclusions of this work can also be extended to these hydrological processes 5 preliminary application as a preliminary test the ddcm proposed above is applied here to simulate the hydrographs induced by rainfall events in the wadi ahin west oman fig 9 the hourly flow and rainfall data were obtained from the hayl flow gauge and the seven rainfall gauges in the wadi ahin west catchment aisha al qurashi et al 2008 the wadi ahin west catchment situated in the north of oman has a drainage area of 734 km2 and low vegetation cover with the channels in this catchment consisting mainly of sands and gravel see aisha al qurashi et al 2008 for detailed hydrologic conditions of the study site nine rainfall events from 1996 to 1998 where rainfall durations were short and concentrated were simulated by the ddcm for the study site these nine rainfall events were named by their dates for example event 05 september 1998 the information of these nine rainfall events is listed in table 3 and the field data and the model results of the nine hydrographs are plotted in fig 10 the width br and slope of the channels j in the model were defined based on the data in aisha al qurashi et al 2008 the hydraulic conductivity k and manining s roughness coefficient nc were then calibrated we fixed the two parameters br and j determined above set different k and nc values for simulation and then calculated the coefficient of determination of the model results based on the field data this trial and error approach led to the best fit k and nc with the largest coefficient of determination the best fit manining s coefficient was 0 035 close to that 0 036 approximated by aisha al qurashi et al 2008 the hydraulic conductivity k was first assumed to be uniform and isotropic to check whether the simplified model can capture the general pattern of the hydrograph if not then a high resolution heterogeneous k distribution would be fitted the other reason for selecting a uniform k as the first fitting exercise was because of the limited hydrologic information of this study site including for example the coarse resolution rainfall data mentioned below which increased the uncertainty for a fine resolution model with a complex k distribution we also assumed that the rainfall recharge in the riparian zones flowed mainly to the corresponding river channels r1 r6 notably this assumption was not based on field observations which were not available but for application simplification to reduce the number of unknown parameters for each rainfall event simulation the four main parameters of the ddcm k nc j and br remained unchanged and hence the model applicability was partially validated for this study site the time step size was set as δ t 100 s and space step sizes were set as δ x 2 m and δ y 50 m as shown in fig 10 the initial river discharge of the 9 simulated rainfall runoff events was close to base flow hence the initial condition was selected as base flow and the calculated discharge was then subtracted by the initial discharge considering the large basin area 734 km2 the spatial distribution of rainfall has a great influence on the observed hydrographs but the actual spatial distribution of rainfall was unknown note that the seven gauges were not enough to provide a high resolution spatial distribution of rainfall needed for the fine resolution model therefore the following two rainfall patterns were considered to simulate the hydrographs 1 rainfall fell evenly within the catchment the corresponding model is abbreviated as ddcm e and 2 rainfall fell within a 5 km radius of the rainfall center the corresponding model is abbreviated as ddcm c the model input rainfall per unit time assigned for each sub catchment ri is calculated according to the runoff coefficient and rainfall intensity and area finally based on the river network information as shown in fig 9 the hydrodynamic process of each sub channel is connected to calculate the hydrograph at the downstream outlet which is then compared with the observed hydrograph fig 10 shows the data of these nine runoff events and the results of the model simulation in the two events 05 september 1998 and 07 august 1996 the left two plots on the top row although the rainfall was short and concentrated the observed hydrograph showed a bimodal phenomenon fig 10a and 10b in this case the simulation results of ddcm e were better than that of ddcm c this may be because the rainfall events were evenly distributed in the basin and river water from different tributaries reached downstream at different times resulting in a bimodal peak during the rainfall event 11 march 1996 there were two periods of relatively strong rainfall which lead to the bimodal phenomenon fig 10c at this time the ddcm e hydrograph was closer to the observed one but the model fit was still not satisfactory implying the complex spatiotemporal distribution of this rainfall event for other rainfall events such as 11 october 1997 13 september 1997 17 july 1998 20 july 1998 and 29 october 1997 see fig 9e 9i one flood peak was detected downstream the simulation results of ddcm c were closer to the observed data than those of ddcm e this indicates that the actual rainfall distribution might be concentrated near the rainfall centers while there was little rainfall in the tributary sub catchments table 4 shows the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of the 9 rainfall events because ddcm is a physical process based model it is sensitive to input conditions rainfall distribution when the rainfall distribution is known the ddcm can describe the downstream hydrograph as shown in fig 9a the real river has several curved sections and hence the simplification of the river network to the straight channel shown in fig 9b may affect the simulation results in at least two ways first compared with straight channels water flow slows downstream in the curved ones therefore the peak arrival time in the hydrograph simulated by the ddcm may be biased second the magnitude and pattern of hefs along the curved channel are different from those along the straight channel storey et al 2003 boano et al 2006 allgeier et al 2021 morén et al 2021 especially in the upstream part of the curved channel the water pressure is high which will promote the hefs to enter the riparian zone and part of the hefs will reach the downstream through the curved riparian zone these factors will affect the hydrograph pattern and need to be systematically evaluated in a future study using a field site with a finer resolution of hydrologic data notably this preliminary application only checked the applicability of the ddcm in simplifying complex river dynamics further applications are still needed to evaluate the ddcm s full capability in quantifying the impacts of the lateral hef and the aquifer heterogeneity on the nuance of the real world hydrograph especially its peak and tail it is also noteworthy that the impact of hefs on the hydrograph cannot be neglected in flood events although the rate of hefs can be several orders of magnitude lower than the flood discharge previous studies showed that the rate of lateral hefs significantly increased during flood events liu et al 2020 and the hefs occurred throughout the river network kiel and cardenas 2014 the ddcm proposed by this study considered the influence of lateral hefs on hydrograph our numerical results revealed the buffering effect of lateral hefs on flood hydrograph where the magnitude of this buffering effect is related to the riverbank sediment hydraulic conductivity channel characteristics and flow conditions as the flood flows over a long distance the river water is continuously forced to enter riparian zones and this accumulative discharge loss needs to be considered especially when k is large calculations in fig 10 also considered the effect of lateral hefs otherwise the model results would fit worse the observed hydrographs 5 1 influence of model parameters on rainfall runoff the above mentioned simulations revealed that input conditions rainfall or upstream flood in the hefs have dissimilar impacts on the resultant hydrograph pattern when the rainfall starts the initial river flow mainly consists of the rain that falls directly on the river surface and the amount of water that enters the channel rapidly after the rainfall event the flow in the channel is recharged by hefs which have a certain influence on the river discharge and flow velocity when the upstream flood arrives hefs can reduce the flood peak value and cause hydrograph tailing behavior however due to the large flood discharge and fast flow velocity the influence of hefs on flood velocity is limited based on the river channel data in section 5 shown in fig 9 we investigated the effects of the four ddcm parameters k b r j and nc on hydrograph under rainfall condition the simulation results are shown in fig 11 where base flow was subtracted from the river discharge as shown in fig 11a the increase of k increases the rate of hefs which reduces the discharge peak and causes the hydrograph tailing behavior in contrast to the flood condition the hydrograph tail is smoother and lasts longer under the rainfall condition the reason is that the rain falls directly on the riparian zone and raises the groundwater table which can provide long term hefs fig 11b shows that an increase of br may lead to a decrease in the mean flow velocity which is different from the results shown in fig 3b in this example the effect of rainfall was to raise the river stage and the hydraulic head of groundwater according to the manning s formula u r 1 n c r 2 3 j 1 2 r b r h r b r 2 h r when h r is the same the larger the b r the faster the river flow after the rainfall groundwater began to recharge the river and the wider the river channel the smaller the river stage rise caused by the same hefs this means that a larger channel width leads to a larger river flow velocity during the rainfall period while the river flow velocity with a wider channel will decline faster after the rainfall in this example the rainfall center is 25 km away from the downstream section the simulation results showed that a larger river width led to a longer time for the flow peak to reach the downstream section as shown in fig 11c j has a great influence on the flow velocity under the rainfall condition as expected contrarily for the case of upstream flood fig 3c j has a limited influence on the flow velocity as shown in fig 11d a large n c reduces the peak discharge and increases the peak arrival time which is consistent with the results under the upstream flood condition in conclusion the influence of hefs on hydrograph is not only related to hydrogeological parameters but also to the flow and rainfall conditions it is also noteworthy that the hydrograph can be influenced by many factors in addition to the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall the soil moisture and heterogeneity and the characteristics of the channel etc because the ddcm cannot capture the nuance of these factors it is difficult for ddcm to accurately predict the hydrograph the accuracy of experimental data also affects the model results for example the water surface slope data for each tributary only has an average value limiting the ddcm s capability in modeling the nuance of discharge however the ddcm can quickly predict the overall pattern of the hydrograph with limited hydrological data which can be practically useful for the field sites at a large scale with limited hydrological information 6 conclusion this study proposed a distributed domain model ddcm by coupling the river dynamic process and the hydrologic exchange process to quantify the influence of bidirectional hydrologic exchange flows hefs on hydrograph patterns a series of numerical experiments were conducted using a synthetic river aquifer case the influence of the channel characteristics including the sediment hydraulic conductivity k the river channel width br the hydraulic gradient j and the channel roughness nc on hydrograph patterns were analyzed moreover the impact of the hydraulic conductivity distribution on the falling limb of streamflow response was investigated by explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity in k the present ddcm was then applied to characterize the observed hydrographs the major conclusions of this study are as follows first the lateral hef can have a buffering effect on flood routing and at the same time cause the tailing phenomenon of the flood process the flow rate of lateral hef is mainly controlled by k when k is large the hydrologic exchange rate increases and the flood peak is significantly reduced meanwhile a large k leads to a heavy hydrograph tailing behavior at the late time with a short duration river channel characteristics including nc j and b r have a great influence on the downstream hydrograph the downstream flood encounters a greater dissipation with an increasing nc and decreasing j and b r these findings can be important for flood control second the spatial heterogeneity in k can have a significant impact on the shape of the hydrograph in general as the rsd of k increases the late time hydrograph tends to exhibit a power law decline because the spatially heterogeneous hefs between the riparian zone and the river channel can lead to multi rate return flows the hydrograph tailing behavior is mainly controlled by the following two factors 1 the distribution range of k and the proportions of different distribution ranges and 2 the sensitivity of hydrograph pattern to the variation of k this is the major mechanism of the power law tailing behavior of hydrographs revealed by this study third the influence of hefs to the hydrograph pattern is related to the channel characteristics the riparian zone permeability flow conditions and the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall fourth the ddcm proposed by this study can simulate the flood hydrographs observed at the hayl flow gauge in the wadi ahin west oman the rainfall distribution in the basin has a great influence on the hydrograph pattern it was expected that if the rainfall distribution can be reasonably captured ddcm may characterize better the observed hydrograph pattern further applications are needed to check the applicability of the ddcm in quantifying the impacts of the lateral hef and the aquifer heterogeneity on the nuance of real world hydrographs credit authorship contribution statement song wei methodology software validation writing original draft

solving the proposed ddcm model as shown in fig 2 the ddcm model simplified the river riparian system into a coupled 1d river channel and 2d groundwater hydrodynamic process due to the symmetry of both sides of the river only the riparian zone on one side needs to be calculated here although the hyporheic exchange on both sides of the river needs to be considered when quantifying the river flow hydrodynamics the river channel is divided into n sections n l δ y and the riparian zone is divided into n m sub areas where m b δ x where δ x and δ y are the spatial step sizes in the x and y directions respectively the total time of the model simulation is denoted as t and the total time step is n t t δ t where δ t is the time interval for simplification here we use superscripts to denote time and subscripts to denote space for example z r j k represents the numerical result of the river stage z r at time k δ t and position y j δ y and h g i j k represents the numerical result of the groundwater hydraulic head h g at time k δ t and position x y i δ x j δ y the ddcm model is solved numerically using the following three steps step ⅰ based on the water level information h k z r k and h g k of the river channel and the riparian zone at the k th time step k 1 n t 1 the hydrologic exchange flux q gr k k h k h g k z r k δ x is calculated step ⅱ the water level of the river channel z r k 1 at the k 1 th time step can be obtained by solving the open channel flow model eq 2 according to the preissmann scheme lyn and goodwin 1987 using the adi method to solve the groundwater flow model eq 3 the groundwater level data h k 1 and h g k 1 at the k 1 th time step can be obtained xue and xie 2007 step iii the water level data calculated in step ⅱ i e h k 1 z r k 1 and h g k 1 are used to

iteration continues if the relative errors are less than the convergence criteria ε 1 ε 0 1 and ε 2 ε 0 2 the numerical result is considered to be stable and then move to step 1 to solve the next time

for 2d boussinesq equation the adi scheme assumes an intermediate time step t i 1 2 between t i and t i 1 the algorithm contains two steps step 1 from t i to t i 1 2 the discretization of the governing equation in the x direction adopts the implicit finite difference scheme while the discretization in the y direction adopts the explicit finite difference scheme step 2 from t i 1 2 to t i 1 the explicit and implicit finite difference schemes are used to discretize the governing equation in the x direction and y direction respectively for the discretization of equation 3 the derivative is replaced by the following difference quotient form x k h h g x i j 1 δ x k h h g x i 1 2 j k h h g x i 1 2 j o δ x 2 k h i 1 2 j h g i 1 j h g i j δ x 2 k h i 1 2 j h g i 1 j h g i j δ x 2 where k h i

calculating the catchment scale hydrograph with rainfall events using ddcm when applying the ddcm method proposed by this study to calculate the hydrograph for a catchment the sub domain discretization and related hydrologic calculations are needed to reach this goal we proposed the following two step numerical strategy and applied it for solving the catchment scale hydrography with rainfall events in the wadi ahin west catchment shown in section 5 step ⅰ catchment separation and rainfall data processing 1 based on the characteristics of the river network mainly the sub drainage delineation the catchment is divided into sub domains 2 the rainfall received by each sub catchment is then calculated according to the intensity and spatial distribution of the rainfall and the area of the sub catchment these rainfall results are then allocated to each sub domain underlying each sub catchment for example for the wadi ahin west catchment discussed in section 5 six sub domains were identified and named as r1 r6 in fig 9b each of which contains the corresponding sub catchments no 1 20 shown in fig 9a specifically sub domain r1 contains sub catchments 2 6 11 and 12 sub domain r2 contains sub catchments 7 and 18 sub domain r3 contains sub catchments 8 and 9 sub domain r4 contains sub catchments 1 and 13 16 sub domain r5 contains sub catchments 10 and 20 and sub domain r6 contains sub catchments 17 and 19 the channel and riparian zones in each sub domain were discretized according to the method described in appendix a step 2 hydrodynamic calculation of the river network for a dendritic drainage basin such as the wadi ahin west catchment the hydrodynamic process of the tributaries is calculated first and then the mainstream during this calculation flows at the upstream channels are calculated first followed by the downstream channels meanwhile the discharge and water level at river confluences should satisfy the consistency equation for the wadi ahin west catchment hydrodynamic calculations for the 6 sub domains plotted in fig 9b were not independent but following step 2 mentioned above we also assumed that these six sub domains did not exchange water at the boundary with each other since field data about the possible water exchange between these sub domains were not available we emphasize here that the example shown in section 5 was mainly to check whether the ddcm method can roughly predict the hydrograph with limited field information an updated robust model can be built if the core hydrologic data are available for the study basin
