7050,understanding changes in water quality over time and landscape and anthropogenic factors affecting them are of paramount importance to human and ecosystem health we analyzed the seasonal trends of total nitrogen total phosphorus chemical oxygen demand and total suspended solid ss in the han river basin hrb of south korea using the mann kendall test we explored the effects of anthropogenic land cover and population and natural factors topography and soil on the trends by using moran s eigenvector based spatial filtering regressions at four different spatial scales water quality of the hrb generally improved from the early 1990s to 2016 with decreasing summer nutrient and winter ss concentrations water quality trends were spatially autocorrelated with distinct spatial variations within the basin some stations close to the seoul metropolitan area however still exhibited poor water quality conditions approximately 20 70 percent of spatial variation of different water quality trends were explained by some combination of current agricultural land cover forest land cover area covered by water change in those land covers and slope variations the 100 m buffer and one kilometer upstream scale analyses generally showed higher explanatory power than the sub watershed scale analyses while the effect of seasons differed for different parameters the significant factors in each regression model typically differed among different scales but not among different seasons of the same scale the spatial filtering approach removed the residual spatial autocorrelation and thus significantly increased the explanatory power of water quality trend models keywords water quality landscape factors gis spatial filter scale han river 1 introduction various pollutants from different anthropogenic or natural sources are mobilized in the watershed by hydrological terrestrial or atmospheric processes and are delivered to the river granger et al 2010 within the river environment they go through various physical and chemical changes which determine the physical biological and chemical characteristics of the river water vannote et al 1980 the water quality of rivers exhibit high seasonal and spatial variability due to differential responses to the source mobilization and delivery mechanisms in different seasons and different parts of the watershed lintern et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 water quality in the modern era is a product of complex human natural and climatic interactions it is prone to be affected by human behavior natural hydrological or biological phenomenon as well as by spatial and temporal variability of temperature and precipitation aherne et al 2006 allan 2004 finlay et al 2013 haidary et al 2013 human intervention is the major cause of establishing a cascade of reactive nitrogen in different components of the biogeochemical cycle increasing nitrogen pollution in our atmospheric terrestrial and aquatic systems galloway et al 2003 there is a largely one way flow of the majority of the phosphorus from the geologic sources to agriculture which washes to downstream water bodies and ultimately to the ocean elser and bennett 2011 increases in human induced changes such as agricultural and urban land use are the main source of nutrients flowing to the river bu et al 2014 finlay et al 2013 shi et al 2016 the land use usually interacts with the topography of the watershed to determine the rate of nutrient accumulation in the river peterson et al 2011 earlier studies investigating the relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality utilized the entire area upstream from the monitoring stations as a predictor of water quality later researchers started to use the buffer of a certain distance from the river as predictors and reported varying results omernik et al 1981 reported no such effect of an addition of a new proximity variable in the model other studies found a greater influence of the whole watershed than a 100 m buffer in their analysis e g pratt and chang 2012 sliva and williams 2001 houlahan and findlay 2004 however identified a 4000 m buffer as a critical distance within which the percentage of land cover affects the phosphorus availability to the water of wetlands in southeastern ontario canada other studies found temporally varying relationship between water quality and landscape factors harding et al 1998 with the advent of widely available watershed geographic data many researchers have used gis derived landscape variables to analyze the spatial relationships between land cover and water quality using regression modeling bu et al 2014 chang 2008 mehaffey et al 2005 the geographically weighted regression symmetric and asymmetric eigenvector maps or moving average approach of spatial statistics are being used in the recent works to account for the spatial structure in water quality modelling blanchet et al 2008 chang and psaris 2013 detenbeck et al 2016 hoef and peterson 2010 tu 2011 the symmetrical multidirectional and asymmetrical unidirectional based on the river flow moran s eigenvector maps mems are being used in the literature in order to assess the effect of spatial processes in water quality blanchet et al 2008 the model involving unidirectional watercourse distance captured patterns that were not captured by symmetrical eigenvectors landeiro et al 2011 on the other hand vrebos et al 2017 reported that the spatial predictors with multidirectional predictors explained water quality better than those employing only the directional process in this work we use spatial filtering of eigenvectors in the regression modeling the eigenvector based spatial filtering of the variables are used to separate the spatial effects in regression modeling when any of the variables or the model residuals suffer from spatial autocorrelation getis and griffith 2002 similar to the eigenvector mapping approach it also uses eigenfunctions of spatial configuration matrices to derive the spatial eigenvectors griffith and peres neto 2006 this approach has been used to model soil attributes kim et al 2016 plant diversity kim and shin 2016 crime patterns chun 2014 and diseases jacob et al 2008 which patterns are typically spatially related to each other however this method has not been applied to understand the spatial relationships between water quality parameters and factors affecting it because water quality parameters and explanatory variables exhibit strong spatial autocorrelation chang 2008 this method is appropriate to be used in the proposed study additionally we chose this approach because the candidate eigenvector s selection methodology for the multiple regression is already established in the literature tiefelsdorf and griffith 2007 using the total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solid ss as response variables and land cover types change in land cover types topography and demographic data set as the explanatory variables we attempt to use a new spatial statistical modeling approach in understanding spatial relationships between water quality trends and landscape characteristics we seek to answer the following questions 1 what is the spatial pattern of seasonal water quality trends in monitoring stations along the tributaries of the han river where are statistically significant trends located we hypothesize that significant seasonal water quality trends are spatially clustered rather than randomly distributed over space 2 what landscape and anthropogenic factors explain the spatial variations of water quality trends we hypothesize that the change in land cover in conjunction with the catchment physical and anthropogenic conditions explain changes in water quality 3 how do different seasons and scales of analysis affect the relationships between water quality trend and landscape characteristics considering distinct seasonality in rainfall and temperature in the study basin we hypothesize that the factors affecting water quality trends are also different by season we further hypothesize that the predictor variables that are derived from finer scales can explain water quality better than the whole catchment approach 4 can the use of the eigenvector based spatial filters in such models better explain the trend of water quality we hypothesize that spatial filtering approach which removes residual spatial autocorrelation helps explain the missing predictor variables 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the han river basin hrb is the largest 23 of south korea and the most populous river basin in south korea with the home of south korea s capital seoul and its surrounding metropolitan areas population density is approximately 800 person km2 the lower hrb has been rapidly developed in the latter half of the 20th century accelerated by industrialization and urbanization such development has resulted in the degradation of water quality in the lower hrb however water quality has been somewhat improved in some sections of the river with the introduction of modern wastewater treatment technology in the late 1990s and 2000s chang 2008 according to 2010 land cover classification forest 77 is the most dominant land cover in the hrb followed by agriculture 13 and urban land cover 4 egis korea 2017 located in humid temperate climates the hrb receives approximately 1200 mm precipitation annually with 2 3 of precipitation falling during the monsoon season as a result of the strong seasonality of precipitation the variation of river discharge is large with a coefficient of variation reaching to 0 31 bae et al 2008 the hrb consists of approximately 67 percent poorly drained 15 percent well drained and 18 percent moderately drained soil http www wamis go kr the underlying geology consists of granites carbonates clastic sediments and gneisses ryu et al 2007 2 2 data sources and processing 2 2 1 water quality data we used four water quality parameters representing physical and chemical characteristics total phosphorus tp mg l total nitrogen tn mg l chemical oxygen demand cod mg l and suspended solid ss mg l monthly water quality data were obtained from the south korea ministry of environment korea ministry of environment 2016 we used data from 111 stations from the early 1990s to 2016 fig 1 these data were collected at least twice a month using a standard protocol clesceri et al 2017 and averaged for each month detail of water quality sample collection laboratory analysis and reporting procedures are available in the korean ministry of environment s water information system korea ministry of environment 2016 according to the portal an arithmetic average of the samples collected at least twice a day at more than 30 minute intervals was used as sample values chang 2005 an absorptiometric analysis was used to measure tn and tp this method involves recording intensity change as a result of dissolved tn and tp when light penetrates the water samples concentration of tn was measured by oxidizing nitrogen compounds into no2 using organic matter at 120 c to measure tp concentration phosphorus compounds were converted into po4 by oxidizing and decomposing organic matters that was eventually treated by the ascorbic acid reduction method to derive po4 concentration chang 2005 korea ministry of environment 2016 when water quality data for particular months were not available for two years in a row those data were treated as missing data in the analysis we omitted the stations when there were 10 or more missing data for a parameter of a station the monthly data were divided into four seasons december january and february winter march april and may spring june july and august summer and september october and november fall the resultant average values were subjected to mann kendall s tau analysis in order to explore any significant upward or downward trend in the seasonal water quality parameters 2 2 2 explanatory variables we used various land cover topographic and demographic variables as explanatory variables to model different seasonal water quality trends table 1 these variables were chosen as they are available for the entire study area and represent key variables affecting water quality lintern et al 2018 the 1990 and 2010 land cover data of 30 meter resolutions were used to derive the percentage of different land cover types for 2010 and the percent change of each type between 1990 and 2010 we also derived the average and standard deviation of elevation and slope from 30 meter digital elevation model the percentage of three different soil types well drained moderately drained and poorly drained are also used as potential predictor variables we used population estimates from 2015 derived from worldpop as one of the potential predictor variables gaughan et al 2013 2 3 gis analysis 2 3 1 subwatershed and buffer delineations the subwatersheds were delineated using archydro tools in such a way that they do not overlap in order to avoid spatial dependence of our explanatory variables following previous studies chang 2008 pratt and chang 2012 we derived a 100 m buffer for the rivers of the entire basin using the buffer tool of arcgis 10 4 we also used the circular buffer of a one kilometer radius from the station toward the upstream area the 100 m buffer of river reaches within the one kilometer upstream from the station was also derived using the buffer tool of arcgis fig 2 each buffer level was constrained for subwatershed level in order to extract only information within it 2 3 2 extraction of explanatory variables the average elevation average and standard deviation of the slope and total population were extracted from their respective raster files using the zonal statistics as table tool of arcgis the percentage of different land cover types was extracted using the zonal histogram tool of arcgis 10 4 1 zonal histogram 2017 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 water quality trend analysis we used seasonally averaged data of each water quality parameter and ran a mann kendall s trend analysis this analysis can be used with the seasonal water quality data in order to detect any upward downward or non significant trend it also works when the data have some missing values and do not conform to any particular distribution yu et al 1993 this method has been widely used for detecting water quality trends e g chang 2008 singh and chang 2014 masoud et al 2016 2 4 2 current water quality standards for each station we calculated the frequency of the data that exhibited poor environmental rating category v or higher according to the government of korea s standard wamis 2018 we converted those values into percentage of times a particular station exceeded the poor rating in the past five years 2012 2016 it is to be noted that the samples were collected at least once per month the values used in the analysis are as follows tn 7 mg l tp 0 3 mg l cod 9 mg l and ss 100 mg l wamis 2018 the stations showing percentage of times they exceeded the limits in the past five years were mapped using arcgis 10 5 2 4 3 correlation analysis between trends we ran a correlation analysis between each pair of the water quality trend data in order to explore whether the temporal trend among different parameters are similar to each other we used a correlation function in r software to run this analysis 2 4 4 spatial autocorrelation the temporal trend values derived as mann kendall s tau were subjected to spatial autocorrelation analysis using inverse distance weighted spatial relationships among the sampling stations and the euclidean distance method in arcgis version 10 4 1 we used moran s i to test the significance of spatial autocorrelation getis and ord 1992 to explore where the significant high and low temporal trends are located we also ran local indicator of spatial analysis lisa of the temporal trend using local moran s i analysis according to anselin 1995 2 4 5 regression analysis the stepwise multiple linear regressions smlr have been used to model trends in water quality parameters using various topographic land cover and socioeconomic variables singh and chang 2014 modeled change in different water quality parameter at three basins in oregon derived from mann kendall s test using several explanatory variables at two spatial scales several other studies used different types of regression models to elucidate landscape level effects in water quality liu et al 2016 grabowski et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 shi et al 2016 a total of 16 different regression models four parameters times four seasons were run for each scale the multicollinearity of the predictor variables was checked by deriving variation inflation factor vif and those variables having vif more than 10 were removed before regression analysis 2 4 6 residual spatial autocorrelation and spatial filtering for each regression model the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals was calculated using the euclidean distance approach the spatial autocorrelation of a response variable usually results in rsac of a regression model miralha and kim 2018 a reduction in rsac leads to robust understanding of the factors affecting water quality and also reduces errors in the models due to spatial autocorrelation according to tiefelsdorf and griffith 2007 regression models using spatial filters are designed to result in spatially uncorrelated residuals so the resultant model never suffers from rsac the rsac of the models were corrected using an eigenvector spatial filtering esf approach developed by tiefelsdorf and griffith 2007 the eigenvector spatial filtering can be expressed as in eq 1 chun et al 2016 1 y x β e k β ε ε in eq 1 y is a dependent variable x denotes a matrix of independent variables ek denotes the selected matrix of eigenvectors β is a set of regression coefficients for predictor variables β ε is a set of regression coefficients for selected eigenvectors and ε is random noise error the esf produces a set of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors by utilizing the spectral decomposition of a transformed weight matrix chun et al 2016 tiefelsdorf and griffith 2007 an ideal candidate set of spatial eigenvectors for stepwise multiple regression were chosen using an algorithm that selects the candidate eigenvectors having significant spatial component and are able to reduce residual spatial autocorrelation tiefelsdorf and griffith 2007 a custom built function spatialfiltering that implements this algorithm was used to select fitted spatial filters from eigenvectors using the spdep package in r version 3 3 bivand 2017 the fitted spatial filters were used to run spatial filtering based linear regression models sflr the coefficient of determination r2 values were compared between smlr and sflr using the paired sampled t test in order to statistically evaluate the model strength to account for the effects of seasons and scales in the model performance we used two way analysis of variance anova for two way anova we only used parameters whose r2 values were not significantly different between smlr and sflr 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns of water quality trends by parameters tn concentrations showed mixed trends with the reduction of tn over time in the northwest region especially around the seoul metropolitan area in all seasons and significant increases in tn in more remote north and south regions in all seasons fig 3 tn summer season trends were mostly negative throughout the basin implying the dilution of the summer nitrogen concentration over time the clustering pattern of high high and low low values of tn trends derived from lisa also showed a similar pattern with clustering of decreasing trends in the western part of the basin close to seoul fig 4 tn in fall and summer there was at least one station showing an increasing trend value as an outlier in that region there was an overall reduction or no significant trend of tp except for a few stations in all seasons fig 3 tp especially the northern remote mountainous region did not show any significant trend of tp however there were some stations with significantly high trend values surrounded by low trend values of tp in eastern and western regions of basin fig 4 tp cod trends showed mixed trends with approximately 20 percent of stations showing increasing trends and an approximately equal percentage showing decreasing trends over time fig 3 cod the trends were spatially distinct with lowland western regions close to seoul showing downward trends and a remote upland region exhibiting upward trends a clear separation of high high and low low clusters was evident for cod in all seasons with high being in mountainous eastern region and low in low lying western region fig 4 cod ss showed downward trends in most seasons less than five percent of stations showed increasing ss over time in all seasons fig 3 ss ss trends also exhibited a distinct spatial pattern in fall and spring as the stations showing downward trends were concentrated around the northwest region of the hrb around seoul 3 2 correlation of trends between parameters and spatial autocorrelation of trends trends of different water quality parameters were significantly p 0 01 correlated to each other table 2 cod and ss trends were most strongly correlated to each other in all seasons with the correlation coefficients higher than 0 69 while tn and tp trends were also correlated moderately in most of the seasons 0 39 r 0 52 the correlation between tp and ss trends was weak correlations of tn trends with cod and ss trends were also not strong compared to other pairs for the respective seasons most of the mann kendall s tau values showed significant spatial autocorrelation table 3 only winter and spring trends of tp did not show any significant spatial autocorrelation for most of the parameters more than 50 percent of stations did not show any significant trends as indicated by the mann kendall s tau value close to zero this might also explain why there seems to be spatial dependence among neighboring stations as revealed by spatial autocorrelation analysis the lisa analysis also showed a clear spatial separation of trends of water quality parameters with significant high clusters in the western region around seoul and significant low clusters around the eastern mountainous region fig 4 3 3 current status of water quality parameters among the temporal datasets of different months for each season different water quality parameters exceeded poor category up to 15 percent of times between 2012 and 2016 fig 5 the number of stations exceeding the limit are the highest in tn followed by cod and tp the largest number of such stations are found during winter and spring for tn but during spring for cod most of such stations are located in the seoul metropolitan area and its vicinity with a few exceptions however none of the stations in any season exceeded 100 mg l of ss concentration fig 5 3 4 regression models of different water quality parameters 3 4 1 tn the r2 values of sflr ranged from 0 18 to 0 39 among different seasons and different scales when sflrs were run most of tn trend models showed significant rsac table 4 due to the significant rsac reported in most of the models r2 value significantly increased when sflr were run table 8 when there was a significant rsac reported the sflr either changed the magnitude and direction of the coefficient of predictor variables or added new predictor variables that were not originally loaded in the smlr models table 4 the significant factors affecting temporal trends differed among different scales but not so among different seasons of the same scale when sflrs were run table 4 at the subwatershed scale tn trend variations were positively associated with slope mean and percentage change in agricultural area while it was negatively associated with the elevation percentage grassland and percentage change in grassland at the 100 m buffer scale percentage forest slope mean percentage of area classified as water and percentage change in agricultural land were positively associated with tn trends at the one km upstream scale percent water cover percent forest land and standard deviation of slope significantly explained the variation in tn trends while average slope was negatively associated with the trends the average slope and percentage change in barren land were negatively associated while percentage forest was positively associated with tn trends at the 100 m buffer within the one km upstream scale 3 4 2 tp the r2 values of sflr for tp trends also showed similar range with 0 19 0 4 among different seasons and different scales table 5 most of tp trends also showed significant rsac due to significant rsac reported in most of the models r2 values significantly increased when sflr was run table 8 the magnitude and direction of some predictor variables were changed when sflrs were run in comparison to the smlrs with significant rsac for the winter model at one km upstream scale there were not any significant variables loaded in the smlr model with only 0 19 r2 values but percentage change in barren land was significantly loaded along with other spatial eigenvectors when sflr was run table 5 the significant factors affecting tp trends over time did not differ significantly among different seasons but they differed among different scales table 4 at the subwatershed scale slope mean population density and percentage change in barren land were positively associated with tp trends while percentage wetland percentage change in wetland percentage change in forest and percentage change in agricultural land were negatively associated with tp trends at the 100 m buffer scale percentage forest percentage water and population density were positively associated with tp trends while standard deviation of elevation mean slope percentage water percentage wetland and percentage change in water are negatively associated with tp trends at the one km upstream scale population density and percentage agricultural land were positively associated with tp trends while the percentage change in barren land and percentage change in agricultural land were negatively related to tp trends at the 100 m buffer within one km upstream scale percentage water was the dominant explanatory variable along with forest cover while the percentage of well drained soil soil1 elevation and percent change in agricultural land were negatively associated with tp trends 3 4 3 cod the percentage of variability explained by the explanatory variables for cod is among the highest with r2 values ranging from 0 38 to 0 68 when sflrs were run table 6 most cod trends did not show any significant rsac there was not any significant change in r2 when sflrs were run table 8 and nearly the same set of variables in smlr were selected to explain variations in cod trends when the sflrs were run when significant rsacs were reported fall and summer at the subwatershed scale there was no predictor variable reported with sflr although there were some predictor variables reported in smlr table 6 the factors explaining cod trends in the regression models differed among different scales and seasons at the subwatershed scale fall winter and summer season trends were mostly positively associated with the percentage of agricultural cover percentage water and percentage change in water while the spring season trend was positively associated with the percentage of agricultural land and negatively associated with the percentage medium drained soil at the 100 m buffer scale most of the predictor variables were the same except grassland change percentage of forest change and percentage of agricultural land change negatively related to the trend in different seasons the factors affecting cod trends at the one kilometer upstream scale were seasonally more distinct than the buffer scale analysis the spring season trend at this scale was positively explained by standard deviation of slope only while other seasons trends were positively explained by percentage water and negatively by the percentage change in water and population density at the 100 m buffer in one km upstream scale standard deviation of slope percentage water percentage forest percentage barren land and the percentage agricultural land were positively associated with cod trends while percentage forest change percentage agricultural land change and percentage barren land change were negatively associated with the trend for fall and winter seasons the spring season trends were positively explained by standard deviation of slope and negatively by grassland cover at this scale the summer season trend was mostly the same as that of fall and winter except for percentage grass land cover and percentage change in water which were negatively associated with the summer tn trends 3 4 4 ss the sflr of ss trends in different scales and seasons ranged from 0 19 to 0 52 table 7 only two models showed significant rsac fall of subwatershed scale and one km upstream scale where r2 increased by more than two times when sflrs were run due to lack of rsacs in other models there was not any significant change of r2 between smlrs and sflrs table 8 when sflrs were run for the models with significant rsacs some new variables were loaded as significant predictors at the subwatershed level soil type one well drained was negatively associated with ss trends while the percentage of agriculture land cover the percentage of grassland cover and standard deviation of slope positively explained ss trends at 100 m buffer scale slope mean the percentage change of water cover forest grassland and agriculture land were negatively related to ss while slope standard deviation positively explained ss trends in different seasons at both scale of one kilometer upstream percentage water forest and agriculture positively explained ss trends while percentage change in those cover types negatively explained ss trends at both scales the population density was also a significant negative predictor of spring temporal trend at one km upstream scale 3 5 effect of scales and seasons the 100 m buffer scale and the winter season provided with the highest r2 values for tn trends fig 6 the winter and spring season models r2 were higher than the summer for tn trends at all scales the r2 values for tp trends had a narrow range from 0 19 to 0 4 the r2 values were not markedly different among different seasons and scales for tp trends the model strength of cod however significantly differed among different scales and different seasons the 100 m buffer and one km upstream r2 were significantly higher than other scales p 0 001 the summer season r2 value was significantly higher than fall which was significantly higher than winter and spring the combined effect of season and scale however did not show any significant effect on the model performance of cod trends the strength of ss trends was significantly different among seasons with winter r2 values being significantly lower than other seasons the scale did not have any effect on the model strength of ss trends this was also the case with the combined effect of scale and season 4 discussion 4 1 water quality trends and factors affecting them the diverse and spatially distinct trends of different water quality parameters are results of different ecological socioeconomic and policy effects in the basin the spatially distinct trends of tn tp cod and ss fig 3 in our study might have been associated with different factors affecting the source and mobilization of those elements in this heterogeneous large river basin phosphorus in the soil is mostly affected by the surface curvature and elevation in south korea which is subsequently delivered to the river by overland flow after the rainfall while nitrogen is mostly affected by vegetation coverage and enters the river in the dissolved form overland and through the groundwater pathways jeong et al 2017 phosphorus when delivered to the rivers from the soil is affected by other physical and chemical factors within the water such as ph and dissolved oxygen availability kim et al 2004 the high elevation region not showing any significant trend of tp over the study period can be attributed to the lower rate of land cover change and low population density compared to the downstream developed regions in contrast the declining trends of tp in major urban areas were associated with better treatment of wastewater and a ban on phosphorus based detergent chang 2008 similar to other findings in the uk e g civan et al 2018 the agricultural land use is the main source of phosphorous that gets delivered to the river ockenden et al 2017 powers et al 2016 which is congruent to our analysis where we found positive relations with percentage agricultural land and agricultural land cover change with tp trends especially at the subwatershed scale the spatially distinct pattern with the downward trends of tn around the seoul metropolitan area can be attributed to the recent effort of the south korean government to restore the ecological health of watersheds and rivers the installation of new wastewater treatment plants and stream restoration projects in major urban areas have both resulted in some improvements of water quality in the seoul metropolitan area hong et al 2018 additionally this spatial pattern may have resulted from different land management practices with different vegetation compositions that were associated with different nitrogen accumulation rates in the soil as the spatial pattern of soil nitrogen was mostly determined by vegetation metrics in the mountainous watersheds in south korea jeong et al 2017 the increase in forest cover during the study period may also have contributed to increasing trends in tn in some mountainous regions the change in nitrogen concentration is typically attributed to the change in agricultural land use nitrogen fertilizer usage or nitrogen release from the forest hoos and mcmahon 2009 preston and brakebill 1999 stålnacke et al 2003 our analysis also suggests that increase in agricultural land use and reduction in grassland cover is the main determinants of increase in tn concentration particularly in more remote mountainous regions where the nitrogen delivery to river via overland flow is accelerated by steep slopes lintern et al 2018 the spatially distinct pattern of cod trends is similar to that of tn trends where high mountainous regions have significant upward trends while low lying urbanized regions with declining cod trends the increase in cod concentration in north and south han river reported in lee and choi 2009 s analysis also agreed with our result where we reported the upward trend of cod in mountainous tributaries flowing down to north and south han river while the tributaries flowing down to lower main stem han river showed reduced cod over time although an increase in urban land cover increases the concentration of cod in the river water chang 2008 chen and lu 2014 liu et al 2017 the reduction in cod in more urban areas is highly associated with better watershed management practices and source protection in this region hong et al 2018 the summer wet season has shown the highest trends signifying increased water cover to the increased flushing of pollutants to the river resulting into the increased cod liu et al 2016 the wetland and vegetation interaction in those regions might have led to variable trends of cod as the increased forest cover was also associated with the reduced cod especially at the buffer scale which is similar with the findings of other studies in east asia e g liu et al 2017 this is also consistent with the ecological significance of riparian vegetation which helps reduce various pollutants entering to the river connolly et al 2015 kuglerová et al 2014 the ss concentration in the river is affected by several factors including topography slope and elevation urban land cover and wetland land cover singh and chang 2014 the declining ss trends were found in the western part of the watershed the suburban area of seoul that has undergone rapid urbanization and population growth this suggests that increase in urban impervious cover in relatively flat areas could reduce ss concentration over time factors affecting the concentration of ss are location specific and the urban land cover change might have a greater impact on water quality in less urbanized watersheds than that in the already urbanized watershed tu 2011 4 2 correlation of trends between water quality parameters the urbanized regions in and around the seoul metropolitan area however still need improvements as many of the stations had tp tn and cod concentrations higher than the acceptable limit more than once during the study period even though wastewater treatment plants have been constructed population growth may have outpaced the proper treatment of wastewater as well as increasing non point source pollutions the increased impervious surface might have caused these regions not to exceed the limit of ss similar trends of different water quality parameters can have either a similar effect of the watershed protection interventions to all the parameters or some sort of cause and effect relationship among different parameters in catchments dominated by either agricultural or urban land uses tn and tp were co produced and showed similar trends in response to the temporal change in land use jeong et al 2017 kim et al 2004 powers et al 2016 the concentration of tn and tp typically depend upon ss flowing through the water bowes and house 2001 especially in slow flowing water bodies the phosphorus becomes chemically active and desorbs from the underlying sediment when the sediment concentration in water is lower than the certain limit kim et al 2004 the amount of the tp release from sediment is therefore proportional to the sediments available in the water body the strong positive relationship between cod and ss can be explained by the increased cod during high rainfall events when the ss is higher due to surface washing e g liu et al 2016 4 3 residual spatial autocorrelation rsac and spatial filtering recent works have reported that rsac can be due to the scale or inability to account for predictor variables that might have a spatial structure or inappropriate sampling design due to a model misspecification bini et al 2009 thayn and simanis 2013 rsac when it is significant might be caused by spatial autocorrelation of the trends as most of our models show significant autocorrelation and spatially distinct high low clustering as in the case of most of the tn and tp trend models there must be some explanatory variables missing that would account for a better model and also remove rsac which is evident from a set of significant fitted spatial filters associated with the sflr models when we used the spatial filtering approach the fitted spatial filters worked as those missing variables and rsacs were not significant in resultant models derived from the spatial filtering approach we report that the characteristics of explanatory variables change when we used fitted spatial filters in the model such changes in the nature of explanatory variables are also reported by many other studies for example in a study of plant diversity kim and shin 2016 reported that an inclusion of spatial filters typically reduces the explanatory power of most of the predictor variables the regression coefficients which are estimated after spatial autocorrelation are taken into account are more acceptable than without it especially when there is significant spatial autocorrelation observed kim et al 2016 the change in behaviors of these regression coefficients however are specific to the individual models bini et al 2009 the change in direction of the regression coefficients in some of our models after the spatial filters were incorporated might be due to the availability of a new set of directional data set whose spatial structure was opposite of the model structure originally created in the model the current study is an attempt to use an empirical approach to modeling water quality trends using readily available landscape metrics and population data to test the usefulness of spatial statistical approaches a process based or conceptual lumped models are also being used frequently in order to predict current or future water quality at a watershed outlet based on the availability of the point and non point sources e g praskievicz and chang 2009 fan and shibata 2015 fonseca et al 2014 while such models could offer a better understanding of cascading changes in watershed processes e g changes in land cover or climate induced changes in flow and subsequent alterations in water quality most of them require much more data with many assumptions additionally they do not necessarily incorporate complex spatial relationships among sampling stations and the effect of associated watershed processes in their modeling process the method and results from this work can thus be used to better inform such models in order to account for non point source pollution and incorporate spatial processes 4 4 effects of seasons and scales most of the parameters we analyzed showed differences in trends and factors affecting them were different across different seasons and scales the water quality parameters in the river showed seasonal pattern due to the seasonality of temperature precipitation and seasonally varying fertilizer application rates lintern et al 2018 tn demonstrated exactly the same characteristics as winter r2 values were higher than other seasons winter is the lowest rainfall season in korean peninsula bae et al 2008 kim et al 2008 cod and ss concentrations are mostly dependent on the turbidity of water and are mainly determined by sediment concentration brought to river via overland flow path resulting in the higher modeling strength during the wet season these findings are similar to those of huang et al 2016 who found that an individual parameter s affinity to a season was also reflected in the trend model strength as tn had the strongest model prediction in dry season while cod had the strongest model prediction in the wet season a significant effect of scale in water quality modelling using land cover and topography are reported by other studies as well e g liu et al 2017 pratt and chang 2012 although model strengths are comparable among different seasons and scales the highest r2 values at the 100 m buffer scale analysis suggest that the topography and land cover of the regions adjacent to the river are more important than whole watershed for those water quality parameters a significance of the forest cover at the buffer scales but not at the subwatershed scale for most of the parameters reinforces the advantage of riparian vegetation in ameliorating non point source pollution in the river water on the other hand the effect of agricultural land cover on tp trends was observed at the subwatershed scale only signifying overall land use management for reducing non point source pollution from the entire basin 5 conclusions the water quality in the hrb improved in most of the regions with decreasing summer nutrient and winter ss concentrations in the river over the study period these trends were however variable across different locations with significant positive spatial autocorrelation with stations showing improvements clustered in mostly urban regions around the seoul metropolitan area some of these stations around seoul metropolitan area however still had poor quality during some parts of the year trends in water quality can be modeled using a set of anthropogenic and natural factors all water quality parameters trends were modeled with reasonable r2 values suggesting the chosen metrics ability for explaining the spatial variability of water quality trends most of these trends were explained by current agricultural land cover forest land cover percent area covered by water percent change in those land covers and slope variations suggesting that land management could be an effective strategy to improve water quality the model performances were generally better at the 100 m buffer and one km upstream scale models than the watershed scale models suggesting that near stream processes are more important than the whole watershed scale processes the model strengths also varied by season tn and tp trend models r2 were the highest in winter while cod trend model s r2 was highest in summer the effects of season and scale in the model performance were independent of each other as an individual effect of seasons and scales was observed in the trends of most parameters but the combined effects of seasons and scales on trends were not significant the moran s eigenvector based spatial filtering approach effectively removed the residual spatial autocorrelation significantly increased explanatory power of the models and changed the magnitude and direction of the predictor variables when there was a significant rsac reported the spatial filtering method therefore has great potential to be used in similar water quality modeling endeavors when a model suffers from spatial artefacts like rsac declarations of interest none

7050,understanding changes in water quality over time and landscape and anthropogenic factors affecting them are of paramount importance to human and ecosystem health we analyzed the seasonal trends of total nitrogen total phosphorus chemical oxygen demand and total suspended solid ss in the han river basin hrb of south korea using the mann kendall test we explored the effects of anthropogenic land cover and population and natural factors topography and soil on the trends by using moran s eigenvector based spatial filtering regressions at four different spatial scales water quality of the hrb generally improved from the early 1990s to 2016 with decreasing summer nutrient and winter ss concentrations water quality trends were spatially autocorrelated with distinct spatial variations within the basin some stations close to the seoul metropolitan area however still exhibited poor water quality conditions approximately 20 70 percent of spatial variation of different water quality trends were explained by some combination of current agricultural land cover forest land cover area covered by water change in those land covers and slope variations the 100 m buffer and one kilometer upstream scale analyses generally showed higher explanatory power than the sub watershed scale analyses while the effect of seasons differed for different parameters the significant factors in each regression model typically differed among different scales but not among different seasons of the same scale the spatial filtering approach removed the residual spatial autocorrelation and thus significantly increased the explanatory power of water quality trend models keywords water quality landscape factors gis spatial filter scale han river 1 introduction various pollutants from different anthropogenic or natural sources are mobilized in the watershed by hydrological terrestrial or atmospheric processes and are delivered to the river granger et al 2010 within the river environment they go through various physical and chemical changes which determine the physical biological and chemical characteristics of the river water vannote et al 1980 the water quality of rivers exhibit high seasonal and spatial variability due to differential responses to the source mobilization and delivery mechanisms in different seasons and different parts of the watershed lintern et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 water quality in the modern era is a product of complex human natural and climatic interactions it is prone to be affected by human behavior natural hydrological or biological phenomenon as well as by spatial and temporal variability of temperature and precipitation aherne et al 2006 allan 2004 finlay et al 2013 haidary et al 2013 human intervention is the major cause of establishing a cascade of reactive nitrogen in different components of the biogeochemical cycle increasing nitrogen pollution in our atmospheric terrestrial and aquatic systems galloway et al 2003 there is a largely one way flow of the majority of the phosphorus from the geologic sources to agriculture which washes to downstream water bodies and ultimately to the ocean elser and bennett 2011 increases in human induced changes such as agricultural and urban land use are the main source of nutrients flowing to the river bu et al 2014 finlay et al 2013 shi et al 2016 the land use usually interacts with the topography of the watershed to determine the rate of nutrient accumulation in the river peterson et al 2011 earlier studies investigating the relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality utilized the entire area upstream from the monitoring stations as a predictor of water quality later researchers started to use the buffer of a certain distance from the river as predictors and reported varying results omernik et al 1981 reported no such effect of an addition of a new proximity variable in the model other studies found a greater influence of the whole watershed than a 100 m buffer in their analysis e g pratt and chang 2012 sliva and williams 2001 houlahan and findlay 2004 however identified a 4000 m buffer as a critical distance within which the percentage of land cover affects the phosphorus availability to the water of wetlands in southeastern ontario canada other studies found temporally varying relationship between water quality and landscape factors harding et al 1998 with the advent of widely available watershed geographic data many researchers have used gis derived landscape variables to analyze the spatial relationships between land cover and water quality using regression modeling bu et al 2014 chang 2008 mehaffey et al 2005 the geographically weighted regression symmetric and asymmetric eigenvector maps or moving average approach of spatial statistics are being used in the recent works to account for the spatial structure in water quality modelling blanchet et al 2008 chang and psaris 2013 detenbeck et al 2016 hoef and peterson 2010 tu 2011 the symmetrical multidirectional and asymmetrical unidirectional based on the river flow moran s eigenvector maps mems are being used in the literature in order to assess the effect of spatial processes in water quality blanchet et al 2008 the model involving unidirectional watercourse distance captured patterns that were not captured by symmetrical eigenvectors landeiro et al 2011 on the other hand vrebos et al 2017 reported that the spatial predictors with multidirectional predictors explained water quality better than those employing only the directional process in this work we use spatial filtering of eigenvectors in the regression modeling the eigenvector based spatial filtering of the variables are used to separate the spatial effects in regression modeling when any of the variables or the model residuals suffer from spatial autocorrelation getis and griffith 2002 similar to the eigenvector mapping approach it also uses eigenfunctions of spatial configuration matrices to derive the spatial eigenvectors griffith and peres neto 2006 this approach has been used to model soil attributes kim et al 2016 plant diversity kim and shin 2016 crime patterns chun 2014 and diseases jacob et al 2008 which patterns are typically spatially related to each other however this method has not been applied to understand the spatial relationships between water quality parameters and factors affecting it because water quality parameters and explanatory variables exhibit strong spatial autocorrelation chang 2008 this method is appropriate to be used in the proposed study additionally we chose this approach because the candidate eigenvector s selection methodology for the multiple regression is already established in the literature tiefelsdorf and griffith 2007 using the total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solid ss as response variables and land cover types change in land cover types topography and demographic data set as the explanatory variables we attempt to use a new spatial statistical modeling approach in understanding spatial relationships between water quality trends and landscape characteristics we seek to answer the following questions 1 what is the spatial pattern of seasonal water quality trends in monitoring stations along the tributaries of the han river where are statistically significant trends located we hypothesize that significant seasonal water quality trends are spatially clustered rather than randomly distributed over space 2 what landscape and anthropogenic factors explain the spatial variations of water quality trends we hypothesize that the change in land cover in conjunction with the catchment physical and anthropogenic conditions explain changes in water quality 3 how do different seasons and scales of analysis affect the relationships between water quality trend and landscape characteristics considering distinct seasonality in rainfall and temperature in the study basin we hypothesize that the factors affecting water quality trends are also different by season we further hypothesize that the predictor variables that are derived from finer scales can explain water quality better than the whole catchment approach 4 can the use of the eigenvector based spatial filters in such models better explain the trend of water quality we hypothesize that spatial filtering approach which removes residual spatial autocorrelation helps explain the missing predictor variables 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the han river basin hrb is the largest 23 of south korea and the most populous river basin in south korea with the home of south korea s capital seoul and its surrounding metropolitan areas population density is approximately 800 person km2 the lower hrb has been rapidly developed in the latter half of the 20th century accelerated by industrialization and urbanization such development has resulted in the degradation of water quality in the lower hrb however water quality has been somewhat improved in some sections of the river with the introduction of modern wastewater treatment technology in the late 1990s and 2000s chang 2008 according to 2010 land cover classification forest 77 is the most dominant land cover in the hrb followed by agriculture 13 and urban land cover 4 egis korea 2017 located in humid temperate climates the hrb receives approximately 1200 mm precipitation annually with 2 3 of precipitation falling during the monsoon season as a result of the strong seasonality of precipitation the variation of river discharge is large with a coefficient of variation reaching to 0 31 bae et al 2008 the hrb consists of approximately 67 percent poorly drained 15 percent well drained and 18 percent moderately drained soil http www wamis go kr the underlying geology consists of granites carbonates clastic sediments and gneisses ryu et al 2007 2 2 data sources and processing 2 2 1 water quality data we used four water quality parameters representing physical and chemical characteristics total phosphorus tp mg l total nitrogen tn mg l chemical oxygen demand cod mg l and suspended solid ss mg l monthly water quality data were obtained from the south korea ministry of environment korea ministry of environment 2016 we used data from 111 stations from the early 1990s to 2016 fig 1 these data were collected at least twice a month using a standard protocol clesceri et al 2017 and averaged for each month detail of water quality sample collection laboratory analysis and reporting procedures are available in the korean ministry of environment s water information system korea ministry of environment 2016 according to the portal an arithmetic average of the samples collected at least twice a day at more than 30 minute intervals was used as sample values chang 2005 an absorptiometric analysis was used to measure tn and tp this method involves recording intensity change as a result of dissolved tn and tp when light penetrates the water samples concentration of tn was measured by oxidizing nitrogen compounds into no2 using organic matter at 120 c to measure tp concentration phosphorus compounds were converted into po4 by oxidizing and decomposing organic matters that was eventually treated by the ascorbic acid reduction method to derive po4 concentration chang 2005 korea ministry of environment 2016 when water quality data for particular months were not available for two years in a row those data were treated as missing data in the analysis we omitted the stations when there were 10 or more missing data for a parameter of a station the monthly data were divided into four seasons december january and february winter march april and may spring june july and august summer and september october and november fall the resultant average values were subjected to mann kendall s tau analysis in order to explore any significant upward or downward trend in the seasonal water quality parameters 2 2 2 explanatory variables we used various land cover topographic and demographic variables as explanatory variables to model different seasonal water quality trends table 1 these variables were chosen as they are available for the entire study area and represent key variables affecting water quality lintern et al 2018 the 1990 and 2010 land cover data of 30 meter resolutions were used to derive the percentage of different land cover types for 2010 and the percent change of each type between 1990 and 2010 we also derived the average and standard deviation of elevation and slope from 30 meter digital elevation model the percentage of three different soil types well drained moderately drained and poorly drained are also used as potential predictor variables we used population estimates from 2015 derived from worldpop as one of the potential predictor variables gaughan et al 2013 2 3 gis analysis 2 3 1 subwatershed and buffer delineations the subwatersheds were delineated using archydro tools in such a way that they do not overlap in order to avoid spatial dependence of our explanatory variables following previous studies chang 2008 pratt and chang 2012 we derived a 100 m buffer for the rivers of the entire basin using the buffer tool of arcgis 10 4 we also used the circular buffer of a one kilometer radius from the station toward the upstream area the 100 m buffer of river reaches within the one kilometer upstream from the station was also derived using the buffer tool of arcgis fig 2 each buffer level was constrained for subwatershed level in order to extract only information within it 2 3 2 extraction of explanatory variables the average elevation average and standard deviation of the slope and total population were extracted from their respective raster files using the zonal statistics as table tool of arcgis the percentage of different land cover types was extracted using the zonal histogram tool of arcgis 10 4 1 zonal histogram 2017 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 water quality trend analysis we used seasonally averaged data of each water quality parameter and ran a mann kendall s trend analysis this analysis can be used with the seasonal water quality data in order to detect any upward downward or non significant trend it also works when the data have some missing values and do not conform to any particular distribution yu et al 1993 this method has been widely used for detecting water quality trends e g chang 2008 singh and chang 2014 masoud et al 2016 2 4 2 current water quality standards for each station we calculated the frequency of the data that exhibited poor environmental rating category v or higher according to the government of korea s standard wamis 2018 we converted those values into percentage of times a particular station exceeded the poor rating in the past five years 2012 2016 it is to be noted that the samples were collected at least once per month the values used in the analysis are as follows tn 7 mg l tp 0 3 mg l cod 9 mg l and ss 100 mg l wamis 2018 the stations showing percentage of times they exceeded the limits in the past five years were mapped using arcgis 10 5 2 4 3 correlation analysis between trends we ran a correlation analysis between each pair of the water quality trend data in order to explore whether the temporal trend among different parameters are similar to each other we used a correlation function in r software to run this analysis 2 4 4 spatial autocorrelation the temporal trend values derived as mann kendall s tau were subjected to spatial autocorrelation analysis using inverse distance weighted spatial relationships among the sampling stations and the euclidean distance method in arcgis version 10 4 1 we used moran s i to test the significance of spatial autocorrelation getis and ord 1992 to explore where the significant high and low temporal trends are located we also ran local indicator of spatial analysis lisa of the temporal trend using local moran s i analysis according to anselin 1995 2 4 5 regression analysis the stepwise multiple linear regressions smlr have been used to model trends in water quality parameters using various topographic land cover and socioeconomic variables singh and chang 2014 modeled change in different water quality parameter at three basins in oregon derived from mann kendall s test using several explanatory variables at two spatial scales several other studies used different types of regression models to elucidate landscape level effects in water quality liu et al 2016 grabowski et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 shi et al 2016 a total of 16 different regression models four parameters times four seasons were run for each scale the multicollinearity of the predictor variables was checked by deriving variation inflation factor vif and those variables having vif more than 10 were removed before regression analysis 2 4 6 residual spatial autocorrelation and spatial filtering for each regression model the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals was calculated using the euclidean distance approach the spatial autocorrelation of a response variable usually results in rsac of a regression model miralha and kim 2018 a reduction in rsac leads to robust understanding of the factors affecting water quality and also reduces errors in the models due to spatial autocorrelation according to tiefelsdorf and griffith 2007 regression models using spatial filters are designed to result in spatially uncorrelated residuals so the resultant model never suffers from rsac the rsac of the models were corrected using an eigenvector spatial filtering esf approach developed by tiefelsdorf and griffith 2007 the eigenvector spatial filtering can be expressed as in eq 1 chun et al 2016 1 y x β e k β ε ε in eq 1 y is a dependent variable x denotes a matrix of independent variables ek denotes the selected matrix of eigenvectors β is a set of regression coefficients for predictor variables β ε is a set of regression coefficients for selected eigenvectors and ε is random noise error the esf produces a set of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors by utilizing the spectral decomposition of a transformed weight matrix chun et al 2016 tiefelsdorf and griffith 2007 an ideal candidate set of spatial eigenvectors for stepwise multiple regression were chosen using an algorithm that selects the candidate eigenvectors having significant spatial component and are able to reduce residual spatial autocorrelation tiefelsdorf and griffith 2007 a custom built function spatialfiltering that implements this algorithm was used to select fitted spatial filters from eigenvectors using the spdep package in r version 3 3 bivand 2017 the fitted spatial filters were used to run spatial filtering based linear regression models sflr the coefficient of determination r2 values were compared between smlr and sflr using the paired sampled t test in order to statistically evaluate the model strength to account for the effects of seasons and scales in the model performance we used two way analysis of variance anova for two way anova we only used parameters whose r2 values were not significantly different between smlr and sflr 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns of water quality trends by parameters tn concentrations showed mixed trends with the reduction of tn over time in the northwest region especially around the seoul metropolitan area in all seasons and significant increases in tn in more remote north and south regions in all seasons fig 3 tn summer season trends were mostly negative throughout the basin implying the dilution of the summer nitrogen concentration over time the clustering pattern of high high and low low values of tn trends derived from lisa also showed a similar pattern with clustering of decreasing trends in the western part of the basin close to seoul fig 4 tn in fall and summer there was at least one station showing an increasing trend value as an outlier in that region there was an overall reduction or no significant trend of tp except for a few stations in all seasons fig 3 tp especially the northern remote mountainous region did not show any significant trend of tp however there were some stations with significantly high trend values surrounded by low trend values of tp in eastern and western regions of basin fig 4 tp cod trends showed mixed trends with approximately 20 percent of stations showing increasing trends and an approximately equal percentage showing decreasing trends over time fig 3 cod the trends were spatially distinct with lowland western regions close to seoul showing downward trends and a remote upland region exhibiting upward trends a clear separation of high high and low low clusters was evident for cod in all seasons with high being in mountainous eastern region and low in low lying western region fig 4 cod ss showed downward trends in most seasons less than five percent of stations showed increasing ss over time in all seasons fig 3 ss ss trends also exhibited a distinct spatial pattern in fall and spring as the stations showing downward trends were concentrated around the northwest region of the hrb around seoul 3 2 correlation of trends between parameters and spatial autocorrelation of trends trends of different water quality parameters were significantly p 0 01 correlated to each other table 2 cod and ss trends were most strongly correlated to each other in all seasons with the correlation coefficients higher than 0 69 while tn and tp trends were also correlated moderately in most of the seasons 0 39 r 0 52 the correlation between tp and ss trends was weak correlations of tn trends with cod and ss trends were also not strong compared to other pairs for the respective seasons most of the mann kendall s tau values showed significant spatial autocorrelation table 3 only winter and spring trends of tp did not show any significant spatial autocorrelation for most of the parameters more than 50 percent of stations did not show any significant trends as indicated by the mann kendall s tau value close to zero this might also explain why there seems to be spatial dependence among neighboring stations as revealed by spatial autocorrelation analysis the lisa analysis also showed a clear spatial separation of trends of water quality parameters with significant high clusters in the western region around seoul and significant low clusters around the eastern mountainous region fig 4 3 3 current status of water quality parameters among the temporal datasets of different months for each season different water quality parameters exceeded poor category up to 15 percent of times between 2012 and 2016 fig 5 the number of stations exceeding the limit are the highest in tn followed by cod and tp the largest number of such stations are found during winter and spring for tn but during spring for cod most of such stations are located in the seoul metropolitan area and its vicinity with a few exceptions however none of the stations in any season exceeded 100 mg l of ss concentration fig 5 3 4 regression models of different water quality parameters 3 4 1 tn the r2 values of sflr ranged from 0 18 to 0 39 among different seasons and different scales when sflrs were run most of tn trend models showed significant rsac table 4 due to the significant rsac reported in most of the models r2 value significantly increased when sflr were run table 8 when there was a significant rsac reported the sflr either changed the magnitude and direction of the coefficient of predictor variables or added new predictor variables that were not originally loaded in the smlr models table 4 the significant factors affecting temporal trends differed among different scales but not so among different seasons of the same scale when sflrs were run table 4 at the subwatershed scale tn trend variations were positively associated with slope mean and percentage change in agricultural area while it was negatively associated with the elevation percentage grassland and percentage change in grassland at the 100 m buffer scale percentage forest slope mean percentage of area classified as water and percentage change in agricultural land were positively associated with tn trends at the one km upstream scale percent water cover percent forest land and standard deviation of slope significantly explained the variation in tn trends while average slope was negatively associated with the trends the average slope and percentage change in barren land were negatively associated while percentage forest was positively associated with tn trends at the 100 m buffer within the one km upstream scale 3 4 2 tp the r2 values of sflr for tp trends also showed similar range with 0 19 0 4 among different seasons and different scales table 5 most of tp trends also showed significant rsac due to significant rsac reported in most of the models r2 values significantly increased when sflr was run table 8 the magnitude and direction of some predictor variables were changed when sflrs were run in comparison to the smlrs with significant rsac for the winter model at one km upstream scale there were not any significant variables loaded in the smlr model with only 0 19 r2 values but percentage change in barren land was significantly loaded along with other spatial eigenvectors when sflr was run table 5 the significant factors affecting tp trends over time did not differ significantly among different seasons but they differed among different scales table 4 at the subwatershed scale slope mean population density and percentage change in barren land were positively associated with tp trends while percentage wetland percentage change in wetland percentage change in forest and percentage change in agricultural land were negatively associated with tp trends at the 100 m buffer scale percentage forest percentage water and population density were positively associated with tp trends while standard deviation of elevation mean slope percentage water percentage wetland and percentage change in water are negatively associated with tp trends at the one km upstream scale population density and percentage agricultural land were positively associated with tp trends while the percentage change in barren land and percentage change in agricultural land were negatively related to tp trends at the 100 m buffer within one km upstream scale percentage water was the dominant explanatory variable along with forest cover while the percentage of well drained soil soil1 elevation and percent change in agricultural land were negatively associated with tp trends 3 4 3 cod the percentage of variability explained by the explanatory variables for cod is among the highest with r2 values ranging from 0 38 to 0 68 when sflrs were run table 6 most cod trends did not show any significant rsac there was not any significant change in r2 when sflrs were run table 8 and nearly the same set of variables in smlr were selected to explain variations in cod trends when the sflrs were run when significant rsacs were reported fall and summer at the subwatershed scale there was no predictor variable reported with sflr although there were some predictor variables reported in smlr table 6 the factors explaining cod trends in the regression models differed among different scales and seasons at the subwatershed scale fall winter and summer season trends were mostly positively associated with the percentage of agricultural cover percentage water and percentage change in water while the spring season trend was positively associated with the percentage of agricultural land and negatively associated with the percentage medium drained soil at the 100 m buffer scale most of the predictor variables were the same except grassland change percentage of forest change and percentage of agricultural land change negatively related to the trend in different seasons the factors affecting cod trends at the one kilometer upstream scale were seasonally more distinct than the buffer scale analysis the spring season trend at this scale was positively explained by standard deviation of slope only while other seasons trends were positively explained by percentage water and negatively by the percentage change in water and population density at the 100 m buffer in one km upstream scale standard deviation of slope percentage water percentage forest percentage barren land and the percentage agricultural land were positively associated with cod trends while percentage forest change percentage agricultural land change and percentage barren land change were negatively associated with the trend for fall and winter seasons the spring season trends were positively explained by standard deviation of slope and negatively by grassland cover at this scale the summer season trend was mostly the same as that of fall and winter except for percentage grass land cover and percentage change in water which were negatively associated with the summer tn trends 3 4 4 ss the sflr of ss trends in different scales and seasons ranged from 0 19 to 0 52 table 7 only two models showed significant rsac fall of subwatershed scale and one km upstream scale where r2 increased by more than two times when sflrs were run due to lack of rsacs in other models there was not any significant change of r2 between smlrs and sflrs table 8 when sflrs were run for the models with significant rsacs some new variables were loaded as significant predictors at the subwatershed level soil type one well drained was negatively associated with ss trends while the percentage of agriculture land cover the percentage of grassland cover and standard deviation of slope positively explained ss trends at 100 m buffer scale slope mean the percentage change of water cover forest grassland and agriculture land were negatively related to ss while slope standard deviation positively explained ss trends in different seasons at both scale of one kilometer upstream percentage water forest and agriculture positively explained ss trends while percentage change in those cover types negatively explained ss trends at both scales the population density was also a significant negative predictor of spring temporal trend at one km upstream scale 3 5 effect of scales and seasons the 100 m buffer scale and the winter season provided with the highest r2 values for tn trends fig 6 the winter and spring season models r2 were higher than the summer for tn trends at all scales the r2 values for tp trends had a narrow range from 0 19 to 0 4 the r2 values were not markedly different among different seasons and scales for tp trends the model strength of cod however significantly differed among different scales and different seasons the 100 m buffer and one km upstream r2 were significantly higher than other scales p 0 001 the summer season r2 value was significantly higher than fall which was significantly higher than winter and spring the combined effect of season and scale however did not show any significant effect on the model performance of cod trends the strength of ss trends was significantly different among seasons with winter r2 values being significantly lower than other seasons the scale did not have any effect on the model strength of ss trends this was also the case with the combined effect of scale and season 4 discussion 4 1 water quality trends and factors affecting them the diverse and spatially distinct trends of different water quality parameters are results of different ecological socioeconomic and policy effects in the basin the spatially distinct trends of tn tp cod and ss fig 3 in our study might have been associated with different factors affecting the source and mobilization of those elements in this heterogeneous large river basin phosphorus in the soil is mostly affected by the surface curvature and elevation in south korea which is subsequently delivered to the river by overland flow after the rainfall while nitrogen is mostly affected by vegetation coverage and enters the river in the dissolved form overland and through the groundwater pathways jeong et al 2017 phosphorus when delivered to the rivers from the soil is affected by other physical and chemical factors within the water such as ph and dissolved oxygen availability kim et al 2004 the high elevation region not showing any significant trend of tp over the study period can be attributed to the lower rate of land cover change and low population density compared to the downstream developed regions in contrast the declining trends of tp in major urban areas were associated with better treatment of wastewater and a ban on phosphorus based detergent chang 2008 similar to other findings in the uk e g civan et al 2018 the agricultural land use is the main source of phosphorous that gets delivered to the river ockenden et al 2017 powers et al 2016 which is congruent to our analysis where we found positive relations with percentage agricultural land and agricultural land cover change with tp trends especially at the subwatershed scale the spatially distinct pattern with the downward trends of tn around the seoul metropolitan area can be attributed to the recent effort of the south korean government to restore the ecological health of watersheds and rivers the installation of new wastewater treatment plants and stream restoration projects in major urban areas have both resulted in some improvements of water quality in the seoul metropolitan area hong et al 2018 additionally this spatial pattern may have resulted from different land management practices with different vegetation compositions that were associated with different nitrogen accumulation rates in the soil as the spatial pattern of soil nitrogen was mostly determined by vegetation metrics in the mountainous watersheds in south korea jeong et al 2017 the increase in forest cover during the study period may also have contributed to increasing trends in tn in some mountainous regions the change in nitrogen concentration is typically attributed to the change in agricultural land use nitrogen fertilizer usage or nitrogen release from the forest hoos and mcmahon 2009 preston and brakebill 1999 stålnacke et al 2003 our analysis also suggests that increase in agricultural land use and reduction in grassland cover is the main determinants of increase in tn concentration particularly in more remote mountainous regions where the nitrogen delivery to river via overland flow is accelerated by steep slopes lintern et al 2018 the spatially distinct pattern of cod trends is similar to that of tn trends where high mountainous regions have significant upward trends while low lying urbanized regions with declining cod trends the increase in cod concentration in north and south han river reported in lee and choi 2009 s analysis also agreed with our result where we reported the upward trend of cod in mountainous tributaries flowing down to north and south han river while the tributaries flowing down to lower main stem han river showed reduced cod over time although an increase in urban land cover increases the concentration of cod in the river water chang 2008 chen and lu 2014 liu et al 2017 the reduction in cod in more urban areas is highly associated with better watershed management practices and source protection in this region hong et al 2018 the summer wet season has shown the highest trends signifying increased water cover to the increased flushing of pollutants to the river resulting into the increased cod liu et al 2016 the wetland and vegetation interaction in those regions might have led to variable trends of cod as the increased forest cover was also associated with the reduced cod especially at the buffer scale which is similar with the findings of other studies in east asia e g liu et al 2017 this is also consistent with the ecological significance of riparian vegetation which helps reduce various pollutants entering to the river connolly et al 2015 kuglerová et al 2014 the ss concentration in the river is affected by several factors including topography slope and elevation urban land cover and wetland land cover singh and chang 2014 the declining ss trends were found in the western part of the watershed the suburban area of seoul that has undergone rapid urbanization and population growth this suggests that increase in urban impervious cover in relatively flat areas could reduce ss concentration over time factors affecting the concentration of ss are location specific and the urban land cover change might have a greater impact on water quality in less urbanized watersheds than that in the already urbanized watershed tu 2011 4 2 correlation of trends between water quality parameters the urbanized regions in and around the seoul metropolitan area however still need improvements as many of the stations had tp tn and cod concentrations higher than the acceptable limit more than once during the study period even though wastewater treatment plants have been constructed population growth may have outpaced the proper treatment of wastewater as well as increasing non point source pollutions the increased impervious surface might have caused these regions not to exceed the limit of ss similar trends of different water quality parameters can have either a similar effect of the watershed protection interventions to all the parameters or some sort of cause and effect relationship among different parameters in catchments dominated by either agricultural or urban land uses tn and tp were co produced and showed similar trends in response to the temporal change in land use jeong et al 2017 kim et al 2004 powers et al 2016 the concentration of tn and tp typically depend upon ss flowing through the water bowes and house 2001 especially in slow flowing water bodies the phosphorus becomes chemically active and desorbs from the underlying sediment when the sediment concentration in water is lower than the certain limit kim et al 2004 the amount of the tp release from sediment is therefore proportional to the sediments available in the water body the strong positive relationship between cod and ss can be explained by the increased cod during high rainfall events when the ss is higher due to surface washing e g liu et al 2016 4 3 residual spatial autocorrelation rsac and spatial filtering recent works have reported that rsac can be due to the scale or inability to account for predictor variables that might have a spatial structure or inappropriate sampling design due to a model misspecification bini et al 2009 thayn and simanis 2013 rsac when it is significant might be caused by spatial autocorrelation of the trends as most of our models show significant autocorrelation and spatially distinct high low clustering as in the case of most of the tn and tp trend models there must be some explanatory variables missing that would account for a better model and also remove rsac which is evident from a set of significant fitted spatial filters associated with the sflr models when we used the spatial filtering approach the fitted spatial filters worked as those missing variables and rsacs were not significant in resultant models derived from the spatial filtering approach we report that the characteristics of explanatory variables change when we used fitted spatial filters in the model such changes in the nature of explanatory variables are also reported by many other studies for example in a study of plant diversity kim and shin 2016 reported that an inclusion of spatial filters typically reduces the explanatory power of most of the predictor variables the regression coefficients which are estimated after spatial autocorrelation are taken into account are more acceptable than without it especially when there is significant spatial autocorrelation observed kim et al 2016 the change in behaviors of these regression coefficients however are specific to the individual models bini et al 2009 the change in direction of the regression coefficients in some of our models after the spatial filters were incorporated might be due to the availability of a new set of directional data set whose spatial structure was opposite of the model structure originally created in the model the current study is an attempt to use an empirical approach to modeling water quality trends using readily available landscape metrics and population data to test the usefulness of spatial statistical approaches a process based or conceptual lumped models are also being used frequently in order to predict current or future water quality at a watershed outlet based on the availability of the point and non point sources e g praskievicz and chang 2009 fan and shibata 2015 fonseca et al 2014 while such models could offer a better understanding of cascading changes in watershed processes e g changes in land cover or climate induced changes in flow and subsequent alterations in water quality most of them require much more data with many assumptions additionally they do not necessarily incorporate complex spatial relationships among sampling stations and the effect of associated watershed processes in their modeling process the method and results from this work can thus be used to better inform such models in order to account for non point source pollution and incorporate spatial processes 4 4 effects of seasons and scales most of the parameters we analyzed showed differences in trends and factors affecting them were different across different seasons and scales the water quality parameters in the river showed seasonal pattern due to the seasonality of temperature precipitation and seasonally varying fertilizer application rates lintern et al 2018 tn demonstrated exactly the same characteristics as winter r2 values were higher than other seasons winter is the lowest rainfall season in korean peninsula bae et al 2008 kim et al 2008 cod and ss concentrations are mostly dependent on the turbidity of water and are mainly determined by sediment concentration brought to river via overland flow path resulting in the higher modeling strength during the wet season these findings are similar to those of huang et al 2016 who found that an individual parameter s affinity to a season was also reflected in the trend model strength as tn had the strongest model prediction in dry season while cod had the strongest model prediction in the wet season a significant effect of scale in water quality modelling using land cover and topography are reported by other studies as well e g liu et al 2017 pratt and chang 2012 although model strengths are comparable among different seasons and scales the highest r2 values at the 100 m buffer scale analysis suggest that the topography and land cover of the regions adjacent to the river are more important than whole watershed for those water quality parameters a significance of the forest cover at the buffer scales but not at the subwatershed scale for most of the parameters reinforces the advantage of riparian vegetation in ameliorating non point source pollution in the river water on the other hand the effect of agricultural land cover on tp trends was observed at the subwatershed scale only signifying overall land use management for reducing non point source pollution from the entire basin 5 conclusions the water quality in the hrb improved in most of the regions with decreasing summer nutrient and winter ss concentrations in the river over the study period these trends were however variable across different locations with significant positive spatial autocorrelation with stations showing improvements clustered in mostly urban regions around the seoul metropolitan area some of these stations around seoul metropolitan area however still had poor quality during some parts of the year trends in water quality can be modeled using a set of anthropogenic and natural factors all water quality parameters trends were modeled with reasonable r2 values suggesting the chosen metrics ability for explaining the spatial variability of water quality trends most of these trends were explained by current agricultural land cover forest land cover percent area covered by water percent change in those land covers and slope variations suggesting that land management could be an effective strategy to improve water quality the model performances were generally better at the 100 m buffer and one km upstream scale models than the watershed scale models suggesting that near stream processes are more important than the whole watershed scale processes the model strengths also varied by season tn and tp trend models r2 were the highest in winter while cod trend model s r2 was highest in summer the effects of season and scale in the model performance were independent of each other as an individual effect of seasons and scales was observed in the trends of most parameters but the combined effects of seasons and scales on trends were not significant the moran s eigenvector based spatial filtering approach effectively removed the residual spatial autocorrelation significantly increased explanatory power of the models and changed the magnitude and direction of the predictor variables when there was a significant rsac reported the spatial filtering method therefore has great potential to be used in similar water quality modeling endeavors when a model suffers from spatial artefacts like rsac declarations of interest none

7051,rainfall event simulation can be very useful in many hydrological and hydraulic practices such as dam design the aim of this study is to propose a new single site stochastic model for generating daily rainfall events the model has two components copula based joint simulation of rainfall characteristics and rainfall temporal pattern simulation compared with prevailing stochastic rainfall models this new model can not only preserve the dependence relationship between rainfall duration and rainfall depth by using copula functions but also take different temporal rainfall patterns that can cause various hydrological responses of watersheds into consideration additionally the internal clustering validation index is introduced in this study to objectively determine the number of representative rainfall patterns in this model lastly a framework is designed to apply the developed stochastic model to 39 gauged meteorological stations in zhejiang province east china and to extend its application to one ungauged site for validation the final validation results were sound and indicated that the developed stochastic model is robust and can be applied at both gauged stations and ungauged sites for generating long rainfall records keywords rainfall pattern rainfall characteristics copula internal cluster validation indices gauged stations ungauged sites 1 introduction many problems in hydrology agricultural science and engineering require extensive records of rainfall mehrotra et al 2015 especially for flood risk assessment water resource management or hydraulic structure design vandenberghe et al 2011 in reality however observational records are often short or lacking so that stochastic rainfall models have become more established to augment the rainfall time series or generate synthetic rainfall records where none are available numerous stochastic rainfall models have been proposed throughout the years including various single site models e g mhanna and bauwens 2012 katz 1977 sharma and lall 1999 zheng and katz 2008a and multi site models e g zheng and katz 2008b chen et al 2018 wilks 1998 mehrotra and sharma 2007b multi site rainfall models incorporate spatial dependence across multiple point sites based on single site models from the adopted simulation methods these rainfall models are based on non parametric e g leander and buishand 2009 sharma and lall 1999 basinger et al 2010 semi parametric e g mehrotra and sharma 2007b aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 or parametric techniques e g liu et al 2011 van montfort and witter 1986 and they differ in complexity the advantages of non parametric methods such as nearest neighbor algorithm and kernel density estimation approach are that they are simple and can reproduce observations very well but they lack extrapolation ability and do not provide unobserved extremes the parametric methods have extrapolation capability and thus become more popular in the application of climate impact studies for existing stochastic rainfall models most models are usually based on markov chains e g haan et al 1976 mehrotra et al 2006 mehrotra and sharma 2007b to simulate the occurrence of wet and dry days in the rainfall process and then rainfall amount on a wet day moreover a number of alternative types of models that focus on the event based nature of the rainfall process have also been developed including profile based e g wu et al 2015 huff 1967 and pulse based models with representative bartlett lewis models e g onof and wheater 1993 ritschel et al 2017 and neyman scott models e g rodríguez iturbe et al 1987 cowpertwait 1991 since event based rainfall models are able to simulate continuous temporal rainfall which often leads to extreme rainfall events and causes catastrophic loss they have received considerable attentions in recent years and are utilized to analyze design storms for water resources management and other engineering design applications based on the above stochastic rainfall models the study in this paper is emphasized on profile based rainfall events using parametric methods at a set of sites independently on a daily time scale a stochastic profile based model should preserve the statistical characteristics of rainfall events including total rainfall depth rainfall duration inter event time and intra event temporal structure rainfall hyetographs or rainfall profiles heneker et al 2001 huff 1967 terranova and iaquinta 2011 failure to address each of these characteristics can lead to poor outcomes for water or agricultural management regarding the simulation of rainfall characteristics much work has been done including those that separately simulate the average intensity depth and duration of rainfall events by assuming their independence from each other eagleson 1972 rodríguez iturbe 1986 and those that construct joint distribution of rainfall characteristics by assuming the same type of the marginal probability distribution such as multivariate gaussian distribution exponential distribution or gamma distribution bacchi et al 1994 clarke 1980 the above hypothesis of rainfall characteristics has been subsequently questioned and turned out to be unrealistic kim and kavvas 2006 in reality rainfall variables are usually dependent and they do not follow in general the normal distribution and do not have the same marginal distributions vandenberghe et al 2011 michele and salvadori 2003 evin and favre 2008 moreover the dependent structure of rainfall characteristics has been found to have an important impact on the runoff process and further affect hydrological design and floodplain management córdova and ignacio 1985 zhang and singh 2007 to overcome the above shortages in recent years copula functions are gradually introduced into joint simulation of rainfall characteristics and have been widely used in hydrology sawano 2008 bárdossy and pegram 2009 the advantage of copulas is that they can flexibly construct the dependence relationship between different rainfall variables independently of their marginal distribution functions vandenberghe et al 2010a balistrocchi and bacchi 2011 vandenberghe et al 2011 demonstrated the use of copula models for extreme rainfall events and analyzed the designed values under different return periods zhang and singh 2007 derived rainfall frequency distributions using the copula models and found that the copula based distribution fit the dependence structure of observed rainfall characteristics data series better than the bivariate normal probability distribution besides rainfall characteristics the internal temporal structure of rainfall events i e rainfall pattern cannot be neglected and is of paramount importance in soil erosion studies and agricultural drainage system design garcia guzman and aranda oliver 1993 several methods have already existed for determining hyetographs of rainfall events of individual gauged stations the triangular hyetograph method by yen and chow 1980 the instantaneous intensity method by chow et al 1988 the gaussian distribution based hyetograph method by huang 2011 and the stochastic simulation model by huff 1967 terranova and iaquinta 2011 and candela et al 2014 etc among the above approaches one of the stochastic models known as huff curves is the most commonly used which uses dimensionless mass curves or standardized rainfall profiles srp to describe the intra event temporal pattern and generate the hyetograph shapes only based on the probabilistic representation of dimensionless accumulated depth at each quantile of dimensionless elapsed times bonta 2004 bonta and rao 1988 these mass curves are often classified into four groups depending on one of the four storm quantiles 25 interval in which the maximum rainfall intensity occurred an improved method of huff curves proposed by terranova and iaquinta 2011 adopted the areas a1 a2 a3 a4 between the four quantiles of the srp durations and the corresponding four values of the uniform srp usrp to identify the shape of rainfall profiles which provided more accurate characteristics of the temporal structure of rainfall events however these methods only define four types of the hyetograph shapes in advance and limit the various possibility of temporal variability of rainfall events moreover they also neglect the dependence relationship between different hyetograph ordinates within intra event structure therefore to reflect more natural rainfall types in this study a novel method of simulating rainfall hyetographs is introduced to classify the temporal structures of rainfall events at individual sites into diverse rainfall types based on clustering method and consider the correlations of hyetograph ordinates in stochastically simulating each rainfall type using the transformed monte carlo simulation to preserve the dependence relationship of rainfall characteristics and to simultaneously represent the variability of internal temporal structure of rainfall events a single site stochastic simulation model of daily scale rainfall events is developed in this study this model for the first time couples the simple and efficient copula functions with the novel stochastic simulation method of rainfall temporal patterns that based on the method by wu et al 2006b the occurrence probability of different temporal rainfall patterns that is affected by rainfall depth and rainfall duration is also considered in this model in addition the internal clustering validation index liu et al 2010 is introduced to objectively determine the number of rainfall patterns from the perspectives of compactness within one cluster and separation between clusters the objectives of this study are therefore to 1 develop a new single site stochastic model based on rainfall pattern classification and simulation and copula simulation of rainfall characteristics to generate rainfall events 2 apply this new model to 39 gauged stations in zhejiang province east china for stochastically simulating daily rainfall event sequences 3 extend this model to one ungauged site for validation 4 compare this new model with wu s event based model and two other markov based rainfall sequence models 2 methodology a general flowchart of the modelling framework in this study is shown as fig 1 which includes the main steps of the methodology 2 1 stochastic model of daily rainfall events the continuous wet period separated by a dry spell is defined as a rainfall event the rainfall events usually can be described by the following characteristics the occurrence number of rainfall events total rainfall depth rainfall duration and temporal pattern of each rainfall event and inter event time between rainfall events vittal et al 2013 which are shown in fig 2 a according to many previous studies on the definition of wet days 1 mm and dry days 1 mm 1 mm is usually the threshold to define the wet and dry days connolly et al 1998 kang and yusof 2012 in this study the criteria for extracting rainfall events are adopted as follows 1 daily rainfall depth 1 mm 2 dry spell 1 day not only light rain 1 r 10 mm day moderate rain 10 r 25 mm day and heavy rain 25 r 50 mm day but also extreme rain r 50 mm day gong et al 2004 qian et al 2007 kwarteng et al 2010 were included in the extracted rainfall events in this study based on the extracted rainfall events the stochastic model of rainfall events proposed in this study is divided into three parts 1 copula simulation of the characteristics of rainfall events 2 classification and simulation of dimensionless rainfall patterns for which we have removed the effects of rainfall depth and duration for each event 3 merging the dimensionless rainfall patterns with rainfall characteristics to form the complete generated rainfall events here the term characteristics of rainfall events refers to the associated rainfall depth rainfall duration and inter event time while rainfall pattern refers to the temporal variation of rainfall intensity within one rainfall event 2 1 1 copulas for rainfall characteristics simulation to generate random rainfall events the first thing needed to know is the probability distributions of rainfall characteristics in fact inter event time rainfall depth and rainfall duration at individual sites are often inter dependent and their probability distributions are probably non normal for this reason to preserve the dependence of these variables the copula approach was applied in the present study copulas are functions that can construct a joint multivariate distribution function by linking several independent univariate marginal distributions for multiple random variables their marginal distributions can be flexible and even different which is a principal advantage over common models that require the same parametric family for each univariate distribution such as multivariate gamma log normal normal and some extreme value distributions genest and favre 2007 currently many hydrological events involving multiple variables have used copulas successfully vandenberghe et al 2010a zhang et al 2012 sawano 2008 and therefore copulas were chosen in this study according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 if there are cumulative distributions u1 u2 un and f is a n dimensional distribution with these marginal distributions a copula c can be obtained through eq 1 1 f x 1 x 2 x n c u 1 x 1 u 2 x 2 u n x n c u 1 u 2 u n in eq 1 when u 1 x 1 u 1 u 2 x 2 u 2 u n x n u n are continuous c is unique on the contrary if c is an n dimensional copula and u1 u2 un are the distribution functions then f x 1 x 2 x n as above is a n dimensional cumulative distribution with marginal distributions u1 u2 un there are three main groups of copulas marshall olkin copulas elliptical copulas and archimedean copulas of which the structure of archimedean copulas is relatively simple and can construct many forms of joint distribution functions zhang et al 2012 in this study five copula functions of the elliptical and archimedean families were used and their structures are described in table 1 jaworski et al 2010 the mutual dependence of these copulas can be described by kendall rank correlation coefficient i e tau in order to select the best fitted copula two criteria were employed to test their goodness of fit which are the akaike information criterion aic and ordinary least square ols tong et al 2014 huang and niu 2015 the corresponding equations are given as follows 2 aic n log 1 n i 1 n f emp x i 1 x i 2 x im c u i1 u i 2 u im 2 2 k 3 ols 1 n i 1 n f emp x i 1 x i 2 x im c u i1 u i 2 u im 2 where k is the number of parameters m is the dimensions of the function n is the data length and f emp x i 1 x i 2 x im and c u i1 u i 2 u im are respectively the joint empirical cumulative probability and theoretical cumulative probability the smaller the aic and ols values are the better fitted the copula is the equation of joint empirical cumulative probability is given as eq 4 gringorten 1963 4 f emp x i 1 x i 2 x im p x 1 x i 1 x 2 x i 2 x m x im g 1 n k 1 n l 1 n n g k l 0 44 n 0 12 in which n gk l is the joint observation number under the condition x 1 x i 1 x 2 x i 2 x m x im 2 1 2 classification of rainfall patterns within one rainfall event rainfall intensity varies with time each rainfall event has a relatively different temporal pattern and these patterns have important influences on the hydrologic response of a watershed nied et al 2014 vandenberghe et al 2010b therefore developing a procedure to generate different meaningful rainfall patterns in stochastic rainfall event simulation is essential the new stochastic model uses a novel rainfall temporal pattern model developed from the model of wu et al 2006b this model utilized dimensionless rainfall mass curves to identify rainfall patterns so that they can remove the influences of different rainfall durations and depths and only consider the temporal variation of relative rainfall intensity the dimensionless mass curve of one rainfall event is given as eq 5 5 a τ d t d d τ t d in which d is the rainfall duration in days τ is the dimensionless interval corresponding to the observed time t τ 0 1 d d is the total rainfall depth d t is the accumulated rainfall depth at t and a τ is the corresponding dimensionless accumulated rainfall depth a τ 0 1 for each rainfall event the rainfall duration can be equally divided into k intervals δ t d k a i i 1 2 k is the dimensionless accumulated rainfall depth at the i th dimensionless time τ and i i a i a i 1 is the incremental dimensionless depth at the i th dimensionless time interval which can be seen in fig 2 b in this study k 12 was chosen accordingly the dimensionless mass curves of all rainfall events are obtained the k ordinates of each dimensionless mass curve corresponding to the k dimensionless time are used to reflect the shape of mass curve based on which the dimensionless rainfall mass curves are then clustered into several representative patterns by the k means method macqueen 1967 the k means method which is based on euclidean distance is simple and can be easily operated especially for a large dataset hill et al 2013 the cluster number of the k means method that needed to be assigned in advance is respectively given as 5 6 and 7 in this study considering the collection of representative rainfall patterns 2 1 3 optimization of the cluster number of rainfall patterns in general since the most suitable number of groups or representative rainfall patterns cannot be known in advance the common way is to artificially specify the number or use the trial and error method to visually examine the clustering analysis results wu et al 2006b however these methods are rather subjective herein the internal clustering validation index liu et al 2010 is introduced to help determine the optimum number of representative rainfall patterns and test the clustering quality the clustering validation index examines the quality of the clustering results by considering two aspects separation and compactness the former of which measures how dissimilar one cluster is from other clusters and the later measures how closely the objects are similar to each other in one cluster when objects within the same cluster are closer and objects in different clusters are more separated it means the clustering results are better here the xie beni index xb is used and its definition is given in eq 6 the xb index considers the average square distance between each object and its cluster center as the intra cluster compactness and the minimum square distance between pairwise cluster centers as the inter cluster separation when the value of xb is smallest the appropriate cluster number can be obtained liu et al 2013 6 xb k 1 nc j 1 n u kj 2 d 2 x j c k n min i j i d 2 c i c j where n is the number of objects in the data set nc is the number of clusters u jk is the membership value of the j th object in the i th cluster d x y is the distance between y and x and c i is the center of the i th cluster 2 1 4 simulation of a specified rainfall pattern the core of simulating a specified rainfall pattern is to generate non decreasing ordinates of the dimensionless rainfall mass curve i e rainfall pattern 0 a i 1 i 1 2 k k 12 in this study which in essence can be converted to generate i i that are individual dimensionless and normalized variables and must obey the conditions i 1 i 2 i k 1 0 and 0 i i 1 i 1 2 k the ordinates of i i are generally constrained correlated non normal random variables and their direct generation is relatively difficult therefore this problem is shifted into another problem of monte carlo normal simulation by a series of transformation procedures a brief procedure of rainfall pattern simulation is described as follows 1 log ratio transformation choose one i from i 1 2 k and the corresponding i i to implement the log ratio transformation of the remaining i i values aitchison 1986 as eq 7 the range of the transformed variable y i would be from to i 3 is taken as the interval to omit in this study 7 y i log i i i i i 1 2 k i i 2 transformation from non normal space to standard normal space for all the sets y i at a gauged station calculate the first four sample moments of the variable y i as in eq 7 and fit each y i to the johnson distribution system as eq 8 for all i i the johnson distribution system greenwood 1949 covers various distribution types and is flexible to convert non normal variables to standard normal variables three special types of johnson distributions are 1 the bounded system sb w i γ δ ln y i ξ ξ λ y i ξ y i ξ λ 2 the unbounded system su w i γ δ sinh 1 y i ξ λ 3 the log normal system sl w i γ δ ln y i ξ ξ y i the parameters and the best fit johnson distribution type for each y i can be determined by the algorithm program provided by hill et al 1976 using the first four sample moments of y i 8 w i g y i γ δ ξ λ γ δ f y i ξ λ where yi is the initial non normal variable wi is the transformed standard normal variable and γ δ ξ λ are model parameters appropriate for the data at the given gauged station 3 orthogonal transformation calculate the correlation matrix of the transformed standard normal variables w and determine its orthogonal transformation matrix t then the cross correlated standard normal random variables w can be transformed to uncorrelated ones w t 1 w liu and kiureghian 1986 4 monte carlo simulation generate q q k 1 independent standard normal variables w w 1 w 2 w q t 5 inverse transformation firstly the corresponding correlated standard normal variables can be obtained as w tw secondly multivariate non normal random variables can be obtained from multivariate normal random variables through the inverse of f the johnson transformation in eq 8 as y i f i 1 φ w i i 1 2 m φ denotes the cdf of standard normal variables and f i 1 is the inverse cdf of the initial random variable y i in eq 8 lastly constrained multivariate correlated non normal random variables i 1 i 2 i k are obtained in two stages by eq 9 then the specified dimensionless rainfall mass curve i e rainfall pattern can be obtained by linear transformation using eq 5 9 i i exp y i 1 r 1 r i k exp y r 1 i k i i i i 1 1 r 1 r i k exp y r repeating the above five steps m specified rainfall patterns can be simulated a detailed numerical example can be found in appendix a 2 1 5 synthesis of rainfall events for one rainfall event the characteristics including rainfall depth rainfall duration and rainfall pattern are unique moreover rainfall depth and rainfall duration affect the occurrence probability of the temporal rainfall pattern therefore a contingency table huff 1967 is used to count the occurrence numbers of each representative rainfall pattern at the given range of historical rainfall duration and rainfall depth and furthermore the occurrence likelihood for each rainfall pattern can be computed by a multinomial model as eq 10 10 p i n i i l n i i 1 2 l in which l is the total number of rainfall patterns n i is the occurrence number of i th historical rainfall pattern under the given range of rainfall duration and rainfall depth and p i is the occurrence probability of i th rainfall pattern after a sample of the joint rainfall duration and rainfall depth for m rainfall events is generated by the constructed copula as section 2 1 1 the corresponding rainfall patterns for the sample can be simultaneously generated with eq 10 to generate the rainfall events the dimensionless rainfall patterns should be merged with rainfall depths and rainfall durations there are two steps 1 to multiply the dimensionless time by the rainfall duration d and multiply the dimensionless accumulated rainfall by the total depth d d to get the accumulated rainfall depth d t at time t t δ t 2 δ t k δ t δ t d 24 k using the inverse of eq 5 2 to calculate the rainfall depth of each hour sub daily during the rainfall duration and sum the daily rainfall depth in this section rainfall intensity is assumed to be uniform in each δ t which means a linear interpolation of the rainfall mass curves in step 1 through the above steps the simulated daily rainfall events are finally obtained 2 2 stochastic rainfall events generation at ungauged sites 2 2 1 hydrological regionalization generally there is a logical assumption that the rainfall characteristics of stations in the same hydrological region are similar lin and wu 2007 for ungauged sites their synthetic daily rainfall events can be generated based on the statistical characteristics of rainfall events of gauged stations in the same hydrological region therefore the identification of hydrological homogeneous regions is the most important work that needed to be done first in this study the stations geographic information annual rainfall distribution and inter annual variation of rainfall lin and chen 2006 are studied to determine which stations in zhejiang province belong to the same hydrological region the input variables considered include longitude m latitude m elevation m average monthly rainfall mm average annual rainfall mm and standard deviation of annual rainfall mm for each station in total 17 variables of each station 12 of them are average monthly rainfall are used to conduct the regionalization analysis the self organizing map method som kohonen 1982 is employed in this study to perform the hydrological regionalization the som method one of the artificial neural network methodologies anns is a feed forward and unsupervised neural network and can project high dimensional data sets that might have complex relationships to a low dimensional and easily understandable feature map the detailed information about som is readily available in the literature kohonen 2001 lin and wu 2007 xu et al 2016 in the som method the 17 variables of each station are regarded as 17 input neurons in the input layer and each input neuron is assigned a synaptic weight to connect with one output neuron in the output layer then through the unsupervised learning som method all stations are assigned to neurons in the output layer the stations that are assigned to the same or nearby neurons are considered in the same region finally the stations in the same hydrological region are determined 2 2 2 assigning method after the identification of hydrological homogeneous regions the region to which the ungauged site belongs can be determined based on the som based clustering results an assigning method lin and wu 2007 is employed and the ungauged site is assigned to the cluster which has the largest probability as determined in eq 11 by the inverse distance weighting idw method the longitude latitude and elevation of sites are taken as the major factors affecting the similarity between sites which are respectively expressed as symbols x y z the symbol g is the total number of gauged stations and nc is the cluster number p i x y z is the probability that the ungauged site x y z belongs to the i th cluster w j is the weight of the j th gauged station and f j is the membership of the j th gauged station belonging to the i th cluster x j y j z j are respectively the longitude latitude and elevation of the j th gauged station and d j is the distance between the ungauged site and the j th gauged station these variables are formalized below in eq 11 p i x y z j 1 g w j f j f j 1 if j i 0 if j i w j d j 2 j 1 g d j 2 d j x x j 2 y y j 2 z z j 2 11 j 1 2 g i 1 nc 2 2 3 rainfall events at ungauged sites according to the new model the characteristics of rainfall events and the corresponding rainfall patterns at gauged sites are separately simulated so are ungauged sites the two simulation processes are as follows 1 after assigning the ungauged site to a certain cluster assume the i th cluster the rainfall characteristics of the ungauged site for a given frequency can be interpolated from the h gauged stations in the i th cluster using idw shown in eq 12 since the fitted copula function for rainfall characteristics at each gauged station is not the same the characteristics of each station should be generated individually subsequently rainfall characteristics of a chosen frequency at all h gauged stations can be obtained by cubic spline interpolation 12 v p j 1 h w j v jp w j d j 2 j 1 h d j 2 d j x x j 2 y y j 2 z z j 2 where v p are the characteristics e g rainfall depth rainfall duration of the ungauged site at the given frequency p v jp are the characteristics of the j th station in the i th cluster at the given frequency p w j is the inverse distance weight of the ungauged site to the j th gauged station 2 the simulated dimensionless rainfall patterns of the ungauged site are directly transferred from the gauged station which is nearest to the ungauged site the reason is that the corresponding rainfall pattern for each gauged station at a given range of rainfall depth and rainfall duration is unlikely to be the same averaging rainfall patterns of the control gauged stations by inverse distance interpolation would therefore over smooths the patterns to avoid this we directly used the simulated parameters of rainfall patterns from the nearest gauged station to simulate rainfall patterns of the ungauged station based on the simulated characteristics of rainfall events at the ungauged site in the first step the corresponding rainfall pattern can be generated in the second step finally a full set of stochastic rainfall events for the ungauged site can be obtained as described in section 2 1 5 3 study area and data zhejiang province 118 01 e 123 10 e 27 02 n 31 11 n with a total land area of 103 800 km2 is situated at the southern wing of the yangtze river delta which is the strategic coastal area of southeast china its seaboard is adjacent to east china sea fig 3 the terrain in this province is complex and it declines from mountains in the southwestern part through hills in the middle to low alluvial plains in northeastern part this province has abundant rainfall with its temperature high in summer and dry and cold in winter which is mainly controlled by a subtropical monsoon climate the annual average rainfall varies from 980 mm to 2000 mm and the annual average temperature is 15 c 18 c tian et al 2012 there are eight major rivers from south to north lying ao river feiyun river ou river jiao river yong river qiantang river tiaoxi river and beijing hangzhou canal among which qiantang river is the largest river and ou river is the second fig 4 due to its special geographical condition this province has often suffered from serious flooding mainly caused by typhoon or plum rain which severely threaten people s life and property security the plum rain often referred to the east asian rainy season is caused by precipitation along a persistent stationary front known as the mei yu front for nearly two months during the late spring and early summer between eastern russia china taiwan korea and japan the wet season ends during the summer when the subtropical ridge becomes strong enough to push this front north of the region https en wikipedia org wiki east asian rainy season the typhoon is a strong cyclonic vortex in the tropical ocean and this province is one of the high frequency area of typhoons the above reasons lead to the uniqueness of the rainfall temporal structure in this region therefore studying the mechanism of rainfall generation and simulating rainfall series in zhejiang province is meaningful and important daily rainfall data used in this study are from 40 meteorological stations table 2 in which 39 stations are used for model analysis and the meteorological station jiande is deliberately kept as an ungauged site for validation of the stochastic model the rainfall data of these stations are mostly available from 34 to 61 years except beiji 12 years dongtou 14 years linhai 14 years ruian 7 years and shengshan station 14 years as this study primarily concentrates on the analysis of rainfall events described in section 4 2 and the number of rainfall events extracted is often enough at each station the stations with fewer data are also included 4 results 4 1 som clustering results through the hydrological regionalization by the som method the 39 meteorological stations in zhejiang province were eventually clustered into seven regions which are shown in fig 4 the hydrological regionalization result of zhejiang province by the som method was consistent with that derived by zhejiang provincial hydrology bureau 2005 affected by the occurrence time of monsoon and the activities of typhoon the annual distribution of rainfall was extremely uneven to analyze the different features of rainfall among regions one representative station was selected for each cluster region see fig 5 according to its geographical location data length and rainfall distribution fig 5 presents the annual distribution of rainfall for selected gauges in the seven representative regions which can be further classified into three major types plum rain control region typhoon rain control region and typhoon plum rain compatible region according to the generation causes of rainfall 1 plum rain control region cluster 1 the representative station quzhou fig 5 a this region was mainly located at the upper and middle reaches of qiantang and ou river only one peak value emerged in the annual rainfall distribution and wet spell occurred in the months from march to june or april to july with the largest monthly rainfall occurring in may or june the average largest monthly rainfall accounted for 15 20 percent of the annual rainfall and the largest rainfall of continuous four months could reach 50 60 percent 2 typhoon rain control region cluster 6 7 the representative stations qingtian hongjia fig 5 f and g this region covered the downstream of yong and cao e river the middle and lower reaches of jiao ou feiyun and ao river the annual rainfall distribution had two peak values of which the first one usually occurred in the months from march to june that was mainly affected by spring rain or plum rain and the second one occurred in august and september that was primarily formed by typhoon generally for the peak months i e the months which peaks occur in the monthly rainfall of the first peak can occupy 16 of the annual rainfall and the second is around 11 the average largest rainfall of continuous four months was about 50 of the annual rainfall which usually occurs in june to september 3 typhoon plum rain compatible region cluster 2 3 4 5 respectively the representative stations are dongyang pinghu tianmushan kuocangshan fig 5 b e this region mainly included the lower reaches of qiantang river the upper reaches of jiao river and xiaoxi basin of ou river etc the pattern of annual rainfall distribution was synthesized by that of plum rain and typhoon rain the nearer the cluster is adjacent to east china sea the greater the cluster is influenced by typhoon meanwhile the amount of rainfall in august and september became larger with the increasing effects of typhoon moreover the smaller the distance from the cluster to inland was the larger the effect of plum rain was and rainfall was primarily distributed in march to june with the maximum rainfall in june in addition it can be seen from fig 5 that the magnitude of rainfall in each month decreased from southwest to northeast where the impact of typhoon became greater the reason may be that rainfall intensity of typhoon is large but its duration is very short while plum rain can last a long time to induce heavy rainfall chiang et al 2009 due to the exceptional altitudes of kuocangshan and tianmushan stations 1383 1 m and 1505 9 m respectively that are much higher than those of other stations ranging from 0 to 500 8 m kuocangshan and tianmushan were individually the sole stations in cluster 6 and custer 7 and the quantity of rainfall was relatively large cluster 6 was more affected by typhoon rain than plum rain while cluster 7 was the opposite 4 2 analysis of rainfall events at gauged stations 4 2 1 number of extracted rainfall events according to the definition of rainfall event in section 2 1 all rainfall events were extracted for each station in the province table 3 shows the extracted number of rainfall events at each station as there are so many stations here only one representative station is used as an example i e dongyang station whose monthly average rainfall is also plotted in fig 5 b to demonstrate the statistical characteristics of its rainfall events which also applies to the subsequent results and the corresponding results at the other six representative stations can be found in appendix b during the period 1962 2011 there are in total 2671 rainfall events at dongyang station table 4 the number of rainfall events in spring 32 2 and summer 25 1 were observed clearly to be higher than that in autumn 20 1 and winter 22 6 which was in agreement with the annual rainfall distribution of dongyang since light and moderate rain events were also included in the extracted rainfall events the number of rainfall events occurring in each month was large and there was no significant difference in general annual random occurrence numbers of hydrological events are thought to be independent and that can be described by a poisson process zorzetto et al 2016 therefore to check whether it can model the annual occurrence of rainfall events the poisson distribution was tested by using the fisher dispersion index d i as eq 13 cunnane 1979 13 d i i 1 n n i n 2 n n 1 var n e n in which n is the number of years n i denotes the occurrence number of hydrological events in the i th year n is the average value of n i the index d i follows a χ 2 distribution and its degree of freedom is n 1 when the p value associated with d i is greater than the significance level commonly 5 or 1 the poisson distribution is accepted through testing the annual occurrence number of rainfall events of the 39 meteorological stations in zhejiang province we found that the p values range from 0 89 0 99 and are all larger than the significance level 5 so the annual occurrence numbers of rainfall events in all stations follow the poisson distribution which is used to stochastically simulate the annual number of rainfall events the p value of dongyang station is shown in table 4 4 2 2 correlations among inter event time rainfall duration and rainfall depth kendall rank correlation coefficient and pearson correlation coefficient were both computed to highlight pairwise relationships among inter event time rainfall duration and rainfall depth for all stations in zhejiang province of which the latter is often applied to measure the linear correlation of two variables and the former is employed to measure the monotonicity and dependence relationship of two variables and can be used directly in copula functions in table 5 it can be seen that there existed moderately or strongly positive correlations between rainfall depth and rainfall duration at all stations in terms of pearson and kendall coefficients no correlation r 0 0 2 weak correlation r 0 2 0 5 moderate correlation r 0 5 0 8 strong correlation r 0 8 1 0 and perfect correlation r 1 0 eberly 2007 this means that rainfall depth has a simple linear relationship with rainfall duration table 5 also demonstrates that inter event time had no or a very weakly correlated relationship with rainfall duration or rainfall depth limiting the meaningful correlation to the two latter variables the correlation between rainfall duration and rainfall depth in the plum rain control region was higher than that in the typhoon rain control region 4 2 3 2d copula selection for simulating rainfall duration and rainfall depth in consideration that a significant correlation was only observed between rainfall duration and rainfall depth a two dimensional 2d copula was used to construct their joint distribution the marginal distributions utilized to verify which rainfall duration and depth were subject to include pearson type iii distribution pe3 lognormal distribution with three parameters ln3 generalized logistic distribution glo generalized pareto distribution gpa and generalized extreme value distribution gev subsequently an l moment ratio diagram was drawn which is a widely used approach to identify a parent distribution among many distributions vogel and fennessey 1993 the l moment ratio diagram of rainfall depth of 39 stations that were closely distributed in fig 6 a indicated that rainfall depth was mostly possible to follow gpa or ln3 similarly fig 6 b shows that rainfall duration was more likely to follow gpa or pe3 with the purpose of determining the ultimate distributions of rainfall duration and depth here the kolmogorov smirnov test was applied and the best fit distribution was chosen with the largest p value it can be found that the p values of gpa followed by rainfall depth at all stations were larger than that of ln3 while for rainfall duration 82 of stations had larger p values of pe3 than that of gpa hence rainfall depth followed gpa distribution and rainfall duration followed pe3 distribution five copulas namely gaussian student s t clayton frank and gumbel in table 1 were constructed and tested to select the best copula with the minimum aic and ols values the parameters of each copula were estimated by kendall rank correlation coefficients table 6 illustrates that student s t copula gave the lowest aic and ols values and was chosen as the best matching copula for rainfall duration and rainfall depth at dongyang station fig 7 shows the corresponding empirical and theoretical joint probability distribution for rainfall duration and rainfall depth which also demonstrated that the student s t copula fitted very well the student s t copula was also the optimal copula to simulate the joint distribution of rainfall duration and rainfall depth for 84 of the other stations in zhejiang province 4 2 4 classification and optimization of rainfall patterns after the k means clustering analysis the average dimensionless mass curve of each rainfall pattern under the 5 6 and 7 groups at dongyang station is respectively shown in fig 8 a c there are several common types of rainfall patterns uniform type u delayed type d central peaked type c and advanced type a the uniform type means that rainfall intensity keeps relatively constant throughout the rainfall period the delayed type denotes that relatively high rainfall intensity occurs in the late part of the rainfall event whereas the advanced type has the opposite situation for the central peaked type its high rainfall intensity occurs in the middle and rainfall intensity tapers off towards the early and late part of the rainfall event comparing these three classification results the differences are that the central peaked type was not included in the 5 group classification but the central peaked type in the 6 group classification was split into two central peaked types that were included in the 7 group classification in the following the xb clustering validation index was computed to determine the suitable number of rainfall patterns for dongyang station six was determined as the optimal number of rainfall patterns at the same time the 6 group classification just had the sufficient and effective types of rainfall patterns and therefore six patterns were considered as the proper number for dongyang station the representative number of rainfall patterns at all stations in zhejiang province using the same method is listed in table 7 from the table it can be seen that six was the optimal number of representative rainfall patterns for almost all the stations about 74 and seven was for 23 of the stations and five was for only one station when each station was analyzed individually the number determined by the xb index could be regarded as the optimal number of rainfall patterns for each gauged station however when it came to regional frequency analysis i e expanding generation of rainfall events at gauged stations to an ungauged site the number of rainfall patterns in one region needed to be kept the same in view of the above results the number 6 was eventually selected as the number of representative rainfall patterns for regional frequency analysis for all the seven regions because 6 is the most seen number in table 7 4 2 5 stochastic generation of one specified rainfall pattern according to the statistical parameters i e mean sd skewness and kurtosis of the dimensionless rainfall hyetograph i i i 1 2 k and the corresponding log ratio variables y i i 1 2 k i 3 for each rainfall pattern an arbitrary size sample of dimensionless rainfall mass curves can be generated fig 9 displays 100 simulated dimensionless rainfall mass curves of the six specified rainfall patterns for dongyang station the simulated and observed average dimensionless rainfall mass curves for the six rainfall patterns are compared in fig 10 which showed that they fitted very well figs 9 and 10 demonstrate that the simulation results can well preserve the statistical characteristics of each rainfall pattern and the simulation method was valid here the size 100 of the sample is only taken as an example 4 2 6 synthesizing rainfall events first 100 simulated rainfall depths and rainfall durations were generated using student s t copula with the parameters estimated in section 4 2 3 for dongyang station the occurrence probability of each rainfall pattern was calculated according to eq 10 based on its occurrence number at different ranges of rainfall depth and rainfall duration shown in table 8 based on the results in table 8 the random selection of a particular rainfall pattern can be realized for a simulated rainfall event with specified rainfall depth and rainfall duration from table 8 it can be seen that for the six rainfall patterns rainfall events with rainfall depth less than 50 mm and rainfall duration less than 3 days occurred most frequently and rainfall pattern u had the largest occurrence frequency 0 62 which was far greater than that of the other five patterns for other rainfall events the occurrence frequency was small and there was not much difference for the six rainfall patterns next the 100 simulated rainfall depths were merged with the corresponding 100 rainfall patterns which are presented in fig 11 the top curve was obviously higher than the lower curves of which rainfall depth was 182 0 mm with the non exceedance probability 0 99 the rainfall depth of the second top curve was 117 1 mm and its non exceedance probability was 0 98 finally 100 simulated daily rainfall events were formed by merging the accumulated rainfall depth with the corresponding rainfall duration here only one rainfall event of each rainfall pattern was randomly taken for just illustrating the results fig 12 fig 12 a displays the rainfall event of pattern a2 with 0 74 non exceedance probability of rainfall depth 31 16 mm and 0 69 non exceedance probability of rainfall duration 2 36 days fig 12 b is the rainfall event with 114 48 mm rainfall depth non exceedance probability 0 98 and 7 36 days rainfall duration non exceedance probability 0 99 for pattern a1 for pattern c the rainfall event is displayed in fig 12 c of which rainfall depth was 57 93 mm and rainfall duration was 3 36 days the non exceedance probabilities were respectively 0 90 and 0 84 similarly the rainfall events for pattern u pattern d1 and pattern d2 are shown from left to right in fig 12 d f their rainfall depths were respectively 69 91 mm 168 73 mm and 38 51 mm with the corresponding non exceedance probabilities 0 93 0 99 and 0 80 and their rainfall durations were in sequence 1 97 days 7 38 days and 5 23 days with the non exceedance probabilities 0 60 0 98 and 0 95 the results above revealed that this stochastic generation model of daily rainfall events can be applied successfully at gauged stations 4 3 stochastic generation of daily rainfall events at ungauged sites to validate the stochastic model jiande station shown in fig 3 was used as an ungauged site whose data had not been used in the analysis above through the assigning method shown in section 2 2 2 jiande station was assigned to the 3rd cluster region which included chunan quzhou kaihua suichang jiangshan and longquan gauged stations the inverse distance weights from the above six stations to jiande station were separately 0 68 0 13 0 06 0 06 0 05 and 0 02 calculated by eq 12 with which the joint rainfall depth and rainfall duration for jiande station can be interpolated from the gauged stations also the kendall rank correlation coefficients between rainfall duration and rainfall depth of the six stations were very close to each other 0 58 0 60 in the 3rd cluster region and the kendall rank correlation coefficient at jiande station is interpolated to be 0 59 a scatter diagram of the simulated and observed pairs rainfall duration and rainfall depth is shown in fig 13 a which is the most natural way of examining the suitability of a copula model genest and favre 2007 the simulated joint distribution of rainfall duration and rainfall depth was nearly superimposed with the observed pairs reflecting that the observed and simulated values fitted very well the kendall correlation coefficient of the observed pairs was 0 58 which was almost the same as that of the simulated pairs fig 13 b and c show the exceedance probability distributions of rainfall duration and rainfall depth for simulation and observation and they further indicated that the performance of simulating rainfall characteristics was very good even for the ungauged site to validate whether transplanting characteristics of rainfall patterns from gauged stations to ungauged sites is reasonable the simulated and observed rainfall patterns were compared at jiande station as chunan station was nearest to jiande station its simulation results of rainfall patterns were treated as the simulated results of jiande station the average dimensionless rainfall mass curve of each pattern extracted from the observed rainfall events matched that of the simulated ones very well see fig 14 on the basis of the above analysis the entire model built in this study for simulating daily rainfall events is robust and can be expanded to ungauged sites 4 4 comparison with other stochastic rainfall models 4 4 1 comparison with wu s event based model the comparison between the new model developed in this study and the event based rainfall model by wu et al 2006a was conducted from the following three aspects 1 model structure and operating efficiency 2 statistics of rainfall event characteristics and dependence relationship between rainfall depth and rainfall duration 3 performance in simulating extreme rainfall events fig 15 shows the different parts in the model structure between the new model and wu s model from which it can be seen that the main difference of these two models existed in the simulation segment of rainfall characteristics i e rainfall depth and rainfall duration rainfall characteristics are usually multivariate correlated non normal variates that are difficult to be directly generated by monte carlo method and these variates firstly need to be transformed to standard normal random variates through normal transformation and orthogonal transformation the process of which is complex and tedious therefore copula functions were introduced to simplify the simulation process which is simple and flexible for constructing the joint distribution of multivariable data and can well preserve their dependence structure moreover the internal clustering index was introduced to objectively determine the representative rainfall patterns through the above improvements the model structure was simplified and running efficiency of the new model was improved compared to wu s model table 9 shows the simulated statistics of rainfall event characteristics by wu s model and the new model which were both compared with the observed values 50 years of rainfall events were stochastically generated using these two models and the simulation process was repeated 1000 times from table 9 it can be found that the correlation relationship between rainfall depth and rainfall duration simulated by the new model 0 70 was the same with the observed 0 70 and it was better than the simulation results by wu s model 0 62 from the perspective of statistics i e mean standard deviation sd skewness and kurtosis the simulated statistics by the new model was much closer to the observed values than those by wu s model and the standard deviation associated with 1000 simulations for each statistic was smaller than that of wu s model the above results further demonstrated that the new model is more robust in simulating the statistics of rainfall events the performance of these two models in simulating extreme rainfall events is shown in fig 16 it is observed that the mean depth frequency curve lies relatively higher above the median curve indicating these two models generated positively skewed estimation of rainfall quantile especially for larger return periods under 1 day and 3 day rainfall durations wu s model performed slightly better than the new model although both models underestimated the observed data however for 2 day 4 day 5 day and 6 day rainfall durations the mean and median of simulated curves of the new model were much closer to the observed curve than those of wu s model and the uncertainty ranges were smaller for longer rainfall durations the performance of the new model was better since these models were not designed for extreme rainfall events they did not perform very well in simulating extreme rainfall events to some extent however on the whole the proposed new stochastic rainfall model can improve the generation efficiency of rainfall events and simulate rainfall characteristics more accurately 4 4 2 comparison with two markov chain models apart from comparison with an event based rainfall model the new model was also compared with two state of art rainfall sequence models namely weagets weather generator école de technologie supérieure chen et al 2010 and mrs multisite rainfall simulator mehrotra et al 2015 mehrotra and sharma 2007a both of which are based on markov chains for rainfall occurrence and consider low frequency variability e g the year to year dependence of daily rainfall the details of these two models can be found in the relevant references and the mrs model was used as a single site rainfall model here the simulation length at dongyang station was set as 30 years from the year 1964 to 1993 and the maximum number of simulations was 100 rainfall events were extracted from the simulation results of both models according to the definition of rainfall events in section 2 1 and were then compared with the observed rainfall events and the simulated results of the new model due to lack of space only the average values were used here to evaluate these models the comparison results of statistics of rainfall characteristics are shown in table 10 from table 10 it is clear that the new model and mrs model performed much better in simulating rainfall characteristics than that of weagets model and the new model preserved the mean standard deviation of rainfall depth and rainfall duration and their correlations better than the mrs model the new model often overestimated the skewness and kurtosis of rainfall depth and duration while mrs often underestimated these values in simulating rainfall characteristics the new model performed the best the mrs model is the second and the weagets model is the worst as for the extreme rainfall simulated by the new model weagets and mrs model the results all demonstrated large relative bias when compared with the observed extreme rainfall under different rainfall durations which could be expected because all these models were not designed for extreme rainfall events on the whole the mrs model performed the worst in comparison with other two models under almost all rainfall durations particularly for larger return periods the new model and weagets model performed almost the same and both could preserve extreme rainfall satisfactorily relative bias 35 under different rainfall durations through comparing with wu s event based rainfall model and two markov based rainfall models the new model is regarded to be able to reproduce the observed characteristics of rainfall events very well and has advantages in simulating extreme rainfall events 5 conclusions the study presented a new single site stochastic model of daily rainfall events the main advantage of which is that the internal temporal structures of rainfall events and the simple but effective copula functions for preserving the dependence structure of rainfall characteristics were comprehensively incorporated the main steps of the new model include 1 to generate multi year rainfall events by poisson distribution 2 to rapidly simulate rainfall characteristics through their joint distribution constructed by copula functions 3 to capture the corresponding rainfall temporal patterns by their occurrence frequency which were associated with rainfall depth and duration temporal patterns of rainfall events are required in hydrosystem engineering design and analysis but they are usually neglected by most existing rainfall models to objectively reflect the natural variability of internal temporal structures of rainfall events we adopted clustering analysis to classify dimensionless rainfall mass curves into different rainfall patterns and then introduced the internal clustering validation index to determine the representative rainfall patterns in the study area through applying the new model in zhejiang province s seven different hydrological regions that include 39 gauged stations the results showed that the new model can properly simulate both the dependent rainfall duration and depth and the rainfall patterns at all stations which fully demonstrated that this new model is capable of stochastically simulating rainfall events to augment the length of rainfall data for gauged stations in addition based on the interpolated rainfall characteristics from gauged stations within the same hydrological region and the transplanted rainfall patterns from the nearest gauged station this model was also successfully extended to an ungauged site for simulating its rainfall events indicating this new stochastic model can also be used to provide artificial rainfall records for ungauged sites which is of great use for engineering design at ungauged sites moreover compared with wu s event based rainfall model and two other markov based rainfall sequences models i e weagets and mrs the new model further showed advantages in simulating rainfall characteristics and extreme rainfall since the new model was not designed for extreme rainfall events it does not exhibit strong ability in simulating extreme rainfall events however this problem can be solved by modifying the definition of rainfall events another potential application for this model is that it can be used for simulating finer scale e g hourly rainfall events that mainly depend on the time scale of input rainfall data palynchuk and guo 2008 used a similar stochastic procedure to simulate hourly rainstorm events in which rainfall events were specially confined to rainstorm events according to the rainfall characteristics of canada the proposed procedure is sufficiently generic and capable of simulating rainfall events at hourly resolution the proposed model can be also extended to simulate the new extreme rainfall events under climate change the extension would involve modifying the historical data set by applying projected change fields to rainfall characteristics e g semenov and barrow 2002 fadhel et al 2017 or introducing the dependence structure between rainfall characteristics and covariates e g time temperature or atmospheric circulation index e g wasko and sharma 2015 panthou et al 2014 and then using

7051,rainfall event simulation can be very useful in many hydrological and hydraulic practices such as dam design the aim of this study is to propose a new single site stochastic model for generating daily rainfall events the model has two components copula based joint simulation of rainfall characteristics and rainfall temporal pattern simulation compared with prevailing stochastic rainfall models this new model can not only preserve the dependence relationship between rainfall duration and rainfall depth by using copula functions but also take different temporal rainfall patterns that can cause various hydrological responses of watersheds into consideration additionally the internal clustering validation index is introduced in this study to objectively determine the number of representative rainfall patterns in this model lastly a framework is designed to apply the developed stochastic model to 39 gauged meteorological stations in zhejiang province east china and to extend its application to one ungauged site for validation the final validation results were sound and indicated that the developed stochastic model is robust and can be applied at both gauged stations and ungauged sites for generating long rainfall records keywords rainfall pattern rainfall characteristics copula internal cluster validation indices gauged stations ungauged sites 1 introduction many problems in hydrology agricultural science and engineering require extensive records of rainfall mehrotra et al 2015 especially for flood risk assessment water resource management or hydraulic structure design vandenberghe et al 2011 in reality however observational records are often short or lacking so that stochastic rainfall models have become more established to augment the rainfall time series or generate synthetic rainfall records where none are available numerous stochastic rainfall models have been proposed throughout the years including various single site models e g mhanna and bauwens 2012 katz 1977 sharma and lall 1999 zheng and katz 2008a and multi site models e g zheng and katz 2008b chen et al 2018 wilks 1998 mehrotra and sharma 2007b multi site rainfall models incorporate spatial dependence across multiple point sites based on single site models from the adopted simulation methods these rainfall models are based on non parametric e g leander and buishand 2009 sharma and lall 1999 basinger et al 2010 semi parametric e g mehrotra and sharma 2007b aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 or parametric techniques e g liu et al 2011 van montfort and witter 1986 and they differ in complexity the advantages of non parametric methods such as nearest neighbor algorithm and kernel density estimation approach are that they are simple and can reproduce observations very well but they lack extrapolation ability and do not provide unobserved extremes the parametric methods have extrapolation capability and thus become more popular in the application of climate impact studies for existing stochastic rainfall models most models are usually based on markov chains e g haan et al 1976 mehrotra et al 2006 mehrotra and sharma 2007b to simulate the occurrence of wet and dry days in the rainfall process and then rainfall amount on a wet day moreover a number of alternative types of models that focus on the event based nature of the rainfall process have also been developed including profile based e g wu et al 2015 huff 1967 and pulse based models with representative bartlett lewis models e g onof and wheater 1993 ritschel et al 2017 and neyman scott models e g rodríguez iturbe et al 1987 cowpertwait 1991 since event based rainfall models are able to simulate continuous temporal rainfall which often leads to extreme rainfall events and causes catastrophic loss they have received considerable attentions in recent years and are utilized to analyze design storms for water resources management and other engineering design applications based on the above stochastic rainfall models the study in this paper is emphasized on profile based rainfall events using parametric methods at a set of sites independently on a daily time scale a stochastic profile based model should preserve the statistical characteristics of rainfall events including total rainfall depth rainfall duration inter event time and intra event temporal structure rainfall hyetographs or rainfall profiles heneker et al 2001 huff 1967 terranova and iaquinta 2011 failure to address each of these characteristics can lead to poor outcomes for water or agricultural management regarding the simulation of rainfall characteristics much work has been done including those that separately simulate the average intensity depth and duration of rainfall events by assuming their independence from each other eagleson 1972 rodríguez iturbe 1986 and those that construct joint distribution of rainfall characteristics by assuming the same type of the marginal probability distribution such as multivariate gaussian distribution exponential distribution or gamma distribution bacchi et al 1994 clarke 1980 the above hypothesis of rainfall characteristics has been subsequently questioned and turned out to be unrealistic kim and kavvas 2006 in reality rainfall variables are usually dependent and they do not follow in general the normal distribution and do not have the same marginal distributions vandenberghe et al 2011 michele and salvadori 2003 evin and favre 2008 moreover the dependent structure of rainfall characteristics has been found to have an important impact on the runoff process and further affect hydrological design and floodplain management córdova and ignacio 1985 zhang and singh 2007 to overcome the above shortages in recent years copula functions are gradually introduced into joint simulation of rainfall characteristics and have been widely used in hydrology sawano 2008 bárdossy and pegram 2009 the advantage of copulas is that they can flexibly construct the dependence relationship between different rainfall variables independently of their marginal distribution functions vandenberghe et al 2010a balistrocchi and bacchi 2011 vandenberghe et al 2011 demonstrated the use of copula models for extreme rainfall events and analyzed the designed values under different return periods zhang and singh 2007 derived rainfall frequency distributions using the copula models and found that the copula based distribution fit the dependence structure of observed rainfall characteristics data series better than the bivariate normal probability distribution besides rainfall characteristics the internal temporal structure of rainfall events i e rainfall pattern cannot be neglected and is of paramount importance in soil erosion studies and agricultural drainage system design garcia guzman and aranda oliver 1993 several methods have already existed for determining hyetographs of rainfall events of individual gauged stations the triangular hyetograph method by yen and chow 1980 the instantaneous intensity method by chow et al 1988 the gaussian distribution based hyetograph method by huang 2011 and the stochastic simulation model by huff 1967 terranova and iaquinta 2011 and candela et al 2014 etc among the above approaches one of the stochastic models known as huff curves is the most commonly used which uses dimensionless mass curves or standardized rainfall profiles srp to describe the intra event temporal pattern and generate the hyetograph shapes only based on the probabilistic representation of dimensionless accumulated depth at each quantile of dimensionless elapsed times bonta 2004 bonta and rao 1988 these mass curves are often classified into four groups depending on one of the four storm quantiles 25 interval in which the maximum rainfall intensity occurred an improved method of huff curves proposed by terranova and iaquinta 2011 adopted the areas a1 a2 a3 a4 between the four quantiles of the srp durations and the corresponding four values of the uniform srp usrp to identify the shape of rainfall profiles which provided more accurate characteristics of the temporal structure of rainfall events however these methods only define four types of the hyetograph shapes in advance and limit the various possibility of temporal variability of rainfall events moreover they also neglect the dependence relationship between different hyetograph ordinates within intra event structure therefore to reflect more natural rainfall types in this study a novel method of simulating rainfall hyetographs is introduced to classify the temporal structures of rainfall events at individual sites into diverse rainfall types based on clustering method and consider the correlations of hyetograph ordinates in stochastically simulating each rainfall type using the transformed monte carlo simulation to preserve the dependence relationship of rainfall characteristics and to simultaneously represent the variability of internal temporal structure of rainfall events a single site stochastic simulation model of daily scale rainfall events is developed in this study this model for the first time couples the simple and efficient copula functions with the novel stochastic simulation method of rainfall temporal patterns that based on the method by wu et al 2006b the occurrence probability of different temporal rainfall patterns that is affected by rainfall depth and rainfall duration is also considered in this model in addition the internal clustering validation index liu et al 2010 is introduced to objectively determine the number of rainfall patterns from the perspectives of compactness within one cluster and separation between clusters the objectives of this study are therefore to 1 develop a new single site stochastic model based on rainfall pattern classification and simulation and copula simulation of rainfall characteristics to generate rainfall events 2 apply this new model to 39 gauged stations in zhejiang province east china for stochastically simulating daily rainfall event sequences 3 extend this model to one ungauged site for validation 4 compare this new model with wu s event based model and two other markov based rainfall sequence models 2 methodology a general flowchart of the modelling framework in this study is shown as fig 1 which includes the main steps of the methodology 2 1 stochastic model of daily rainfall events the continuous wet period separated by a dry spell is defined as a rainfall event the rainfall events usually can be described by the following characteristics the occurrence number of rainfall events total rainfall depth rainfall duration and temporal pattern of each rainfall event and inter event time between rainfall events vittal et al 2013 which are shown in fig 2 a according to many previous studies on the definition of wet days 1 mm and dry days 1 mm 1 mm is usually the threshold to define the wet and dry days connolly et al 1998 kang and yusof 2012 in this study the criteria for extracting rainfall events are adopted as follows 1 daily rainfall depth 1 mm 2 dry spell 1 day not only light rain 1 r 10 mm day moderate rain 10 r 25 mm day and heavy rain 25 r 50 mm day but also extreme rain r 50 mm day gong et al 2004 qian et al 2007 kwarteng et al 2010 were included in the extracted rainfall events in this study based on the extracted rainfall events the stochastic model of rainfall events proposed in this study is divided into three parts 1 copula simulation of the characteristics of rainfall events 2 classification and simulation of dimensionless rainfall patterns for which we have removed the effects of rainfall depth and duration for each event 3 merging the dimensionless rainfall patterns with rainfall characteristics to form the complete generated rainfall events here the term characteristics of rainfall events refers to the associated rainfall depth rainfall duration and inter event time while rainfall pattern refers to the temporal variation of rainfall intensity within one rainfall event 2 1 1 copulas for rainfall characteristics simulation to generate random rainfall events the first thing needed to know is the probability distributions of rainfall characteristics in fact inter event time rainfall depth and rainfall duration at individual sites are often inter dependent and their probability distributions are probably non normal for this reason to preserve the dependence of these variables the copula approach was applied in the present study copulas are functions that can construct a joint multivariate distribution function by linking several independent univariate marginal distributions for multiple random variables their marginal distributions can be flexible and even different which is a principal advantage over common models that require the same parametric family for each univariate distribution such as multivariate gamma log normal normal and some extreme value distributions genest and favre 2007 currently many hydrological events involving multiple variables have used copulas successfully vandenberghe et al 2010a zhang et al 2012 sawano 2008 and therefore copulas were chosen in this study according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 if there are cumulative distributions u1 u2 un and f is a n dimensional distribution with these marginal distributions a copula c can be obtained through eq 1 1 f x 1 x 2 x n c u 1 x 1 u 2 x 2 u n x n c u 1 u 2 u n in eq 1 when u 1 x 1 u 1 u 2 x 2 u 2 u n x n u n are continuous c is unique on the contrary if c is an n dimensional copula and u1 u2 un are the distribution functions then f x 1 x 2 x n as above is a n dimensional cumulative distribution with marginal distributions u1 u2 un there are three main groups of copulas marshall olkin copulas elliptical copulas and archimedean copulas of which the structure of archimedean copulas is relatively simple and can construct many forms of joint distribution functions zhang et al 2012 in this study five copula functions of the elliptical and archimedean families were used and their structures are described in table 1 jaworski et al 2010 the mutual dependence of these copulas can be described by kendall rank correlation coefficient i e tau in order to select the best fitted copula two criteria were employed to test their goodness of fit which are the akaike information criterion aic and ordinary least square ols tong et al 2014 huang and niu 2015 the corresponding equations are given as follows 2 aic n log 1 n i 1 n f emp x i 1 x i 2 x im c u i1 u i 2 u im 2 2 k 3 ols 1 n i 1 n f emp x i 1 x i 2 x im c u i1 u i 2 u im 2 where k is the number of parameters m is the dimensions of the function n is the data length and f emp x i 1 x i 2 x im and c u i1 u i 2 u im are respectively the joint empirical cumulative probability and theoretical cumulative probability the smaller the aic and ols values are the better fitted the copula is the equation of joint empirical cumulative probability is given as eq 4 gringorten 1963 4 f emp x i 1 x i 2 x im p x 1 x i 1 x 2 x i 2 x m x im g 1 n k 1 n l 1 n n g k l 0 44 n 0 12 in which n gk l is the joint observation number under the condition x 1 x i 1 x 2 x i 2 x m x im 2 1 2 classification of rainfall patterns within one rainfall event rainfall intensity varies with time each rainfall event has a relatively different temporal pattern and these patterns have important influences on the hydrologic response of a watershed nied et al 2014 vandenberghe et al 2010b therefore developing a procedure to generate different meaningful rainfall patterns in stochastic rainfall event simulation is essential the new stochastic model uses a novel rainfall temporal pattern model developed from the model of wu et al 2006b this model utilized dimensionless rainfall mass curves to identify rainfall patterns so that they can remove the influences of different rainfall durations and depths and only consider the temporal variation of relative rainfall intensity the dimensionless mass curve of one rainfall event is given as eq 5 5 a τ d t d d τ t d in which d is the rainfall duration in days τ is the dimensionless interval corresponding to the observed time t τ 0 1 d d is the total rainfall depth d t is the accumulated rainfall depth at t and a τ is the corresponding dimensionless accumulated rainfall depth a τ 0 1 for each rainfall event the rainfall duration can be equally divided into k intervals δ t d k a i i 1 2 k is the dimensionless accumulated rainfall depth at the i th dimensionless time τ and i i a i a i 1 is the incremental dimensionless depth at the i th dimensionless time interval which can be seen in fig 2 b in this study k 12 was chosen accordingly the dimensionless mass curves of all rainfall events are obtained the k ordinates of each dimensionless mass curve corresponding to the k dimensionless time are used to reflect the shape of mass curve based on which the dimensionless rainfall mass curves are then clustered into several representative patterns by the k means method macqueen 1967 the k means method which is based on euclidean distance is simple and can be easily operated especially for a large dataset hill et al 2013 the cluster number of the k means method that needed to be assigned in advance is respectively given as 5 6 and 7 in this study considering the collection of representative rainfall patterns 2 1 3 optimization of the cluster number of rainfall patterns in general since the most suitable number of groups or representative rainfall patterns cannot be known in advance the common way is to artificially specify the number or use the trial and error method to visually examine the clustering analysis results wu et al 2006b however these methods are rather subjective herein the internal clustering validation index liu et al 2010 is introduced to help determine the optimum number of representative rainfall patterns and test the clustering quality the clustering validation index examines the quality of the clustering results by considering two aspects separation and compactness the former of which measures how dissimilar one cluster is from other clusters and the later measures how closely the objects are similar to each other in one cluster when objects within the same cluster are closer and objects in different clusters are more separated it means the clustering results are better here the xie beni index xb is used and its definition is given in eq 6 the xb index considers the average square distance between each object and its cluster center as the intra cluster compactness and the minimum square distance between pairwise cluster centers as the inter cluster separation when the value of xb is smallest the appropriate cluster number can be obtained liu et al 2013 6 xb k 1 nc j 1 n u kj 2 d 2 x j c k n min i j i d 2 c i c j where n is the number of objects in the data set nc is the number of clusters u jk is the membership value of the j th object in the i th cluster d x y is the distance between y and x and c i is the center of the i th cluster 2 1 4 simulation of a specified rainfall pattern the core of simulating a specified rainfall pattern is to generate non decreasing ordinates of the dimensionless rainfall mass curve i e rainfall pattern 0 a i 1 i 1 2 k k 12 in this study which in essence can be converted to generate i i that are individual dimensionless and normalized variables and must obey the conditions i 1 i 2 i k 1 0 and 0 i i 1 i 1 2 k the ordinates of i i are generally constrained correlated non normal random variables and their direct generation is relatively difficult therefore this problem is shifted into another problem of monte carlo normal simulation by a series of transformation procedures a brief procedure of rainfall pattern simulation is described as follows 1 log ratio transformation choose one i from i 1 2 k and the corresponding i i to implement the log ratio transformation of the remaining i i values aitchison 1986 as eq 7 the range of the transformed variable y i would be from to i 3 is taken as the interval to omit in this study 7 y i log i i i i i 1 2 k i i 2 transformation from non normal space to standard normal space for all the sets y i at a gauged station calculate the first four sample moments of the variable y i as in eq 7 and fit each y i to the johnson distribution system as eq 8 for all i i the johnson distribution system greenwood 1949 covers various distribution types and is flexible to convert non normal variables to standard normal variables three special types of johnson distributions are 1 the bounded system sb w i γ δ ln y i ξ ξ λ y i ξ y i ξ λ 2 the unbounded system su w i γ δ sinh 1 y i ξ λ 3 the log normal system sl w i γ δ ln y i ξ ξ y i the parameters and the best fit johnson distribution type for each y i can be determined by the algorithm program provided by hill et al 1976 using the first four sample moments of y i 8 w i g y i γ δ ξ λ γ δ f y i ξ λ where yi is the initial non normal variable wi is the transformed standard normal variable and γ δ ξ λ are model parameters appropriate for the data at the given gauged station 3 orthogonal transformation calculate the correlation matrix of the transformed standard normal variables w and determine its orthogonal transformation matrix t then the cross correlated standard normal random variables w can be transformed to uncorrelated ones w t 1 w liu and kiureghian 1986 4 monte carlo simulation generate q q k 1 independent standard normal variables w w 1 w 2 w q t 5 inverse transformation firstly the corresponding correlated standard normal variables can be obtained as w tw secondly multivariate non normal random variables can be obtained from multivariate normal random variables through the inverse of f the johnson transformation in eq 8 as y i f i 1 φ w i i 1 2 m φ denotes the cdf of standard normal variables and f i 1 is the inverse cdf of the initial random variable y i in eq 8 lastly constrained multivariate correlated non normal random variables i 1 i 2 i k are obtained in two stages by eq 9 then the specified dimensionless rainfall mass curve i e rainfall pattern can be obtained by linear transformation using eq 5 9 i i exp y i 1 r 1 r i k exp y r 1 i k i i i i 1 1 r 1 r i k exp y r repeating the above five steps m specified rainfall patterns can be simulated a detailed numerical example can be found in appendix a 2 1 5 synthesis of rainfall events for one rainfall event the characteristics including rainfall depth rainfall duration and rainfall pattern are unique moreover rainfall depth and rainfall duration affect the occurrence probability of the temporal rainfall pattern therefore a contingency table huff 1967 is used to count the occurrence numbers of each representative rainfall pattern at the given range of historical rainfall duration and rainfall depth and furthermore the occurrence likelihood for each rainfall pattern can be computed by a multinomial model as eq 10 10 p i n i i l n i i 1 2 l in which l is the total number of rainfall patterns n i is the occurrence number of i th historical rainfall pattern under the given range of rainfall duration and rainfall depth and p i is the occurrence probability of i th rainfall pattern after a sample of the joint rainfall duration and rainfall depth for m rainfall events is generated by the constructed copula as section 2 1 1 the corresponding rainfall patterns for the sample can be simultaneously generated with eq 10 to generate the rainfall events the dimensionless rainfall patterns should be merged with rainfall depths and rainfall durations there are two steps 1 to multiply the dimensionless time by the rainfall duration d and multiply the dimensionless accumulated rainfall by the total depth d d to get the accumulated rainfall depth d t at time t t δ t 2 δ t k δ t δ t d 24 k using the inverse of eq 5 2 to calculate the rainfall depth of each hour sub daily during the rainfall duration and sum the daily rainfall depth in this section rainfall intensity is assumed to be uniform in each δ t which means a linear interpolation of the rainfall mass curves in step 1 through the above steps the simulated daily rainfall events are finally obtained 2 2 stochastic rainfall events generation at ungauged sites 2 2 1 hydrological regionalization generally there is a logical assumption that the rainfall characteristics of stations in the same hydrological region are similar lin and wu 2007 for ungauged sites their synthetic daily rainfall events can be generated based on the statistical characteristics of rainfall events of gauged stations in the same hydrological region therefore the identification of hydrological homogeneous regions is the most important work that needed to be done first in this study the stations geographic information annual rainfall distribution and inter annual variation of rainfall lin and chen 2006 are studied to determine which stations in zhejiang province belong to the same hydrological region the input variables considered include longitude m latitude m elevation m average monthly rainfall mm average annual rainfall mm and standard deviation of annual rainfall mm for each station in total 17 variables of each station 12 of them are average monthly rainfall are used to conduct the regionalization analysis the self organizing map method som kohonen 1982 is employed in this study to perform the hydrological regionalization the som method one of the artificial neural network methodologies anns is a feed forward and unsupervised neural network and can project high dimensional data sets that might have complex relationships to a low dimensional and easily understandable feature map the detailed information about som is readily available in the literature kohonen 2001 lin and wu 2007 xu et al 2016 in the som method the 17 variables of each station are regarded as 17 input neurons in the input layer and each input neuron is assigned a synaptic weight to connect with one output neuron in the output layer then through the unsupervised learning som method all stations are assigned to neurons in the output layer the stations that are assigned to the same or nearby neurons are considered in the same region finally the stations in the same hydrological region are determined 2 2 2 assigning method after the identification of hydrological homogeneous regions the region to which the ungauged site belongs can be determined based on the som based clustering results an assigning method lin and wu 2007 is employed and the ungauged site is assigned to the cluster which has the largest probability as determined in eq 11 by the inverse distance weighting idw method the longitude latitude and elevation of sites are taken as the major factors affecting the similarity between sites which are respectively expressed as symbols x y z the symbol g is the total number of gauged stations and nc is the cluster number p i x y z is the probability that the ungauged site x y z belongs to the i th cluster w j is the weight of the j th gauged station and f j is the membership of the j th gauged station belonging to the i th cluster x j y j z j are respectively the longitude latitude and elevation of the j th gauged station and d j is the distance between the ungauged site and the j th gauged station these variables are formalized below in eq 11 p i x y z j 1 g w j f j f j 1 if j i 0 if j i w j d j 2 j 1 g d j 2 d j x x j 2 y y j 2 z z j 2 11 j 1 2 g i 1 nc 2 2 3 rainfall events at ungauged sites according to the new model the characteristics of rainfall events and the corresponding rainfall patterns at gauged sites are separately simulated so are ungauged sites the two simulation processes are as follows 1 after assigning the ungauged site to a certain cluster assume the i th cluster the rainfall characteristics of the ungauged site for a given frequency can be interpolated from the h gauged stations in the i th cluster using idw shown in eq 12 since the fitted copula function for rainfall characteristics at each gauged station is not the same the characteristics of each station should be generated individually subsequently rainfall characteristics of a chosen frequency at all h gauged stations can be obtained by cubic spline interpolation 12 v p j 1 h w j v jp w j d j 2 j 1 h d j 2 d j x x j 2 y y j 2 z z j 2 where v p are the characteristics e g rainfall depth rainfall duration of the ungauged site at the given frequency p v jp are the characteristics of the j th station in the i th cluster at the given frequency p w j is the inverse distance weight of the ungauged site to the j th gauged station 2 the simulated dimensionless rainfall patterns of the ungauged site are directly transferred from the gauged station which is nearest to the ungauged site the reason is that the corresponding rainfall pattern for each gauged station at a given range of rainfall depth and rainfall duration is unlikely to be the same averaging rainfall patterns of the control gauged stations by inverse distance interpolation would therefore over smooths the patterns to avoid this we directly used the simulated parameters of rainfall patterns from the nearest gauged station to simulate rainfall patterns of the ungauged station based on the simulated characteristics of rainfall events at the ungauged site in the first step the corresponding rainfall pattern can be generated in the second step finally a full set of stochastic rainfall events for the ungauged site can be obtained as described in section 2 1 5 3 study area and data zhejiang province 118 01 e 123 10 e 27 02 n 31 11 n with a total land area of 103 800 km2 is situated at the southern wing of the yangtze river delta which is the strategic coastal area of southeast china its seaboard is adjacent to east china sea fig 3 the terrain in this province is complex and it declines from mountains in the southwestern part through hills in the middle to low alluvial plains in northeastern part this province has abundant rainfall with its temperature high in summer and dry and cold in winter which is mainly controlled by a subtropical monsoon climate the annual average rainfall varies from 980 mm to 2000 mm and the annual average temperature is 15 c 18 c tian et al 2012 there are eight major rivers from south to north lying ao river feiyun river ou river jiao river yong river qiantang river tiaoxi river and beijing hangzhou canal among which qiantang river is the largest river and ou river is the second fig 4 due to its special geographical condition this province has often suffered from serious flooding mainly caused by typhoon or plum rain which severely threaten people s life and property security the plum rain often referred to the east asian rainy season is caused by precipitation along a persistent stationary front known as the mei yu front for nearly two months during the late spring and early summer between eastern russia china taiwan korea and japan the wet season ends during the summer when the subtropical ridge becomes strong enough to push this front north of the region https en wikipedia org wiki east asian rainy season the typhoon is a strong cyclonic vortex in the tropical ocean and this province is one of the high frequency area of typhoons the above reasons lead to the uniqueness of the rainfall temporal structure in this region therefore studying the mechanism of rainfall generation and simulating rainfall series in zhejiang province is meaningful and important daily rainfall data used in this study are from 40 meteorological stations table 2 in which 39 stations are used for model analysis and the meteorological station jiande is deliberately kept as an ungauged site for validation of the stochastic model the rainfall data of these stations are mostly available from 34 to 61 years except beiji 12 years dongtou 14 years linhai 14 years ruian 7 years and shengshan station 14 years as this study primarily concentrates on the analysis of rainfall events described in section 4 2 and the number of rainfall events extracted is often enough at each station the stations with fewer data are also included 4 results 4 1 som clustering results through the hydrological regionalization by the som method the 39 meteorological stations in zhejiang province were eventually clustered into seven regions which are shown in fig 4 the hydrological regionalization result of zhejiang province by the som method was consistent with that derived by zhejiang provincial hydrology bureau 2005 affected by the occurrence time of monsoon and the activities of typhoon the annual distribution of rainfall was extremely uneven to analyze the different features of rainfall among regions one representative station was selected for each cluster region see fig 5 according to its geographical location data length and rainfall distribution fig 5 presents the annual distribution of rainfall for selected gauges in the seven representative regions which can be further classified into three major types plum rain control region typhoon rain control region and typhoon plum rain compatible region according to the generation causes of rainfall 1 plum rain control region cluster 1 the representative station quzhou fig 5 a this region was mainly located at the upper and middle reaches of qiantang and ou river only one peak value emerged in the annual rainfall distribution and wet spell occurred in the months from march to june or april to july with the largest monthly rainfall occurring in may or june the average largest monthly rainfall accounted for 15 20 percent of the annual rainfall and the largest rainfall of continuous four months could reach 50 60 percent 2 typhoon rain control region cluster 6 7 the representative stations qingtian hongjia fig 5 f and g this region covered the downstream of yong and cao e river the middle and lower reaches of jiao ou feiyun and ao river the annual rainfall distribution had two peak values of which the first one usually occurred in the months from march to june that was mainly affected by spring rain or plum rain and the second one occurred in august and september that was primarily formed by typhoon generally for the peak months i e the months which peaks occur in the monthly rainfall of the first peak can occupy 16 of the annual rainfall and the second is around 11 the average largest rainfall of continuous four months was about 50 of the annual rainfall which usually occurs in june to september 3 typhoon plum rain compatible region cluster 2 3 4 5 respectively the representative stations are dongyang pinghu tianmushan kuocangshan fig 5 b e this region mainly included the lower reaches of qiantang river the upper reaches of jiao river and xiaoxi basin of ou river etc the pattern of annual rainfall distribution was synthesized by that of plum rain and typhoon rain the nearer the cluster is adjacent to east china sea the greater the cluster is influenced by typhoon meanwhile the amount of rainfall in august and september became larger with the increasing effects of typhoon moreover the smaller the distance from the cluster to inland was the larger the effect of plum rain was and rainfall was primarily distributed in march to june with the maximum rainfall in june in addition it can be seen from fig 5 that the magnitude of rainfall in each month decreased from southwest to northeast where the impact of typhoon became greater the reason may be that rainfall intensity of typhoon is large but its duration is very short while plum rain can last a long time to induce heavy rainfall chiang et al 2009 due to the exceptional altitudes of kuocangshan and tianmushan stations 1383 1 m and 1505 9 m respectively that are much higher than those of other stations ranging from 0 to 500 8 m kuocangshan and tianmushan were individually the sole stations in cluster 6 and custer 7 and the quantity of rainfall was relatively large cluster 6 was more affected by typhoon rain than plum rain while cluster 7 was the opposite 4 2 analysis of rainfall events at gauged stations 4 2 1 number of extracted rainfall events according to the definition of rainfall event in section 2 1 all rainfall events were extracted for each station in the province table 3 shows the extracted number of rainfall events at each station as there are so many stations here only one representative station is used as an example i e dongyang station whose monthly average rainfall is also plotted in fig 5 b to demonstrate the statistical characteristics of its rainfall events which also applies to the subsequent results and the corresponding results at the other six representative stations can be found in appendix b during the period 1962 2011 there are in total 2671 rainfall events at dongyang station table 4 the number of rainfall events in spring 32 2 and summer 25 1 were observed clearly to be higher than that in autumn 20 1 and winter 22 6 which was in agreement with the annual rainfall distribution of dongyang since light and moderate rain events were also included in the extracted rainfall events the number of rainfall events occurring in each month was large and there was no significant difference in general annual random occurrence numbers of hydrological events are thought to be independent and that can be described by a poisson process zorzetto et al 2016 therefore to check whether it can model the annual occurrence of rainfall events the poisson distribution was tested by using the fisher dispersion index d i as eq 13 cunnane 1979 13 d i i 1 n n i n 2 n n 1 var n e n in which n is the number of years n i denotes the occurrence number of hydrological events in the i th year n is the average value of n i the index d i follows a χ 2 distribution and its degree of freedom is n 1 when the p value associated with d i is greater than the significance level commonly 5 or 1 the poisson distribution is accepted through testing the annual occurrence number of rainfall events of the 39 meteorological stations in zhejiang province we found that the p values range from 0 89 0 99 and are all larger than the significance level 5 so the annual occurrence numbers of rainfall events in all stations follow the poisson distribution which is used to stochastically simulate the annual number of rainfall events the p value of dongyang station is shown in table 4 4 2 2 correlations among inter event time rainfall duration and rainfall depth kendall rank correlation coefficient and pearson correlation coefficient were both computed to highlight pairwise relationships among inter event time rainfall duration and rainfall depth for all stations in zhejiang province of which the latter is often applied to measure the linear correlation of two variables and the former is employed to measure the monotonicity and dependence relationship of two variables and can be used directly in copula functions in table 5 it can be seen that there existed moderately or strongly positive correlations between rainfall depth and rainfall duration at all stations in terms of pearson and kendall coefficients no correlation r 0 0 2 weak correlation r 0 2 0 5 moderate correlation r 0 5 0 8 strong correlation r 0 8 1 0 and perfect correlation r 1 0 eberly 2007 this means that rainfall depth has a simple linear relationship with rainfall duration table 5 also demonstrates that inter event time had no or a very weakly correlated relationship with rainfall duration or rainfall depth limiting the meaningful correlation to the two latter variables the correlation between rainfall duration and rainfall depth in the plum rain control region was higher than that in the typhoon rain control region 4 2 3 2d copula selection for simulating rainfall duration and rainfall depth in consideration that a significant correlation was only observed between rainfall duration and rainfall depth a two dimensional 2d copula was used to construct their joint distribution the marginal distributions utilized to verify which rainfall duration and depth were subject to include pearson type iii distribution pe3 lognormal distribution with three parameters ln3 generalized logistic distribution glo generalized pareto distribution gpa and generalized extreme value distribution gev subsequently an l moment ratio diagram was drawn which is a widely used approach to identify a parent distribution among many distributions vogel and fennessey 1993 the l moment ratio diagram of rainfall depth of 39 stations that were closely distributed in fig 6 a indicated that rainfall depth was mostly possible to follow gpa or ln3 similarly fig 6 b shows that rainfall duration was more likely to follow gpa or pe3 with the purpose of determining the ultimate distributions of rainfall duration and depth here the kolmogorov smirnov test was applied and the best fit distribution was chosen with the largest p value it can be found that the p values of gpa followed by rainfall depth at all stations were larger than that of ln3 while for rainfall duration 82 of stations had larger p values of pe3 than that of gpa hence rainfall depth followed gpa distribution and rainfall duration followed pe3 distribution five copulas namely gaussian student s t clayton frank and gumbel in table 1 were constructed and tested to select the best copula with the minimum aic and ols values the parameters of each copula were estimated by kendall rank correlation coefficients table 6 illustrates that student s t copula gave the lowest aic and ols values and was chosen as the best matching copula for rainfall duration and rainfall depth at dongyang station fig 7 shows the corresponding empirical and theoretical joint probability distribution for rainfall duration and rainfall depth which also demonstrated that the student s t copula fitted very well the student s t copula was also the optimal copula to simulate the joint distribution of rainfall duration and rainfall depth for 84 of the other stations in zhejiang province 4 2 4 classification and optimization of rainfall patterns after the k means clustering analysis the average dimensionless mass curve of each rainfall pattern under the 5 6 and 7 groups at dongyang station is respectively shown in fig 8 a c there are several common types of rainfall patterns uniform type u delayed type d central peaked type c and advanced type a the uniform type means that rainfall intensity keeps relatively constant throughout the rainfall period the delayed type denotes that relatively high rainfall intensity occurs in the late part of the rainfall event whereas the advanced type has the opposite situation for the central peaked type its high rainfall intensity occurs in the middle and rainfall intensity tapers off towards the early and late part of the rainfall event comparing these three classification results the differences are that the central peaked type was not included in the 5 group classification but the central peaked type in the 6 group classification was split into two central peaked types that were included in the 7 group classification in the following the xb clustering validation index was computed to determine the suitable number of rainfall patterns for dongyang station six was determined as the optimal number of rainfall patterns at the same time the 6 group classification just had the sufficient and effective types of rainfall patterns and therefore six patterns were considered as the proper number for dongyang station the representative number of rainfall patterns at all stations in zhejiang province using the same method is listed in table 7 from the table it can be seen that six was the optimal number of representative rainfall patterns for almost all the stations about 74 and seven was for 23 of the stations and five was for only one station when each station was analyzed individually the number determined by the xb index could be regarded as the optimal number of rainfall patterns for each gauged station however when it came to regional frequency analysis i e expanding generation of rainfall events at gauged stations to an ungauged site the number of rainfall patterns in one region needed to be kept the same in view of the above results the number 6 was eventually selected as the number of representative rainfall patterns for regional frequency analysis for all the seven regions because 6 is the most seen number in table 7 4 2 5 stochastic generation of one specified rainfall pattern according to the statistical parameters i e mean sd skewness and kurtosis of the dimensionless rainfall hyetograph i i i 1 2 k and the corresponding log ratio variables y i i 1 2 k i 3 for each rainfall pattern an arbitrary size sample of dimensionless rainfall mass curves can be generated fig 9 displays 100 simulated dimensionless rainfall mass curves of the six specified rainfall patterns for dongyang station the simulated and observed average dimensionless rainfall mass curves for the six rainfall patterns are compared in fig 10 which showed that they fitted very well figs 9 and 10 demonstrate that the simulation results can well preserve the statistical characteristics of each rainfall pattern and the simulation method was valid here the size 100 of the sample is only taken as an example 4 2 6 synthesizing rainfall events first 100 simulated rainfall depths and rainfall durations were generated using student s t copula with the parameters estimated in section 4 2 3 for dongyang station the occurrence probability of each rainfall pattern was calculated according to eq 10 based on its occurrence number at different ranges of rainfall depth and rainfall duration shown in table 8 based on the results in table 8 the random selection of a particular rainfall pattern can be realized for a simulated rainfall event with specified rainfall depth and rainfall duration from table 8 it can be seen that for the six rainfall patterns rainfall events with rainfall depth less than 50 mm and rainfall duration less than 3 days occurred most frequently and rainfall pattern u had the largest occurrence frequency 0 62 which was far greater than that of the other five patterns for other rainfall events the occurrence frequency was small and there was not much difference for the six rainfall patterns next the 100 simulated rainfall depths were merged with the corresponding 100 rainfall patterns which are presented in fig 11 the top curve was obviously higher than the lower curves of which rainfall depth was 182 0 mm with the non exceedance probability 0 99 the rainfall depth of the second top curve was 117 1 mm and its non exceedance probability was 0 98 finally 100 simulated daily rainfall events were formed by merging the accumulated rainfall depth with the corresponding rainfall duration here only one rainfall event of each rainfall pattern was randomly taken for just illustrating the results fig 12 fig 12 a displays the rainfall event of pattern a2 with 0 74 non exceedance probability of rainfall depth 31 16 mm and 0 69 non exceedance probability of rainfall duration 2 36 days fig 12 b is the rainfall event with 114 48 mm rainfall depth non exceedance probability 0 98 and 7 36 days rainfall duration non exceedance probability 0 99 for pattern a1 for pattern c the rainfall event is displayed in fig 12 c of which rainfall depth was 57 93 mm and rainfall duration was 3 36 days the non exceedance probabilities were respectively 0 90 and 0 84 similarly the rainfall events for pattern u pattern d1 and pattern d2 are shown from left to right in fig 12 d f their rainfall depths were respectively 69 91 mm 168 73 mm and 38 51 mm with the corresponding non exceedance probabilities 0 93 0 99 and 0 80 and their rainfall durations were in sequence 1 97 days 7 38 days and 5 23 days with the non exceedance probabilities 0 60 0 98 and 0 95 the results above revealed that this stochastic generation model of daily rainfall events can be applied successfully at gauged stations 4 3 stochastic generation of daily rainfall events at ungauged sites to validate the stochastic model jiande station shown in fig 3 was used as an ungauged site whose data had not been used in the analysis above through the assigning method shown in section 2 2 2 jiande station was assigned to the 3rd cluster region which included chunan quzhou kaihua suichang jiangshan and longquan gauged stations the inverse distance weights from the above six stations to jiande station were separately 0 68 0 13 0 06 0 06 0 05 and 0 02 calculated by eq 12 with which the joint rainfall depth and rainfall duration for jiande station can be interpolated from the gauged stations also the kendall rank correlation coefficients between rainfall duration and rainfall depth of the six stations were very close to each other 0 58 0 60 in the 3rd cluster region and the kendall rank correlation coefficient at jiande station is interpolated to be 0 59 a scatter diagram of the simulated and observed pairs rainfall duration and rainfall depth is shown in fig 13 a which is the most natural way of examining the suitability of a copula model genest and favre 2007 the simulated joint distribution of rainfall duration and rainfall depth was nearly superimposed with the observed pairs reflecting that the observed and simulated values fitted very well the kendall correlation coefficient of the observed pairs was 0 58 which was almost the same as that of the simulated pairs fig 13 b and c show the exceedance probability distributions of rainfall duration and rainfall depth for simulation and observation and they further indicated that the performance of simulating rainfall characteristics was very good even for the ungauged site to validate whether transplanting characteristics of rainfall patterns from gauged stations to ungauged sites is reasonable the simulated and observed rainfall patterns were compared at jiande station as chunan station was nearest to jiande station its simulation results of rainfall patterns were treated as the simulated results of jiande station the average dimensionless rainfall mass curve of each pattern extracted from the observed rainfall events matched that of the simulated ones very well see fig 14 on the basis of the above analysis the entire model built in this study for simulating daily rainfall events is robust and can be expanded to ungauged sites 4 4 comparison with other stochastic rainfall models 4 4 1 comparison with wu s event based model the comparison between the new model developed in this study and the event based rainfall model by wu et al 2006a was conducted from the following three aspects 1 model structure and operating efficiency 2 statistics of rainfall event characteristics and dependence relationship between rainfall depth and rainfall duration 3 performance in simulating extreme rainfall events fig 15 shows the different parts in the model structure between the new model and wu s model from which it can be seen that the main difference of these two models existed in the simulation segment of rainfall characteristics i e rainfall depth and rainfall duration rainfall characteristics are usually multivariate correlated non normal variates that are difficult to be directly generated by monte carlo method and these variates firstly need to be transformed to standard normal random variates through normal transformation and orthogonal transformation the process of which is complex and tedious therefore copula functions were introduced to simplify the simulation process which is simple and flexible for constructing the joint distribution of multivariable data and can well preserve their dependence structure moreover the internal clustering index was introduced to objectively determine the representative rainfall patterns through the above improvements the model structure was simplified and running efficiency of the new model was improved compared to wu s model table 9 shows the simulated statistics of rainfall event characteristics by wu s model and the new model which were both compared with the observed values 50 years of rainfall events were stochastically generated using these two models and the simulation process was repeated 1000 times from table 9 it can be found that the correlation relationship between rainfall depth and rainfall duration simulated by the new model 0 70 was the same with the observed 0 70 and it was better than the simulation results by wu s model 0 62 from the perspective of statistics i e mean standard deviation sd skewness and kurtosis the simulated statistics by the new model was much closer to the observed values than those by wu s model and the standard deviation associated with 1000 simulations for each statistic was smaller than that of wu s model the above results further demonstrated that the new model is more robust in simulating the statistics of rainfall events the performance of these two models in simulating extreme rainfall events is shown in fig 16 it is observed that the mean depth frequency curve lies relatively higher above the median curve indicating these two models generated positively skewed estimation of rainfall quantile especially for larger return periods under 1 day and 3 day rainfall durations wu s model performed slightly better than the new model although both models underestimated the observed data however for 2 day 4 day 5 day and 6 day rainfall durations the mean and median of simulated curves of the new model were much closer to the observed curve than those of wu s model and the uncertainty ranges were smaller for longer rainfall durations the performance of the new model was better since these models were not designed for extreme rainfall events they did not perform very well in simulating extreme rainfall events to some extent however on the whole the proposed new stochastic rainfall model can improve the generation efficiency of rainfall events and simulate rainfall characteristics more accurately 4 4 2 comparison with two markov chain models apart from comparison with an event based rainfall model the new model was also compared with two state of art rainfall sequence models namely weagets weather generator école de technologie supérieure chen et al 2010 and mrs multisite rainfall simulator mehrotra et al 2015 mehrotra and sharma 2007a both of which are based on markov chains for rainfall occurrence and consider low frequency variability e g the year to year dependence of daily rainfall the details of these two models can be found in the relevant references and the mrs model was used as a single site rainfall model here the simulation length at dongyang station was set as 30 years from the year 1964 to 1993 and the maximum number of simulations was 100 rainfall events were extracted from the simulation results of both models according to the definition of rainfall events in section 2 1 and were then compared with the observed rainfall events and the simulated results of the new model due to lack of space only the average values were used here to evaluate these models the comparison results of statistics of rainfall characteristics are shown in table 10 from table 10 it is clear that the new model and mrs model performed much better in simulating rainfall characteristics than that of weagets model and the new model preserved the mean standard deviation of rainfall depth and rainfall duration and their correlations better than the mrs model the new model often overestimated the skewness and kurtosis of rainfall depth and duration while mrs often underestimated these values in simulating rainfall characteristics the new model performed the best the mrs model is the second and the weagets model is the worst as for the extreme rainfall simulated by the new model weagets and mrs model the results all demonstrated large relative bias when compared with the observed extreme rainfall under different rainfall durations which could be expected because all these models were not designed for extreme rainfall events on the whole the mrs model performed the worst in comparison with other two models under almost all rainfall durations particularly for larger return periods the new model and weagets model performed almost the same and both could preserve extreme rainfall satisfactorily relative bias 35 under different rainfall durations through comparing with wu s event based rainfall model and two markov based rainfall models the new model is regarded to be able to reproduce the observed characteristics of rainfall events very well and has advantages in simulating extreme rainfall events 5 conclusions the study presented a new single site stochastic model of daily rainfall events the main advantage of which is that the internal temporal structures of rainfall events and the simple but effective copula functions for preserving the dependence structure of rainfall characteristics were comprehensively incorporated the main steps of the new model include 1 to generate multi year rainfall events by poisson distribution 2 to rapidly simulate rainfall characteristics through their joint distribution constructed by copula functions 3 to capture the corresponding rainfall temporal patterns by their occurrence frequency which were associated with rainfall depth and duration temporal patterns of rainfall events are required in hydrosystem engineering design and analysis but they are usually neglected by most existing rainfall models to objectively reflect the natural variability of internal temporal structures of rainfall events we adopted clustering analysis to classify dimensionless rainfall mass curves into different rainfall patterns and then introduced the internal clustering validation index to determine the representative rainfall patterns in the study area through applying the new model in zhejiang province s seven different hydrological regions that include 39 gauged stations the results showed that the new model can properly simulate both the dependent rainfall duration and depth and the rainfall patterns at all stations which fully demonstrated that this new model is capable of stochastically simulating rainfall events to augment the length of rainfall data for gauged stations in addition based on the interpolated rainfall characteristics from gauged stations within the same hydrological region and the transplanted rainfall patterns from the nearest gauged station this model was also successfully extended to an ungauged site for simulating its rainfall events indicating this new stochastic model can also be used to provide artificial rainfall records for ungauged sites which is of great use for engineering design at ungauged sites moreover compared with wu s event based rainfall model and two other markov based rainfall sequences models i e weagets and mrs the new model further showed advantages in simulating rainfall characteristics and extreme rainfall since the new model was not designed for extreme rainfall events it does not exhibit strong ability in simulating extreme rainfall events however this problem can be solved by modifying the definition of rainfall events another potential application for this model is that it can be used for simulating finer scale e g hourly rainfall events that mainly depend on the time scale of input rainfall data palynchuk and guo 2008 used a similar stochastic procedure to simulate hourly rainstorm events in which rainfall events were specially confined to rainstorm events according to the rainfall characteristics of canada the proposed procedure is sufficiently generic and capable of simulating rainfall events at hourly resolution the proposed model can be also extended to simulate the new extreme rainfall events under climate change the extension would involve modifying the historical data set by applying projected change fields to rainfall characteristics e g semenov and barrow 2002 fadhel et al 2017 or introducing the dependence structure between rainfall characteristics and covariates e g time temperature or atmospheric circulation index e g wasko and sharma 2015 panthou et al 2014 and then using

7052,this study presents a new approach for complex networks based analysis of temporal streamflow dynamics the novelty comes in the form of using nonlinear dynamic concepts to construct the temporal streamflow network the approach involves three steps first the single variable streamflow time series is represented in a multi dimensional phase space using delay embedding i e phase space reconstruction next this reconstructed phase space is treated as a network with the reconstructed vectors instead of the streamflow values themselves serving as the nodes and the connections between them serving as the links finally the strength of each node in the network is determined using a distance metric the approach is employed independently to monthly streamflow time series observed over a period of 53 years january 1950 december 2002 from each of 639 stations in the contiguous united states for each time series different delay time values for phase space reconstruction are considered and the optimum embedding dimension is determined using the false nearest neighbor fnn method the results indicate the usefulness of the phase space reconstruction based network construction for examining the temporal connections in streamflow the distribution of the strengths of nodes for any streamflow network is used to identify the type of the underlying network the average node strength of each of the 639 streamflow networks are also interpreted 1 to identify similarities and differences between the stations 2 to explain the role of catchment and flow properties drainage area elevation and flow mean on network strength and 3 to assess the influence of time i e month of the year on network strength keywords streamflow temporal dynamics complex networks network construction phase space reconstruction node strength 1 introduction streamflow modeling is one of the central problems in hydrology and is key to proper planning and management of our water resources environment and ecosystems however it is also extremely challenging since streamflow arises as a result of complex and nonlinear interactions between climate inputs and landscape characteristics at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales over the last century an enormous amount of research has been dedicated to streamflow modeling resulting in numerous approaches and models the existing approaches can be categorized according to their underlying scientific concepts and mathematical techniques into deterministic and stochastic linear and nonlinear parametric and non parametric and many others see salas et al 1995 and sivakumar and berndtsson 2010 for comprehensive accounts from the perspective of time series methods regardless of the approach at the heart of streamflow and hydrologic modeling is the idea of connections whether in space or in time or in space time see özger et al 2013 tongal et al 2013 mishra and coulibaly 2014 and cui and singh 2015 for some recent studies in the context of connections network theory or graph theory offer useful ideas a network is a set of points nodes connected by a set of lines links in particular recent discoveries under the umbrella of the science of complex networks e g watts and strogatz 1998 barabási and albert 1999 girvan and newman 2002 provide new avenues for studying complex and dynamically evolving systems applications of the concepts of complex networks for studying streamflow dynamics are gaining momentum e g sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 halverson and fleming 2015 braga et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 fang et al 2017 han et al 2018 see also rinaldo et al 2006 zaliapin et al 2010 scarsoglio et al 2013 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2015 jha and sivakumar 2017 konapala and mishra 2017 and naufan et al 2018 among others for complex networks based studies in hydrology more broadly such studies have examined the spatial or temporal or spatio temporal connections in streamflow and other hydrologic processes using a variety of complex networks based methods including degree centrality clustering coefficient degree distribution horizontal visibility graph shortest path length and community structure a basic step in the application of complex networks based methods is the construction of the network i e nodes and links studies employing the complex networks based methods for streamflow and other hydrologic data have essentially used such data in their original form for network construction for instance in examining the spatial connections in streamflow between different stations e g sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 halverson and fleming 2015 each station is considered as a node and all the possible connections between the stations as the links the actual connections are identified using some criterion e g spatial correlation in streamflow values between stations in examining the temporal connections in streamflow at a station e g braga et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 each timestep e g daily is considered as a node and all the possible connections between the timesteps as the links the actual connections are identified using some criterion e g geometric height in streamflow values between timesteps although this type of network construction is useful it provides only a one dimensional view the network construction considers connections in streamflow at one station timestep with only one other station timestep this is clearly inadequate to represent the streamflow dynamics since streamflow dynamic evolution often possesses patterns across multiple stations timesteps what is required therefore is a multi dimensional view where more than two stations timesteps can be considered to construct the network this provides the motivation for the present study in the context of multi dimensional view for network construction ideas developed in the area of nonlinear dynamic and chaos theories are very useful in particular the phase space reconstruction concept e g packard et

light of this the present study explores the utility of phase space reconstruction in the complex networks based analysis of streamflow the study focuses only on temporal dynamics instead of treating each streamflow data as a node in the network each point vector in the multi dimensional reconstructed phase space obtained using the delay embedding theorem of takens 1981 is treated as a node with this network construction the strength of each node and of the entire network is determined using a distance measure e g euclidean distance between any two nodes the approach is applied independently to monthly streamflow time series observed over a period of 53 years january 1950 december 2002 from each of 639 stations in the contiguous united states for any given station the distribution of the strength of nodes is used to recognize the type of network associated with that station the node strengths for the different stations are also used to identify the similarities and differences among the 639 streamflow stations the coupled phase space reconstruction complex networks methodology proposed herein to examine the temporal streamflow dynamics has a particular advantage over either of the methods when applied independently for instance the phase space reconstruction presents the trajectory of the evolution of a system through representation of a single variable time series in a multi dimensional phase space the trajectory of the phase space is useful to obtain information on the general evolution of the time series which can then be used for other purposes e g identification of system behavior prediction classification however the trajectory does not offer any specific information regarding the importance or significance or dominance of each and every timestep value in the time series i e node the complex networks based methods on the other hand essentially deal with the connections between the timesteps values in the time series in a node link perspective the timesteps are the nodes and the connections between them are the links this way the complex networks based methods are useful to identify the importance of each node through for example identification of the number of links for each node however in the general sense of using the time series as it is these methods offer only a one dimensional view of the time series for network construction rather than a multi dimensional view the coupled phase space reconstruction complex networks methodology overcomes the limitations of both these methods it first offers a multi dimensional view of the time series through phase space reconstruction and then provides useful information on the importance of each node of the time series i e reconstructed vector the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the network concept its construction using phase space reconstruction and calculation of node strength section 3 provides some details of the study area and the streamflow data considered for analysis section 4 presents the analysis results and their discussion section 5 draws some conclusions 2 network concept construction and strength a network or a graph is a set of points that are connected together by a set of lines the points are called as vertices or nodes and the lines are called as edges or links the existence non existence of links in a network is identified based on a measure that represents the strength of the links e g distance or correlation between the nodes for instance node pairs that have strengths exceeding below a certain threshold value may be assigned links with this construction of the streamflow network to represent the temporal dynamics and the strength properties of the network are described next the procedure follows three steps 1 multi dimensional phase space reconstruction using a single variable time series 2 network construction based on phase space reconstruction and 3 calculation of strength of nodes and hence the network let us assume a streamflow time series xi where i 1 2 n as shown in fig 1 a with n 6 and the objective is to identify the temporal connections using network analysis a common procedure to construct the streamflow network is to treat each value of xi as a node in the network and identifying the links between them as shown in fig 1 b in a purely one dimensional sense here we adopt a new method for network construction in a multi dimensional sense we use the concept of phase space reconstruction e g packard et al 1980 where a multi dimensional phase space is reconstructed using only a single variable time series through delay embedding e g takens 1981 the phase space is a very useful concept for representing the evolution of dynamic systems it is essentially a coordinate diagram with the coordinates representing the variables necessary to completely describe the state of a system at any moment the evolution of any given system and its history from any known initial state is represented by the trajectories of the phase space diagram the region of attraction of the points gives important qualitative information on the degree of complexity of the underlying dynamics given a single variable streamflow time series xi where i 1 2 n a multi dimensional phase space can be reconstructed according to takens embedding theorem takens 1981 as follows 1 y j x j x j τ x j 2 τ x j m 1 τ δ t where j 1 2 n m 1 τ δt m is the dimension of the vector y j embedding dimension and τ is an appropriate delay time taken to be some suitable integer multiple of the sampling time δt with the time series in fig 1 a the reconstruction of the phase space in two dimensions m 2 with a delay time of 1 τ 1 is shown in fig 1 c with a total of five vectors points y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 and y 5 each of these points is considered as a node in the network i e there is a total of five nodes with each node having possible links with the rest of the nodes fig 1 d shows all the possible links in this network of five nodes with this phase space reconstruction for a given m the distances e g the euclidean distances between any two node pairs i and j and denoted as dij can be calculated once the distances dij are obtained the strength of the node i can be calculated as follows 2 s i 1 1 n d i 1 i j n d d ij where nd is the total number of node distances fig 1 e shows the strength of each node in the above network while fig 1 f shows the distribution of the node strength i e the number of nodes with the same strength 3 study area and data to examine the temporal dynamics of streamflow using the coupled nonlinear dynamics complex networks approach in the present study monthly streamflow data from each of 639 stations across the contiguous united states are studied fig 2 shows the locations of these 639 stations the streamflow data are collected from the us geological survey usgs database for surface water http nwis waterdata usgs gov nwis sw and specifically from the hydro climatic data network hcdn the hcdn was originally developed by slack and landwehr 1992 and subsequently updated at various times the hcdn is a sub set of all united states geological survey usgs streamflow gaging stations see lins 2012 and kiang et al 2013 for additional details the hcdn stream gage stations have been screened to eliminate sites where human activities influence the natural flow of the waterway as of now the hcdn database provides streamflow data of 743 stations until the year 2009 but the period and length of the data for these stations also vary details of the hcdn data are available in lins 2012 see also http water usgs gov osw hcdn 2009 a number of studies have examined the hcdn streamflow data set or a sub set for various purposes and using different methodologies e g slack and landwehr 1992 kahya and dracup 1993 sivakumar 2003 tootle and piechota 2006 sivakumar and singh 2012 kiang et al 2013 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 vignesh et al 2015 among such studies the ones by sivakumar 2003 sivakumar and singh 2012 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 and vignesh et al 2015 are particularly relevant to the present study for their focus on the application of nonlinear dynamic concepts including phase space reconstruction to study temporal dynamics or complex networks to study spatial connections these studies have generally analyzed monthly average streamflow data that were observed before the year 2003 to be consistent with these studies in the period of streamflow data analyzed including for the purpose of selecting the proper embedding dimension for phase space reconstruction network construction in the present study and for possible interpretations and comparisons in other studies monthly streamflow data observed over a period of only 53 years january 1950 december 2002 i e calendar year from each of the above 639 streamflow stations are considered for instance the proper embedding dimensions for phase space reconstruction of streamflow data from these 639 stations are identified based on the study by vignesh et al 2015 while it would indeed be desirable to consider even a longer period of data including the latest available data from more number of stations the data considered in this study are sufficient especially in the context of methodology development as is the purpose in this study 4 analysis and results 4 1 analysis the procedure described in section 2 is now employed independently to each of the above 639 monthly streamflow time series from the contiguous united states to examine the strengths of nodes in each of the 639 streamflow networks and hence of each network the analysis is performed on normalized streamflow time series the phase space reconstruction of the streamflow time series and hence the network construction are performed as follows as the selection of the delay time τ can influence the phase space reconstruction of the streamflow time series and hence the outcomes of their strength analysis five different delay time values are considered three of these are chosen to represent monthly τ 1 seasonal τ 3 and annual τ 12 separation of elements in the phase space reconstruction the remaining two are obtained using the autocorrelation function acf method holzfuss and mayer kress 1986 and the average mutual information ami method fraser and swinney 1986 and are used to represent optimum separation in linear and nonlinear contexts respectively therefore for each of the 639 streamflow time series the phase space is reconstructed first using each of the five delay time values with embedding dimensions m from 1 to 20 after this reconstruction the optimum embedding dimension for each case of the delay time values is chosen by employing the false nearest neighbor fnn method kennel et al 1992 and the networks are constructed additional details on the delay time values including those from the acf and ami methods and the fnn dimension estimates for the 639 streamflow time series are presented in vignesh et al 2015 and therefore are not reported here the fnn dimension results obtained by vignesh et al 2015 are used for further analysis in the present study for presentation and discussion here we focus on only one particular case of phase space reconstruction i e use of ami delay time value and the corresponding fnn dimension the reason for using the case of the ami delay time value for presentation and discussion here is that the ami method measures the general dependence i e both linear and nonlinear between successive values of the time series and thus is more appropriate for phase space reconstruction fraser and swinney 1986 and fnn dimension estimation of streamflow time series the acf method on the other hand measures just the linear dependence and hence may not always yield an appropriate reconstruction and fnn dimension estimation for streamflow time series the fnn dimension estimates made by vignesh et al 2015 do not show significant differences between the cases of acf based delay times and the ami based delay times however the results also reveal that the fnn dimension estimates obtained using the ami delay times are slightly better than those obtained using the acf delay times as the former are better able to reflect the variability in streamflow even between nearby stations for the purpose of illustration of the strength analysis we present the results for only three of the 639 streamflow time series 1 station 01073000 oyster river near durham new hampshire nh 2 station 06846500 beaver at cedar bluffs kansas ks and 3 station 11063500 lone pine c near keenbrook california ca these three stations are chosen in such a way that they represent different regions northeast mid west and southwest respectively and streamflow variability trends at least from a preliminary visual inspection of the time series see fig 2 for their locations and figs 3 5 a for their streamflow time series original non normalized time series the streamflow time series reveal that 1 station 01073000 exhibits flow variations over the entire period with a clear annual cycle throughout 2 station 06846500 shows a significant reduction in flow in the latter periods when compared to the earlier periods and 3 station 11063500 shows no specific trends in terms of flow evolution but significant peaks in flow appear at certain times table 1 presents some other relevant information for these three time series including the ami delay times and fnn dimensions for phase space reconstruction as well as the mean minimum and maximum flows as table 1 indicates delay times of 4 7 and 13 and embedding dimensions of 6 5 and 4 are used for phase space reconstruction of the above three time series respectively 4 2 network strength figs 3 5 present the results of the strength analysis of streamflow time series from the above three stations respectively each of figs 3 5 include the following a monthly streamflow time series original non normalized b phase space reconstruction of original non normalized time series in two dimensions i e m 2 with τ 1 c strengths of all the available nodes for normalized time series and d frequency distribution of node strength i e number of nodes with the same strengths overall the three streamflow time series as explained above and correspondingly the phase space reconstruction node strengths and strength distribution show distinct behaviors some specific observations from the results are as follows 1 the phase spaces for the three streamflow time series show some kind of an attractor however the extent of the spread of the trajectories in the phase space does not seem to indicate a very low dimensional system which is also reflected by the fnn dimensions the one obtained for station 01073000 fig 3 b is clearly better when compared to the other two for further interpretation of phase space diagram especially on their usefulness to interpret the complexity of streamflow dynamics see sivakumar et al 2007 and sivakumar and singh 2012 among others 2 the strengths of nodes for the three time series show distinct behaviors somewhat similar to that of the streamflow variability as follows station 01073000 exhibits variations in strength over all nodes with a somewhat noticeable cycle throughout station 06846500 shows high variations for the earlier nodes and relatively lower variations for the latter nodes and station 11063500 shows no specific trend in strength variations but some significant variations appear for certain nodes especially the latter ones nevertheless the strengths do not exactly follow the trend of the streamflow time series with clear differences observed between the variability of the time series and the node strength the average node strength for the three stations are 1 811 7 531 and 6 548 respectively see table 1 for additional details 3 the distribution of strengths for the three streamflow time series show distinct and interesting behavior the strength distribution for station 01073000 fig 3 d seems to reveal a left skewed distribution but a gaussian like distribution cannot be eliminated altogether the strength distribution for station 06846500 fig 4 d is totally different and is more like a j shaped distribution with the highest count i e over 70 observed only for the highest strength value i e 9 417 and with a few other higher counts for some other higher strengths the strength distribution for station 11063500 fig 5 d shows a behavior that seems to lie between the above two with a j shaped distribution more likely however unlike the strength distribution for station 06846500 several very high values of strengths i e over 8 or so have very high counts i e over 10 or 20 a look at the three strength distributions in terms of ranges of strength values rather than just the individual strength values also reveals somewhat similar results although some differences are clearly observed fig 6 presents the average node strength i e network strength for each of the 639 streamflow time series considered in this study the results reveal the following observations among others 1 stations in the mid west and southwest have generally high network strengths 2 stations in the northwest and northeast have generally low network strengths 3 many regions have a good mix of high strengths and low strengths and 4 some distant stations have similar strengths these observations suggest that while geographic proximity may result in similarties in catchment behavior streamflow variability in certain regions it need not always be the case for all regions indeed as seen in fig 6 a number of catchments that are geographically closer exhibit significantly different network strengths e g the catchments in the utah colorado region tennessee alabama south carolina north carolina region and the florida georgia region while a number of catchments that are geographically distant e g catchments in the extreme northwest and extreme northeast exhibit similar strengths therefore the network strengths can be useful not only for understanding temporal connections in streamflow at a given station but also for classification of streamflow stations in a large region 4 3 network strength versus catchment flow properties with the network strength for each of the 639 streamflow series available now it would be interesting to see how the network strengths compare with catchment characteristics and streamflow statistics to this end fig 7 compares the network strength with drainage area fig 7 a elevation fig 7 b and flow mean fig 7 c the results generally reveal that low and also medium network strengths are observed for all ranges i e low medium and high of drainage area elevation and flow mean for instance a network strength of as low as 2 is observed for very small and very large catchments less than 20 km2 as well as more than 30 000 km2 very low and very high elevations less than 5 m as well as almost 2500 m and very low and very high flow means less than 2 m3 s and more than 300 m3 s however the situation is different for very high strengths about 10 or higher while very high strengths are observed only for a very few catchments most of them also happen to have relatively smaller drainage areas lower elevations and lower flow means as can be seen on the right half of fig 7 a c table 2 for instance presents the details of five such stations corresponding to the five points on the far right region in fig 7 a c these stations are situated in different states regions across the united states station 01646000 is in virginia in the eastern us stations 06860000 and 06873000 are in kansas in the mid western us station 08408500 is in new mexico in the southwest us and station 10258500 is in california in the far southwest us therefore the networks based strength analysis with phase space reconstruction for network construction seems to be a suitable tool to represent the temporal dynamics of streamflow with due consideration to catchment characteristics and flow statistical properties 4 4 influence of time month on network strength since the purpose in this study is to examine the temporal connections in streamflow using node network strength it would be useful to investigate the importance of each timestep in the time series one way to do this is by simply looking at the strengths of all nodes that have similar structures in the present study since the nodes correspond to vectors in the reconstructed phase space identification of vectors of similar structure should offer a reliable means since monthly streamflow series are studied here this task becomes simpler for any given station considering that successive months form the first elements of the successive vectors in the phase space reconstruction m is fixed i e the fnn dimension for example and that the successive elements of each vector are separated by a delay time τ is fixed i e the ami delay time for example there is a total of 12 different types of nodes corresponding to the 12 months that form the first element of the reconstructed vector therefore the average of strengths of all the nodes in each vector structure should indicate the strength of the given month fig 8 a c for instance presents the network strengths of the 12 individual months for the three stations specifically discussed in section 4 2 station 01073000 in new hampshire station 06846500 in kansas and station 11063500 in california the results offer some interesting observations 1 for station 01073000 there is a clear cyclic pattern in the network strength every four months january february may june september and october have relatively higher strengths over 2 0 while the remaining six months have relatively lower strengths less than 1 7 2 for station 06846500 there is no clear pattern at all but the strengths for different months also do not seem to change much in a relative sense varying between 7 2 and 7 8 3 for station 11063500 there is a very clear pattern almost similar to a gaussian like behavior very low strengths are observed in the beginning and end of the year with january having the lowest strength very high strengths are observed in the middle of the year with july having the highest strength and intermediate strengths are observed during the other months these observations suggest that the networks based strength analysis with the network constructed using phase space reconstruction provides useful information about the dominance of any month or timestep on the streamflow evolution and thus explain the seasonal and other influences 5 closing remarks this study proposed a new approach for temporal streamflow analysis using complex networks by applying a nonlinear dynamic concept for construction of the streamflow network the approach first used the phase space reconstruction concept to construct the streamflow network and then used a distance metric to determine the strength of the nodes in the network the approach was employed to monthly streamflow time series observed at 639 stations in the contiguous united states the results obtained for the 639 streamflow networks offered some interesting observations for instance 1 the streamflow networks exhibit many different types of behaviors 2 similarities and differences among the 639 networks exist but geographic proximity alone does not dictate these 3 catchment characteristics and flow properties influence the strength of the network and this is especially the case for networks with high strengths and 4 certain months of the year have far more influence on network strength than others but this may also be different for different stations including the pattern of strength across time all these have important implications for streamflow modeling and prediction including in the identification of the appropriate complexity of model selection of the appropriate nearest neighbors in the time history of evolution for flow predictions e g in the nonlinear local approximation prediction method missing data estimation i e temporal data filling and others the method can also be extended to include multiple variables so that the multi dimensional phase space can be reconstructed using those multiple variables and then the network can be constructed correspondingly the outcomes of the present study clearly indicate the utility of phase space reconstruction and other nonlinear dynamic concepts for the construction of the network in the application of complex networks concepts for temporal streamflow analysis indeed there may be many different ways to couple the concepts of nonlinear dynamics with complex networks to better construct the streamflow network and study its properties for instance after constructing the streamflow network using phase space reconstruction a distance threshold can be used to better identify the existence of links in the network this has parallels to the nearest neighbor based calculations in dimension estimation methods e g correlation sum or integral in the correlation dimension method such an analysis can also lead to the identification of an optimal or critical threshold and hence an optimal network clustering

7052,this study presents a new approach for complex networks based analysis of temporal streamflow dynamics the novelty comes in the form of using nonlinear dynamic concepts to construct the temporal streamflow network the approach involves three steps first the single variable streamflow time series is represented in a multi dimensional phase space using delay embedding i e phase space reconstruction next this reconstructed phase space is treated as a network with the reconstructed vectors instead of the streamflow values themselves serving as the nodes and the connections between them serving as the links finally the strength of each node in the network is determined using a distance metric the approach is employed independently to monthly streamflow time series observed over a period of 53 years january 1950 december 2002 from each of 639 stations in the contiguous united states for each time series different delay time values for phase space reconstruction are considered and the optimum embedding dimension is determined using the false nearest neighbor fnn method the results indicate the usefulness of the phase space reconstruction based network construction for examining the temporal connections in streamflow the distribution of the strengths of nodes for any streamflow network is used to identify the type of the underlying network the average node strength of each of the 639 streamflow networks are also interpreted 1 to identify similarities and differences between the stations 2 to explain the role of catchment and flow properties drainage area elevation and flow mean on network strength and 3 to assess the influence of time i e month of the year on network strength keywords streamflow temporal dynamics complex networks network construction phase space reconstruction node strength 1 introduction streamflow modeling is one of the central problems in hydrology and is key to proper planning and management of our water resources environment and ecosystems however it is also extremely challenging since streamflow arises as a result of complex and nonlinear interactions between climate inputs and landscape characteristics at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales over the last century an enormous amount of research has been dedicated to streamflow modeling resulting in numerous approaches and models the existing approaches can be categorized according to their underlying scientific concepts and mathematical techniques into deterministic and stochastic linear and nonlinear parametric and non parametric and many others see salas et al 1995 and sivakumar and berndtsson 2010 for comprehensive accounts from the perspective of time series methods regardless of the approach at the heart of streamflow and hydrologic modeling is the idea of connections whether in space or in time or in space time see özger et al 2013 tongal et al 2013 mishra and coulibaly 2014 and cui and singh 2015 for some recent studies in the context of connections network theory or graph theory offer useful ideas a network is a set of points nodes connected by a set of lines links in particular recent discoveries under the umbrella of the science of complex networks e g watts and strogatz 1998 barabási and albert 1999 girvan and newman 2002 provide new avenues for studying complex and dynamically evolving systems applications of the concepts of complex networks for studying streamflow dynamics are gaining momentum e g sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 halverson and fleming 2015 braga et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 fang et al 2017 han et al 2018 see also rinaldo et al 2006 zaliapin et al 2010 scarsoglio et al 2013 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2015 jha and sivakumar 2017 konapala and mishra 2017 and naufan et al 2018 among others for complex networks based studies in hydrology more broadly such studies have examined the spatial or temporal or spatio temporal connections in streamflow and other hydrologic processes using a variety of complex networks based methods including degree centrality clustering coefficient degree distribution horizontal visibility graph shortest path length and community structure a basic step in the application of complex networks based methods is the construction of the network i e nodes and links studies employing the complex networks based methods for streamflow and other hydrologic data have essentially used such data in their original form for network construction for instance in examining the spatial connections in streamflow between different stations e g sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 halverson and fleming 2015 each station is considered as a node and all the possible connections between the stations as the links the actual connections are identified using some criterion e g spatial correlation in streamflow values between stations in examining the temporal connections in streamflow at a station e g braga et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 each timestep e g daily is considered as a node and all the possible connections between the timesteps as the links the actual connections are identified using some criterion e g geometric height in streamflow values between timesteps although this type of network construction is useful it provides only a one dimensional view the network construction considers connections in streamflow at one station timestep with only one other station timestep this is clearly inadequate to represent the streamflow dynamics since streamflow dynamic evolution often possesses patterns across multiple stations timesteps what is required therefore is a multi dimensional view where more than two stations timesteps can be considered to construct the network this provides the motivation for the present study in the context of multi dimensional view for network construction ideas developed in the area of nonlinear dynamic and chaos theories are very useful in particular the phase space reconstruction concept e g packard et al 1980 allows reconstruction of a multi dimensional phase space using only a single variable time series through delay embedding e g takens 1981 or other techniques applications of the phase space reconstruction concept for system dynamic representation and for subsequent purposes e g identification prediction disaggregation missing data estimation classification have been an important area of research in streamflow and other hydrologic studies over the past two decades e g jayawardena and lai 1994 liu et al 1998 elshorbagy et al 2001 islam and sivakumar 2002 regonda et al 2004 sivakumar et

light of this the present study explores the utility of phase space reconstruction in the complex networks based analysis of streamflow the study focuses only on temporal dynamics instead of treating each streamflow data as a node in the network each point vector in the multi dimensional reconstructed phase space obtained using the delay embedding theorem of takens 1981 is treated as a node with this network construction the strength of each node and of the entire network is determined using a distance measure e g euclidean distance between any two nodes the approach is applied independently to monthly streamflow time series observed over a period of 53 years january 1950 december 2002 from each of 639 stations in the contiguous united states for any given station the distribution of the strength of nodes is used to recognize the type of network associated with that station the node strengths for the different stations are also used to identify the similarities and differences among the 639 streamflow stations the coupled phase space reconstruction complex networks methodology proposed herein to examine the temporal streamflow dynamics has a particular advantage over either of the methods when applied independently for instance the phase space reconstruction presents the trajectory of the evolution of a system through representation of a single variable time series in a multi dimensional phase space the trajectory of the phase space is useful to obtain information on the general evolution of the time series which can then be used for other purposes e g identification of system behavior prediction classification however the trajectory does not offer any specific information regarding the importance or significance or dominance of each and every timestep value in the time series i e node the complex networks based methods on the other hand essentially deal with the connections between the timesteps values in the time series in a node link perspective the timesteps are the nodes and the connections between them are the links this way the complex networks based methods are useful to identify the importance of each node through for example identification of the number of links for each node however in the general sense of using the time series as it is these methods offer only a one dimensional view of the time series for network construction rather than a multi dimensional view the coupled phase space reconstruction complex networks methodology overcomes the limitations of both these methods it first offers a multi dimensional view of the time series through phase space reconstruction and then provides useful information on the importance of each node of the time series i e reconstructed vector the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the network concept its construction using phase space reconstruction and calculation of node strength section 3 provides some details of the study area and the streamflow data considered for analysis section 4 presents the analysis results and their discussion section 5 draws some conclusions 2 network concept construction and strength a network or a graph is a set of points that are connected together by a set of lines the points are called as vertices or nodes and the lines are called as edges or links the existence non existence of links in a network is identified based on a measure that represents the strength of the links e g distance or correlation between the nodes for instance node pairs that have strengths exceeding below a certain threshold value may be assigned links with this construction of the streamflow network to represent the temporal dynamics and the strength properties of the network are described next the procedure follows three steps 1 multi dimensional phase space reconstruction using a single variable time series 2 network construction based on phase space reconstruction and 3 calculation of strength of nodes and hence the network let us assume a streamflow time series xi where i 1 2 n as shown in fig 1 a with n 6 and the objective is to identify the temporal connections using network analysis a common procedure to construct the streamflow network is to treat each value of xi as a node in the network and identifying the links between them as shown in fig 1 b in a purely one dimensional sense here we adopt a new method for network construction in a multi dimensional sense we use the concept of phase space reconstruction e g packard et al 1980 where a multi dimensional phase space is reconstructed using only a single variable time series through delay embedding e g takens 1981 the phase space is a very useful concept for representing the evolution of dynamic systems it is essentially a coordinate diagram with the coordinates representing the variables necessary to completely describe the state of a system at any moment the evolution of any given system and its history from any known initial state is represented by the trajectories of the phase space diagram the region of attraction of the points gives important qualitative information on the degree of complexity of the underlying dynamics given a single variable streamflow time series xi where i 1 2 n a multi dimensional phase space can be reconstructed according to takens embedding theorem takens 1981 as follows 1 y j x j x j τ x j 2 τ x j m 1 τ δ t where j 1 2 n m 1 τ δt m is the dimension of the vector y j embedding dimension and τ is an appropriate delay time taken to be some suitable integer multiple of the sampling time δt with the time series in fig 1 a the reconstruction of the phase space in two dimensions m 2 with a delay time of 1 τ 1 is shown in fig 1 c with a total of five vectors points y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 and y 5 each of these points is considered as a node in the network i e there is a total of five nodes with each node having possible links with the rest of the nodes fig 1 d shows all the possible links in this network of five nodes with this phase space reconstruction for a given m the distances e g the euclidean distances between any two node pairs i and j and denoted as dij can be calculated once the distances dij are obtained the strength of the node i can be calculated as follows 2 s i 1 1 n d i 1 i j n d d ij where nd is the total number of node distances fig 1 e shows the strength of each node in the above network while fig 1 f shows the distribution of the node strength i e the number of nodes with the same strength 3 study area and data to examine the temporal dynamics of streamflow using the coupled nonlinear dynamics complex networks approach in the present study monthly streamflow data from each of 639 stations across the contiguous united states are studied fig 2 shows the locations of these 639 stations the streamflow data are collected from the us geological survey usgs database for surface water http nwis waterdata usgs gov nwis sw and specifically from the hydro climatic data network hcdn the hcdn was originally developed by slack and landwehr 1992 and subsequently updated at various times the hcdn is a sub set of all united states geological survey usgs streamflow gaging stations see lins 2012 and kiang et al 2013 for additional details the hcdn stream gage stations have been screened to eliminate sites where human activities influence the natural flow of the waterway as of now the hcdn database provides streamflow data of 743 stations until the year 2009 but the period and length of the data for these stations also vary details of the hcdn data are available in lins 2012 see also http water usgs gov osw hcdn 2009 a number of studies have examined the hcdn streamflow data set or a sub set for various purposes and using different methodologies e g slack and landwehr 1992 kahya and dracup 1993 sivakumar 2003 tootle and piechota 2006 sivakumar and singh 2012 kiang et al 2013 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 vignesh et al 2015 among such studies the ones by sivakumar 2003 sivakumar and singh 2012 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 and vignesh et al 2015 are particularly relevant to the present study for their focus on the application of nonlinear dynamic concepts including phase space reconstruction to study temporal dynamics or complex networks to study spatial connections these studies have generally analyzed monthly average streamflow data that were observed before the year 2003 to be consistent with these studies in the period of streamflow data analyzed including for the purpose of selecting the proper embedding dimension for phase space reconstruction network construction in the present study and for possible interpretations and comparisons in other studies monthly streamflow data observed over a period of only 53 years january 1950 december 2002 i e calendar year from each of the above 639 streamflow stations are considered for instance the proper embedding dimensions for phase space reconstruction of streamflow data from these 639 stations are identified based on the study by vignesh et al 2015 while it would indeed be desirable to consider even a longer period of data including the latest available data from more number of stations the data considered in this study are sufficient especially in the context of methodology development as is the purpose in this study 4 analysis and results 4 1 analysis the procedure described in section 2 is now employed independently to each of the above 639 monthly streamflow time series from the contiguous united states to examine the strengths of nodes in each of the 639 streamflow networks and hence of each network the analysis is performed on normalized streamflow time series the phase space reconstruction of the streamflow time series and hence the network construction are performed as follows as the selection of the delay time τ can influence the phase space reconstruction of the streamflow time series and hence the outcomes of their strength analysis five different delay time values are considered three of these are chosen to represent monthly τ 1 seasonal τ 3 and annual τ 12 separation of elements in the phase space reconstruction the remaining two are obtained using the autocorrelation function acf method holzfuss and mayer kress 1986 and the average mutual information ami method fraser and swinney 1986 and are used to represent optimum separation in linear and nonlinear contexts respectively therefore for each of the 639 streamflow time series the phase space is reconstructed first using each of the five delay time values with embedding dimensions m from 1 to 20 after this reconstruction the optimum embedding dimension for each case of the delay time values is chosen by employing the false nearest neighbor fnn method kennel et al 1992 and the networks are constructed additional details on the delay time values including those from the acf and ami methods and the fnn dimension estimates for the 639 streamflow time series are presented in vignesh et al 2015 and therefore are not reported here the fnn dimension results obtained by vignesh et al 2015 are used for further analysis in the present study for presentation and discussion here we focus on only one particular case of phase space reconstruction i e use of ami delay time value and the corresponding fnn dimension the reason for using the case of the ami delay time value for presentation and discussion here is that the ami method measures the general dependence i e both linear and nonlinear between successive values of the time series and thus is more appropriate for phase space reconstruction fraser and swinney 1986 and fnn dimension estimation of streamflow time series the acf method on the other hand measures just the linear dependence and hence may not always yield an appropriate reconstruction and fnn dimension estimation for streamflow time series the fnn dimension estimates made by vignesh et al 2015 do not show significant differences between the cases of acf based delay times and the ami based delay times however the results also reveal that the fnn dimension estimates obtained using the ami delay times are slightly better than those obtained using the acf delay times as the former are better able to reflect the variability in streamflow even between nearby stations for the purpose of illustration of the strength analysis we present the results for only three of the 639 streamflow time series 1 station 01073000 oyster river near durham new hampshire nh 2 station 06846500 beaver at cedar bluffs kansas ks and 3 station 11063500 lone pine c near keenbrook california ca these three stations are chosen in such a way that they represent different regions northeast mid west and southwest respectively and streamflow variability trends at least from a preliminary visual inspection of the time series see fig 2 for their locations and figs 3 5 a for their streamflow time series original non normalized time series the streamflow time series reveal that 1 station 01073000 exhibits flow variations over the entire period with a clear annual cycle throughout 2 station 06846500 shows a significant reduction in flow in the latter periods when compared to the earlier periods and 3 station 11063500 shows no specific trends in terms of flow evolution but significant peaks in flow appear at certain times table 1 presents some other relevant information for these three time series including the ami delay times and fnn dimensions for phase space reconstruction as well as the mean minimum and maximum flows as table 1 indicates delay times of 4 7 and 13 and embedding dimensions of 6 5 and 4 are used for phase space reconstruction of the above three time series respectively 4 2 network strength figs 3 5 present the results of the strength analysis of streamflow time series from the above three stations respectively each of figs 3 5 include the following a monthly streamflow time series original non normalized b phase space reconstruction of original non normalized time series in two dimensions i e m 2 with τ 1 c strengths of all the available nodes for normalized time series and d frequency distribution of node strength i e number of nodes with the same strengths overall the three streamflow time series as explained above and correspondingly the phase space reconstruction node strengths and strength distribution show distinct behaviors some specific observations from the results are as follows 1 the phase spaces for the three streamflow time series show some kind of an attractor however the extent of the spread of the trajectories in the phase space does not seem to indicate a very low dimensional system which is also reflected by the fnn dimensions the one obtained for station 01073000 fig 3 b is clearly better when compared to the other two for further interpretation of phase space diagram especially on their usefulness to interpret the complexity of streamflow dynamics see sivakumar et al 2007 and sivakumar and singh 2012 among others 2 the strengths of nodes for the three time series show distinct behaviors somewhat similar to that of the streamflow variability as follows station 01073000 exhibits variations in strength over all nodes with a somewhat noticeable cycle throughout station 06846500 shows high variations for the earlier nodes and relatively lower variations for the latter nodes and station 11063500 shows no specific trend in strength variations but some significant variations appear for certain nodes especially the latter ones nevertheless the strengths do not exactly follow the trend of the streamflow time series with clear differences observed between the variability of the time series and the node strength the average node strength for the three stations are 1 811 7 531 and 6 548 respectively see table 1 for additional details 3 the distribution of strengths for the three streamflow time series show distinct and interesting behavior the strength distribution for station 01073000 fig 3 d seems to reveal a left skewed distribution but a gaussian like distribution cannot be eliminated altogether the strength distribution for station 06846500 fig 4 d is totally different and is more like a j shaped distribution with the highest count i e over 70 observed only for the highest strength value i e 9 417 and with a few other higher counts for some other higher strengths the strength distribution for station 11063500 fig 5 d shows a behavior that seems to lie between the above two with a j shaped distribution more likely however unlike the strength distribution for station 06846500 several very high values of strengths i e over 8 or so have very high counts i e over 10 or 20 a look at the three strength distributions in terms of ranges of strength values rather than just the individual strength values also reveals somewhat similar results although some differences are clearly observed fig 6 presents the average node strength i e network strength for each of the 639 streamflow time series considered in this study the results reveal the following observations among others 1 stations in the mid west and southwest have generally high network strengths 2 stations in the northwest and northeast have generally low network strengths 3 many regions have a good mix of high strengths and low strengths and 4 some distant stations have similar strengths these observations suggest that while geographic proximity may result in similarties in catchment behavior streamflow variability in certain regions it need not always be the case for all regions indeed as seen in fig 6 a number of catchments that are geographically closer exhibit significantly different network strengths e g the catchments in the utah colorado region tennessee alabama south carolina north carolina region and the florida georgia region while a number of catchments that are geographically distant e g catchments in the extreme northwest and extreme northeast exhibit similar strengths therefore the network strengths can be useful not only for understanding temporal connections in streamflow at a given station but also for classification of streamflow stations in a large region 4 3 network strength versus catchment flow properties with the network strength for each of the 639 streamflow series available now it would be interesting to see how the network strengths compare with catchment characteristics and streamflow statistics to this end fig 7 compares the network strength with drainage area fig 7 a elevation fig 7 b and flow mean fig 7 c the results generally reveal that low and also medium network strengths are observed for all ranges i e low medium and high of drainage area elevation and flow mean for instance a network strength of as low as 2 is observed for very small and very large catchments less than 20 km2 as well as more than 30 000 km2 very low and very high elevations less than 5 m as well as almost 2500 m and very low and very high flow means less than 2 m3 s and more than 300 m3 s however the situation is different for very high strengths about 10 or higher while very high strengths are observed only for a very few catchments most of them also happen to have relatively smaller drainage areas lower elevations and lower flow means as can be seen on the right half of fig 7 a c table 2 for instance presents the details of five such stations corresponding to the five points on the far right region in fig 7 a c these stations are situated in different states regions across the united states station 01646000 is in virginia in the eastern us stations 06860000 and 06873000 are in kansas in the mid western us station 08408500 is in new mexico in the southwest us and station 10258500 is in california in the far southwest us therefore the networks based strength analysis with phase space reconstruction for network construction seems to be a suitable tool to represent the temporal dynamics of streamflow with due consideration to catchment characteristics and flow statistical properties 4 4 influence of time month on network strength since the purpose in this study is to examine the temporal connections in streamflow using node network strength it would be useful to investigate the importance of each timestep in the time series one way to do this is by simply looking at the strengths of all nodes that have similar structures in the present study since the nodes correspond to vectors in the reconstructed phase space identification of vectors of similar structure should offer a reliable means since monthly streamflow series are studied here this task becomes simpler for any given station considering that successive months form the first elements of the successive vectors in the phase space reconstruction m is fixed i e the fnn dimension for example and that the successive elements of each vector are separated by a delay time τ is fixed i e the ami delay time for example there is a total of 12 different types of nodes corresponding to the 12 months that form the first element of the reconstructed vector therefore the average of strengths of all the nodes in each vector structure should indicate the strength of the given month fig 8 a c for instance presents the network strengths of the 12 individual months for the three stations specifically discussed in section 4 2 station 01073000 in new hampshire station 06846500 in kansas and station 11063500 in california the results offer some interesting observations 1 for station 01073000 there is a clear cyclic pattern in the network strength every four months january february may june september and october have relatively higher strengths over 2 0 while the remaining six months have relatively lower strengths less than 1 7 2 for station 06846500 there is no clear pattern at all but the strengths for different months also do not seem to change much in a relative sense varying between 7 2 and 7 8 3 for station 11063500 there is a very clear pattern almost similar to a gaussian like behavior very low strengths are observed in the beginning and end of the year with january having the lowest strength very high strengths are observed in the middle of the year with july having the highest strength and intermediate strengths are observed during the other months these observations suggest that the networks based strength analysis with the network constructed using phase space reconstruction provides useful information about the dominance of any month or timestep on the streamflow evolution and thus explain the seasonal and other influences 5 closing remarks this study proposed a new approach for temporal streamflow analysis using complex networks by applying a nonlinear dynamic concept for construction of the streamflow network the approach first used the phase space reconstruction concept to construct the streamflow network and then used a distance metric to determine the strength of the nodes in the network the approach was employed to monthly streamflow time series observed at 639 stations in the contiguous united states the results obtained for the 639 streamflow networks offered some interesting observations for instance 1 the streamflow networks exhibit many different types of behaviors 2 similarities and differences among the 639 networks exist but geographic proximity alone does not dictate these 3 catchment characteristics and flow properties influence the strength of the network and this is especially the case for networks with high strengths and 4 certain months of the year have far more influence on network strength than others but this may also be different for different stations including the pattern of strength across time all these have important implications for streamflow modeling and prediction including in the identification of the appropriate complexity of model selection of the appropriate nearest neighbors in the time history of evolution for flow predictions e g in the nonlinear local approximation prediction method missing data estimation i e temporal data filling and others the method can also be extended to include multiple variables so that the multi dimensional phase space can be reconstructed using those multiple variables and then the network can be constructed correspondingly the outcomes of the present study clearly indicate the utility of phase space reconstruction and other nonlinear dynamic concepts for the construction of the network in the application of complex networks concepts for temporal streamflow analysis indeed there may be many different ways to couple the concepts of nonlinear dynamics with complex networks to better construct the streamflow network and study its properties for instance after constructing the streamflow network using phase space reconstruction a distance threshold can be used to better identify the existence of links in the network this has parallels to the nearest neighbor based calculations in dimension estimation methods e g correlation sum or integral in the correlation dimension method such an analysis can also lead to the identification of an optimal or critical threshold and hence an optimal network clustering research in this direction is currently underway and we hope to be able to report the details in the near future acknowledgments this study was supported by the australian research council arc future

using the agricultural water to protect the river ecological basic flow which will have a significant impact on food safety this study employs a calculation model to determine agricultural economic

different strategies that have been used to protect the ecological basic flow of the baoji section of the weihe river which is the largest tributary of the yellow river this quantitative model used in this study was based on information generated from considering the following 1 according to the protection target of the ecological basic flow of rivers the water shortage of the ecological basic flow

loss by improving the level of food safety guarantee our results indicate that the agricultural water sector cannot guarantee the river ecological basic flow as such we consider the feasibility of using other methods to protect the ecological basic flow of rivers 2 methodology in this study a model to calculate the agricultural economic losses caused by methods introduced to protect the ecological basic flow of rivers and guarantee food safety has been developed fig 1 within this framework firstly a balance analysis was used to determine the water shortage of the river ecological basic flow secondly we should calculate the residual water after the food safety guarantee and determine whether the river ecological basic flow can be guaranteed finally using the residual water after the food safety guarantee to protect the river ecological basic flow and analyze the agricultural water shortage caused by the river ecological basic flow protection and the agricultural economic loss caused by the river ecological basic flow protection was calculated 2 1 the water shortages of the ecological basic flow of rivers the amount of water coming from the river can be divided into three parts the residual water after the water diversion wr the agricultural water consumption wa and the water consumption in other departments wo if the residual water cannot satisfy the river ecological basic flow that is wr wg then water shortage of the river ecological basic flow is calculated by the following expressions 1 w l w g w r w g w q w a w o where w l is the water shortage of the ecological basic flow of rivers hundred million m3 wg is the ecological basic flow of rivers hundred million m3 wr is the residual water after water diversion from different departments hundred million m3 wq is the runoff from river hundred million m3 wa is the agricultural water consumption hundred million m3 wo is the water consumption of other departments hundred million m3 if the residual water can meet the ecological basic flow of rivers then the water shortage of the ecological basic flow of rivers is 0 hundred million m3 2 2 use of surplus agricultural water to maintain river ecological basic flow 2 2 1 crop water requirement coefficients crop water requirement coefficients can have two definitions 1 the ratio of evapotranspiration of water to dry matter quality which corresponds to the amount of water required for production of a harvest over the whole growth period 2 the ratio of crop evapotranspiration and evaporation of water during the whole growth period based on these definitions eq 2 can be used to calculate the crop water requirement coefficient 2 k c et e o o r k c et m where kc is the crop water requirement coefficient m3 kg et is the crop water volume requirement over the whole crop growth period m3 e0 is the water surface evaporation m3 and m is the amount of harvest or dry matter production kg 2 2 2 surplus water available from the agricultural sector once food safety guarantee levels have been met then the agricultural sector can provide a set volume of surplus water to maintain water river ecological basic flow this formula can be expressed using eq 3 3 w cg p s q a p t k c where wcg is the surplus water after the food safety guarantee m3 qa is the food safety value kg person ps is the per capita grain output in the study area kg person and pt is the total population of the study area ten thousand persons 2 3 difference between water shortage and surplus water eq 4 was used to calculate the differences between the amount of surplus agricultural water used to protect the ecological basic flow of the river and the water shortage of the ecological basic flow of the river that results 4 w d w cg w l where wd is the difference of surplus water after food safety and the water shortage of the ecological basic flow of rivers hundred million m3 2 4 agricultural economic losses caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers if wd is greater than 0 the agricultural department can be considered to be capable of completely protecting the river ecological basic flow meanwhile the agricultural water shortage is the water shortage of the river ecological basic flow with agricultural economic losses being calculated using eq 5 5 y l q l p c w l k c p c where yl is the agricultural economic loss caused by ecological river basic flow protection one hundred million yuan ql is the loss in grain yield caused by the river ecological river basic flow protection kg and pc is the current price of food crops yuan kg if wd is greater than zero then the protection rate of the river ecological basic flow is 100 however if wd is less than zero then the agricultural department cannot protect or cannot fully protect the river ecological basic flow without potentially damaging agricultural output agricultural economic losses can calculated under two different conditions 1 if the agricultural department cannot protect the river ecological basic flow then the agricultural water shortage is zero and the economic loss will be zero 2 if the agricultural department cannot fully protect the river ecological basic flow then the agricultural water shortage is the surplus water after food safety guarantee and eq 6 can be used to calculate agricultural economic losses 6 y l q l p c w cg k c p c eq 7 can then be used to calculate the protection rate of the river ecological basic flow 7 p g w cg w l 100 where pg is the protection rate of the river ecological basic flow 3 case analysis 3 1 study area a case study was used to calculate agricultural losses caused by diverting agricultural water to protect the ecological basic flow of rivers in the baoji section of the weihe river fig 2 the guanzhong section of the weihe river is located in the middle of the shaanxi province with the east longitude and north latitude values for the guanzhong section being 106 30 110 30 and 33 30 35 40 respectively the baoji section of the weihe river linjiacun weijiabao has a total length of 65 km and is located in the middle and lower reaches of the river fig 2 the baojixia irrigation district occurs in the western guanzhong region latitude and longitude levels of 34 35 and 107 9 covering an area of 2355 km2 two diversion hubs linjiacun and weijiabao hydrological stations are present in the baojixia yuanshang and baojixia yuanxia irrigation districts respectively the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district mainly covers jintai xianyang baoji qishan yangling wugong qianxian jingyang qindou wei cheng and gaoling districts fig 2 this irrigation district obtains water from the linjiacun hydrological station covering an irrigation 128 thousand hm2 that receives an average annual water diversion of 6 08 hundred million m3 3 2 analysis of existing water shortage problems in the study area climate change and human activities including construction of water diversions projects has resulted in the amount of water present in the baoji section of the river gradually decreasing over time hou et al 2011 xiao et al 2012 ma 2013 see fig 3 the average water diversion processed by the linjiacun hydrological station in the baojixia irrigation district is large accounting for a monthly flow of around 5 14 hundred million m3 values in the non flood season from october to may are particularly high with the linjiacun station causing significant ecological problems which can lead to breaks in river flow and deterioration of the local environment lin and li 2010 the conflict between using water for agricultural and ecological applications is particularly problematic in the baoji section of the weihe river previous studies on river ecological basic flow in the baoji section of the weihe river have found that basic flow guarantee values should be 6 m3 s yang 2008 xu et al 2016 8 m3 s kou 2005 and 10 m3 s however water runoff at the linjiacun three station often does not meet these levels for example river ecological basic flow only met the necessary flow levels on 19 out of 274 days from october to may of 2009 2010 fig 4 corresponding to a protection rate of only 6 93 over that period of time indeed in 2002 2003 water runoff only supplied minimum river ecological basic flow rates for one day clearly indicating a complete loss in the basic ecological functions of these rivers 4 agricultural economic losses caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of the weihe river 4 1 water shortages of the river ecological flow protection river ecological basic flow protection values are 6 8 yang 2008 kou 2005 and 10 m3 s according to the comprehensive treatment planning of the weihe river in shaanxi province china the water shortage of the river ecological basic flow during the non flood seasons from october to may from 2000 to 2015 is computed by using formula 1 as shown in table 1 4 2 surplus water available after food safety levels had been guaranteed 4 2 1 crop water requirement coefficients the non flood season in the baoji section of the weihe river occurs from october to may with winter wheat considered to be the major crop in the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district therefore we choose winter wheat as the typical crop according to the surface water evaporation during the entire growth period of winter wheat in baojixia yuanshang irrigation district and its corresponding water requirement we used formula 2 compute the crop water requirement coefficient as shown in table 2 the national food safety index also known as the food safety evaluation criteria fao proposes three basic standards that should be adhered to 1 national food self sufficiency must be 95 i e on food production security 2 grain stocks per capita should reach 400 kg 3 grain reserves stocks of at least 18 of yearly grain consumption should be available with grain values of 14 denoting a state of emergency for food supplies the agricultural economics research institute of the academy of agricultural sciences has argued that annual grain consumption of 250 400 kg per person is a basic necessity worldwide whilst consumption of 400 600 kg of grain represents a much higher standard of living however other scholars have argued that grain consumption per person does not necessarily have to reach 400 kg since this value is currently much higher level than current annual consumption levels in china the baojixia yuanshang district is a large irrigation district within china which should be capable of producing 400 kg of grain per person with a 95 value currently being considered as the official local target for self sufficiency however by the end of 2012 this production value had dropped to 90 which is primarily due to the import of soybeans as an alternative feedstock that had resulted in a reduction in grain production across china given this information we suggest a value of 85 90 of 400 kg as an acceptable level for grain consumption in china which corresponds to 350 kg per person which is similar to previous threshold values reported by he and yang 2008 according to the food production per capita and the winter wheat crop water requirement coefficients surplus water available above food safety guarantee in the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district were then calculated using eq 3 see table 3 for details data on the water shortage of the river ecological basic flow and surplus water available after food safety guarantee levels had been satisfied were then used as terms for eq 4 this enabled us to calculate the difference between surplus water and water shortages and determine the degree of protection afforded to the ecological basic flow of rivers see table 4 data in table 4 shows that the agricultural department could not fully protect the river ecological basic flow in the years 2001 2003 and 2007 with table 5 detailing results for the protection rate of the river ecological basic flow 4 3 agricultural economic losses caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers table 6 shows the agricultural economic losses caused by the river ecological basic flow values that were calculated using eqs 6 and 7 5 results and discussion 5 1 analysis of agricultural economic losses agricultural economic losses in the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers vary with time with a generally downwards trend over time being observed over the past 15 years the dispersion coefficient for agricultural economic loss was 0 45 indicating that the rate of decrease of agricultural economic losses has been relatively stable runoff levels are used for calculating agricultural economic losses caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers annual or seasonal changes in runoff play a decisive role in determining agricultural economic losses with larger runoff values generally resulting in smaller agricultural economic losses fig 5 shows the runoff and ecological economic losses from the past 15 years with runoff values lowest in 2000 2010 and 2011 which resulted in relatively large agricultural economic losses whilst a large runoff in 2006 resulted in minimal agricultural economic losses annual runoff values reached 8 15 and 8 67 m3 s in 2001 and 2013 with differences in agricultural economic losses caused by the need to employ different levels of water protection being quite large runoff levels in october 2001 were relatively large runoff levels over the next few months was not sufficient to afford adequate protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers 6 m3 s fig 6 5 2 agricultural economic losses caused by increases in food safety levels the level of food safety guarantee required has a great influence on agricultural economic losses incurred with the increases in food safety values resulting in agricultural economic losses becoming smaller in certain years the agricultural department could not protect the river ecological basic flow adequately for a value of 400 kg person however choosing a food safety guarantee level at 350 kg person would mean that the necessary river ecological basic flow values could be successfully met however using a food safety guarantee of 400 kg person means that the agricultural department could not meet its necessary targets in 7 out of the 14 years examined namely 2001 2003 2007 2011 and 2013 2014 comparison of the data in table 4 and 7 reveal that use of a food safety guarantee value reaches 400 kg person meant the amount of surplus water that could be used for protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers was limited therefore differences in food safety guarantee values can have a great influence on agricultural economic losses caused by the protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers 5 3 application of water saving measures in maintaining river ecological basic flow agricultural water diversion can be divided into water that is necessary to guarantee food production and surplus water sources that can be used to supplement river water levels in some years insufficient water is available to guarantee food safety and as a consequence there is no surplus water available to protect river ecological basic flow therefore it is important that water usage is optimized to guarantee food safety particularly if surplus water can be used to protect river ecological basic flow according to the statistics the water diversion plant used at the linjiacun station is relatively old with a low canal water utilization coefficient meaning that its overall efficiency is relatively low the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district is responsible for 41 7 of the effective irrigation zone exhibiting an irrigation water utilization coefficient of only 54 in the years 2013 and 2014 the amount of water diversion in the non flood period was around 410 million m3 a pipeline system used to transport water could potentially save 0 82 1 23 billion m3 of water with spray irrigation saving 205 million m3 of water resources and micro irrigation and drip irrigation water saving a further 2 46 2 87 million m3 therefore water saving and irrigation technologies can potentially serve to reduce the amount of water taken from rivers to protect their ecological basic flow 5 4 water rights transaction and agriculture ecological compensation as the proper methods to deal with the agricultural economic loss these losses caused by protecting the river ecological basic flow in the irrigation areas should be compensated by related departments of rivers but the definition of economic compensation is not ultimate means of resolving water crises especially in regions with scarce water resources pang et al 2013 therefore we cannot simply compensate for the losses caused by the ecological basic flow of rivers and it cannot arise the enthusiasm of farmers to protect water resources and cannot promote the development of agriculture we should divide the compensation funds into two parts a simple cash compensation and creating funds for water saving measures and a simple cash compensation can simply use for compensating farmers due to the agricultural economic loss caused by the surplus water after food safety guarantee the creating funds for water saving measures can be carried out in the form of water rights transactions tradable water systems have become an important means of achieving distributive efficiency for water resources zhang 2007 wheeler et al 2010 also water rights transaction can induce water users in the district to conserve water and to utilize water resources for economic and significant ecological benefits and further promote the ecological and economic development simultaneously therefore a functional combination of agricultural ecological compensation and water rights transaction is an effective way to solve the contradiction between ecological basic flow protection and development of the agricultural sector 5 5 comparative analysis of unilateral agricultural economic losses protection of the river ecological basic flow in the baoji section of the weihe river is difficult because the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district has been taking large volumes of water from the river for a long period of time reducing the amount of diverted water is advantageous in protecting the river ecological basic flow however reductions in water volumes would seriously affect the grain output in the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district very few studies on agricultural economic losses caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers have been published with this study showing that unilateral agricultural water losses in the baoji section of the weihe river are around 2 56 yuan m3 these values are consistent with a previous report by huang 2013 who employed fuzzy mathematical methods to calculate unilateral river ecological basic flow values for different hydrological stations in the guanzhong section of the weihe river see table 8 6 conclusions this study has used a model for calculating agricultural economic losses caused by the river ecological basic flow protection in the baoji section of the weihe river the main conclusions were obtained agricultural economic losses were negatively correlated with annual water runoff with food safety levels of 400 kg per person meaning that the agricultural water sector could not adequately protect the river ecological basic flow further water saving measures could potentially be effectively to further protect the ecological basic flow of rivers based on a functional combination of agricultural ecological compensation and water rights transactions that would promote effective water saving measures and a fair allocation of valuable water resources acknowledgments this study was funded by the national science foundation

is the current price of food crops yuan kg if wd is greater than zero then the protection rate of the river ecological basic flow is 100 however if wd is less than zero then the agricultural department cannot protect or cannot fully protect the river ecological basic flow without potentially damaging agricultural output agricultural economic losses can calculated under two different conditions 1 if the agricultural department cannot protect the river ecological basic flow then the agricultural water shortage is zero and the economic loss will be zero 2 if the agricultural department cannot fully protect the river ecological basic flow then the agricultural water shortage is the surplus water after food safety guarantee and eq 6 can be used to calculate agricultural economic losses 6 y l q l p c w cg k c p c eq 7 can then be used to calculate the protection rate of the river ecological basic flow 7 p g w cg w l 100 where pg is the protection rate of the river ecological basic flow 3 case analysis 3 1 study area a case study was used to calculate agricultural losses caused by diverting agricultural water to protect the ecological basic flow of rivers in the baoji section of the weihe river fig 2 the guanzhong section of the weihe river is located in the middle of the shaanxi province with the east longitude and north latitude values for the guanzhong section being 106 30 110 30 and 33 30 35 40 respectively the baoji section of the weihe river linjiacun weijiabao has a total length of 65 km and is located in the middle and lower reaches of the river fig 2 the baojixia irrigation district occurs in the western guanzhong region latitude and longitude levels of 34 35 and 107 9 covering an area of 2355 km2 two diversion hubs linjiacun and weijiabao hydrological stations are present in the baojixia yuanshang and baojixia yuanxia irrigation districts respectively the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district mainly covers jintai xianyang baoji qishan yangling wugong qianxian jingyang qindou wei cheng and gaoling districts fig 2 this irrigation district obtains water from the linjiacun hydrological station covering an irrigation 128 thousand hm2 that receives an average annual water diversion of 6 08 hundred million m3 3 2 analysis of existing water shortage problems in the study area climate change and human activities including construction of water diversions projects has resulted in the amount of water present in the baoji section of the river gradually decreasing over time hou et al 2011 xiao et al 2012 ma 2013 see fig 3 the average water diversion processed by the linjiacun hydrological station in the baojixia irrigation district is large accounting for a monthly flow of around 5 14 hundred million m3 values in the non flood season from october to may are particularly high with the linjiacun station causing significant ecological problems which can lead to breaks in river flow and deterioration of the local environment lin and li 2010 the conflict between using water for agricultural and ecological applications is particularly problematic in the baoji section of the weihe river previous studies on river ecological basic flow in the baoji section of the weihe river have found that basic flow guarantee values should be 6 m3 s yang 2008 xu et al 2016 8 m3 s kou 2005 and 10 m3 s however water runoff at the linjiacun three station often does not meet these levels for example river ecological basic flow only met the necessary flow levels on 19 out of 274 days from october to may of 2009 2010 fig 4 corresponding to a protection rate of only 6 93 over that period of time indeed in 2002 2003 water runoff only supplied minimum river ecological basic flow rates for one day clearly indicating a complete loss in the basic ecological functions of these rivers 4 agricultural economic losses caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of the weihe river 4 1 water shortages of the river ecological flow protection river ecological basic flow protection values are 6 8 yang 2008 kou 2005 and 10 m3 s according to the comprehensive treatment planning of the weihe river in shaanxi province china the water shortage of the river ecological basic flow during the non flood seasons from october to may from 2000 to 2015 is computed by using formula 1 as shown in table 1 4 2 surplus water available after food safety levels had been guaranteed 4 2 1 crop water requirement coefficients the non flood season in the baoji section of the weihe river occurs from october to may with winter wheat considered to be the major crop in the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district therefore we choose winter wheat as the typical crop according to the surface water evaporation during the entire growth period of winter wheat in baojixia yuanshang irrigation district and its corresponding water requirement we used formula 2 compute the crop water requirement coefficient as shown in table 2 the national food safety index also known as the food safety evaluation criteria fao proposes three basic standards that should be adhered to 1 national food self sufficiency must be 95 i e on food production security 2 grain stocks per capita should reach 400 kg 3 grain reserves stocks of at least 18 of yearly grain consumption should be available with grain values of 14 denoting a state of emergency for food supplies the agricultural economics research institute of the academy of agricultural sciences has argued that annual grain consumption of 250 400 kg per person is a basic necessity worldwide whilst consumption of 400 600 kg of grain represents a much higher standard of living however other scholars have argued that grain consumption per person does not necessarily have to reach 400 kg since this value is currently much higher level than current annual consumption levels in china the baojixia yuanshang district is a large irrigation district within china which should be capable of producing 400 kg of grain per person with a 95 value currently being considered as the official local target for self sufficiency however by the end of 2012 this production value had dropped to 90 which is primarily due to the import of soybeans as an alternative feedstock that had resulted in a reduction in grain production across china given this information we suggest a value of 85 90 of 400 kg as an acceptable level for grain consumption in china which corresponds to 350 kg per person which is similar to previous threshold values reported by he and yang 2008 according to the food production per capita and the winter wheat crop water requirement coefficients surplus water available above food safety guarantee in the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district were then calculated using eq 3 see table 3 for details data on the water shortage of the river ecological basic flow and surplus water available after food safety guarantee levels had been satisfied were then used as terms for eq 4 this enabled us to calculate the difference between surplus water and water shortages and determine the degree of protection afforded to the ecological basic flow of rivers see table 4 data in table 4 shows that the agricultural department could not fully protect the river ecological basic flow in the years 2001 2003 and 2007 with table 5 detailing results for the protection rate of the river ecological basic flow 4 3 agricultural economic losses caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers table 6 shows the agricultural economic losses caused by the river ecological basic flow values that were calculated using eqs 6 and 7 5 results and discussion 5 1 analysis of agricultural economic losses agricultural economic losses in the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers vary with time with a generally downwards trend over time being observed over the past 15 years the dispersion coefficient for agricultural economic loss was 0 45 indicating that the rate of decrease of agricultural economic losses has been relatively stable runoff levels are used for calculating agricultural economic losses caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers annual or seasonal changes in runoff play a decisive role in determining agricultural economic losses with larger runoff values generally resulting in smaller agricultural economic losses fig 5 shows the runoff and ecological economic losses from the past 15 years with runoff values lowest in 2000 2010 and 2011 which resulted in relatively large agricultural economic losses whilst a large runoff in 2006 resulted in minimal agricultural economic losses annual runoff values reached 8 15 and 8 67 m3 s in 2001 and 2013 with differences in agricultural economic losses caused by the need to employ different levels of water protection being quite large runoff levels in october 2001 were relatively large runoff levels over the next few months was not sufficient to afford adequate protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers 6 m3 s fig 6 5 2 agricultural economic losses caused by increases in food safety levels the level of food safety guarantee required has a great influence on agricultural economic losses incurred with the increases in food safety values resulting in agricultural economic losses becoming smaller in certain years the agricultural department could not protect the river ecological basic flow adequately for a value of 400 kg person however choosing a food safety guarantee level at 350 kg person would mean that the necessary river ecological basic flow values could be successfully met however using a food safety guarantee of 400 kg person means that the agricultural department could not meet its necessary targets in 7 out of the 14 years examined namely 2001 2003 2007 2011 and 2013 2014 comparison of the data in table 4 and 7 reveal that use of a food safety guarantee value reaches 400 kg person meant the amount of surplus water that could be used for protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers was limited therefore differences in food safety guarantee values can have a great influence on agricultural economic losses caused by the protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers 5 3 application of water saving measures in maintaining river ecological basic flow agricultural water diversion can be divided into water that is necessary to guarantee food production and surplus water sources that can be used to supplement river water levels in some years insufficient water is available to guarantee food safety and as a consequence there is no surplus water available to protect river ecological basic flow therefore it is important that water usage is optimized to guarantee food safety particularly if surplus water can be used to protect river ecological basic flow according to the statistics the water diversion plant used at the linjiacun station is relatively old with a low canal water utilization coefficient meaning that its overall efficiency is relatively low the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district is responsible for 41 7 of the effective irrigation zone exhibiting an irrigation water utilization coefficient of only 54 in the years 2013 and 2014 the amount of water diversion in the non flood period was around 410 million m3 a pipeline system used to transport water could potentially save 0 82 1 23 billion m3 of water with spray irrigation saving 205 million m3 of water resources and micro irrigation and drip irrigation water saving a further 2 46 2 87 million m3 therefore water saving and irrigation technologies can potentially serve to reduce the amount of water taken from rivers to protect their ecological basic flow 5 4 water rights transaction and agriculture ecological compensation as the proper methods to deal with the agricultural economic loss these losses caused by protecting the river ecological basic flow in the irrigation areas should be compensated by related departments of rivers but the definition of economic compensation is not ultimate means of resolving water crises especially in regions with scarce water resources pang et al 2013 therefore we cannot simply compensate for the losses caused by the ecological basic flow of rivers and it cannot arise the enthusiasm of farmers to protect water resources and cannot promote the development of agriculture we should divide the compensation funds into two parts a simple cash compensation and creating funds for water saving measures and a simple cash compensation can simply use for compensating farmers due to the agricultural economic loss caused by the surplus water after food safety guarantee the creating funds for water saving measures can be carried out in the form of water rights transactions tradable water systems have become an important means of achieving distributive efficiency for water resources zhang 2007 wheeler et al 2010 also water rights transaction can induce water users in the district to conserve water and to utilize water resources for economic and significant ecological benefits and further promote the ecological and economic development simultaneously therefore a functional combination of agricultural ecological compensation and water rights transaction is an effective way to solve the contradiction between ecological basic flow protection and development of the agricultural sector 5 5 comparative analysis of unilateral agricultural economic losses protection of the river ecological basic flow in the baoji section of the weihe river is difficult because the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district has been taking large volumes of water from the river for a long period of time reducing the amount of diverted water is advantageous in protecting the river ecological basic flow however reductions in water volumes would seriously affect the grain output in the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district very few studies on agricultural economic losses caused by protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers have been published with this study showing that unilateral agricultural water losses in the baoji section of the weihe river are around 2 56 yuan m3 these values are consistent with a previous report by huang 2013 who employed fuzzy mathematical methods to calculate unilateral river ecological basic flow values for different hydrological stations in the guanzhong section of the weihe river see table 8 6 conclusions this study has used a model for calculating agricultural economic losses caused by the river ecological basic flow protection in the baoji section of the weihe river the main conclusions were obtained agricultural economic losses were negatively correlated with annual water runoff with food safety levels of 400 kg per person meaning that the agricultural water sector could not adequately protect the river ecological basic flow further water saving measures could potentially be effectively to further protect the ecological basic flow of rivers based on a functional combination of agricultural ecological compensation and water rights transactions that would promote effective water saving measures and a fair allocation of valuable water resources acknowledgments this study was funded by the national science foundation

7054,given the high cost of data acquisition in soil water problems it is becoming increasingly essential to collect the measurements as cost efficient as possible by introducing the data worth analysis framework coupled with ensemble kalman filter enkf this real world case study attempts to assess the worth of potential soil moisture observations before data collection a field experiment was implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of quantifying the effect of future data on uncertainty reduction under real circumstances in a sequential way the data worth of future observations is defined regarding soil hydraulic parameter estimation or soil moisture profile retrieval four information measures including the trace tr shannon entropy difference sd relative entropy re and degrees of freedom for signal dfs are introduced to quantify the information content the sequential data worth analysis framework is examined by a number of cases including under different irrigation intensities with different prior data existing observations that have already been collected and with data of various depths and different measurement errors we demonstrated the ability and the challenge as well of quantifying the data worth sequentially our results showed that data worth assessment regarding soil moisture profile retrieval is more difficult than that regarding parameter identification variance type and covariance type metrics have relatively loose accuracy requirement on potential observations future possible observations to be collected while mean covariance type metrics require higher accuracy the vertical covariance of soil moisture is susceptible to the effect of atmospheric boundary condition which eventually imposes a challenge on the quantification of data worth with covariance involved indices the match between the expected and reference data worth can be improved by assimilating more prior data however more prior data cannot compensate for the damage from possible model structural error due to the changed scenarios between the prior stage and the posterior or preposterior stage shallow soil moisture data generally has larger data worth than deep observations in our study but evaluating data worth with shallow data is subject to considerable uncertainty if covariance type or mean covariance type index is employed smaller measurement error does not always lead to improved data worth estimation keywords data worth soil water flow data assimilation model structural error 1 introduction the unsaturated zone is inextricably involved in many aspects of hydrology evaporation groundwater recharge soil moisture storage and soil erosion renard 1997 fetter 2000 lettau 1969 penman 1948 plentiful efforts have been made in the past decades on the development of numerical algorithms for modeling unsaturated flow celia et al 1990 freeze 1971 song et al 2014 van genuchten 1982 these algorithms usually entail characterizing the spatial distribution of soil hydraulic parameters and factors affecting flow however it is difficult to directly measure the soil hydraulic properties due to the limitations of measurement techniques and the spatial heterogeneity of parameters inverse modeling approaches and data assimilation methods have thus become popular ways to improve soil moisture estimation and derive soil parameters numerous inverse and data assimilation methods have been developed man et al 2016a b alcolea et al 2006 reichle et al 2002 reichle et al 2008 rubin et al 2010 zimmerman et al 1998 thereinto sequential data assimilation method has gained a significant amount of traction in various communities because of the capability of sequentially incorporating observations into models aanonsen et al 2009 chen and zhang 2006 oliver et al 2008 shi et al 2015 xie and zhang 2010 zhu et al 2017 hu et al 2017 in the recent decade the interest in the real time integration of measurements has been further boosted by the increasing ability of online data acquisition and the growing demand for real time prediction and management observation data from different sources has been merged including remote sensing data shi et al 2011 crow and wood 2003 montzka et al 2011 moradkhani 2008 pipunic et al 2008 and ground based measurements shuwen et al 2005 walker et al 2001 li and ren 2011 li et al 2018 it is no doubt that by incorporating more data into the model the uncertainty of modeling output can be reduced however massive observations from multiple sources would significantly increase the budget of data collection moreover the collection process of soil moisture data is subject to considerable uncertainty either for remotely sensed soil moisture data or data collected by the traditional ground method the identification of data quality or measurement error is not an easy task li et al 2009 reichle et al 2008 this can create an extra uncertainty in data assimilation system furthermore the contribution of each data is not identical when multiple data sources are assimilated together some measurements may make significant contribution to the improvement of simulation accuracy while others may be less useful to avoid the overloaded monitoring cost caused by redundant measurements it is essential to develop a framework to assess the value of infused data before data acquisition data worth sometimes called data utility data information content or data impact has been defined in several different ways it was first defined as the reduction in expected error after sampling gates and kisiel 1974 in a later study of james and freeze 1993 data worth was assessed by comparing the cost of data collection against the expected value of the risk reduction in light of modeling uncertainty statistical measures including the reduction of parameter or prediction variance relative entropy and the possible significance level of hypothesis testing can be used to quantify the data worth leube et al 2012 data worth and analogous concepts have been extensively studied in optimal monitoring network design which aims to obtain a maximum gain of information from the optimum number locations frequency and data types of measurements wu et al 2005 kollat and reed 2006 nowak et al 2010 a few data worth analysis frameworks have been proposed freeze et al 1992 used the search theory and bayesian updating to determine if additional data have worth or not in terms of risk reduction in their study vrugt et al 2002 merged the generalized sensitivity analysis the bayesian recursive estimation algorithm and the metropolis algorithm to identify the most informative measurements for model parameter estimation leube et al 2012 developed a preposterior data impact assessor within the bayesian framework to assess the expected data worth of proposed sampling design recently dai et al 2016 proposed a computationally efficient data worth analysis framework based on ensemble kalman filter and probabilistic collocation method the typical data worth framework consists of prior posterior and preposterior stages the preposterior analysis is most critical and it evaluates whether a future measurement is effective and how effective before it is taken neuman et al 2012 freeze et al 1992 james and gorelick 1994 however the simultaneous data worth analysis coupled with sequential data assimilation methods i e enkf received limited attention to date zhang et al 2005 and dai et al 2016 employed the static kalman filter or enkf to assess the data worth in a groundwater and solute transport problem man et al 2016a proposed a sequential ensemble based optimal design method to improve the performance of parameter estimation for soil water problems evaluating the data worth sequentially has three main benefits firstly the parameter and model states are updated in real time so the data impact to modeling system can be detected instantaneously secondly the sampling strategy can be dynamically adjusted to save the monitoring and analysis cost man et al 2016 thirdly data worth analysis frameworks based on sequential data assimilation methods i e enkf are strictly non intrusive and can be embedded into the forward model in a straightforward way to the best of our knowledge all previous studies are based on synthetic cases and data worth analysis in the context of dynamically evolving soil parameters and soil moisture profile has not been studied in a real world case as stated by leube et al 2012 for nonlinear problems the estimation variance and more sophisticated measures of data utility depend on the actual values of measurements which are still unknown prior to collection it will be more convincing to investigate the data worth under real world circumstances for nonlinear soil water flow one primary difficulty for practical unsaturated soil water problems is the identification of multiple parameters in the water retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity another difficulty lies in the definition of the upper boundary condition such as uncertain and uneven rainfall or irrigation which has a significant influence on shallow soil moisture content cull et al 1981 hence this study focuses on exploring the influence of a variety of uncertain soil parameters on data worth assessment three field plots in a greenhouse were thoroughly investigated soil parameters were measured by the double ring test and lab experiments a period of 65 day continuous soil moisture data under three irrigation schemes was observed we were thus able to identify the evolution of data worth under different upper boundary settings the objective of this study is not to minimize the uncertainty of soil moisture profile estimation by specifying the optimal number and location of measurements to be collected but to explore the applicability of running data worth analysis in a sequential way we attempt to answer the following questions with the aid of this field scale experiment 1 given multiple uncertain soil parameters how does the data worth regarding parameter estimation and soil moisture profile retrieval evolve respectively 2 how do prior data existing data that have already been collected observation depth and measurement error affect the data worth 3 what are the performances of different data worth indices under different irrigation schemes it is hoped that this study can provide a guidance on the design of prospective monitoring strategy for field scale unsaturated flow problems the data worth framework by dai et al 2016 is accommodated to this study besides the tracer index tr introduced by neuman et al 2012 the shannon entropy difference sd shannon 1949 relative entropy re kullback 1959 and degrees of freedom for signal dfs fisher 2003 are also introduced to implement the data worth analysis it is worthy comparing the performance of different indices in the following context section 2 presents the principles of enkf and data worth analysis frameworks and introduces four information metrics namely tr sd re and dfs thereafter section 3 presents a set of examples to demonstrate the ability of the data worth analysis framework to quantify the worth of one given monitoring scheme in terms of irrigation pattern spatial location observation error and prior data content moreover in this section the discrepancy of four information metrics is explored in section 4 conclusions and discussions are presented 2 methodology 2 1 numerical model of one dimensional unsaturated flow in this paper one dimensional soil water movement is considered the flow is described by richards equation richards 1931 1 θ h t z k h h z 1 where θ l3l 3 is the volumetric moisture content h l is the pressure head t t is the time z l is the spatial coordinate oriented positively downward k lt 1 is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in eq 1 there are three unknown quantities θ h and k the constitutive relationship between them can be characterized by the van genuchten mualem model 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 kh k s s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 h 0 k s h 0 4 m 1 1 n n 1 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where θs l3l 3 and θr l3l 3 are the saturated and residual moisture content respectively α l 1 and n dimensionless are the shape parameters of the soil water characteristic curve ks lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity se is the effective saturation in our paper we employ the ross method ross 2006 2003 which is a noniterative numerical scheme to obtain a fast solution of one dimensional richards equation the specific advantages of ross method can be found in zha et al 2013 2 2 ensemble kalman filter enkf in enkf the parameter vector of interest p are augmented with the state variable vector s into a joint state vector y p s t a collection of n 1 members of the state vector y can be written as 6 y y 1 y 2 y n 1 the relationship between observations at time step t d t obs and their true values y t true is represented as follows 7 d t obs hy t true ε t where matrix h is the observation operator which relates the state and observation vectors ɛ t represents measurement error vector which is assumed to be zero mean gaussian with covariance matrix r t as a sequential monte carlo method enkf entails two main steps forecast step and analysis step at the forecast step each state vector in y is projected from time step t 1 to time t through the forward numerical analytical model f 8 y i t f f y i t 1 a i 1 2 n 1 where superscripts f and a refer to forecast and analysis respectively superscripts i is the ensemble member index at the analysis step for any ensemble member i at a given time t the joint state vector is updated by combining model predictions and observations 9 y i t a y i t f k t d i t obs hy i t f where the kalman gain k t is defined as 10 k t c t f h t hc t f h t r t 1 where c t f is the covariance matrix of the state vector at time t which can be updated after data assimilation through 11 c t a i k t h c t f where i is a unit matrix whose dimension is nd nd and nd is the number of available measurements 2 3 data worth analysis framework coupled with enkf following the framework of neuman et al 2012 and dai et al 2016 data worth analysis of future monitoring scheme is comprised of three stages 1 at the prior stage enkf with an ensemble size of n 1 is employed to sequentially assimilate the prior data a a set of n 1 hypothetical observations are then generated with b i hy i f ε i i 1 2 n 1 it is worth noting that n 1 should be large enough to include as many as possible measurement values and assure the accuracy of estimated mean and covariance 2 at the preposterior stage for each possible data b i n 2 realizations satisfying gaussian distribution the ensemble mean is the value of b i and the variance is the measurement error variance are firstly generated enkf with an ensemble size of n 2 is again implemented to estimate the resulting mean and other statistics there are totally n 1 n 2 realizations being run predictive statistics of posterior vector y i j i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 2 i e e y i a b i and cov y i a b i are calculated by jointly conditioning on a b i then e b a e y a b e b a cov y a b and cov b a e y a b are yielded through statistics over all b i similar procedures repeat until the final time in the meantime the expected data worth in the form of quantitative indices is calculated 3 at the posterior stage the actual mean and covariance are obtained by using available real data set b in a sequential manner the real i e reference or posterior data worth and expected preposterior data worth is then compared to reveal the effectiveness of this data worth framework the whole workflow of data worth analysis framework is depicted in fig 1 the framework described above is essentially a two layer hierarchical bayesian model the first layer considers the possible variation range of potential data observations to be collected in the future and the second layer contains the uncertainty from uncertain parameters by quantifying the contained uncertainty and sometimes the resulting change of mean behavior for a nonlinear system in the first layer the expected data worth for a given observation scheme i e for given number locations frequency and data types of measurements is then determined in this study we introduce four information metrics to quantify the worth of potential observations firstly the statistics in the prior and preposterior analysis have the following theoretical relations neuman et al 2012 12 e y a e b a e y a b 13 cov y a e b a cov y a b cov b a e y a b where e y a is the prior mean of state vector y conditioning on prior data a eb a e y a b is the expectation of e y a b for the sake of simplicity e y a and e y a b are denoted by m 1 and m 2 respectively cov y a denoted as c 1 represents prior predictive uncertainty given that potential observation b is generated by conditioning on a c 1 is theoretically equal to cov y a at the preposterior stage however in fact they may differ from each other due to the sampling error caused by the finite sample size moreover e b a cov y a b is the expectation of cov y a b conditioning on a b which represents the predictive uncertainty in preposterior data worth analysis here it is denoted by c 2 at the early time of data worth analysis procedure the total uncertainty of the system mostly lies in the second layer i e cov y a e b a cov y a b while cov b a e y a b 0 with the sequential infusion of potential observations at the following time steps cov b a e y a b starts to increase in addition when calculating the reference data worth c 2 refers to cov y a b and m 2 refers to e y a b 1 trace a scalar indicator trace tr is defined by neuman et al 2012 as a measure of data worth in terms of uncertainty reduction 14 t r t r c 1 t r c 2 where tr indicates the trace sum of diagonal entries of a matrix 2 the shannon entropy difference sd between the prior and preposterior probability density functions pdfs also can be used to quantify the information content extracted from future data due to the fact that the prior and preposterior pdfs are both gaussian in enkf sd can be expressed as shannon 1949 xu 2007 15 sd ln det c 1 2 ln det c 2 2 ln det c 1 c 2 1 2 where det denotes the determinant 3 the relative entropy re known as a signal dispersion combined index provides a measure of the information content of an analysis posterior pdf with respect to background prior pdf zhang et al 2015 singh et al 2013 under the assumption that the background and the analysis pdfs are n dimensional gaussian re is defined as xu 2007 16 re j b dp 17 j b m 2 m 1 t c 1 1 m 2 m 1 2 18 dp ln det c 1 c 2 1 t r c 2 c 1 1 n 2 unlike sd and tr the relative entropy re is not additive xu 2007 the advantage of re index is the ability of measuring both the signal mean part jb and dispersion covariance part dp which may be important for nonlinear soil water system from eqs 9 16 17 and 18 it is emphasized that re not only depends on the observation operator but also depends on observation vector itself in particular the signal part jb mainly depends on the realizations of d i t obs h t y i t f for each realization of d i t obs the signal and dispersion components indicate the improvements made from the mean and covariance respectively xu et al 2009 the calculation process of jb implies the influence of actual values of measurements on data worth assessment 4 the degrees of freedom for signal dfs measures how many degrees of freedom of an observation are related to signal versus noise xu et al 2009 it characterizes the total reduction in variance or the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom of the error resulting from the addition of observations singh et al 2013 dfs can be defined as 19 dfs 2 j b where represents the expectation for a linear or linearized observation operator the definition of dfs can be transformed into 20 dfs n t r c 2 c 1 1 in essence these indices can be divided into three categories variance type tr covariance type sd and dfs eq 20 and mean covariance type re and dfs eq 19 among these indices re jb part and dfs eq 19 consider the effect of actual measurement data values on data worth while other indices merely include the influence of uncertainty variance and or covariance it is noted that the implementation of above data worth analysis framework is computationally expensive thus parallel computing is utilized to alleviate this issue efficient surrogate system can be further combined to reduce the computational burden man et al 2017 dai et al 2016 3 experiment and modeling results 3 1 field experiment a field experiment was conducted in the irrigation and drainage laboratory of wuhan university china the experimental period was between 29 february and 3 may 2016 there were totally three experimental plots selected in the greenhouse all plots were bare soil with no vegetation cover three plots were named as w1 w2 and w3 respectively each plot had a size of 3 m by 1 m as shown in fig 2 within each plot three trime trime ptco iph tubes were installed randomly in space average soil water content at multiple depth ranges 0 02 0 18 m 0 22 0 38 m 0 42 0 58 m and 0 62 0 78 m were measured the average soil water content of three tubes in each plot were regarded as the soil water content of this plot the measurement time interval was 3 4 days the amount of irrigation water for plots w1 w2 and w3 are given by fig 2 during the first 51 days the irrigation amount of three plots were the same while during the next 14 days the irrigation amount at each irrigation time in w2 was half of that in w1 and there was no irrigation in w3 in w1 and w2 the irrigation frequency doubled during the last 14 days the late stage of w2 was designed to investigate the data worth response to changed irrigation frequency while the simultaneous effect of changed irrigation frequency and amount was explored in w1 and the data worth response to no irrigation was analyzed in w3 16 groups of undisturbed soil samples and 3 groups of packed soil samples were collected to measure the soil hydraulic parameters the saturated moisture content θs was determined as 0 44 by using oven drying method the other three soil parameters θr α and n were determined by using the nonlinear isqcurvefit function in matlab their values were equal to 0 02 1 48 m 1 and 1 27 respectively in addition soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks was measured by using the double ring infiltrometer experiment at 10 random sites within the study field leading to an average value of 0 068 m d 3 2 model setup the key parameters of the numerical cases are listed in table 1 focusing on the vertical soil water flow each plot is represented by a one dimensional soil column the soil column has a height of 0 8 m and is discretized with 80 grids of uniform size the top and bottom boundaries are set as an atmospheric boundary and constant water content respectively in addition ks α and n are assumed to be unknown and lognormally distributed during data worth analysis a suite of cases table 2 is designed to serve our research purposes case c1 is set as the base case to verify the feasibility of assessing the data worth within the data worth analysis framework coupled with enkf the prior data entering into case c1 comprises of soil water content measurements taken at diverse depths i e 0 02 0 18 m 0 22 0 38 m 0 42 0 58 m and 0 62 0 78 m during the first 19 days a comparison among cases c1 c2 and c3 is designed to investigate the effect of prior data content on data worth analysis which can help us to determine the required prior information content to ensure the accuracy of data worth assessment cases c2 and c3 have 30 day and 9 day prior soil moisture data respectively differing from 19 day data in case c1 many previous studies attempted to explore the potential of using surface soil moisture data which are most readily available to retrieve soil moisture profile li et al 2010 calvet and noilhan 2000 das and mohanty 2006 and soil hydraulic properties montzka et al 2011 shi et al 2015 however in the cases where moisture content observations in the topsoil and deep soil are both available without considering technique constraints is the surface soil moisture more valuable therefore two more test cases i e c4 and c5 are designed to investigate the effect of monitoring depths on data worth analysis test cases c4 and c5 are identical to c1 except that the additional observations are made at the depths of 0 22 0 38 m and 0 42 0 58 m respectively considering that observed data is always accompanied with error it is interesting to explore the discrepancy of data worth under different levels of observation errors here we assume that the measurement errors are gaussian distributed and have a constant variance the measurement error variance of soil moisture for c1 is assumed to be 0 0005 to be compared against the values of 0 0001 and 0 001 in cases c6 and c7 respectively 3 3 results and discussions 3 3 1 validation of data worth analysis method coupled with enkf case c1 in this case 19 day prior soil moisture data is provided to generate potential soil moisture at the depth of 0 02 0 18 m fig 3 b 1 3 presents a comparison of the real observations red squares and the corresponding n 1 200 potential observation samples black dots as well as their ensemble mean black squares in all plots it is seen that the mean values of potential observation realizations show some deviations from the actual measurements with 19 day prior data with the increase of prior data the generated potential data are expected to approach to the actual observations as shown in fig 3c with 30 day prior data the unsatisfactory performance under inadequate prior data can be attributed to the following reasons 1 insufficient prior data may result in parameter estimates not close enough to the true values after data assimilation fig 4 a c plots the updated mean of ln α ln n and ln ks versus time by assimilating all soil moisture observations sequentially it is seen that within 19 day prior period the estimated parameters especially for ln ks have not reached stable values for all plots 2 the change of future scenario irrigation amount and frequency may trigger the potential model structural error wagener and gupta 2005 xu et al 2017 this is particularly obvious in plot w3 with no irrigation at the late time if one model undergoes different and contrasting scenarios the model structural error is likely to appear since model parameters updated or calibrated under one scenario have not been examined under another scenario this can be confirmed by the fluctuated parameter estimates in all plots after 50th day when the irrigation amount and frequency start to change fig 4 inaccurate description to forcing term such as evaporation or a simplified representation of real soil layer structure xu and valocchi 2016 beven 2005 crow and van loon 2005 dee 2005 mccuen 1974 may also introduce model structural error this potential error eventually increases the difficulty of accurately imitating real observations with potential data 3 3 2 parameter estimation based on the above potential and actual observations their expected and reference data worth regarding parameter estimation can be quantified in the form of tr sd re jb dp and dfs eq 20 as depicted in fig 5 only the results in plot w1 are presented on the whole the results lead to two findings 1 for variance type tr or covariance type sd dp and dfs eq 20 indicators the expected and reference data worth values match very well even though the potential observations and real data do not fit quite well we recall that such an agreeable match is achieved even if the means of the potential observations still deviate from the actual observations as shown in fig 3 2 for re or jb the expected value barely reproduces its reference counterpart this is because that mean covariance type metric further takes into account the effects of mean behavior m 2 m 1 which is barely reproducible with high accuracy due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of the soil water system yeh et al 1985 mantoglou and gelhar 1987 and the possible model structural error these results imply that a satisfactory evaluation of data worth with mean covariance type metrics places high demands on the potential observations especially the mean of potential observations for soil water problems under the real world circumstance while the variance type and covariance type metrics relatively relax the accuracy requirement to the potential observations but focus on the uncertainty level according to eq 19 and eq 20 dfs can be calculated in two ways i e the original definition similar to jb shown in fig 5d and linearized transformed definition shown in fig 5f although the linearized form of dfs leads to a better match between the expected and reference data worth it may not be applicable in soil water problems due to the inherent nonlinearity the results show that such linearization can introduce artificial distortion to data worth analysis although linearized dfs has been popularly used by previous studies fisher 2003 xu 2007 3 3 3 soil moisture profile retrieval when we evaluate the data worth of potential measurements on soil moisture profile retrieval it is requisite to consider at which resolution the soil moisture profile should be reproduced we run data worth analysis with different numbers of nodes and investigate the influence of meshing size on data worth analysis surprisingly the results show that meshing size has a very large effect on the calculated data worth in terms of sd and dp fig 6 a and b present the rmse between the expected and reference sd and dp with respect to different node spacings it is observed that the rmse for sd or dp increases drastically when the node spacing is small fig 6 c and d further compare the expected and reference covariance matrixes at the 65th day with a node spacing of 1 cm the apparent contrast between the expected and reference covariance exists for the cross covariance between the shallow and deep nodes highlighted by gray rectangle this cross covariance bias is caused by the spurious correlation due to numerical calculation further results show that the variance can be estimated relatively easily while a satisfactory cross covariance estimation is difficult which can be inferred by comparing fig 7 a and b since covariance type metrics depend on both the variance the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix and the cross correlation the non diagonal elements the results demonstrate the challenge of data worth analysis for soil moisture prediction if the covariance type index is employed there are two solutions for this issue one is to use a larger node spacing a larger node spacing seems helpful to alleviate the adverse effect of spurious correlation see fig 7a and b but at the same time it may lead to false cross covariance and variance another way is to use the localization technique to avoid the spurious cross covariance in our study only soil moisture at several representative nodes i e at the depths of 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm and 70 cm are selected to evaluate the data worth the results of data worth are given in fig 7 the expected and reference sd matches constantly well the expected and reference sd and dfs fit well during the early period but start to deteriorate at the late time meanwhile the comparison of fig 5 and fig 7 reveals an inferior data worth analysis performance for soil moisture retrieval when the covariance type index is used compared with data worth analysis for parameter estimation to understand this phenomenon the expected and reference posterior covariance matrices at the 30th and 65th day are displayed in fig 8 it is found that compared to parameter covariance the match of expected and reference soil moisture covariance deteriorates obviously at the 65th day this can explain the deteriorated match of sd or dfs over time for soil moisture retrieval one unfavorable aspect regarding data worth analysis for soil moisture retrieval is that the vertical covariance of soil moisture is susceptible to the upper boundary condition in plot w1 frequent irrigation is applied during the late period and the intensified drying and wetting processes seem difficult to be described accurately by the updated soil parameters from the prior period which consequently brings difficulty of reproducing the real cross covariance thus the future change of the atmospheric scenario should be paid enough attention not only due to the possibly introduced model structural error but also due to its vital effect on soil moisture covariance estimation 3 3 4 effect of prior data content c1 c2 and c3 fig 9 a f compares the data worth among cases c3 c1 and c2 with 9 day 19 day and 30 day prior data respectively with respect to parameter identification to avoid repetition only the results of tr sd and re representing variance type covariance type and mean covariance type index respectively in plots w1 and w2 are shown overall the expected and reference data worth has a better match as more prior data are assimilated especially for tr and sd this is in line with the fact that actual observations are more readily captured with potential observation realizations as prior data increases as depicted in fig 3 it is also seen from fig 9 a c or fig 9 d f that in comparison to mean covariance type indicator re the fitness between the expected and reference variance type and covariance type indicators tr and sd are less sensitive to prior data different responses of re to prior data are observed in plots w1 and w2 more prior data leads to the improved estimation of re in plot w2 while increasing the prior period from 19 days to 30 days unfortunately worsens the data worth match after the 50th day in plot w1 considering that w1 was applied with more intensive irrigation after the 50th day it is found that more prior data does not always lead to better data worth estimation fig 9 c in plot w1 the abnormal pattern of re at the late time is possibly caused by more intensified wetting drying cycle of moisture content than in plot w2 which eventually increases the difficulty of obtaining reasonable parameters to represent the real soil thus on one side data worth assessment regarding parameter identification can be improved by assimilating more prior data xue et al 2014 if tr and sd are used on the other side the deteriorated performance of re in plot w1 reminds us that poor fitting of mean covariance type index due to imperfect parameter estimates may hardly be compensated by assimilating more prior data we note that model structural error and imperfect parameter estimate actually appear simultaneously since parameters are forced to compensate for the bias between observation and simulation if sequential data assimilation is employed similar conclusions can be drawn for soil moisture profile retrieval fig 9 g presents the sd in plot w2 as suggested by comparing fig 9 e and fig 9 g some interesting phenomena can be found for parameter identification 19 day prior data is adequate to guarantee the estimation accuracy of sd nevertheless the accuracy of sd regarding soil moisture prediction is satisfactory only when the prior data period reaches 30 days such a difference again indicates that more prior information is required to assess data worth for soil moisture profile characterization compared with soil parameter identification 3 3 5 effect of monitoring location c1 c4 and c5 since shallow soil moisture is more sensitive to the atmospheric boundary and shows larger temporal variation than deep soil moisture in our field experiment it is expected that shallow soil moisture is subject to higher uncertainty and hence observations at shallow depths generate larger data worth tr and sd as demonstrated in fig 10 a b d and e assimilating deep soil moisture brings reduced data worth regardless of parameter identification or soil moisture profile retrieval this result is consistent with the finding of dai et al 2016 which claimed that an effective observation strategy is to acquire new data at a location where the prior predictive uncertainty is large however the response of relative entropy to different depths of soil moisture is rather complicated especially at the late time when the irrigation frequency was intensified in plot w2 a few phenomena can be observed 1 regardless of the observation depth overall all expected values of data worth indices deviate from their reference values more and more as time goes on 2 the moisture data has reduced reference data worth with increased observation depth during the early period 0 50 day but some unusual patterns can be seen for example the reference relative entropy based on the observation at 0 22 0 38 m depth shows abnormal surge during the late period 3 despite of the larger data worth from shallow observations for soil moisture estimation sd and re do not perform well in term of the matching degree of reference and expected data worth if shallow moisture data at the depths of 0 02 0 18 m and 0 22 0 38 m are collected the reason could be two sided the potential observations of shallow depth may suffer more uncertainty sources for example spatial or and temporal variability of surface soil parameters uncertain atmospheric boundaries and inaccurate evapotranspiration model the measurement error of surface moisture data may also receive higher uncertainty our results imply that evaluating the data worth of shallow soil moisture observation is subject to considerable challenge if covariance type or mean covariance type index is employed similar findings regarding soil moisture data assimilation have been reported by crow and van loon 2005 and shi et al 2015 4 comparing to tr and sd the match of reference and expected re is especially not agreeable which has also been observed in figs 5 7 and 9 our further analysis showed that the accelerating discrepancy between the reference and expected re is because jb is the dominant component and there exists a large difference between the reference and expected jb figures not presented these results further emphasize that the influence of atmospheric boundary conditions should be taken into account when determining the future monitoring strategy location frequency and data type with mean covariance type index 3 3 6 effect of observation error c1 c6 and c7 fig 11 reveals a comparison of data worth among cases c6 c1 and c7 with observation error variance being equal to 0 0001 0 0005 and 0 001 respectively only the results in plot w1 are shown different data worth indices respond very differently to the observation error tr increases with increasing error while sd shows a opposite trend moreover it is seen that the reference re of case c6 with the smallest measurement error shows abrupt rising and the match between the reference and expected data worth deteriorates significantly after the 50th day for both parameter estimation and soil moisture profile retrieval for ease of comparison the rmse between the expected and reference re for parameter estimation in all three plots are presented in fig 12 a two findings can be obtained 1 the smallest observation error leads to the worst data worth estimation in all plots 2 the data worth accuracy overall degrades when the measurement error increases from 0 0005 to 0 001 the potential observations of cases c6 and c7 are given in fig 12 b and c respectively it is observed that smaller error indeed generates potential observations closer to real observations before the 50th day while it also leads to more deviated potential observations at the late time too large observation error certainly will reduce the contained value of measurement data however our results demonstrate that too small observation error is also unfavorable in the real world case one possible explanation is that relative lager observation error can actually alleviate the adverse effect of model structural error 4 discussion and conclusion in this paper with the aid of one field experiment the data worth analysis coupled with enkf is introduced to sequentially evaluate the potential value of future soil moisture data three representative types of indicators i e variance type tr covariance type sd dp and dfs and mean covariance type re and jb are employed to quantify the data worth the variance and covariance type metrics focus on the reduction of predictive uncertainty while the mean covariance type index simultaneously considers the time varying behaviors of mean and covariance the former two can be estimated with ease while the latter is hardly reproduced due to several reasons including the high demand on prior information the inherent non linearity of unsaturated flow and the model structural error even so the mean covariance type index may be a more objective index since it can characterize the prospective change of future data in a more comprehensive way the data worth of given observations to soil parameters α n ks estimation and soil moisture profile retrieval are simultaneously assessed in this study regarding data worth analysis for soil moisture profile retrieval we showed that the vertical cross covariance of soil moisture exerts a significant impact on the estimation accuracy of covariance type metrics the manifesting impact is associated with the meshing size and the future scenario such as atmospheric boundary soil moisture profile and associated covariance are susceptible to irrigation and evaporation events model structural error is likely to occur under changing scenarios it is thus challenging to evaluate the worth of future monitoring scheme for soil moisture profile characterization in the real world circumstance a series of illustrative cases were employed to explore the influence of the following various factors on data worth analysis 1 scenario condition a future scenario obviously different from the historical scenario at the prior stage is likely to bring in model structural error this raises the difficulty of imitating actual measurements and leads to deteriorated data worth assessment 2 prior information content overall more prior data can improve the match between the reference and expected data worth the performance of variance and covariance type index is less sensitive to prior data volume while mean covariance type indices deteriorate dramatically with insufficient prior data despite of the overall benefit by assimilating more prior data during data worth analysis it cannot compensate the negative damage from unresolved model structural error 3 observation location the moisture data has reduced reference data worth with increased observation depth for the variance and covariance type index in this study the surface soil layer is the most valuable location to collect observations in terms of the data worth assessment with variance and covariance type index however for the mean covariance type index the data worth shows complicated patterns due to the complex features of mean and covariance our results demonstrated the challenge of evaluating the data worth of surface soil moisture observations with mean covariance type index 4 observation error small observation error is not always helpful for improving data worth analysis relatively high observation error seems beneficial in a real world case especially when the future scenario differs with the historical scenario in this current study only soil moisture data are considered the future study will further evaluate the data worth of other types of data such as water head flux tracer concentration temperature remote sensing data and ground penetrating radar data it is expected that these data can provide an additional constraint on modeling uncertainty however a quantitative assessment to the worth of different data sources remains to be explored such analysis can provide modeler with advice on which data to be collected and optimal collection strategy frequency location and accuracy besides how to quantify and alleviate the adverse effect of model structural error and improve the performance of mean covariance type index should be investigated for nonlinear soil water problem acknowledgements this study was supported

7054,given the high cost of data acquisition in soil water problems it is becoming increasingly essential to collect the measurements as cost efficient as possible by introducing the data worth analysis framework coupled with ensemble kalman filter enkf this real world case study attempts to assess the worth of potential soil moisture observations before data collection a field experiment was implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of quantifying the effect of future data on uncertainty reduction under real circumstances in a sequential way the data worth of future observations is defined regarding soil hydraulic parameter estimation or soil moisture profile retrieval four information measures including the trace tr shannon entropy difference sd relative entropy re and degrees of freedom for signal dfs are introduced to quantify the information content the sequential data worth analysis framework is examined by a number of cases including under different irrigation intensities with different prior data existing observations that have already been collected and with data of various depths and different measurement errors we demonstrated the ability and the challenge as well of quantifying the data worth sequentially our results showed that data worth assessment regarding soil moisture profile retrieval is more difficult than that regarding parameter identification variance type and covariance type metrics have relatively loose accuracy requirement on potential observations future possible observations to be collected while mean covariance type metrics require higher accuracy the vertical covariance of soil moisture is susceptible to the effect of atmospheric boundary condition which eventually imposes a challenge on the quantification of data worth with covariance involved indices the match between the expected and reference data worth can be improved by assimilating more prior data however more prior data cannot compensate for the damage from possible model structural error due to the changed scenarios between the prior stage and the posterior or preposterior stage shallow soil moisture data generally has larger data worth than deep observations in our study but evaluating data worth with shallow data is subject to considerable uncertainty if covariance type or mean covariance type index is employed smaller measurement error does not always lead to improved data worth estimation keywords data worth soil water flow data assimilation model structural error 1 introduction the unsaturated zone is inextricably involved in many aspects of hydrology evaporation groundwater recharge soil moisture storage and soil erosion renard 1997 fetter 2000 lettau 1969 penman 1948 plentiful efforts have been made in the past decades on the development of numerical algorithms for modeling unsaturated flow celia et al 1990 freeze 1971 song et al 2014 van genuchten 1982 these algorithms usually entail characterizing the spatial distribution of soil hydraulic parameters and factors affecting flow however it is difficult to directly measure the soil hydraulic properties due to the limitations of measurement techniques and the spatial heterogeneity of parameters inverse modeling approaches and data assimilation methods have thus become popular ways to improve soil moisture estimation and derive soil parameters numerous inverse and data assimilation methods have been developed man et al 2016a b alcolea et al 2006 reichle et al 2002 reichle et al 2008 rubin et al 2010 zimmerman et al 1998 thereinto sequential data assimilation method has gained a significant amount of traction in various communities because of the capability of sequentially incorporating observations into models aanonsen et al 2009 chen and zhang 2006 oliver et al 2008 shi et al 2015 xie and zhang 2010 zhu et al 2017 hu et al 2017 in the recent decade the interest in the real time integration of measurements has been further boosted by the increasing ability of online data acquisition and the growing demand for real time prediction and management observation data from different sources has been merged including remote sensing data shi et al 2011 crow and wood 2003 montzka et al 2011 moradkhani 2008 pipunic et al 2008 and ground based measurements shuwen et al 2005 walker et al 2001 li and ren 2011 li et al 2018 it is no doubt that by incorporating more data into the model the uncertainty of modeling output can be reduced however massive observations from multiple sources would significantly increase the budget of data collection moreover the collection process of soil moisture data is subject to considerable uncertainty either for remotely sensed soil moisture data or data collected by the traditional ground method the identification of data quality or measurement error is not an easy task li et al 2009 reichle et al 2008 this can create an extra uncertainty in data assimilation system furthermore the contribution of each data is not identical when multiple data sources are assimilated together some measurements may make significant contribution to the improvement of simulation accuracy while others may be less useful to avoid the overloaded monitoring cost caused by redundant measurements it is essential to develop a framework to assess the value of infused data before data acquisition data worth sometimes called data utility data information content or data impact has been defined in several different ways it was first defined as the reduction in expected error after sampling gates and kisiel 1974 in a later study of james and freeze 1993 data worth was assessed by comparing the cost of data collection against the expected value of the risk reduction in light of modeling uncertainty statistical measures including the reduction of parameter or prediction variance relative entropy and the possible significance level of hypothesis testing can be used to quantify the data worth leube et al 2012 data worth and analogous concepts have been extensively studied in optimal monitoring network design which aims to obtain a maximum gain of information from the optimum number locations frequency and data types of measurements wu et al 2005 kollat and reed 2006 nowak et al 2010 a few data worth analysis frameworks have been proposed freeze et al 1992 used the search theory and bayesian updating to determine if additional data have worth or not in terms of risk reduction in their study vrugt et al 2002 merged the generalized sensitivity analysis the bayesian recursive estimation algorithm and the metropolis algorithm to identify the most informative measurements for model parameter estimation leube et al 2012 developed a preposterior data impact assessor within the bayesian framework to assess the expected data worth of proposed sampling design recently dai et al 2016 proposed a computationally efficient data worth analysis framework based on ensemble kalman filter and probabilistic collocation method the typical data worth framework consists of prior posterior and preposterior stages the preposterior analysis is most critical and it evaluates whether a future measurement is effective and how effective before it is taken neuman et al 2012 freeze et al 1992 james and gorelick 1994 however the simultaneous data worth analysis coupled with sequential data assimilation methods i e enkf received limited attention to date zhang et al 2005 and dai et al 2016 employed the static kalman filter or enkf to assess the data worth in a groundwater and solute transport problem man et al 2016a proposed a sequential ensemble based optimal design method to improve the performance of parameter estimation for soil water problems evaluating the data worth sequentially has three main benefits firstly the parameter and model states are updated in real time so the data impact to modeling system can be detected instantaneously secondly the sampling strategy can be dynamically adjusted to save the monitoring and analysis cost man et al 2016 thirdly data worth analysis frameworks based on sequential data assimilation methods i e enkf are strictly non intrusive and can be embedded into the forward model in a straightforward way to the best of our knowledge all previous studies are based on synthetic cases and data worth analysis in the context of dynamically evolving soil parameters and soil moisture profile has not been studied in a real world case as stated by leube et al 2012 for nonlinear problems the estimation variance and more sophisticated measures of data utility depend on the actual values of measurements which are still unknown prior to collection it will be more convincing to investigate the data worth under real world circumstances for nonlinear soil water flow one primary difficulty for practical unsaturated soil water problems is the identification of multiple parameters in the water retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity another difficulty lies in the definition of the upper boundary condition such as uncertain and uneven rainfall or irrigation which has a significant influence on shallow soil moisture content cull et al 1981 hence this study focuses on exploring the influence of a variety of uncertain soil parameters on data worth assessment three field plots in a greenhouse were thoroughly investigated soil parameters were measured by the double ring test and lab experiments a period of 65 day continuous soil moisture data under three irrigation schemes was observed we were thus able to identify the evolution of data worth under different upper boundary settings the objective of this study is not to minimize the uncertainty of soil moisture profile estimation by specifying the optimal number and location of measurements to be collected but to explore the applicability of running data worth analysis in a sequential way we attempt to answer the following questions with the aid of this field scale experiment 1 given multiple uncertain soil parameters how does the data worth regarding parameter estimation and soil moisture profile retrieval evolve respectively 2 how do prior data existing data that have already been collected observation depth and measurement error affect the data worth 3 what are the performances of different data worth indices under different irrigation schemes it is hoped that this study can provide a guidance on the design of prospective monitoring strategy for field scale unsaturated flow problems the data worth framework by dai et al 2016 is accommodated to this study besides the tracer index tr introduced by neuman et al 2012 the shannon entropy difference sd shannon 1949 relative entropy re kullback 1959 and degrees of freedom for signal dfs fisher 2003 are also introduced to implement the data worth analysis it is worthy comparing the performance of different indices in the following context section 2 presents the principles of enkf and data worth analysis frameworks and introduces four information metrics namely tr sd re and dfs thereafter section 3 presents a set of examples to demonstrate the ability of the data worth analysis framework to quantify the worth of one given monitoring scheme in terms of irrigation pattern spatial location observation error and prior data content moreover in this section the discrepancy of four information metrics is explored in section 4 conclusions and discussions are presented 2 methodology 2 1 numerical model of one dimensional unsaturated flow in this paper one dimensional soil water movement is considered the flow is described by richards equation richards 1931 1 θ h t z k h h z 1 where θ l3l 3 is the volumetric moisture content h l is the pressure head t t is the time z l is the spatial coordinate oriented positively downward k lt 1 is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in eq 1 there are three unknown quantities θ h and k the constitutive relationship between them can be characterized by the van genuchten mualem model 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 kh k s s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 h 0 k s h 0 4 m 1 1 n n 1 5 s e θ

is the saturated hydraulic conductivity se is the effective saturation in our paper we employ the ross method ross 2006 2003 which is a noniterative numerical scheme to obtain a fast solution of one dimensional richards equation the specific advantages of ross method can be found in zha et al 2013 2 2 ensemble kalman filter enkf in enkf the parameter vector of interest p are augmented with the state variable vector s into a joint state vector y p s t a collection of n 1 members of the state vector y can be written as 6 y y 1 y 2 y n 1 the relationship between observations at time step t d t obs and their true values y t true is represented as follows 7 d t obs hy t true ε t where matrix h is the observation operator which relates the state and observation vectors ɛ t represents measurement error vector which is assumed to be zero mean gaussian with covariance matrix r t as a sequential monte carlo method enkf entails two main steps forecast step and analysis step at the forecast step each state vector in y is projected from time step t 1 to time t through the forward numerical analytical model f 8 y i t f f y i t 1 a i 1 2 n 1 where superscripts f and a refer to forecast and analysis respectively superscripts i is the ensemble member index at the analysis step for any ensemble member i at a given time t the joint state vector is updated by combining model predictions and observations 9 y i t a y i t f k t d i t obs hy i t f where the kalman gain k t is defined as 10 k t c t f h t hc t f h t r t 1 where c t f is the covariance matrix of the state vector at time t which can be updated after data assimilation through 11 c t a i k t h c t f where i is a unit matrix whose dimension is nd nd and nd is the number of available measurements 2 3 data worth analysis framework coupled with enkf following the framework of neuman et al 2012 and dai et al 2016 data worth analysis of future monitoring scheme is comprised of three stages 1 at the prior stage enkf with an ensemble size of n 1 is employed to sequentially assimilate the prior data a a set of n 1 hypothetical observations are then generated with b i hy i f ε i i 1 2 n 1 it is worth noting that n 1 should be large enough to include as many as possible measurement values and assure the accuracy of estimated mean and covariance 2 at the preposterior stage for each possible data b i n 2 realizations satisfying gaussian distribution the ensemble mean is the value of b i and the variance is the measurement error variance are firstly generated enkf with an ensemble size of n 2 is again implemented to estimate the resulting mean and other statistics there are totally n 1 n 2 realizations being run predictive statistics of posterior vector y i j i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n 2 i e e y i a b i and cov y i a b i are calculated by jointly conditioning on a b i then e b a e y a b e b a cov y a b and cov b a e y a b are yielded through statistics over all b i similar procedures repeat until the final time in the meantime the expected data worth in the form of quantitative indices is calculated 3 at the posterior stage the actual mean and covariance are obtained by using available real data set b in a sequential manner the real i e reference or posterior data worth and expected preposterior data worth is then compared to reveal the effectiveness of this data worth framework the whole workflow of data worth analysis framework is depicted in fig 1 the framework described above is essentially a two layer hierarchical bayesian model the first layer considers the possible variation range of potential data observations to be collected in the future and the second layer contains the uncertainty from uncertain parameters by quantifying the contained uncertainty and sometimes the resulting change of mean behavior for a nonlinear system in the first layer the expected data worth for a given observation scheme i e for given number locations frequency and data types of measurements is then determined in this study we introduce four information metrics to quantify the worth of potential observations firstly the statistics in the prior and preposterior analysis have the following theoretical relations neuman et al 2012 12 e y a e b a e y a b 13 cov y a e b a cov y a b cov b a e y a b where e y a is the prior mean of state vector y conditioning on prior data a eb a e y a b is the expectation of e y a b for the sake of simplicity e y a and e y a b are denoted by m 1 and m 2 respectively cov y a denoted as c 1 represents prior predictive uncertainty given that potential observation b is generated by conditioning on a c 1 is theoretically equal to cov y a at the preposterior stage however in fact they may differ from each other due to the sampling error caused by the finite sample size moreover e b a cov y a b is the expectation of cov y a b conditioning on a b which represents the predictive uncertainty in preposterior data worth analysis here it is denoted by c 2 at the early time of data worth analysis procedure the total uncertainty of the system mostly lies in the second layer i e cov y a e b a cov y a b while cov b a e y a b 0 with the sequential infusion of potential observations at the following time steps cov b a e y a b starts to increase in addition when calculating the reference data worth c 2 refers to cov y a b and m 2 refers to e y a b 1 trace a scalar indicator trace tr is defined by neuman et al 2012 as a measure of data worth in terms of uncertainty reduction 14 t r t r c 1 t r c 2 where tr indicates the trace sum of diagonal entries of a matrix 2 the shannon entropy difference sd between the prior and preposterior probability density functions pdfs also can be used to quantify the information content extracted from future data due to the fact that the prior and preposterior pdfs are both gaussian in enkf sd can be expressed as shannon 1949 xu 2007 15 sd ln det c 1 2 ln det c 2 2 ln det c 1 c 2 1 2 where det denotes the determinant 3 the relative entropy re known as a signal dispersion combined index provides a measure of the information content of an analysis posterior pdf with respect to background prior pdf zhang et al 2015 singh et al 2013 under the assumption that the background and the analysis pdfs are n dimensional gaussian re is defined as xu 2007 16 re j b dp 17 j b m 2 m 1 t c 1 1 m 2 m 1 2 18 dp ln det c 1 c 2 1 t r c 2 c 1 1 n 2 unlike sd and tr the relative entropy re is not additive xu 2007 the advantage of re index is the ability of measuring both the signal mean part jb and dispersion covariance part dp which may be important for nonlinear soil water system from eqs 9 16 17 and 18 it is emphasized that re not only depends on the observation operator but also depends on observation vector itself in particular the signal part jb mainly depends on the realizations of d i t obs h t y i t f for each realization of d i t obs the signal and dispersion components indicate the improvements made from the mean and covariance respectively xu et al 2009 the calculation process of jb implies the influence of actual values of measurements on data worth assessment 4 the degrees of freedom for signal dfs measures how many degrees of freedom of an observation are related to signal versus noise xu et al 2009 it characterizes the total reduction in variance or the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom of the error resulting from the addition of observations singh et al 2013 dfs can be defined as 19 dfs 2 j b where represents the expectation for a linear or linearized observation operator the definition of dfs can be transformed into 20 dfs n t r c 2 c 1 1 in essence these indices can be divided into three categories variance type tr covariance type sd and dfs eq 20 and mean covariance type re and dfs eq 19 among these indices re jb part and dfs eq 19 consider the effect of actual measurement data values on data worth while other indices merely include the influence of uncertainty variance and or covariance it is noted that the implementation of above data worth analysis framework is computationally expensive thus parallel computing is utilized to alleviate this issue efficient surrogate system can be further combined to reduce the computational burden man et al 2017 dai et al 2016 3 experiment and modeling results 3 1 field experiment a field experiment was conducted in the irrigation and drainage laboratory of wuhan university china the experimental period was between 29 february and 3 may 2016 there were totally three experimental plots selected in the greenhouse all plots were bare soil with no vegetation cover three plots were named as w1 w2 and w3 respectively each plot had a size of 3 m by 1 m as shown in fig 2 within each plot three trime trime ptco iph tubes were installed randomly in space average soil water content at multiple depth ranges 0 02 0 18 m 0 22 0 38 m 0 42 0 58 m and 0 62 0 78 m were measured the average soil water content of three tubes in each plot were regarded as the soil water content of this plot the measurement time interval was 3 4 days the amount of irrigation water for plots w1 w2 and w3 are given by fig 2 during the first 51 days the irrigation amount of three plots were the same while during the next 14 days the irrigation amount at each irrigation time in w2 was half of that in w1 and there was no irrigation in w3 in w1 and w2 the irrigation frequency doubled during the last 14 days the late stage of w2 was designed to investigate the data worth response to changed irrigation frequency while the simultaneous effect of changed irrigation frequency and amount was explored in w1 and the data worth response to no irrigation was analyzed in w3 16 groups of undisturbed soil samples and 3 groups of packed soil samples were collected to measure the soil hydraulic parameters the saturated moisture content θs was determined as 0 44 by using oven drying method the other three soil parameters θr α and n were determined by using the nonlinear isqcurvefit function in matlab their values were equal to 0 02 1 48 m 1 and 1 27 respectively in addition soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks was measured by using the double ring infiltrometer experiment at 10 random sites within the study field leading to an average value of 0 068 m d 3 2 model setup the key parameters of the numerical cases are listed in table 1 focusing on the vertical soil water flow each plot is represented by a one dimensional soil column the soil column has a height of 0 8 m and is discretized with 80 grids of uniform size the top and bottom boundaries are set as an atmospheric boundary and constant water content respectively in addition ks α and n are assumed to be unknown and lognormally distributed during data worth analysis a suite of cases table 2 is designed to serve our research purposes case c1 is set as the base case to verify the feasibility of assessing the data worth within the data worth analysis framework coupled with enkf the prior data entering into case c1 comprises of soil water content measurements taken at diverse depths i e 0 02 0 18 m 0 22 0 38 m 0 42 0 58 m and 0 62 0 78 m during the first 19 days a comparison among cases c1 c2 and c3 is designed to investigate the effect of prior data content on data worth analysis which can help us to determine the required prior information content to ensure the accuracy of data worth assessment cases c2 and c3 have 30 day and 9 day prior soil moisture data respectively differing from 19 day data in case c1 many previous studies attempted to explore the potential of using surface soil moisture data which are most readily available to retrieve soil moisture profile li et al 2010 calvet and noilhan 2000 das and mohanty 2006 and soil hydraulic properties montzka et al 2011 shi et al 2015 however in the cases where moisture content observations in the topsoil and deep soil are both available without considering technique constraints is the surface soil moisture more valuable therefore two more test cases i e c4 and c5 are designed to investigate the effect of monitoring depths on data worth analysis test cases c4 and c5 are identical to c1 except that the additional observations are made at the depths of 0 22 0 38 m and 0 42 0 58 m respectively considering that observed data is always accompanied with error it is interesting to explore the discrepancy of data worth under different levels of observation errors here we assume that the measurement errors are gaussian distributed and have a constant variance the measurement error variance of soil moisture for c1 is assumed to be 0 0005 to be compared against the values of 0 0001 and 0 001 in cases c6 and c7 respectively 3 3 results and discussions 3 3 1 validation of data worth analysis method coupled with enkf case c1 in this case 19 day prior soil moisture data is provided to generate potential soil moisture at the depth of 0 02 0 18 m fig 3 b 1 3 presents a comparison of the real observations red squares and the corresponding n 1 200 potential observation samples black dots as well as their ensemble mean black squares in all plots it is seen that the mean values of potential observation realizations show some deviations from the actual measurements with 19 day prior data with the increase of prior data the generated potential data are expected to approach to the actual observations as shown in fig 3c with 30 day prior data the unsatisfactory performance under inadequate prior data can be attributed to the following reasons 1 insufficient prior data may result in parameter estimates not close enough to the true values after data assimilation fig 4 a c plots the updated mean of ln α ln n and ln ks versus time by assimilating all soil moisture observations sequentially it is seen that within 19 day prior period the estimated parameters especially for ln ks have not reached stable values for all plots 2 the change of future scenario irrigation amount and frequency may trigger the potential model structural error wagener and gupta 2005 xu et al 2017 this is particularly obvious in plot w3 with no irrigation at the late time if one model undergoes different and contrasting scenarios the model structural error is likely to appear since model parameters updated or calibrated under one scenario have not been examined under another scenario this can be confirmed by the fluctuated parameter estimates in all plots after 50th day when the irrigation amount and frequency start to change fig 4 inaccurate description to forcing term such as evaporation or a simplified representation of real soil layer structure xu and valocchi 2016 beven 2005 crow and van loon 2005 dee 2005 mccuen 1974 may also introduce model structural error this potential error eventually increases the difficulty of accurately imitating real observations with potential data 3 3 2 parameter estimation based on the above potential and actual observations their expected and reference data worth regarding parameter estimation can be quantified in the form of tr sd re jb dp and dfs eq 20 as depicted in fig 5 only the results in plot w1 are presented on the whole the results lead to two findings 1 for variance type tr or covariance type sd dp and dfs eq 20 indicators the expected and reference data worth values match very well even though the potential observations and real data do not fit quite well we recall that such an agreeable match is achieved even if the means of the potential observations still deviate from the actual observations as shown in fig 3 2 for re or jb the expected value barely reproduces its reference counterpart this is because that mean covariance type metric further takes into account the effects of mean behavior m 2 m 1 which is barely reproducible with high accuracy due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of the soil water system yeh et al 1985 mantoglou and gelhar 1987 and the possible model structural error these results imply that a satisfactory evaluation of data worth with mean covariance type metrics places high demands on the potential observations especially the mean of potential observations for soil water problems under the real world circumstance while the variance type and covariance type metrics relatively relax the accuracy requirement to the potential observations but focus on the uncertainty level according to eq 19 and eq 20 dfs can be calculated in two ways i e the original definition similar to jb shown in fig 5d and linearized transformed definition shown in fig 5f although the linearized form of dfs leads to a better match between the expected and reference data worth it may not be applicable in soil water problems due to the inherent nonlinearity the results show that such linearization can introduce artificial distortion to data worth analysis although linearized dfs has been popularly used by previous studies fisher 2003 xu 2007 3 3 3 soil moisture profile retrieval when we evaluate the data worth of potential measurements on soil moisture profile retrieval it is requisite to consider at which resolution the soil moisture profile should be reproduced we run data worth analysis with different numbers of nodes and investigate the influence of meshing size on data worth analysis surprisingly the results show that meshing size has a very large effect on the calculated data worth in terms of sd and dp fig 6 a and b present the rmse between the expected and reference sd and dp with respect to different node spacings it is observed that the rmse for sd or dp increases drastically when the node spacing is small fig 6 c and d further compare the expected and reference covariance matrixes at the 65th day with a node spacing of 1 cm the apparent contrast between the expected and reference covariance exists for the cross covariance between the shallow and deep nodes highlighted by gray rectangle this cross covariance bias is caused by the spurious correlation due to numerical calculation further results show that the variance can be estimated relatively easily while a satisfactory cross covariance estimation is difficult which can be inferred by comparing fig 7 a and b since covariance type metrics depend on both the variance the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix and the cross correlation the non diagonal elements the results demonstrate the challenge of data worth analysis for soil moisture prediction if the covariance type index is employed there are two solutions for this issue one is to use a larger node spacing a larger node spacing seems helpful to alleviate the adverse effect of spurious correlation see fig 7a and b but at the same time it may lead to false cross covariance and variance another way is to use the localization technique to avoid the spurious cross covariance in our study only soil moisture at several representative nodes i e at the depths of 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm and 70 cm are selected to evaluate the data worth the results of data worth are given in fig 7 the expected and reference sd matches constantly well the expected and reference sd and dfs fit well during the early period but start to deteriorate at the late time meanwhile the comparison of fig 5 and fig 7 reveals an inferior data worth analysis performance for soil moisture retrieval when the covariance type index is used compared with data worth analysis for parameter estimation to understand this phenomenon the expected and reference posterior covariance matrices at the 30th and 65th day are displayed in fig 8 it is found that compared to parameter covariance the match of expected and reference soil moisture covariance deteriorates obviously at the 65th day this can explain the deteriorated match of sd or dfs over time for soil moisture retrieval one unfavorable aspect regarding data worth analysis for soil moisture retrieval is that the vertical covariance of soil moisture is susceptible to the upper boundary condition in plot w1 frequent irrigation is applied during the late period and the intensified drying and wetting processes seem difficult to be described accurately by the updated soil parameters from the prior period which consequently brings difficulty of reproducing the real cross covariance thus the future change of the atmospheric scenario should be paid enough attention not only due to the possibly introduced model structural error but also due to its vital effect on soil moisture covariance estimation 3 3 4 effect of prior data content c1 c2 and c3 fig 9 a f compares the data worth among cases c3 c1 and c2 with 9 day 19 day and 30 day prior data respectively with respect to parameter identification to avoid repetition only the results of tr sd and re representing variance type covariance type and mean covariance type index respectively in plots w1 and w2 are shown overall the expected and reference data worth has a better match as more prior data are assimilated especially for tr and sd this is in line with the fact that actual observations are more readily captured with potential observation realizations as prior data increases as depicted in fig 3 it is also seen from fig 9 a c or fig 9 d f that in comparison to mean covariance type indicator re the fitness between the expected and reference variance type and covariance type indicators tr and sd are less sensitive to prior data different responses of re to prior data are observed in plots w1 and w2 more prior data leads to the improved estimation of re in plot w2 while increasing the prior period from 19 days to 30 days unfortunately worsens the data worth match after the 50th day in plot w1 considering that w1 was applied with more intensive irrigation after the 50th day it is found that more prior data does not always lead to better data worth estimation fig 9 c in plot w1 the abnormal pattern of re at the late time is possibly caused by more intensified wetting drying cycle of moisture content than in plot w2 which eventually increases the difficulty of obtaining reasonable parameters to represent the real soil thus on one side data worth assessment regarding parameter identification can be improved by assimilating more prior data xue et al 2014 if tr and sd are used on the other side the deteriorated performance of re in plot w1 reminds us that poor fitting of mean covariance type index due to imperfect parameter estimates may hardly be compensated by assimilating more prior data we note that model structural error and imperfect parameter estimate actually appear simultaneously since parameters are forced to compensate for the bias between observation and simulation if sequential data assimilation is employed similar conclusions can be drawn for soil moisture profile retrieval fig 9 g presents the sd in plot w2 as suggested by comparing fig 9 e and fig 9 g some interesting phenomena can be found for parameter identification 19 day prior data is adequate to guarantee the estimation accuracy of sd nevertheless the accuracy of sd regarding soil moisture prediction is satisfactory only when the prior data period reaches 30 days such a difference again indicates that more prior information is required to assess data worth for soil moisture profile characterization compared with soil parameter identification 3 3 5 effect of monitoring location c1 c4 and c5 since shallow soil moisture is more sensitive to the atmospheric boundary and shows larger temporal variation than deep soil moisture in our field experiment it is expected that shallow soil moisture is subject to higher uncertainty and hence observations at shallow depths generate larger data worth tr and sd as demonstrated in fig 10 a b d and e assimilating deep soil moisture brings reduced data worth regardless of parameter identification or soil moisture profile retrieval this result is consistent with the finding of dai et al 2016 which claimed that an effective observation strategy is to acquire new data at a location where the prior predictive uncertainty is large however the response of relative entropy to different depths of soil moisture is rather complicated especially at the late time when the irrigation frequency was intensified in plot w2 a few phenomena can be observed 1 regardless of the observation depth overall all expected values of data worth indices deviate from their reference values more and more as time goes on 2 the moisture data has reduced reference data worth with increased observation depth during the early period 0 50 day but some unusual patterns can be seen for example the reference relative entropy based on the observation at 0 22 0 38 m depth shows abnormal surge during the late period 3 despite of the larger data worth from shallow observations for soil moisture estimation sd and re do not perform well in term of the matching degree of reference and expected data worth if shallow moisture data at the depths of 0 02 0 18 m and 0 22 0 38 m are collected the reason could be two sided the potential observations of shallow depth may suffer more uncertainty sources for example spatial or and temporal variability of surface soil parameters uncertain atmospheric boundaries and inaccurate evapotranspiration model the measurement error of surface moisture data may also receive higher uncertainty our results imply that evaluating the data worth of shallow soil moisture observation is subject to considerable challenge if covariance type or mean covariance type index is employed similar findings regarding soil moisture data assimilation have been reported by crow and van loon 2005 and shi et al 2015 4 comparing to tr and sd the match of reference and expected re is especially not agreeable which has also been observed in figs 5 7 and 9 our further analysis showed that the accelerating discrepancy between the reference and expected re is because jb is the dominant component and there exists a large difference between the reference and expected jb figures not presented these results further emphasize that the influence of atmospheric boundary conditions should be taken into account when determining the future monitoring strategy location frequency and data type with mean covariance type index 3 3 6 effect of observation error c1 c6 and c7 fig 11 reveals a comparison of data worth among cases c6 c1 and c7 with observation error variance being equal to 0 0001 0 0005 and 0 001 respectively only the results in plot w1 are shown different data worth indices respond very differently to the observation error tr increases with increasing error while sd shows a opposite trend moreover it is seen that the reference re of case c6 with the smallest measurement error shows abrupt rising and the match between the reference and expected data worth deteriorates significantly after the 50th day for both parameter estimation and soil moisture profile retrieval for ease of comparison the rmse between the expected and reference re for parameter estimation in all three plots are presented in fig 12 a two findings can be obtained 1 the smallest observation error leads to the worst data worth estimation in all plots 2 the data worth accuracy overall degrades when the measurement error increases from 0 0005 to 0 001 the potential observations of cases c6 and c7 are given in fig 12 b and c respectively it is observed that smaller error indeed generates potential observations closer to real observations before the 50th day while it also leads to more deviated potential observations at the late time too large observation error certainly will reduce the contained value of measurement data however our results demonstrate that too small observation error is also unfavorable in the real world case one possible explanation is that relative lager observation error can actually alleviate the adverse effect of model structural error 4 discussion and conclusion in this paper with the aid of one field experiment the data worth analysis coupled with enkf is introduced to sequentially evaluate the potential value of future soil moisture data three representative types of indicators i e variance type tr covariance type sd dp and dfs and mean covariance type re and jb are employed to quantify the data worth the variance and covariance type metrics focus on the reduction of predictive uncertainty while the mean covariance type index simultaneously considers the time varying behaviors of mean and covariance the former two can be estimated with ease while the latter is hardly reproduced due to several reasons including the high demand on prior information the inherent non linearity of unsaturated flow and the model structural error even so the mean covariance type index may be a more objective index since it can characterize the prospective change of future data in a more comprehensive way the data worth of given observations to soil parameters α n ks estimation and soil moisture profile retrieval are simultaneously assessed in this study regarding data worth analysis for soil moisture profile retrieval we showed that the vertical cross covariance of soil moisture exerts a significant impact on the estimation accuracy of covariance type metrics the manifesting impact is associated with the meshing size and the future scenario such as atmospheric boundary soil moisture profile and associated covariance are susceptible to irrigation and evaporation events model structural error is likely to occur under changing scenarios it is thus challenging to evaluate the worth of future monitoring scheme for soil moisture profile characterization in the real world circumstance a series of illustrative cases were employed to explore the influence of the following various factors on data worth analysis 1 scenario condition a future scenario obviously different from the historical scenario at the prior stage is likely to bring in model structural error this raises the difficulty of imitating actual measurements and leads to deteriorated data worth assessment 2 prior information content overall more prior data can improve the match between the reference and expected data worth the performance of variance and covariance type index is less sensitive to prior data volume while mean covariance type indices deteriorate dramatically with insufficient prior data despite of the overall benefit by assimilating more prior data during data worth analysis it cannot compensate the negative damage from unresolved model structural error 3 observation location the moisture data has reduced reference data worth with increased observation depth for the variance and covariance type index in this study the surface soil layer is the most valuable location to collect observations in terms of the data worth assessment with variance and covariance type index however for the mean covariance type index the data worth shows complicated patterns due to the complex features of mean and covariance our results demonstrated the challenge of evaluating the data worth of surface soil moisture observations with mean covariance type index 4 observation error small observation error is not always helpful for improving data worth analysis relatively high observation error seems beneficial in a real world case especially when the future scenario differs with the historical scenario in this current study only soil moisture data are considered the future study will further evaluate the data worth of other types of data such as water head flux tracer concentration temperature remote sensing data and ground penetrating radar data it is expected that these data can provide an additional constraint on modeling uncertainty however a quantitative assessment to the worth of different data sources remains to be explored such analysis can provide modeler with advice on which data to be collected and optimal collection strategy frequency location and accuracy besides how to quantify and alleviate the adverse effect of model structural error and improve the performance of mean covariance type index should be investigated for nonlinear soil water problem acknowledgements this study was supported
