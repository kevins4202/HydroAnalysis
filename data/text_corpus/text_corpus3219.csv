16095,peracetic acid paa based advanced oxidation processes aops has attracted increasing attentions towards contaminant degradation in the wastewater treatment herein we report the efficient activation of paa by nano cuo ncuo paa to degrade carbamazepine cbz for the first time rapid degradation of cbz was observed in the ncuo paa system at neutral initial ph a new scavenging experiment with mn2 as a specific scavenger was developed to distinguish the dominant role of ch3c o oo for cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process the oxidation of cbz by ch3c o oo was verified to proceed via the electrons transfer and the acute and chronic toxicity of the transformation products was significantly reduced the efficient activation of paa by ncuo was found to be realized through continuous conversion of cu ii to cu i which was significantly boosted by co existing h2o2 the ncuo paa process was slightly affected by the water matrices and maintained high efficiency in real water samples the findings obtained in this study provide new insights into the catalytic formation of ch3c o oo from paa and facilitate the development and application of paa based aops in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes aops peracetic acid copper oxide nanoparticle ncuo carbamazepine cbz acetylperoxy radical 1 introduction peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh a strong peroxyacid oxidant has been widely used in food industry and health care luukkonen and pehkonen 2016 paa emerged as a promising disinfectant in wastewater disinfection owing to the high efficiency for pathogenic microorganisms inactivation and little formation of toxic byproducts balachandran et al 2021 liu et al 2022a in recent years activation of paa to generate reactive species mainly hydroxyl radical oh and organic radicals r o has attracted growing interests in advanced oxidation processes aops for enhancing degradation of refractory organic pollutants in wastewater paa has a much weaker peroxyl bond o o eo o paa 159 kj mol 1 than some commonly used peroxide oxidants such as h2o2 eo o h2o2 213 kj mol 1 and peroxymonosulfate pms eo o pms 317 kj mol 1 zhang et al 2021a thus the formation of reactive radicals via paa dissociation is thermodynamically feasible the homolysis of the o oh bond in paa could generate oh and various r o such as acetoxyl radical ch3c o o and acetylperoxy radical ch3c o oo cai et al 2017 however the dominant reactive species accounting for organic contaminants oxidation largely depends on the activation methods for example uv irradiation could trigger the direct cleavage of o oh bond of paa generating oh and ch3c o o with oh dominated in contaminant oxidation cai et al 2017 in contrast r o is predominantly generated and responsible for organic pollutants oxidation in the transition metal activated paa aops kim et al 2019 as one of the most powerful peroxyl radicals ch3c o oo has been increasingly regarded as the key reactive species in r o for contaminant degradation kim et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b nevertheless the existence of multiple reactive radicals in paa based aops makes it challenging to discriminate the role of ch3c o oo the quenching method using tert butyl alcohol tba and 2 4 hexadiene 2 4 hd as scavengers was frequently employed to distinguish 67 the contribution of oh and acetyl per oxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo tba is an effective scavenger for oh but not for acetyl per oxyl radicals while 2 4 hd can rapidly quench oh and acetyl per oxyl radicals kim et al 2020 however the current approach fails to determine the respective roles of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and the generation of ch3c o oo could be suppressed by dosing excess tba because the reaction between oh and paa k oh paa 1 3 109 m 1 s 1 is an important pathway for ch3c o oo generation therefore it is highly required to develop an effective method to distinguish the contribution of ch3c o oo in paa based aops the activation with transition metals is among the hot topic in paa based aops and co2 is generally considered as the most effective activator for paa in comparison with other transition metals e g fe2 cu2 and mn2 zhang et al 1998 however the toxicity and non recyclability of co2 limits its wide application in wastewater treatment hu and long 2016 heterogeneous activation of paa with cobalt catalysts e g co3o4 has received increasing attention wu et al 2020 but the potential high toxicity of the leached cobalt ion remains a concern in this work we tested dozens of metal oxide nanoparticles nmops for paa activation and surprisingly found that copper oxide nanoparticle ncuo possessed the highest reactivity in catalyzing paa decomposition among the nmops including the previously reported nco3o4 wu et al 2020 this interesting discovery motivated us to conduct an in depth study to elucidate the reactivity and the mechanism of ncuo activation of paa carbamazepine cbz a typical refractory organic pollutant was used in this work to investigate the reaction mechanism of ncuo paa for wastewater treatment the extensive quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr technique were conducted to reveal the reactive species in the ncuo paa process a new quenching experiment with mn2 was developed to distinguish the primary contribution of ch3c o oo to contaminant degradation in the ncuo paa process we further extended the study to various organic contaminants to evaluate the selectivity of ch3c o oo transformation products of cbz and the toxicity variation were investigated to assess the environmental impacts of the effluent generated from ncuo paa system moreover atr ftir and xps techniques were used to characterize the cu species variation on the solid surface to elucidate the activation mechanism the significant role of h2o2 co existed in paa solution in the catalytic reaction of paa with ncuo was revealed to our best knowledge this study is among the first to elucidate the activation mechanism of paa by ncuo and provide a solid evidence for the contribution of ch3c o oo to the degradation of cbz in the system the new knowledge has important implications for application of paa based aops in the wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sources of chemicals and reagents are provided in the supporting information text s1 2 2 experimental procedures the catalytic oxidation reactions were carried out in a 100 ml glass reactor with continuous magnetic stirring at an ambient temperature of 20 2 c reactions were initiated by adding ncuo 0 5 8 0 mg into 100 ml solution containing paa 0 13 1 04 mm and cbz 2 12 21 16 μm if it was not otherwise specified the initial ph was adjusted by naoh 0 2 m and h2so4 0 1 m with no buffer employed in most cases the experiments were conducted at initial ph of 7 0 and the solution ph slightly decreased to about 6 2 after reaction in the study of the effects of solution ph on cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process the solution ph was controlled by dosing 10 mm acetate buffer when ph was set at 6 30 and 10 mm borate buffer at ph of 7 01 or higher no buffer was applied under acidic conditions because the ph change was minimal at these conditions as the reaction proceeded 1 0 ml of solution were extracted at predetermined time intervals and immediately quenched with excess na2s2o3 10 mm prior to analysis the concentration of cbz and other organic compounds were detected by 1260 infinity hplc agilent usa equipped with a uv detector and an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm the analytical methods of the tested contaminants are summarized in table s1 for reusability and stability tests the ncuo catalyst was recovered by centrifugation and washed with purified water for several times then dried in a vacuum oven at 40 c the uv instrument employed in uv h2o2 and uv paa processes was described in detail in text s2 2 3 analytical methods the paa concentration was measured according to the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method apha awwa wef 1998 the crystal structures chemical states and surface charge ζ potential of the catalyst was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance diffractometer bruker germany x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific inc usa and a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk respectively the concentration of leached copper was quantified by mass spectrometer with inductively coupled plasma agilent 7700 icp ms usa the electron spin resonance esr analysis was carried out to characterize the reactive species by using 5 diisopropoxyphosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dippmpo as a trapping agent followed by the simulation of matlab details shown in text s3 the transformation products of cbz was measured by a ultraperformance liquid chromatography uplc ultimate 3000 tandem mass spectrometry q exactive plus ms ms thermo scitific details shown in text s3 the acute toxicity assay was carried out against the photobacterium phosphoreum t3 wang et al 2017 the toxicity interference caused by paa and h2o2 was effectively eliminated by na2s2o3 and catalase with a stoichiometric amount respectively ecological structure activity relationship model ecosar program was also employed to estimate the acute and chronic toxicity kuang et al 2013 detailed information for toxicity analysis is described in text s3 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo molecular orbital analysis were performed by the gaussian 09 program with b3lyp functional method at 6 31 g d p level 3 results and discussion 3 1 activations of paa by nmops ten nmops ncuo nco3o4 nnio nfe3o4 nceo2 nzno nal2o3 nmgo nzro2 and nsno2 were tested for catalyzing paa decomposition at neutral initial ph as shown in fig 1 a paa underwent significant decomposition catalyzed by ncuo nco3o4 nnio nfe3o4 and nceo2 and showed negligible or slight decomposition with other nmops we further evaluated the degradation of cbz in the nmops paa and control systems results show that cbz was nondegradable with paa or nmops alone fig s1a but could be obviously degraded in ncuo paa nco3o4 paa nnio paa and nfe3o4 paa systems fig 1b this indicates a possibility that reactive species may be generated after paa activation based on the study of cai et al 2017 which reported the contribution of oh and r o to the degradation of pharmaceuticals in uv paa among these four nmops ncuo was the most efficient for paa activation to destruct cbz despite its surface area was one of the lowest table s2 the apparent degradation rate constant of cbz in the ncuo paa process was more than 2 times greater than that in the nco3o4 paa process 0 07 min 1 vs 0 03 min 1 fig s1b moreover the degradation of cbz in the ncuo paa system was comparable to the ncuo pms system and was much higher than the ncuo pds system fig s2 3 2 evidence of ch3c o oo contribution the activation of paa with transition metal based catalysts is a complicated process since multiple radicals oh and r o with different reactivity are generated via chain reactions eqs 2 8 the radical chain reactions are triggered by the o o bond cleavage of paa via two competing pathways to primarily generate oh or ch3c o o eqs 2 3 rokhina et al 2010 1 c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o oh h 2 o 2 2 c h 3 c o ooh m n 1 c h 3 c o o m n oh 3 c h 3 c o ooh m n 1 c h 3 c o o m n oh 4 c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o o c h 3 c o oh 5 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 6 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o 2 7 c h 3

degradation of p cba was completely inhibited after addition of tba a typical oh quencher k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 the results strongly suggested that oh was generated but in a small amount in the system radical scavenging experiments were further conducted to assess the contribution of oh and r o to cbz degradation in the ncuo paa system tba is an effective quencher for oh but not for r o due to the absence of α h in tba molecule cai et al 2017 kim et al 2020 while methanol meoh with a α h can scavenge both oh and r o based on the study of wang et al 2020d from fig 1c the addition of tba had a negligible effect on cbz degradation indicating that oh was not a significant reactive species responsible for cbz degradation in contrast the degradation of cbz was completely inhibited after dosing meoh hence the degradation of cbz in the ncuo paa process was not primarily contributed from oh but more likely from r o as another primary r o ch3c o o could contribute to cbz degradation through two pathways i direct oxidation ii indirect action via further generating other r o including ch3 ch3o2 and ch3c o oo through eqs 2 3 and 7 wang et al 2020d at the current experimental conditions paa 0 52 mm cbz 4 23 μm the direct oxidation of ch3c o o for cbz could be overlooked according to the comprehensively discussion in text s4 the self decay reaction a typical β cleavage reaction of ch3c o o could generate ch3 eq 5 which is highly unstable in oxygen to form ch3o2 eq 7 k 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 marchaj et al 1991 both ch3 and ch3o2 have low reactivity huie and neta 2010 and exhibited a negligible contribution to cbz degradation text s4 hence ch3c o oo one of the most powerful peroxyl radicals is expected to play a significant role in cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process ch3c o oo could be generated via the further reaction of oh and ch3c o o with paa through eq 4 8 shi and li 2007 though ch3c o oo has been increasingly recognized as the dominant reactive species in the paa based aops the evidence supporting the role of ch3c o oo is still limited the previous literatures have reported that manganese ion mn2 can rapidly react with peroxy radicals e g alkylperoxyl radicals roo and acylperoxyl radicals r o oo via the electron transfer reactions eq 9 barnese et al 2012 chang and kosman 1989 jee and bakac 2010 the rate constants of mn2 with various peroxy radicals range from 105 to 106 m 1 s 1 table s3 9 m n 2 ro o room n 3 this fact inspires the idea of applying mn2 as the specific quencher for ch3c o oo to investigate the role of ch3c o oo in cbz degradation in the system of ncuo paa the justification of this idea is as follows one concern for using mn2 as the specific quencher for ch3c o oo to investigate the role of ch3c o oo in cbz degradation in the system of ncuo paa is whether mn2 could decrease the generation of reactive species e g ch3c o oo for cbz degradation by consumption of paa in addition to direct quenching of ch3c o oo to make it clear paa decomposition after the addition of mn2 was measured as fig s4a shows the presence of 0 1000 μm mn2 can hardly induce paa decomposition suggesting low reactivity of mn2 towards paa further the unchanged concentration of paa under the co existence of mn2 and cbz excluded the consumption of paa by the possible metal organic complexes fig s4a the reaction of mn2 with h2o2 could also be ignored at the given conditions according to fig s4b besides possible quenching effects of mn2 on other reactive species including oh and other r o except ch3c o oo generated in paa based aops could be another concern especially in view of the possible contribution of oh and ch3c o o for ch3c o oo generation via eqs 4 8 for investigating whether oh could be affected by mn2 uv h2o2 process that can dominantly generate oh was used to degrade cbz in the presence of mn2 results showed that mn2 exhibited no effect on cbz degradation in the uv h2o2 fig s5a suggesting that mn2 could hardly scavenge oh as reported by cai et al 2017 the degradation of cbz in the uv paa system was attributed to the generated oh from fig s5b cbz degradation was not affected after dosing 0 1 mm mn2 which further evidenced that oh generated in paa based aops was resistant to mn2 to further evaluate the effect of mn2 on r o the esr spectra were recorded for paa ncuo solution before and after addition of mn2 using dippmpo as a spin trapping agent the spectra consisted of 20 major esr peaks which were a composite signal formed by the superposition of different adducts fig s6a s6b no typical signal was observed in paa alone or the ncuo h2o2 process with dippmo fig s6c suggesting that the esr peaks were not generated by paa or the ncuo h2o2 process the hyperfine splitting constants ap an and ah were extracted by simulation for further radical identification table s4 indicating the formation of oh ch3c o o ch3 and ch3o2 in the ncuo paa system for example the typical dippmpo trapping adducts for oh 8 line signal indicated as black dots and ch3 12 line signal indicated as red triangles were clearly observed in fig 2 a note that ch3c o oo cannot be simulated from the spectra largely due to its high instability and the lack of related fitting information after addition of mn2 the 20 major peaks in the esr spectrum did not disappear or diminish but increased apparently fig 2b more specifically the intensity of dippmpo oh and dippmpo ch3 adducts were enhanced in the presence of mn2 the increase of the ch3 adducts should be related to the increase of ch3c o o which would induce the increase of ch3o2 based on eqs 5 and 7 respectively these results suggested that oh and these organic radicals including ch3c o o ch3 and ch3o2 could not be scavenged by mn2 moreover the weights of these spectral components significantly increased after dosing mn2 table s4 which might be attributed to the scavenging of ch3c o oo by mn2 to confirm the scavenging effect of mn2 for ch3c o oo generated from paa the impacts of mn2 on the co2 paa and co3o4 paa processes were evaluated in which ch3c o oo is reported as the dominant reactive species for sulfamethoxazole smx according to wang et al 2020d and wu et al 2020 respectively as expected the degradation of smx in these ch3c o oo dominated processes was completely inhibited in the presence of 100 μm mn2 fig s7a s7b accordingly these results strongly supported that mn2 can be used as a specific scavenger for ch3c o oo in paa based aops by using this newly developed quenching method we further explored the role of ch3c o oo on cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process as observed in fig 1d introducing a small amount 5 μm of mn2 clearly inhibited the oxidation of cbz in the ncuo paa process the inhibitory effect for cbz degradation became stronger with higher mn2 dose 5 1000 μm in particular the presence of 100 1000 μm mn2 significantly prevented the degradation of cbz demonstrating that ch3c o oo was the dominant active species contributing to cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process considering that the solution ph decreased from 7 01 to 6 20 with the reaction going on this may alter the degradation mechanism of cbz in the system as the ph changes to make it clear we conducted the quenching experiments at initial ph of 6 30 as shown in fig s8 the presence of tba scavenger for oh showed negligible effect on cbz degradation while meoh scavenger for oh and r o and mn2 scavenger for ch3c o oo significantly inhibited the degradation of cbz these results were identical to the quenching experiments employed at initial ph of 7 01 thus it could be concluded that ch3c o oo was the primary reactive species responsible for cbz degradation in a near neutral environment 3 3 activation mechanism cu iii versus cu i generally cu based aops were proposed to proceed through two alternative ways cu ii cu iii versus cu ii cu i redox cycles chen et al 2019 in the fenton like reactions cu iii could be generated via the electron transfer from cu ii to peroxides e g h2o2 pms pds eq 10 under neutral to alkaline conditions lei et al 2015 according to eq 10 cu iii is supposed to generate in the ncuo paa system the presence of cu iii was examined in the reaction solution by adding periodate as a stabilizer which can generate a stable cu iii periodate complex with a characteristic absorbance at 415 nm wang et al 2020c absence of the characteristic peak at 415 nm in fig s9 suggested that cu iii was not generated in the solution therefore involvement of cu iii in the ncuo paa process could be excluded 10 c u i i h 2 o 2 p d s c u i i i o h s o 4 11 c u i i h 2 o 2 c u i h o 2 c u i o 2 h 12 c u i h 2 o 2 c u i i o h o h 13 c u i i c h 3 c o o o h c u i i o o o c c h 3 h c u i c h 3 c o o o h 14 c u i c h 3 c o o o h c u i i o h c h 3 c o o o r c u i i c h 3 c o o o h alternatively the activation of paa by the surface cu ii on ncuo most likely proceeded via the cu ii cu i cycle recently a method of trapping cu i on the cu ii bearing catalyst surface by neocuproine has been developed owing to the much stronger complexity of neocuproine for cu i log β2 19 1 than cu ii log β2 11 7 ren et al 2020 using this method the interactions of cu i with peroxides could be shielded and thus allowing disclosure of the role of cu i in peroxides activation herein the degradation of cbz significantly decreased after addition of neocuproine in the ncuo paa process fig 1c the considerable suppression of paa decomposition with neocuproine was also observed in fig s10 besides the possible effects of neocuproine on the dominant reactive species i e ch3c o oo was ruled out since the contaminant degradation in a ch3c o oo dominated process e g co2 paa process was not influenced by neocuproine fig s7a these results together revealed that the inhibition of cbz degradation should be attributed to the formation of inactive cu i neocuproine complex the high reactivity of cu i in paa activation was further investigated in two designed experiments in which the aqueous cu was obtained by reducing cu2 with ascorbic acid aa or directly dissolving cucl under strongly acidic conditions details provided in text s5 the addition of aa significantly enhanced the degradation of cbz in the cu2 paa process especially in the initial stage while no promotion was observed with paa or cu2 alone fig s11a moreover a rapid degradation of cbz was also observed in the cucl paa process fig s11b the complete inhibition of cbz degradation by neocuproine in these two processes further proved that it was cu other than cu2 effective for paa activation to provide direct evidence for the generation of cu i xps spectra of the fresh and used ncuo particle were recorded fig s12 in the high resolution spectra of the fresh catalyst the main peak in cu 2p3 2 region at the binding energy of 933 4 ev is assigned to cu ii espinós et al 2002 and the satellite peaks at 940 9 ev and 943 2 ev correspond to the cu ii oxide species li et al 2015 after reaction a new peak at the binding energy of 932 1 ev emerged indicating the formation of cu i jiang et al 2019 the proportion of cu ii species reduced to 63 0 which was probably attributed to the reaction between cu ii and h2o2 paa the above results evidenced that cu ii cu i redox cycle involved in the activation of paa by ncuo significant role of h2o2 h2o2 is always present in the paa solution thus we evaluated whether h2o2 participated in the reaction the presence of h2o2 with the concentration equivalent to or even ten times greater than that in paa solution showed negligible effect on cbz degradation fig s2 suggesting that the co existing h2o2 in paa solution could not directly contribute to the degradation of cbz in the ncuo paa process hence the degradation of cbz was primarily attributed to the activation of paa but not h2o2 noting that the reduction of cu ii to cu i was reported to be the initial step during the reaction between cu ii and h2o2 eq 11 lyu et al 2015 the co existing h2o2 might contribute to the generation of cu i in the ncuo paa process to make it clear ti so4 2 was used as a typical h2o2 chelating agent limvorapitux et al 2017 which could prevent h2o2 from reacting with cu ii from fig 1c the degradation of cbz was inhibited by dosing ti so4 2 implying that h2o2 was likely to contribute to cu i generation to rule out the quenching effect of ti so4 2 on the reactive species in paa based aops the control experiments were also performed in the cu2 paa aa process results showed that ti so4 2 had little effect on cbz degradation in the cu2 paa aa process fig s13 indicating that the radical species were not affacted by ti so4 2 hence the inhibition of cbz degradation by ti so4 2 was most likely attributed to the chelation of h2o2 suggesting the significant role of h2o2 towards cu i generation in the ncuo paa process the rate constant for the reaction of h2o2 with cu i has been reported k h2o2 cu i 4 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 8 wang et al 2020b while the reaction rate constant of paa with cu i is not available to compare the reactivity of cu i in activating h2o2 and paa the decomposition rates of paa and h2o2 catalyzed by cu i were obtained using cucl as a source of cu i as shown in fig s14 the paa decomposition rate significantly increased from 0 029 to 0 072 min 1 with cucl dosing increased from 20 to 100 mg l while h2o2 kept relatively stable under the same conditions the results evidenced that cu i was less reactivity in h2o2 activation than that in paa activation hence it could be assumed that the reaction of cu i with h2o2 was not significant in the ncuo paa process outer sphere versus inner sphere interactions it was reported that the interactions between solute and the particle s surface could proceed through the outer sphere interactions via electrostatic bonding or the inner sphere coordination via covalent bonding or a combination of covalent and ionic bonding zhang et al 2013 the ionic strength could significantly influence the outer sphere interactions rather than the inner sphere coordination stumm 1992 the increase of naclo4 concentration represent the ionic strength from 10 to 200 mm showed a negligible effect on cbz degradation fig 3 a suggesting an inner sphere interaction between paa and the copper reactive sites on ncuo surface the in situ atr ftir was conducted to characterize the chemical interaction on the surface of ncuo with paa from fig 3b ir bands centered at 1550 78 and 1414 30 cm 1 could be assigned to the c o stretching vibration of paa roonasi and holmgren 2010 wijnja and schulthess 2001 the signal of c o stretch was red shifted after paa activation which indicated the decreased strength of c o bond notably three active bands emerged at around 2044 30 2006 31 1973 73 cm 1 respectively which might be attributed to the stretching of o o band silva et al 2011 osako et al 2002 the o o stretch observed after activation meaning an entire o o group was attached to the surface of ncuo these observations supported the formation of cu ii peroxide complexes eq 13 in addition the stretching vibrations of oh on ncuo surface at around 3116 53 cm 1 became much wider and stronger after reacting with paa suggesting that the surface oh groups was formed zhang et al 2013 and actively involved in the activation of paa this result explains the generation of ch3c o o eq 14 in which case paa was split from o o bond to leave oh terminal on ncuo surface neither shift of the typical vibration bands nor new peak formation on ncuo surface after addition of h2o2 fig s15 indicated that ncuo was barely reacts with h2o2 through eqs 10 and 12 therefore either ncuo is nonreactive with h2o2 or ncuo reacts with h2o2 though eq 11 considering paa was proven to be activated by cu i in this study the conversion of cu ii cu i by h2o2 was further supported by this result overall mechanism it was reported that the existing state and property of cu largely determined the performance for peroxide e g h2o2 pms pds activation generally aqueous cu2 exhibited low reactivity towards peroxide oxidants while structural cu ii e g cuo on catalyst surface was much more effective in peroxide activation liang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 peroxide could be activated by structural cu ii via radical or non radical mechanism zhang et al 2014 reported that the non radical process proceeding through the outer sphere interaction between cuo surface and pds anion slightly rearranged the electron distribution of pds rendering it more reactive to accept electrons from organic pollutants as for the radical process pms formed the strong inner sphere complexes with the structural cu ii accompanied by the generation of so4 zhang et al 2013 similarly the inner sphere interaction between paa and surface cu ii formed cu ii peroxide complexes and the stretching of the coordination bonds between the cu ii and ch3c o oo facilitated the electron transfer further generating cu i and ch3c o oo eq 13 the generated cu i in solid phase was much more stable than that in solution which favored the activation towards peroxides liu et al 2022b in the ncuo paa process the co existing h2o2 was found to play a significant role in boosting cu i generation eq 12 fig 4 pathway i the electron transfer from h2o2 to cu ii could be accelerated via the formed surface cu ii peroxide complexes since this strong interaction might induce the rearrangement of cu ii complexes electrons increasing the electron withdrawing power of the bonded surface cu ii zhang et al 2013 after that the in situ generated cu i efficiently catalyzed the decomposition of paa inducing the dominant generation of cu ii oh complexes and ch3c o o eq 14 fig 4 pathway ii with little oh formed the generated ch3c o o would further react with paa generating ch3c o oo eq 4 fig 4 pathway iii that primarily contributed to the degradation of cbz 3 4 products and toxicity assessment to reveal the transformation of cbz attacked by ch3c o oo oh was eliminated by dosing tba in the ncuo paa process the degradation intermediates of cbz in the ncuo paa process were analyzed by uplc ms ms eight main transformation products tps were identified based on the mass to charge ratios m z fig s16 s22 and their empirical formula and molecular structure were summarized in table s5 despite ch3c o oo dominantly contributed to cbz degradation in the ncuo paa system no ch3c o oo substituted or added oxidation products were observed which was consistent with the studies of cai et al 2017 and kim et al 2019 the evolution of tps along the degradation of cbz are shown in fig s23 tp253 10 11 epoxide cbz was the dominant tps with the highest abundance fig s23a suggesting that the hydroxyl addition of the double bond located at heterocyclic ring was the primary pathway for cbz oxidation the abundance of tp253 kept increasing with the reaction time from 0 to 50 min and then slightly decreased indeed the epoxide derivative i e tp253 was found to exhibit relative stability in other study as li et al 2013 the degradation pathway was proposed and illustrated in fig 5 the olefinic double bond with high frontier electron density on the central heterocyclic ring of cbz was considered as the most reactive site on cbz molecule which could be easily attacked by reactive species e g oh and so4 hence ch3c o oo could initially attack the olefinic double bond and induce the generation of tp253 via hydroxyl addition on the ring an alternative pathway was the attack of ch3c o oo via the hydroxylation of the double bond generating monohydroxylated cbz m z 252 hydroxylated products might be generated via the electron transfer from cbz to ch3c o oo inducing the formation of the radical cations that rapidly react with h2o or o2 kim et al 2020 the intermediate monohydroxylated cbz could further undergo dehydration reaction to form tp251 cbz epoxide that was also detected in cbz degradation by uv chlorine and fenton oxidation sun et al 2013 wang et al 2016 besides the subsequent cleavage of amine acrylamido group in tp253 led to the generation of tp210a acridine 9 carboxaldehyde on the other hand tp194 5h dibenzo b f azepine could be generated by the cleavage of c n bond in cbz pan et al 2021 yielding tp210a afterwards tp210a underwent carboxylation primarily via the attack of ch3c o oo to yield tp224 acridine 9 carboxaldehyde followed by the formation of tp180 acridine via de carboxylation the above results proved that the reaction of ch3c o oo with aromatic compounds proceeded as the electron transfer reaction the acute toxicity evolution of cbz after degradation was investigated by evaluating the luminescence inhibition of p phosphoreum t3 a common used toxicity indicator zhang et al 2016 in the cbz free system the relative bioluminescence kept nearly at 100 in 30 min reaction fig s24 suggesting that traces of copper ions leaching from ncuo as well as the decomposition products of paa were innocuous to p phosphoreum t3 obviously the relative bioluminescence in the ncuo paa cbz system gradually increased from 85 9 to 95 8 as the reaction time extended from 0 to 30 min which suggested that the inhibiting effects of cbz was weakened after oxidation hence the degradation of cbz by the ncuo paa process could reduce the overall acute toxicity risk of cbz by transforming cbz into some compounds with less toxicity the toxicity for green algae was further calculated by epa s qsar based ecosar program the cbz compound was very toxic to green algae while the generation of tp253 the dominant products significantly reduced its acute toxicity and chronic toxicity fig s25 table s6 besides other transformation products also had lower acute and chronic toxicity to green algae than the parent compound 3 5 effects of solution ph common water matrices and real water samples on the ncuo paa process fig s26a shows the effects of ph on cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process and results showed that cbz degradation was strongly associated with the solution ph the highest degradation rate was achieved at neutral condition with kobs reached 0 069 min 1 fig s26b neither acidic nor alkaline conditions were conducive to the degradation of cbz as the pka of paa is 8 2 the neutral species of paa paa0 is dominant at acidic conditions the density functional theory dft calculations showed that the optimized paa0 had a shorter o o bond length than that of the anion form of paa paa fig s27 implying that paa0 is more difficult to be activated the previous studies also reported that paa0 is much more stable in the acidic phs wang et al 2020a thus the catalytic decomposition of paa is unfavorable in acidic conditions fig s26c although paa is easier to be activated in the alkaline condition to generate more reactive species for cbz degradation the hydrolysis of paa eq 1 as a non radical process is accelerated at the same time resulting in the high consumption of paa at alkaline phs fig s26c besides the isoelectric point phiep of ncuo was measured to be below 3 0 fig s28 indicating that the catalyst was negatively charged at alkaline phs thus the heterogeneous reaction could be inhibited due to the electrostatic repulsion between paa and ncuo at alkaline phs the alkaline conditions also favored the formation of unreactive copper hydroxide complexes on catalyst surface further reducing the catalytic activity of ncuo accordingly these factors together resulted in the inhibition of cbz degradation at alkaline conditions the effects of paa concentration and ncuo dose were also evaluated at initial ph of 7 0 fig s29 the increased dose of paa 0 13 1 04 mm and ncuo 5 80 mg l 1 accounted for higher cbz degradation fig s29a d mostly owing to the enhanced generation of reactive species discussed in detail in text s6 the impacts of common water matrices including inorganic anions cl po4 3 co3 2 hco3 and organic components represented by humic acids ha were further examined results showed that the cbz degradation was less affected by cl and po4 3 fig s30 while it was significantly inhibited by co3 2 hco3 fig s31a as shown in fig s31e the decomposition of paa in the ncuo paa process was not affected by co3 2 hco3 0 2 0 mm thus the inhibition of cbz degradation is expected to result from the quenching of the reactive species by co3 2 hco3 co3 2 hco3 is known as a common scavenger for oh k oh co32 of 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 k oh hco3 of 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 while the reactivity of co3 2 hco3 with ch3c o oo is largely uncertain as shown in fig s31b the degradation of cbz slightly decreased from 0 07 to 0 053 min 1 in the ncuo paa process as the co3 2 hco3 dose increased from 0 to 0 2 mm which was likely attributed to inactivation of oh by co3 2 hco3 indeed the kobs of cbz degradation remained unchanged at the same conditions in the ncuo paa tba process fig s31c s31d the results evidenced that the slight inhibition of cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process by low concentration of co3 2 hco3 was due to the scavenging of oh significant suppression in the ncuo paa process with and without tba presence were observed when the concentration of co3 2 hco3 was further increased to 2 0 mm which might be attributed to the quenching of the r o primarily ch3c o o and ch3c o oo the results implied that r o had higher resistance towards co3 2 hco3 than oh the inhibitory effects of ha 0 2 mg l 1 on cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process was shown in fig s32a the degradation of cbz declined from 87 to 61 0 after dosing 2 0 mg l 1 ha which was primarily attributed to the scavenging of the reactive species by ha fig s31b text s7 to test the application prospects of this novel technique the efficiency of cbz degradation was evaluated in real water matrix surface water sw wastewater ww the characteristics of the water samples are provided in table s7 as fig s33 shows the removals of cbz were insignificantly affected by the real waters with the removal rates slightly reduced to 82 and 74 in the sw and ww samples respectively the results suggested that this process could be a promising candidate for wastewater decontamination 3 6 selective oxidation of organic contaminants with ch3c o oo the reactivity of ch3c o oo towards various organic contaminants including nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba phenol bisphenol a bpa ciprofloxacin cip enrofloxacin enf sulfamethizol smiz sulfadiazine sdz was also studied the adsorption by ncuo and oxidation by paa for all selected compounds were insignificant at the given conditions data not shown degradation of the eight aromatic compounds after 30 min in the ncuo paa process followed the order nb 2 ba 20 phenol 42 smiz 73 cip 88 sdz 90 enf 95 bpa 100 fig 6 a the homo molecular orbital structures of the aromatic compounds are shown in fig s34 obviously ch3c o oo prefers to degrade those contaminants containing electron rich functional groups moieties e g primary amine or secondary amine which is similar to several nonradical reactive species e g 1o2 and fe iv reported in previous studies gao et al 2020 ye et al 2017 among various molecular descriptors the ionization potential ip of the organic compounds could closely reflect their reactivity in oxidation processes hu et al 2017 shishu et al 2018 generally the ip of the organics can be lowered with electron donating moieties e g hydroxyl and amine but increased with electron withdrawing moieties e g carboxyl and nitrophenyl luo et al 2017 to evaluate the substrate specificity of ch3c o oo oxidation the relationship between ip values and degradation rates of the contaminants was established as shown in fig 6b a probable ip threshold at 9 0 ev was observed corresponding to the oxidative ability of ch3c o oo towards organic pollutants nb and ba with ip values beyond the threshold can hardly be degraded in the ncuo paa process whereas the compounds phenol smiz cip sdz enf and bpa with lower ip values were prone to be oxidized and the degradation rate constants negatively correlated to the ip value 3 7 reusability and stability of the catalysts the reusability of ncuo was investigated in the activation of paa no significant decrease of cbz degradation was observed after four cycle runs fig s35a indicating that ncuo exhibited a high reusability in paa activation under near neutral ph further the amount of cu leached in each run was also measured fig s35b the leached cu2 slightly decreased from 80 to 75 μg l 1 with the cyclic runs which was much lower than the health reference level of cu 1 mg l 1 in drinking water standards for drinking water quality national standard of p r china gb5749 2006 the low and stable metal ion percolation also implies the stability of the catalyst interestingly we found that the presence of paa promoted the dissolution of copper which could be explained by the formed inner sphere coordination between paa and the surface of ncuo zhang et al 2014 the leached copper ion was further tested for the activation of paa to degrade cbz fig s36 showed that cu2 80 μg l 1 as well as the leachate could not activate paa to degrade cbz hence the contribution of the homogeneous catalysis by the leached cu2 was negligible the stability of ncuo catalyst after four cycle runs was evaluated through xrd analysis the xrd patterns of the fresh and used ncuo showed negligible distinction fig s37 suggesting high stability of the crystal structure of ncuo during the activation of paa 4 conclusion this study unveiled the high efficiency of ncuo in paa activation under near neutral conditions for the first time the cu ii cu i redox cycle on ncuo surface strongly boosted the catylytic decomposition of paa to produce reactive species while the co existing h2o2 played a significant role in the conversion of cu ii to cu i the structural cu ii as well as the formed cu ii peroxide complexes are expected to facilitate the conversion in this novel paa based aops ch3c o oo was proved as the dominant reactive species in cbz degradation which could selectively oxidize those aromatic compounds with electron rich functional groups the degradtion of cbz in the ncuo paa process was less affacted by real wastewater matrix suggesting its prospect in wastewater treatment moreover the formed acetic acid during paa decomposition is a potential good carbon source for the subsequent biological treatment processes hence the ncuo paa process would be a promising technology in wastewater treatment and the knowledge obtained in this study will further advance the development of paa based aops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16095,peracetic acid paa based advanced oxidation processes aops has attracted increasing attentions towards contaminant degradation in the wastewater treatment herein we report the efficient activation of paa by nano cuo ncuo paa to degrade carbamazepine cbz for the first time rapid degradation of cbz was observed in the ncuo paa system at neutral initial ph a new scavenging experiment with mn2 as a specific scavenger was developed to distinguish the dominant role of ch3c o oo for cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process the oxidation of cbz by ch3c o oo was verified to proceed via the electrons transfer and the acute and chronic toxicity of the transformation products was significantly reduced the efficient activation of paa by ncuo was found to be realized through continuous conversion of cu ii to cu i which was significantly boosted by co existing h2o2 the ncuo paa process was slightly affected by the water matrices and maintained high efficiency in real water samples the findings obtained in this study provide new insights into the catalytic formation of ch3c o oo from paa and facilitate the development and application of paa based aops in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes aops peracetic acid copper oxide nanoparticle ncuo carbamazepine cbz acetylperoxy radical 1 introduction peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh a strong peroxyacid oxidant has been widely used in food industry and health care luukkonen and pehkonen 2016 paa emerged as a promising disinfectant in wastewater disinfection owing to the high efficiency for pathogenic microorganisms inactivation and little formation of toxic byproducts balachandran et al 2021 liu et al 2022a in recent years activation of paa to generate reactive species mainly hydroxyl radical oh and organic radicals r o has attracted growing interests in advanced oxidation processes aops for enhancing degradation of refractory organic pollutants in wastewater paa has a much weaker peroxyl bond o o eo o paa 159 kj mol 1 than some commonly used peroxide oxidants such as h2o2 eo o h2o2 213 kj mol 1 and peroxymonosulfate pms eo o pms 317 kj mol 1 zhang et al 2021a thus the formation of reactive radicals via paa dissociation is thermodynamically feasible the homolysis of the o oh bond in paa could generate oh and various r o such as acetoxyl radical ch3c o o and acetylperoxy radical ch3c o oo cai et al 2017 however the dominant reactive species accounting for organic contaminants oxidation largely depends on the activation methods for example uv irradiation could trigger the direct cleavage of o oh bond of paa generating oh and ch3c o o with oh dominated in contaminant oxidation cai et al 2017 in contrast r o is predominantly generated and responsible for organic pollutants oxidation in the transition metal activated paa aops kim et al 2019 as one of the most powerful peroxyl radicals ch3c o oo has been increasingly regarded as the key reactive species in r o for contaminant degradation kim et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b nevertheless the existence of multiple reactive radicals in paa based aops makes it challenging to discriminate the role of ch3c o oo the quenching method using tert butyl alcohol tba and 2 4 hexadiene 2 4 hd as scavengers was frequently employed to distinguish 67 the contribution of oh and acetyl per oxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo tba is an effective scavenger for oh but not for acetyl per oxyl radicals while 2 4 hd can rapidly quench oh and acetyl per oxyl radicals kim et al 2020 however the current approach fails to determine the respective roles of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and the generation of ch3c o oo could be suppressed by dosing excess tba because the reaction between oh and paa k oh paa 1 3 109 m 1 s 1 is an important pathway for ch3c o oo generation therefore it is highly required to develop an effective method to distinguish the contribution of ch3c o oo in paa based aops the activation with transition metals is among the hot topic in paa based aops and co2 is generally considered as the most effective activator for paa in comparison with other transition metals e g fe2 cu2 and mn2 zhang et al 1998 however the toxicity and non recyclability of co2 limits its wide application in wastewater treatment hu and long 2016 heterogeneous activation of paa with cobalt catalysts e g co3o4 has received increasing attention wu et al 2020 but the potential high toxicity of the leached cobalt ion remains a concern in this work we tested dozens of metal oxide nanoparticles nmops for paa activation and surprisingly found that copper oxide nanoparticle ncuo possessed the highest reactivity in catalyzing paa decomposition among the nmops including the previously reported nco3o4 wu et al 2020 this interesting discovery motivated us to conduct an in depth study to elucidate the reactivity and the mechanism of ncuo activation of paa carbamazepine cbz a typical refractory organic pollutant was used in this work to investigate the reaction mechanism of ncuo paa for wastewater treatment the extensive quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr technique were conducted to reveal the reactive species in the ncuo paa process a new quenching experiment with mn2 was developed to distinguish the primary contribution of ch3c o oo to contaminant degradation in the ncuo paa process we further extended the study to various organic contaminants to evaluate the selectivity of ch3c o oo transformation products of cbz and the toxicity variation were investigated to assess the environmental impacts of the effluent generated from ncuo paa system moreover atr ftir and xps techniques were used to characterize the cu species variation on the solid surface to elucidate the activation mechanism the significant role of h2o2 co existed in paa solution in the catalytic reaction of paa with ncuo was revealed to our best knowledge this study is among the first to elucidate the activation mechanism of paa by ncuo and provide a solid evidence for the contribution of ch3c o oo to the degradation of cbz in the system the new knowledge has important implications for application of paa based aops in the wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sources of chemicals and reagents are provided in the supporting information text s1 2 2 experimental procedures the catalytic oxidation reactions were carried out in a 100 ml glass reactor with continuous magnetic stirring at an ambient temperature of 20 2 c reactions were initiated by adding ncuo 0 5 8 0 mg into 100 ml solution containing paa 0 13 1 04 mm and cbz 2 12 21 16 μm if it was not otherwise specified the initial ph was adjusted by naoh 0 2 m and h2so4 0 1 m with no buffer employed in most cases the experiments were conducted at initial ph of 7 0 and the solution ph slightly decreased to about 6 2 after reaction in the study of the effects of solution ph on cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process the solution ph was controlled by dosing 10 mm acetate buffer when ph was set at 6 30 and 10 mm borate buffer at ph of 7 01 or higher no buffer was applied under acidic conditions because the ph change was minimal at these conditions as the reaction proceeded 1 0 ml of solution were extracted at predetermined time intervals and immediately quenched with excess na2s2o3 10 mm prior to analysis the concentration of cbz and other organic compounds were detected by 1260 infinity hplc agilent usa equipped with a uv detector and an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm the analytical methods of the tested contaminants are summarized in table s1 for reusability and stability tests the ncuo catalyst was recovered by centrifugation and washed with purified water for several times then dried in a vacuum oven at 40 c the uv instrument employed in uv h2o2 and uv paa processes was described in detail in text s2 2 3 analytical methods the paa concentration was measured according to the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method apha awwa wef 1998 the crystal structures chemical states and surface charge ζ potential of the catalyst was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance diffractometer bruker germany x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific inc usa and a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk respectively the concentration of leached copper was quantified by mass spectrometer with inductively coupled plasma agilent 7700 icp ms usa the electron spin resonance esr analysis was carried out to characterize the reactive species by using 5 diisopropoxyphosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dippmpo as a trapping agent followed by the simulation of

scitific details shown in text s3 the acute toxicity assay was carried out against the photobacterium phosphoreum t3 wang et al 2017 the toxicity interference caused by paa and h2o2 was effectively eliminated by na2s2o3 and catalase with a stoichiometric amount respectively ecological structure activity relationship model ecosar program was also employed to estimate the acute and chronic toxicity kuang et al 2013 detailed information for toxicity analysis is described in text s3 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo molecular orbital analysis were performed by the gaussian 09 program with b3lyp functional method at 6 31 g d p level 3 results and discussion 3 1 activations of paa by nmops ten nmops ncuo nco3o4 nnio nfe3o4 nceo2 nzno nal2o3 nmgo nzro2 and nsno2 were tested for catalyzing paa decomposition at neutral initial ph as shown in fig 1 a paa underwent significant decomposition catalyzed by ncuo nco3o4 nnio nfe3o4 and nceo2 and showed negligible or slight decomposition with other nmops we further evaluated the degradation of cbz in the nmops paa and control systems results show that cbz was nondegradable with paa or nmops alone fig s1a but could be obviously degraded in ncuo paa nco3o4 paa nnio paa and nfe3o4 paa systems fig 1b this indicates a possibility that reactive species may be generated after paa activation based on the study of cai et al 2017 which reported the contribution of oh and r o to the degradation of pharmaceuticals in uv paa among these four nmops ncuo was the most efficient for paa activation to destruct cbz despite its surface area was one of the lowest table s2 the apparent degradation rate constant of cbz in the ncuo paa process was more than 2 times greater than that in the nco3o4 paa process 0 07 min 1 vs 0 03 min 1 fig s1b moreover the degradation of cbz in the ncuo paa system was comparable to the ncuo pms system and was much higher than the ncuo pds system fig s2 3 2 evidence of ch3c o oo contribution the activation of paa with transition metal based catalysts is a complicated process since multiple radicals oh and r o with different reactivity are generated via chain reactions eqs 2 8 the radical chain reactions are triggered by the o o bond cleavage of paa via two competing pathways to primarily generate oh or ch3c o o eqs 2 3 rokhina et al 2010 1 c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o oh h 2 o 2 2 c h 3 c o ooh m n 1 c h 3 c o o m n oh 3 c h 3 c o ooh m n 1 c h 3 c o o m n oh 4 c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o o c h 3 c o oh 5 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 6 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o 2 7 c h 3

degradation of p cba was completely inhibited after addition of tba a typical oh quencher k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 the results strongly suggested that oh was generated but in a small amount in the system radical scavenging experiments were further conducted to assess the contribution of oh and r o to cbz degradation in the ncuo paa system tba is an effective quencher for oh but not for r o due to the absence of α h in tba molecule cai et al 2017 kim et al 2020 while methanol meoh with a α h can scavenge both oh and r o based on the study of wang et al 2020d from fig 1c the addition of tba had a negligible effect on cbz degradation indicating that oh was not a significant reactive species responsible for cbz degradation in contrast the degradation of cbz was completely inhibited after dosing meoh hence the degradation of cbz in the ncuo paa process was not primarily contributed from oh but more likely from r o as another primary r o ch3c o o could contribute to cbz degradation through two pathways i direct oxidation ii indirect action via further generating other r o including ch3 ch3o2 and ch3c o oo through eqs 2 3 and 7 wang et al 2020d at the current experimental conditions paa 0 52 mm cbz 4 23 μm the direct oxidation of ch3c o o for cbz could be overlooked according to the comprehensively discussion in text s4 the self decay reaction a typical β cleavage reaction of ch3c o o could generate ch3 eq 5 which is highly unstable in oxygen to form ch3o2 eq 7 k 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 marchaj et al 1991 both ch3 and ch3o2 have low reactivity huie and neta 2010 and exhibited a negligible contribution to cbz degradation text s4 hence ch3c o oo one of the most powerful peroxyl radicals is expected to play a significant role in cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process ch3c o oo could be generated via the further reaction of oh and ch3c o o with paa through eq 4 8 shi and li 2007 though ch3c o oo has been increasingly recognized as the dominant reactive species in the paa based aops the evidence supporting the role of ch3c o oo is still limited the previous literatures have reported that manganese ion mn2 can rapidly react with peroxy radicals e g alkylperoxyl radicals roo and acylperoxyl radicals r o oo via the electron transfer reactions eq 9 barnese et al 2012 chang and kosman 1989 jee and bakac 2010 the rate constants of mn2 with various peroxy radicals range from 105 to 106 m 1 s 1 table s3 9 m n 2 ro o room n 3 this fact inspires the idea of applying mn2 as the specific quencher for ch3c o oo to investigate the role of ch3c o oo in cbz degradation in the system of ncuo paa the justification of this idea is as follows one concern for using mn2 as the specific quencher for ch3c o oo to investigate the role of ch3c o oo in cbz degradation in the system of ncuo paa is whether mn2 could decrease the generation of reactive species e g ch3c o oo for cbz degradation by consumption of paa in addition to direct quenching of ch3c o oo to make it clear paa decomposition after the addition of mn2 was measured as fig s4a shows the presence of 0 1000 μm mn2 can hardly induce paa decomposition suggesting low reactivity of mn2 towards paa further the unchanged concentration of paa under the co existence of mn2 and cbz excluded the consumption of paa by the possible metal organic complexes fig s4a the reaction of mn2 with h2o2 could also be ignored at the given conditions according to fig s4b besides possible quenching effects of mn2 on other reactive species including oh and other r o except ch3c o oo generated in paa based aops could be another concern especially in view of the possible contribution of oh and ch3c o o for ch3c o oo generation via eqs 4 8 for investigating whether oh could be affected by mn2 uv h2o2 process that can dominantly generate oh was used to degrade cbz in the presence of mn2 results showed that mn2 exhibited no effect on cbz degradation in the uv h2o2 fig s5a suggesting that mn2 could hardly scavenge oh as reported by cai et al 2017 the degradation of cbz in the uv paa system was attributed to the generated oh from fig s5b cbz degradation was not affected after dosing 0 1 mm mn2 which further evidenced that oh generated in paa based aops was resistant to mn2 to further evaluate the effect of mn2 on r o the esr spectra were recorded for paa ncuo solution before and after addition of mn2 using dippmpo as a spin trapping agent the spectra consisted of 20 major esr peaks which were a composite signal formed by the superposition of different adducts fig s6a s6b no typical signal was observed in paa alone or the ncuo h2o2 process with dippmo fig s6c suggesting that the esr peaks were not generated by paa or the ncuo h2o2 process the hyperfine splitting constants ap an and ah were extracted by simulation for further radical identification table s4 indicating the formation of oh ch3c o o ch3 and ch3o2 in the ncuo paa system for example the typical dippmpo trapping adducts for oh 8 line signal indicated as black dots and ch3 12 line signal indicated as red triangles were clearly observed in fig 2 a note that ch3c o oo cannot be simulated from the spectra largely due to its high instability and the lack of related fitting information after addition of mn2 the 20 major peaks in the esr spectrum did not disappear or diminish but increased apparently fig 2b more specifically the intensity of dippmpo oh and dippmpo ch3 adducts were enhanced in the presence of mn2 the increase of the ch3 adducts should be related to the increase of ch3c o o which would induce the increase of ch3o2 based on eqs 5 and 7 respectively these results suggested that oh and these organic radicals including ch3c o o ch3 and ch3o2 could not be scavenged by mn2 moreover the weights of these spectral components significantly increased after dosing mn2 table s4 which might be attributed to the scavenging of ch3c o oo by mn2 to confirm the scavenging effect of mn2 for ch3c o oo generated from paa the impacts of mn2 on the co2 paa and co3o4 paa processes were evaluated in which ch3c o oo is reported as the dominant reactive species for sulfamethoxazole smx according to wang et al 2020d and wu et al 2020 respectively as expected the degradation of smx in these ch3c o oo dominated processes was completely inhibited in the presence of 100 μm mn2 fig s7a s7b accordingly these results strongly supported that mn2 can be used as a specific scavenger for ch3c o oo in paa based aops by using this newly developed quenching method we further explored the role of ch3c o oo on cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process as observed in fig 1d introducing a small amount 5 μm of mn2 clearly inhibited the oxidation of cbz in the ncuo paa process the inhibitory effect for cbz degradation became stronger with higher mn2 dose 5 1000 μm in particular the presence of 100 1000 μm mn2 significantly prevented the degradation of cbz demonstrating that ch3c o oo was the dominant active species contributing to cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process considering that the solution ph decreased from 7 01 to 6 20 with the reaction going on this may alter the degradation mechanism of cbz in the system as the ph changes to make it clear we conducted the quenching experiments at initial ph of 6 30 as shown in fig s8 the presence of tba scavenger for oh showed negligible effect on cbz degradation while meoh scavenger for oh and r o and mn2 scavenger for ch3c o oo significantly inhibited the degradation of cbz these results were identical to the quenching experiments employed at initial ph of 7 01 thus it could be concluded that ch3c o oo was the primary reactive species responsible for cbz degradation in a near neutral environment 3 3 activation mechanism cu iii versus cu i generally cu based aops were proposed to proceed through two alternative ways cu ii cu iii versus cu ii cu i redox cycles chen et al 2019 in the fenton like reactions cu iii could be generated via the electron transfer from cu ii to peroxides e g h2o2 pms pds eq 10 under neutral to alkaline conditions lei et al 2015 according to eq 10 cu iii is supposed to generate in the ncuo paa system the presence of cu iii was examined in the reaction solution by adding periodate as a stabilizer which can generate a stable cu iii periodate complex with a characteristic absorbance at 415 nm wang et al 2020c absence of the characteristic peak at 415 nm in fig s9 suggested that cu iii was not generated in the solution therefore involvement of cu iii in the ncuo paa process could be excluded 10 c u i i h 2 o 2 p d s c u i i i o h s o 4 11 c u i i h 2 o 2 c u i h o 2 c u i o 2 h 12 c u i h 2 o 2 c u i i o h o h 13 c u i i c h 3 c o o o h c u i i o o o c c h 3 h c u i c h 3 c o o o h 14 c u i c h 3 c o o o h c u i i o h c h 3 c o o o r c u i i c h 3 c o o o h alternatively the activation of paa by the surface cu ii on ncuo most likely proceeded via the cu ii cu i cycle recently a method of trapping cu i on the cu ii bearing catalyst surface by neocuproine has been developed owing to the much stronger complexity of neocuproine for cu i log β2 19 1 than cu ii log β2 11 7 ren et al 2020 using this method the interactions of cu i with peroxides could be shielded and thus allowing disclosure of the role of cu i in peroxides activation herein the degradation of cbz significantly decreased after addition of neocuproine in the ncuo paa process fig 1c the considerable suppression of paa decomposition with neocuproine was also observed in fig s10 besides the possible effects of neocuproine on the dominant reactive species i e ch3c o oo was ruled out since the contaminant degradation in a ch3c o oo dominated process e g co2 paa process was not influenced by neocuproine fig s7a these results together revealed that the inhibition of cbz degradation should be attributed to the formation of inactive cu i neocuproine complex the high reactivity of cu i in paa activation was further investigated in two designed experiments in which the aqueous cu was obtained by reducing cu2 with ascorbic acid aa or directly dissolving cucl under strongly acidic conditions details provided in text s5 the addition of aa significantly enhanced the degradation of cbz in the cu2 paa process especially in the initial stage while no promotion was observed with paa or cu2 alone fig s11a moreover a rapid degradation of cbz was also observed in the cucl paa process fig s11b the complete inhibition of cbz degradation by neocuproine in these two processes further proved that it was cu other than cu2 effective for paa activation to provide direct evidence for the generation of cu i xps spectra of the fresh and used ncuo particle were recorded fig s12 in the high resolution spectra of the fresh catalyst the main peak in cu 2p3 2 region at the binding energy of 933 4 ev is assigned to cu ii espinós et al 2002 and the satellite peaks at 940 9 ev and 943 2 ev correspond to the cu ii oxide species li et al 2015 after reaction a new peak at the binding energy of 932 1 ev emerged indicating the formation of cu i jiang et al 2019 the proportion of cu ii species reduced to 63 0 which was probably attributed to the reaction between cu ii and h2o2 paa the above results evidenced that cu ii cu i redox cycle involved in the activation of paa by ncuo significant role of h2o2 h2o2 is always present in the paa solution thus we evaluated whether h2o2 participated in the reaction the presence of h2o2 with the concentration equivalent to or even ten times greater than that in paa solution showed negligible effect on cbz degradation fig s2 suggesting that the co existing h2o2 in paa solution could not directly contribute to the degradation of cbz in the ncuo paa process hence the degradation of cbz was primarily attributed to the activation of paa but not h2o2 noting that the reduction of cu ii to cu i was reported to be the initial step during the reaction between cu ii and h2o2 eq 11 lyu et al 2015 the co existing h2o2 might contribute to the generation of cu i in the ncuo paa process to make it clear ti so4 2 was used as a typical h2o2 chelating agent limvorapitux et al 2017 which could prevent h2o2 from reacting with cu ii from fig 1c the degradation of cbz was inhibited by dosing ti so4 2 implying that h2o2 was likely to contribute to cu i generation to rule out the quenching effect of ti so4 2 on the reactive species in paa based aops the control experiments were also performed in the cu2 paa aa process results showed that ti so4 2 had little effect on cbz degradation in the cu2 paa aa process fig s13 indicating that the radical species were not affacted by ti so4 2 hence the inhibition of cbz degradation by ti so4 2 was most likely attributed to the chelation of h2o2 suggesting the significant role of h2o2 towards cu i generation in the ncuo paa process the rate constant for the reaction of h2o2 with cu i has been reported k h2o2 cu i 4 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 8 wang et al 2020b while the reaction rate constant of paa with cu i is not available to compare the reactivity of cu i in activating h2o2 and paa the decomposition rates of paa and h2o2 catalyzed by cu i were obtained using cucl as a source of cu i as shown in fig s14 the paa decomposition rate significantly increased from 0 029 to 0 072 min 1 with cucl dosing increased from 20 to 100 mg l while h2o2 kept relatively stable under the same conditions the results evidenced that cu i was less reactivity in h2o2 activation than that in paa activation hence it could be assumed that the reaction of cu i with h2o2 was not significant in the ncuo paa process outer sphere versus inner sphere interactions it was reported that the interactions between solute and the particle s surface could proceed through the outer sphere interactions via electrostatic bonding or the inner sphere coordination via covalent bonding or a combination of covalent and ionic bonding zhang et al 2013 the ionic strength could significantly influence the outer sphere interactions rather than the inner sphere coordination stumm 1992 the increase of naclo4 concentration represent the ionic strength from 10 to 200 mm showed a negligible effect on cbz degradation fig 3 a suggesting an inner sphere interaction between paa and the copper reactive sites on ncuo surface the in situ atr ftir was conducted to characterize the chemical interaction on the surface of ncuo with paa from fig 3b ir bands centered at 1550 78 and 1414 30 cm 1 could be assigned to the c o stretching vibration of paa roonasi and holmgren 2010 wijnja and schulthess 2001 the signal of c o stretch was red shifted after paa activation which indicated the decreased strength of c o bond notably three active bands emerged at around 2044 30 2006 31 1973 73 cm 1 respectively which might be attributed to the stretching of o o band silva et al 2011 osako et al 2002 the o o stretch observed after activation meaning an entire o o group was attached to the surface of ncuo these observations supported the formation of cu ii peroxide complexes eq 13 in addition the stretching vibrations of oh on ncuo surface at around 3116 53 cm 1 became much wider and stronger after reacting with paa suggesting that the surface oh groups was formed zhang et al 2013 and actively involved in the activation of paa this result explains the generation of ch3c o o eq 14 in which case paa was split from o o bond to leave oh terminal on ncuo surface neither shift of the typical vibration bands nor new peak formation on ncuo surface after addition of h2o2 fig s15 indicated that ncuo was barely reacts with h2o2 through eqs 10 and 12 therefore either ncuo is nonreactive with h2o2 or ncuo reacts with h2o2 though eq 11 considering paa was proven to be activated by cu i in this study the conversion of cu ii cu i by h2o2 was further supported by this result overall mechanism it was reported that the existing state and property of cu largely determined the performance for peroxide e g h2o2 pms pds activation generally aqueous cu2 exhibited low reactivity towards peroxide oxidants while structural cu ii e g cuo on catalyst surface was much more effective in peroxide activation liang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 peroxide could be activated by structural cu ii via radical or non radical mechanism zhang et al 2014 reported that the non radical process proceeding through the outer sphere interaction between cuo surface and pds anion slightly rearranged the electron distribution of pds rendering it more reactive to accept electrons from organic pollutants as for the radical process pms formed the strong inner sphere complexes with the structural cu ii accompanied by the generation of so4 zhang et al 2013 similarly the inner sphere interaction between paa and surface cu ii formed cu ii peroxide complexes and the stretching of the coordination bonds between the cu ii and ch3c o oo facilitated the electron transfer further generating cu i and ch3c o oo eq 13 the generated cu i in solid phase was much more stable than that in solution which favored the activation towards peroxides liu et al 2022b in the ncuo paa process the co existing h2o2 was found to play a significant role in boosting cu i generation eq 12 fig 4 pathway i the electron transfer from h2o2 to cu ii could be accelerated via the formed surface cu ii peroxide complexes since this strong interaction might induce the rearrangement of cu ii complexes electrons increasing the electron withdrawing power of the bonded surface cu ii zhang et al 2013 after that the in situ generated cu i efficiently catalyzed the decomposition of paa inducing the dominant generation of cu ii oh complexes and ch3c o o eq 14 fig 4 pathway ii with little oh formed the generated ch3c o o would further react with paa generating ch3c o oo eq 4 fig 4 pathway iii that primarily contributed to the degradation of cbz 3 4 products and toxicity assessment to reveal the transformation of cbz attacked by ch3c o oo oh was eliminated by dosing tba in the ncuo paa process the degradation intermediates of cbz in the ncuo paa process were analyzed by uplc ms ms eight main transformation products tps were identified based on the mass to charge ratios m z fig s16 s22 and their empirical formula and molecular structure were summarized in table s5 despite ch3c o oo dominantly contributed to cbz degradation in the ncuo paa system no ch3c o oo substituted or added oxidation products were observed which was consistent with the studies of cai et al 2017 and kim et al 2019 the evolution of tps along the degradation of cbz are shown in fig s23 tp253 10 11 epoxide cbz was the dominant tps with the highest abundance fig s23a suggesting that the hydroxyl addition of the double bond located at heterocyclic ring was the primary pathway for cbz oxidation the abundance of tp253 kept increasing with the reaction time from 0 to 50 min and then slightly decreased indeed the epoxide derivative i e tp253 was found to exhibit relative stability in other study as li et al 2013 the degradation pathway was proposed and illustrated in fig 5 the olefinic double bond with high frontier electron density on the central heterocyclic ring of cbz was considered as the most reactive site on cbz molecule which could be easily attacked by reactive species e g oh and so4 hence ch3c o oo could initially attack the olefinic double bond and induce the generation of tp253 via hydroxyl addition on the ring an alternative pathway was the attack of ch3c o oo via the hydroxylation of the double bond generating monohydroxylated cbz m z 252 hydroxylated products might be generated via the electron transfer from cbz to ch3c o oo inducing the formation of the radical cations that rapidly react with h2o or o2 kim et al 2020 the intermediate monohydroxylated cbz could further undergo dehydration reaction to form tp251 cbz epoxide that was also detected in cbz degradation by uv chlorine and fenton oxidation sun et al 2013 wang et al 2016 besides the subsequent cleavage of amine acrylamido group in tp253 led to the generation of tp210a acridine 9 carboxaldehyde on the other hand tp194 5h dibenzo b f azepine could be generated by the cleavage of c n bond in cbz pan et al 2021 yielding tp210a afterwards tp210a underwent carboxylation primarily via the attack of ch3c o oo to yield tp224 acridine 9 carboxaldehyde followed by the formation of tp180 acridine via de carboxylation the above results proved that the reaction of ch3c o oo with aromatic compounds proceeded as the electron transfer reaction the acute toxicity evolution of cbz after degradation was investigated by evaluating the luminescence inhibition of p phosphoreum t3 a common used toxicity indicator zhang et al 2016 in the cbz free system the relative bioluminescence kept nearly at 100 in 30 min reaction fig s24 suggesting that traces of copper ions leaching from ncuo as well as the decomposition products of paa were innocuous to p phosphoreum t3 obviously the relative bioluminescence in the ncuo paa cbz system gradually increased from 85 9 to 95 8 as the reaction time extended from 0 to 30 min which suggested that the inhibiting effects of cbz was weakened after oxidation hence the degradation of cbz by the ncuo paa process could reduce the overall acute toxicity risk of cbz by transforming cbz into some compounds with less toxicity the toxicity for green algae was further calculated by epa s qsar based ecosar program the cbz compound was very toxic to green algae while the generation of tp253 the dominant products significantly reduced its acute toxicity and chronic toxicity fig s25 table s6 besides other transformation products also had lower acute and chronic toxicity to green algae than the parent compound 3 5 effects of solution ph common water matrices and real water samples on the ncuo paa process fig s26a shows the effects of ph on cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process and results showed that cbz degradation was strongly associated with the solution ph the highest degradation rate was achieved at neutral condition with kobs reached 0 069 min 1 fig s26b neither acidic nor alkaline conditions were conducive to the degradation of cbz as the pka of paa is 8 2 the neutral species of paa paa0 is dominant at acidic conditions the density functional theory dft calculations showed that the optimized paa0 had a shorter o o bond length than that of the anion form of paa paa fig s27 implying that paa0 is more difficult to be activated the previous studies also reported that paa0 is much more stable in the acidic phs wang et al 2020a thus the catalytic decomposition of paa is unfavorable in acidic conditions fig s26c although paa is easier to be activated in the alkaline condition to generate more reactive species for cbz degradation the hydrolysis of paa eq 1 as a non radical process is accelerated at the same time resulting in the high consumption of paa at alkaline phs fig s26c besides the isoelectric point phiep of ncuo was measured to be below 3 0 fig s28 indicating that the catalyst was negatively charged at alkaline phs thus the heterogeneous reaction could be inhibited due to the electrostatic repulsion between paa and ncuo at alkaline phs the alkaline conditions also favored the formation of unreactive copper hydroxide complexes on catalyst surface further reducing the catalytic activity of ncuo accordingly these factors together resulted in the inhibition of cbz degradation at alkaline conditions the effects of paa concentration and ncuo dose were also evaluated at initial ph of 7 0 fig s29 the increased dose of paa 0 13 1 04 mm and ncuo 5 80 mg l 1 accounted for higher cbz degradation fig s29a d mostly owing to the enhanced generation of reactive species discussed in detail in text s6 the impacts of common water matrices including inorganic anions cl po4 3 co3 2 hco3 and organic components represented by humic acids ha were further examined results showed that the cbz degradation was less affected by cl and po4 3 fig s30 while it was significantly inhibited by co3 2 hco3 fig s31a as shown in fig s31e the decomposition of paa in the ncuo paa process was not affected by co3 2 hco3 0 2 0 mm thus the inhibition of cbz degradation is expected to result from the quenching of the reactive species by co3 2 hco3 co3 2 hco3 is known as a common scavenger for oh k oh co32 of 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 k oh hco3 of 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 while the reactivity of co3 2 hco3 with ch3c o oo is largely uncertain as shown in fig s31b the degradation of cbz slightly decreased from 0 07 to 0 053 min 1 in the ncuo paa process as the co3 2 hco3 dose increased from 0 to 0 2 mm which was likely attributed to inactivation of oh by co3 2 hco3 indeed the kobs of cbz degradation remained unchanged at the same conditions in the ncuo paa tba process fig s31c s31d the results evidenced that the slight inhibition of cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process by low concentration of co3 2 hco3 was due to the scavenging of oh significant suppression in the ncuo paa process with and without tba presence were observed when the concentration of co3 2 hco3 was further increased to 2 0 mm which might be attributed to the quenching of the r o primarily ch3c o o and ch3c o oo the results implied that r o had higher resistance towards co3 2 hco3 than oh the inhibitory effects of ha 0 2 mg l 1 on cbz degradation in the ncuo paa process was shown in fig s32a the degradation of cbz declined from 87 to 61 0 after dosing 2 0 mg l 1 ha which was primarily attributed to the scavenging of the reactive species by ha fig s31b text s7 to test the application prospects of this novel technique the efficiency of cbz degradation was evaluated in real water matrix surface water sw wastewater ww the characteristics of the water samples are provided in table s7 as fig s33 shows the removals of cbz were insignificantly affected by the real waters with the removal rates slightly reduced to 82 and 74 in the sw and ww samples respectively the results suggested that this process could be a promising candidate for wastewater decontamination 3 6 selective oxidation of organic contaminants with ch3c o oo the reactivity of ch3c o oo towards various organic contaminants including nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba phenol bisphenol a bpa ciprofloxacin cip enrofloxacin enf sulfamethizol smiz sulfadiazine sdz was also studied the adsorption by ncuo and oxidation by paa for all selected compounds were insignificant at the given conditions data not shown degradation of the eight aromatic compounds after 30 min in the ncuo paa process followed the order nb 2 ba 20 phenol 42 smiz 73 cip 88 sdz 90 enf 95 bpa 100 fig 6 a the homo molecular orbital structures of the aromatic compounds are shown in fig s34 obviously ch3c o oo prefers to degrade those contaminants containing electron rich functional groups moieties e g primary amine or secondary amine which is similar to several nonradical reactive species e g 1o2 and fe iv reported in previous studies gao et al 2020 ye et al 2017 among various molecular descriptors the ionization potential ip of the organic compounds could closely reflect their reactivity in oxidation processes hu et al 2017 shishu et al 2018 generally the ip of the organics can be lowered with electron donating moieties e g hydroxyl and amine but increased with electron withdrawing moieties e g carboxyl and nitrophenyl luo et al 2017 to evaluate the substrate specificity of ch3c o oo oxidation the relationship between ip values and degradation rates of the contaminants was established as shown in fig 6b a probable ip threshold at 9 0 ev was observed corresponding to the oxidative ability of ch3c o oo towards organic pollutants nb and ba with ip values beyond the threshold can hardly be degraded in the ncuo paa process whereas the compounds phenol smiz cip sdz enf and bpa with lower ip values were prone to be oxidized and the degradation rate constants negatively correlated to the ip value 3 7 reusability and stability of the catalysts the reusability of ncuo was investigated in the activation of paa no significant decrease of cbz degradation was observed after four cycle runs fig s35a indicating that ncuo exhibited a high reusability in paa activation under near neutral ph further the amount of cu leached in each run was also measured fig s35b the leached cu2 slightly decreased from 80 to 75 μg l 1 with the cyclic runs which was much lower than the health reference level of cu 1 mg l 1 in drinking water standards for drinking water quality national standard of p r china gb5749 2006 the low and stable metal ion percolation also implies the stability of the catalyst interestingly we found that the presence of paa promoted the dissolution of copper which could be explained by the formed inner sphere coordination between paa and the surface of ncuo zhang et al 2014 the leached copper ion was further tested for the activation of paa to degrade cbz fig s36 showed that cu2 80 μg l 1 as well as the leachate could not activate paa to degrade cbz hence the contribution of the homogeneous catalysis by the leached cu2 was negligible the stability of ncuo catalyst after four cycle runs was evaluated through xrd analysis the xrd patterns of the fresh and used ncuo showed negligible distinction fig s37 suggesting high stability of the crystal structure of ncuo during the activation of paa 4 conclusion this study unveiled the high efficiency of ncuo in paa activation under near neutral conditions for the first time the cu ii cu i redox cycle on ncuo surface strongly boosted the catylytic decomposition of paa to produce reactive species while the co existing h2o2 played a significant role in the conversion of cu ii to cu i the structural cu ii as well as the formed cu ii peroxide complexes are expected to facilitate the conversion in this novel paa based aops ch3c o oo was proved as the dominant reactive species in cbz degradation which could selectively oxidize those aromatic compounds with electron rich functional groups the degradtion of cbz in the ncuo paa process was less affacted by real wastewater matrix suggesting its prospect in wastewater treatment moreover the formed acetic acid during paa decomposition is a potential good carbon source for the subsequent biological treatment processes hence the ncuo paa process would be a promising technology in wastewater treatment and the knowledge obtained in this study will further advance the development of paa based aops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16096,understanding the interactions between dissolved organic matter dom and perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas is essential for predicting the distribution transport and fate of pfaas in aquatic environments based on field investigations in the northwest of taihu lake basin combined with laboratory experiments we obtained dom and pfaa concentrations as well as compositions and investigated key factors of dom affecting pfaa variability and capture of pfaas by dom results indicated that the total concentrations of pfaas were 73 4 689 ng l in surface water and that pfaas were dominated by c3 7 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid the main components of dom included tyrosine fulvic and tryptophan like substances the mantel test revealed a significant positive correlation between dom and pfaas p 0 0001 fulvic like substances were identified as the most crucial factors affecting pfaa variability the laboratory experiments revealed that dom can spontaneously aggregate into a microgel furthermore 19 1 50 9 of pfaas dom characteristic peaks and several metals ca mg cu and fe can be removed during aggregation indicating the capacity of dom binding organic inorganic substances the fulvic like substances were more effectively removed than the protein like substances the distribution coefficients of all pfaas except perfluorohexanoic acid significantly correlated with their perfluorinated carbon numbers r 0 975 p 0 001 our results provided insights into the interactions between dom and pfaas improving the understanding of the distribution transport and fate of pfaas in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords interactions perfluoroalkyl acids dissolved organic matters self assembly natural rivers and lakes 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas refer to a family of artificial compounds which exhibit hydrophobicity as well as oleophobicity thermal as well as chemical stability and strong surface active properties nguyen et al 2020 wang et al 2017 they had been extensively used in several consumer products as well as industrial processes such as plastics fire forming foams and surfactants schaider et al 2017 song et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the intrinsically persistent perfluoroalkyl moieties of pfaas made them resistant to oxidation and biodegradation arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 several studies had highlighted that pfaas had severely adverse effects on the ecological environment owing to their high persistence bioavailability and toxicity chen et al 2015 hua et al 2022 wang et al 2017 in addition pfaas were associated with human multisystem diseases and even cancer ojo et al 2020 zeng et al 2019 pfaas had been continuously discharged from fluorine related plants and wastewater treatment plants kim et al 2021 song et al 2018 owing to the relatively high solubility of pfaas surface water was suggested as one of the most important carriers of pfaas chen et al 2019a dong et al 2020 pfaas had been ubiquitously detected in rivers lakes coastal water global oceans and polar regions with observed concentrations ranging from dozens of pg l to dozens of µg l cerro galvez et al 2020 dong et al 2020 muir and miaz 2021 therefore the distribution transport and fate of pfaas after discharge into the environment particularly in surface water have emerged as a global concern dissolved organic matter dom was suggested as a primary factor affecting the environmental behavior of various contaminants such as heavy metals estrogens and antibiotics cheng et al 2017 huang et al 2019 ma and yates 2018 shiu et al 2020 because dom can interact with them and affect their multiphase distribution bioavailability and degradation shiu et al 2020 wen et al 2016 yan et al 2015 the capacity resulted from dom polymers spontaneously aggregating into a microgel or colloids providing a stabilized tangled network with abundant functional groups particularly carboxyl and hydroxyl for capturing contaminants chin et al 1998 shiu and lee 2017 the aggregated dom can lead to the formation of larger particles which could further undergo gravitational settling and affect the mobility sedimentation of the binding contaminants he et al 2016a shiu and lee 2017 ma and yates 2018 reviewed the interaction mechanisms between dom and estrogens moreover they reported that the interactions of estrogen with microgels determined their binding on dom the binding of estrogens was mainly associated with aromatic dom and mechanisms mainly involved in π π interaction and hydrogen bonding shiu and lee 2017 indicated that the capture of heavy metals during dom self assembly into a microgel was accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity of fulvic like substance and humic acid and that the sequestering capacity was associated with ligand interaction these results indicated that the interactions between dom and contaminants were complex and may be associated with dom concentrations and compositions as well as contaminant properties previous studies focused on dom effects on the environmental behavior of pfaas for example dom was reported to considerably decrease the sorption capacity of pfaas on absorbents the bioconcentration of pfaas by organisms and the removal efficiency of pfaas by water treatment plants du et al 2014 kothawala et al 2017 wen et al 2016 our recent study revealed that the microgel can preload 45 5 62 6 of pfaas in overlying water li and hua 2021 indicating a great potential of aggregated dom in binding pfaas the dom pfaas binding might be responsible for the effects of dom on pfaas chen et al 2019b some studies have used model dom substances such as fulvic acid humic acid and bull serum albumin to disclose the binding mechanisms of pfaas with humic substances and proteins liu et al 2021 wen et al 2016 their findings revealed that pfaas binding with humic substances were relevant to electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and their binding to protein involved electrostatic van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding campos pereira et al 2018 chen et al 2015 liu et al 2021 however doms are heterogeneous mixtures containing various humic and aromatic substances bhattacharya and osburn 2020 different components in dom would interact with each other changing the structure and natural properties liu et al 2021 shiu and lee 2017 therefore understanding the interactions between dom and pfaas in natural water particularly the key factors of dom in regulating dom pfaas binding and the role of dom self assembly in capturing pfaas is imperative the main objective of the present study is to provide insights into the interactions between dom and pfaas in natural rivers and lakes the northwest of taihu lake basin with two independent drainage systems having directional flows to taihu lake and variable land use land covered areas such as vegetation farmland and cities and towns provided an ideal setting to acquire various dom and pfaas in rivers and lakes therefore we systematically investigated the concentrations and compositions of both dom and pfaas in the northwest of taihu lake basin the specific objectives are as follows 1 interpreting the dom fluorescence characteristics and pfaa concentrations and compositions in the northwest of taihu lake basin 2 investigating the correlations between dom characteristics and pfaa variability and identifying the key factors 3 exploring the role of dom self assembly in capturing pfaas by laboratory experiments accordingly the interactive mechanisms between dom and pfaas in rivers and lakes were comprehensively discussed results of this study will be helpful to comprehensively understand the role of dom in absorbing pfaas and affecting the fate of pfaa in a natural aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a total of 12 pfaas purity 98 which included perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas with 3 11 perfluorinated carbons c3 11 and c4 6 8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas were used as external standards the isotope labeled perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos 98 were used as internal standards shoemaker and tettenhorst 2018 table s1 shows detailed information on analytical standards hplc grade reagents i e methanol acetonitrile ammonium hydroxide ammonium acetate and milli q water were used throughout the study 2 2 sampling campaign and laboratory experiments 2 2 1 investigation of dom and pfaas in the northwest of taihu lake basin there were 23 sampling sites in the major rivers and lakes in the northwest of taihu lake basin as shown in fig 1 the samplings sites were selected according to the river systems and the common land use land cover as rivers flow through there were 18 sampling sites in the rivers nine in the taoge river system and nine in the yili river system and five in the lakes three in the northwest of taihu lake one in tao lake and one in ge lake among these sites four sites s1 4 were in vegetations seven sites n1 7 were in farmlands seven sites c1 7 were in cities and towns and five sites h1 5 were in lakes furthermore according to the digital elevation model of the study area the terrain in the taoge river system is high in the west and low in the east and the terrain in the yili river system is high in the south the two river systems finally flow into taihu lake from west to east surface water 0 5 m below the water surface was collected and intensively mixed in high density polypropylene bottles water chemical properties were measured on sites simultaneously using a multiparameter water quality analyzer hq30d hash usa as shown in table s2 the water samples were stored in bubble chambers with ice bags and rapidly transported into a laboratory to measure the concentrations and compositions of dom and pfaas 2 2 2 resampling in typical sites and laboratory experiments to further understand the capacity of the dom in binding pfaas laboratory experiments were designed based on the self aggregation affinity of dom representative sites with distinguished dom and pfaas in the northwest of taihu lake basin were selected according to the results of the first samplings by combining field and laboratory experiments the interaction between dom and pfaas in natural rivers and lakes were explored in detail water samples in the representative sites were re collected then these samples were immediately passed through a 0 45 µm filter millipore usa half samples collected from each site were used for the analysis of dissolved organic carbon doc the excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy of dom several metal content ca mg cu and fe and pfaa concentrations the other half samples and procedure blanks were statically stored in the dark at 4 c to provide a stable environment for dom self assembly and to inhibit the microbial activity the aggregate size and zeta potential of dom were monitored at 25 c on days 0 0 5 1 3 5 7 and 10 using a malvern zetasizer nano zse uk based on dynamic light scattering dls after 10 days the samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm filter and the three dimensional spectra and the content of doc metals and pfaas were assayed the filters were dried in a vacuum freeze drier at 40 c for 48 h and were observed in scanning electron microscopy hitachi s 4800 japan table s2 shows the water parameters the particulate size zeta potential doc and metal contents in procedure blanks were all below the detection limits suggesting there were no microgel formed and background pollution occurred in the procedure blanks 2 3 dom analysis water samples were pretreated using 0 45 millipore usa before analysis the content of dom can be indicated via doc concentrations maizel et al 2017 and doc can be determined using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 3100 germany the eem spectroscopy was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 7000 fl spectrophotometer japan to assess the heterogeneity of dom composition six peaks including peak a c s t d and b were identified three indices including the fluorescence index fi index of recent biological productivity contribution bix and index of the relative degree of humification hix were calculated to indicate the source of humic substances autochthonous degree and humification degree respectively bhattacharya and osburn 2020 details of eem and these indices were summarized in table s3 and table s4 the parallel factor parafac analysis was suggested as an effective tool to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the specific fluorescence characteristics of dom because parafac can debase the dimension and decompose the complex eem spectroscopy into fluorescent components vera et al 2017 after the removal of raman and rayleigh scattering we computed two to seven component models with non negativity constraints for the eems derived from the samples obtained in the comprehensive investigation the relative levels of the derived components can be evaluated using the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax r u yang et al 2015 2 4 pfaa analysis the pfaa analysis in water samples was conducted based on our previous study li et al 2021 li and hua 2021 in brief the filtered water samples 0 45 µm extracted by using waters oasis wax cartridges 6 cc 150 mg usa the extracts were further analyzed using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms triple quad 4500 ab sciex singapore detailed information about the uhplc separation and mass spectrometer analyses are shown in text s1 and table s5 the quantification method of pfaas strictly followed the uepa method 537 1 shoemaker and tettenhorst 2018 the limits of detection and the limits of quantification loqs were defined as signal to noise s n ratios of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively then method detection limits mdls were calculated based on the mean concentration and standard deviation of the procedure blank mdl of individual pfaa ranged from 0 0326 to 0 172 ng l the detailed information of lod loq and mdls was summarized in table s6 field blank procedure blank solvent blank and membrane blank were assayed and all pfaa concentrations were below the loqs indicating that no background contamination occurred

analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca was used to profile the distribution of dom main components and pfaas the principal component analysis pca was used to identify the possible source of pfaas possible correlations between dom and pfaas were determined by mantel test key factors of dom affecting pfaas were excavated using the redundancy analysis rda the distribution coefficients of pfaas between microgel and water k m w l kg can be calculated as k m w c w t 0 c w t 10 m c w t 10 where c w t 0 and c w t 10 are the concentrations of pfaas in water on days 0 and 10 respectively ng l and m is the mass of microgel kg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfaa variability in surface water the spatial distribution of pfaas in surface water is depicted in fig 2 a and full details on the concentration ranges and detection frequencies in surface water are summarized in table s8 the most frequently detected pfaas were c3 7 pfcas and pfos 100 detected accounting for 86 1 18 7 of pfaa concentrations in total the highest pfaa level on average in surface water was that of pfba 100 detected concentration range of 17 0 80 6 ng l representing 33 0 10 0 of pfaas the following dominant pfaas were pfoa and pfpea contributing 25 9 7 17 and 5 97 3 36 of pfaas respectively the concentrations of pfaas ranged from 78 1 to 689 ng l in the taoge river system 73 4 175 2 ng l in the yili river system and 106 140 ng l in taihu lake the mean concentrations of pfaas in the aforementioned were 237 ng l 128 ng l and 120 ng l respectively which were comparable with those in previous observations 206 ng l in 2018 and 172 ng l in 2019 an et al 2021 furthermore table s8 summarizes the comparison of pfaa concentration with those in other rivers and lakes worldwide pca and hca were suggested as effective tools to further disclose the pfaa profiles and possible sources an et al 2021 li et al 2020 as shown in fig 2b pca axes 1 and 2 can be attributed to 82 0 and 6 40 of pfaa variability respectively the vectors of c3 7 pfcas positively stretched far along the pc1 axis whereas the vectors of c8 11 pfcas and pfhxs negatively stretched far along the pc1 axis the results indicated that c3 7 pfcas may have the similar sources the similarity of c8 11 pfcas and pfhxs suggested they had similar sources which were different from those of c3 7 pfcas the vectors of pfbs and pfos had larger projection values in the pc2 axis compared to those in pc1 axis indicating the other sources which were different from the sources of c3 7 pfcas may also have considerable contributions moreover two ratio indicators can be used to evaluate the effects of atmospheric deposition and nonpoint sources on the ratios of pfhpa pfoa 0 26 16 and pfoa pfna 2 15 armitage et al 2009 simcik and dorweiler 2005 the pfhpa pfoa ratios ranged from 0 0452 to 0 301 except in site c4 14 3 indicating the atmosphere deposition had slight contributions to pfaas in most sites the computable pfoa pfna ratios were higher than 100 and pfna was not detected in other sites implying the pfaas in this study were derived from the point sources moreover the hca ward s method performed on pfaas in surface water yielded five clusters of sizes 1 2 2 7 and 11 fig 2b cluster i only involved site c4 which had the highest pfaa load 689 11 5 ng l and was dominated by pfhpa 73 9 of pfaas the distinguished load and compositions of pfaas in site c4 may be related to their adjacency to the largest wastewater treatment plants and the electroplating factories in wujin an et al 2021 therefore we hypothesized that the high pfhpa pfoa ratio in site c4 can be attributed to the combined effect of point source emissions and atmospheric transport cluster ii grouped n1 and n4 owing to their comparable pfaas load 558 15 0 ng l for n1 377 52 6 ng l for n4 and similar high pfbs proportions 50 0 n1 is adjacent to plastic packing plants and n4 is located downstream of several facilities including hardware factories metal processing plants chemical plants plastics packing plants textile mills and so on pfbs related substances were used as substitutes of pfos related congeners zhou et al 2013 and were widely detected in environmental media around advanced electronic facilities metal related plants urban industrial and e waste dismantling areas kim et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 moreover the proximity of these facilities may be responsible for the relatively high levels of pfaas and pfbs cluster iii including n2 and s3 was characterized by high proportions of pfos 35 0 clusters iv and v grouped sites with high relative abundances of pfba and pfoa each group representing 20 0 55 0 of pfaas furthermore cluster iv differed from cluster v by the higher proportions of pfbs and pfos hence the pfaa profile in the northwest of taihu lake basin were dominated by c3 7 pfcas and pfos 3 2 dom characteristics in surface water the doc concentrations in water samples varied from 3 30 to 13 8 mg l table s2 the eem spectroscopy of dom was assayed fig s1 and the fluorescence indices of dom were corresponding calculated as shown in fig 3 a b the values of fi hix bix were 1 73 2 13 1 50 2 13 and 0 952 1 27 respectively most sites in taoge river systems except s1 s2 n2 and h1 and taihu lake had fi values higher than 1 90 indicating that the main source was autochthonously derived humic substances whereas yili river systems except n5 and c7 had fi values between 1 40 1 90 exhibiting both terrestrially and autochthonously derived characteristics mcknight et al 2001 the high values of hix indicate a high degree of humification bhattacharya and osburn 2020 the hix values in taoge river systems yili river systems and western taihu lake were 1 50 2 13 1 56 1 84 and 1 70 1 82 respectively suggesting dom in the taoge river system exhibited more variations in hix all samples except n1 h2 and s3 exhibited bix values higher than 1 0 implying that the dom in the present study area was predominantly autochthonous origin our findings revealed that the dom in the rivers and lakes in the northwest taihu lake basin was variable in the source of humic substances and humification degree and were mainly subjected to microbial metabolism three major components were further identified from complex eem spectroscopy by the parafac model as shown in fig 3c the three components included two protein like substances comp 1 and 3 and a fulvic like substance comp 2 table s7 summarizes the spectral characteristics of each component investigated in this study and the relevant data presented in the previous study comp 1 ex em 225 280 315 and comp 3 ex em 220 285 345 were identified as tyrosine like substance and tryptophan like substance respectively guo et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 they were suggested to be associated with the bioavailability as well as microbial activity and had simple molecular structures cui et al 2017 huang et al 2019 comp 2 ex em 250 310 440 was identified as fulvic like substance guo et al 2021 huang et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 comp 2 was associated with terrestrial organic matter as well as microbial reprocessing which represented organic substances with large molecular weight and complex molecular structures cui et al 2017 huang et al 2019 in general fluorescence peaks with em 380 nm represented polycyclic aromatic structure and peaks with em 380 nm indicated the fluorophores with electron denoting amino and hydroxyl groups li et al 2013 priyanka and saravanakumar 2022 furthermore parafac analysis can quantitatively reveal the distribution of each component in dom by fluorescence intensity fmax the ranges of fmax were 68 3 330 a u for comp 1 62 2 136 a u for comp 2 and 138 402 a u for comp 3 the hca of individual components break in a set of four clusters is depicted in fig s2 cluster 1 grouped sites with low fmax 300 a u in total and high relative abundances of comp 3 and 2 which accounted for 37 7 52 3 and 25 5 34 1 of dom respectively cluster 2 exhibited a high relative abundance of comp 3 34 9 55 1 and comp 2 23 0 41 5 but differed from cluster 1 by the higher fmax 300 450 a u in total cluster 3 was mainly dominated by comp 3 42 2 53 6 and comp 1 28 8 42 2 with relatively high total fmax 450 600 a u cluster 4 was characterized by a high relative abundance of comp 3 38 6 56 7 and low relative proportions of comp 2 20 0 the total fmax in cluster 4 was higher than 650 a u based on the terrain of the two river systems the upper taoge river system west of ge lake and the southern sites in yili river systems i e s3 c3 n3 and c2 were predominated by comp 3 and 2 58 0 however the other sites in both taoge and yili river systems and taihu lake were subjected to comp 3 and 1 80 0 the longitudinal transition of dom with less humic like substances from upstream to downstream may primarily be attributed by the transformation and production of dom bhattacharya and osburn 2020 cory and kling 2018 reitsema et al 2018 the results indicated that protein like substances were more abundant than humic like substances in northwest taihu lake as well as their receiving rivers and that tryptophan like substances were more abundant in dom 3 3 key factors of dom characteristics affecting pfaa variability the mantel test revealed significant positive correlation between dom and pfaas with a correlation coefficient of 0 355 p 0 0001 the results indicated that the dom would affect pfaa concentrations and compositions in surface water rda was performed to further quantify the relative contributions of dom indicators on the influence of pfaas and identify the key factors a total of seven dom indicators were considered and comp 1 3 as well as fi were identified as indicators with significant effects on pfaa concentrations and compositions p 0 05 as shown in fig 4 a and table s9 rda axes 1 and 2 can reflect 19 1 and 8 34 of the relationships between dom and pfaas respectively p 0 002 rda axis 1 best represented dom compositions with significant positive correlations with comp 2 p 0 002 rda axis 2 best represented the source of humic substances exhibiting significant positive correlations with fi vectors p 0 006 positive correlations were observed between comp 2 versus pfba pfpea pfbs and pfoa p 0 05 fig 4 fi was positively correlated with pfhxa and pfhpa p 0 01 long chained pfaas c8 11 pfaas except for pfunda did not exhibit any significant correlations with dom the insignificant correlations might have resulted from the rapid sedimentation of these long chained pfaas after emission song et al 2018 and their limited concentration in surface water furthermore the monte carlo permutation test revealed that humic like substances comp 2 fi and comp 1 explained 13 5 6 5 and 6 9 respectively of the variability in pfaa concentrations and compositions table s9 hence it is evident that the level of fulvic like substances was the most critical indicator for influencing pfaa concentrations and compositions in the surface water of taihu lake basin however pfaas as proteinophilic compounds were suggested to have greater potential to bind with proteins than with humic acids in previous studies liu et al 2021 wen et al 2016 xia et al 2015 a possible reason might be the influences of various ions ph and some coexisting pollutants in natural water on the binding campos pereira et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 showed that phenanthrene binding to dom complexes was much higher than its binding to individual dom substances these results indicated that dom rather than model dom are necessary to understand the interactions between dom and pfaas in natural water 3 4 role of dom self assembly in capturing pfaas considering the spontaneous aggregation potential of dom polymers shiu and lee 2017 the possible binding of dom with pfaas was further explored by laboratory experiments four sites in the taoge river system and taihu lake were selected based on the hc results of dom and pfaas and the spatial heterogeneity of dom was mainly considered pfaa removal in the process of dom self assembly into a microgel and their distribution between the aggregated dom and water were observed the hydrodynamic diameter zeta potential morphology of dom the shifts of metal levels in water and the characteristic peaks of dom were measured to investigate the role of dom self assembly in capturing pfaas 3 4 1 the capture of pfaas in the process of dom self assembly as shown in fig 5 a the hydrodynamic diameter of dom monitored by dls indicated the self assembly of dom relatively reached equilibrium after three days which was coincident with previous observations shiu et al 2018 2020 after 10 days sites s1 c4 and n2 had similar hydrodynamic diameters around 800 nm which were considerably smaller than that in n2 1268 52 0 nm moreover the decreasing zeta potentials of microgels fig 5b with time confirmed that dom was gradually aggregated to microgels fig 6 further provided visual evidence that dom polymers can spontaneously aggregate into microgels the length of the major axis of aggregated dom ranged from 10 1 to 5 µm the observed sizes were akin to previous studies in which the sizes of polymers were suggested to be less than 4 5 µm because the polymer chain length was rather limited gennes and liliane 1982 shiu and lee 2017 although the samples in the selected four sites had variable doc concentrations table s2 and the dom self assembly was suggested as a concentration dependent process chin et al 1998 samples in sites s1 0 633 0 0577 mg l and c4 1 57 0 503 mg l formed less microgels than those formed in n2 9 53 2 20 mg l and h5 9 80 1 08 mg l p 0 01 indicating that the compositions of dom may alter the microgel formation pfaa concentration in water on days 0 and 10 was observed as displayed in table s10 results from this study suggested that dom aggregation was capable of scavenging 19 1 50 9 of pfaas fig 5c indicating that the pfaas can be bound and removed in the aggregation of dom as shown in fig 5d the mean km w values of pfaas had a range of 4 69 5 58 l kg which were higher than the distribution coefficients of c7 11 pfaas between humic acid and water 4 21 4 98 l kg and were comparable with those between albumin and water 4 92 5 86 l kg xia et al 2015 the results suggested the natural dom have comparable absorption capacity of pfaas with albumin comparing the km w values can reveal the difference in affinity for pfaas the pearson s correlation analysis indicated a significant correlation of log km w of all pfaas except pfhxa between their perfluorinated carbon numbers r 0 975 p 0 001 the observations were in agreement with the sorption results in many previous studies chen et al 2019a nguyen et al 2020 vo et al 2022 the affinity characteristics of pfaas with microgels depended on perfluorinated carbon numbers indicating that the sequestering of these pfaas in dom self assembly was mainly subjected to hydrophobic bonding pfsas with a given perfluorinated carbon number had higher log km w values than their corresponding pfcas suggesting that the electrostatic interaction may also be involved in this process notably the highest mean log km w values were observed in pfhxa and the log km w values of pfbs were comparable with those of pfhxs and pfos this can be attributed to the extremely high absorption affinity of fulvic like substances to pfhxa and pfbs because they had similar molecular weights molecular weight fulvic acid 308 pfhxa 314 pfbs 300 furthermore this was supported by the major competitive sorption ability of dom with similar molecules for pfaas du et al 2014 yu et al 2012 3 4 2 possible interactions between the aggregated dom and pfaas the interactions between dom and pfaas can be understood based on dom self assembly free dom polymers are first assembled into nanogels and axially diffuse interpenetrate and anneal to larger gels verdugo and santschi 2010 the interpenetrating nanogel units of microgels were observed in the river and lake waters as shown in the partially enlarged drawings of fig 6 as shown in table 1 and fig s3 the fluorescence intensity of all characteristic peaks was significantly decreased p 0 05 in the samples which had fulvic like substances sites s1 and c4 peak a was more effectively attenuated than other peaks p 0 05 by contrast in the samples with more than two types of protein like substances sites n2 c4 and h5 their attenuation rates in each site were comparable p 0 05 the observations were accordant to previous studies shiu and lee 2017 verdugo and santschi 2010 the results indicated that fulvic like substances may be preferential to self assembly in aquatic environments because dom with larger molecules such as fulvic like substances was easier to aggregate than the smaller molecules i e protein like substances he et al 2016b a previous study suggested that humic acid can encapsulate proteins via hydrophobic attraction and increase the hydrophobicity of their complexes zhao et al 2014 the hydrophobic regions of the dom were responsible for their propensity to self assembly verdugo and santschi 2010 these observations confirmed the rda results that fulvic like substances were the key factor affecting the variability in pfaa concentration and composition fig 4 furthermore the amphiphilic moieties such as the hemimicelle of pfaas can induce the dom self assembly even at extremely low concentrations and the polymers would collapse into a dense nonporous array with the burial of hydrophobic domains chin et al 1998 du et al 2014 shiu et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 as presented in fig 6 moreover dom are negatively charged and amphiphilic owing to their various negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylate the aromatic side chains in proteins and the secluded hydrophobic domains and polar subunits in humic acids colombo et al 2015 shiu et al 2020 under natural conditions pfaas are negatively charged owing to deprotonation liu et al 2021 the negative surface charge may facilitate the crosslinking chelation between the polyanionic dom and cations as well as between cations and pfaas significant decrease in all observed metals including ca mg cu and fe and zeta potentials were observed after the microgel formation p 0 05 fig s4 fig 5b suggesting the participation of these metals in capturing pfaas by microgels ca ii cu ii and fe ii iii can act as the crosslinking agents to stabilize dom networks via bridging transition metal complexation and flocculation respectively he et al 2016b shiu and lee 2017 shiu et al 2018 verdugo and santschi 2010 cations including ca ii mg ii cu ii and fe ii iii can form a bridge between microgels and pfaas via cation bridging effect the covalent metal ligand bond or electrostatic interactions du et al 2014 oliver et al 2019 the quenched fluorescence of eem peaks may result from the electrostatic interaction and ligand and ion exchange between dom and pfaas mediated by cations therefore possible mechanisms between the aggregated dom and pfaas can be concluded as hydrophobic bonding interactions between amphipathic moieties and electrostatic bonding crosslinking bridge chelation by metals as conceptually presented in graphical abstract 3 5 implications dom acts as a mediator that determines the transport of contaminants with currents and their deposition into sediments in aquatic environments therefore understanding the interrelated processes of dom contaminants binding is crucial to the distribution transport and fate of contaminants previous studies have described the essential binding mechanisms of model dom with pfaas kothawala et al 2017 liu et al 2021 wen et al 2016 xia et al 2015 whereas the interactions between dom and pfaas under natural conditions are largely unexplored results of this study demonstrated that the pfaas as well as other organic inorganic substances were captured by the dom via coupling field observations with elaborately designed experiments indicating that dom polymers microgel are crucial in regulating the level of contaminants the transformations between dom polymers and microgel can be affected by the source and physicochemical properties of dom solution chemical properties such as ph cationic strength and pollutant level illumination intensity and hydrodynamic characteristics he et al 2016b shiu et al 2018 2020 the transformative balances may directly determine the mobility and sedimentation of dom binding contaminants in aquatic environments and further affect the bioaccumulation and environmental risks of higher trophic predators including filter feeders and even humans 4 conclusions this study provided comprehensive insights into the interaction between dom and pfaas in natural rivers and lakes by combining field and laboratory experiments the findings revealed that pfaas were dominated by c3 7 pfcas and pfos in the surface water of the northwest of taihu lake basin dom mainly comprised tyrosine like fulvic like and tryptophan like substances dom exhibited significant correlations with pfaas and fulvic acid like substances were identified as the dominant factor affecting pfaa distribution in natural rivers and lakes the laboratorial results further indicated that dom in river and lake waters could spontaneously form microgels and that pfaas can be effectively captured during this process the capture of pfaas in dom aggregation was through the combined effects of various substances which might be primarily fulvic like substances held together with proteins pfaas affinity with dom was largely dependent on the perfluorinated carbon numbers the hydrophobicity and the numbers of free negatively charged functional groups of the dom and pfaas were likely responsible for the hydrophobic binding and crosslinking with cations respectively our results highlighted the significance of dom pfaa binding which can be helpful to understand the multiphase distribution transport and fate of pfaas in a natural aquatic environment declaration of

16096,understanding the interactions between dissolved organic matter dom and perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas is essential for predicting the distribution transport and fate of pfaas in aquatic environments based on field investigations in the northwest of taihu lake basin combined with laboratory experiments we obtained dom and pfaa concentrations as well as compositions and investigated key factors of dom affecting pfaa variability and capture of pfaas by dom results indicated that the total concentrations of pfaas were 73 4 689 ng l in surface water and that pfaas were dominated by c3 7 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid the main components of dom included tyrosine fulvic and tryptophan like substances the mantel test revealed a significant positive correlation between dom and pfaas p 0 0001 fulvic like substances were identified as the most crucial factors affecting pfaa variability the laboratory experiments revealed that dom can spontaneously aggregate into a microgel furthermore 19 1 50 9 of pfaas dom characteristic peaks and several metals ca mg cu and fe can be removed during aggregation indicating the capacity of dom binding organic inorganic substances the fulvic like substances were more effectively removed than the protein like substances the distribution coefficients of all pfaas except perfluorohexanoic acid significantly correlated with their perfluorinated carbon numbers r 0 975 p 0 001 our results provided insights into the interactions between dom and pfaas improving the understanding of the distribution transport and fate of pfaas in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords interactions perfluoroalkyl acids dissolved organic matters self assembly natural rivers and lakes 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas refer to a family of artificial compounds which exhibit hydrophobicity as well as oleophobicity thermal as well as chemical stability and strong surface active properties nguyen et al 2020 wang et al 2017 they had been extensively used in several consumer products as well as industrial processes such as plastics fire forming foams and surfactants schaider et al 2017 song et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the intrinsically persistent perfluoroalkyl moieties of pfaas made them resistant to oxidation and biodegradation arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 several studies had highlighted that pfaas had severely adverse effects on the ecological environment owing to their high persistence bioavailability and toxicity chen et al 2015 hua et al 2022 wang et al 2017 in addition pfaas were associated with human multisystem diseases and even cancer ojo et al 2020 zeng et al 2019 pfaas had been continuously discharged from fluorine related plants and wastewater treatment plants kim et al 2021 song et al 2018 owing to the relatively high solubility of pfaas surface water was suggested as one of the most important carriers of pfaas chen et al 2019a dong et al 2020 pfaas had been ubiquitously detected in rivers lakes coastal water global oceans and polar regions with observed concentrations ranging from dozens of pg l to dozens of µg l cerro galvez et al 2020 dong et al 2020 muir and miaz 2021 therefore the distribution transport and fate of pfaas after discharge into the environment particularly in surface water have emerged as a global concern dissolved organic matter dom was suggested as a primary factor affecting the environmental behavior of various contaminants such as heavy metals estrogens and antibiotics cheng et al 2017 huang et al 2019 ma and yates 2018 shiu et al 2020 because dom can interact with them and affect their multiphase distribution bioavailability and degradation shiu et al 2020 wen et al 2016 yan et al 2015 the capacity resulted from dom polymers spontaneously aggregating into a microgel or colloids providing a stabilized tangled network with abundant functional groups particularly carboxyl and hydroxyl for capturing contaminants chin et al 1998 shiu and lee 2017 the aggregated dom can lead to the formation of larger particles which could further undergo gravitational settling and affect the mobility sedimentation of the binding contaminants he et al 2016a shiu and lee 2017 ma and yates 2018 reviewed the interaction mechanisms between dom and estrogens moreover they reported that the interactions of estrogen with microgels determined their binding on dom the binding of estrogens was mainly associated with aromatic dom and mechanisms mainly involved in π π interaction and hydrogen bonding shiu and lee 2017 indicated that the capture of heavy metals during dom self assembly into a microgel was accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity of fulvic like substance and humic acid and that the sequestering capacity was associated with ligand interaction these results indicated that the interactions between dom and contaminants were complex and may be associated with dom concentrations and compositions as well as contaminant properties previous studies focused on dom effects on the environmental behavior of pfaas for example dom was reported to considerably decrease the sorption capacity of pfaas on absorbents the bioconcentration of pfaas by organisms and the removal efficiency of pfaas by water treatment plants du et al 2014 kothawala et al 2017 wen et al 2016 our recent study revealed that the microgel can preload 45 5 62 6 of pfaas in overlying water li and hua 2021 indicating a great potential of aggregated dom in binding pfaas the dom pfaas binding might be responsible for the effects of dom on pfaas chen et al 2019b some studies have used model dom substances such as fulvic acid humic acid and bull serum albumin to disclose the binding mechanisms of pfaas with humic substances and proteins liu et al 2021 wen et al 2016 their findings revealed that pfaas binding with humic substances were relevant to electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and their binding to protein involved electrostatic van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding campos pereira et al 2018 chen et al 2015 liu et al 2021 however doms are heterogeneous mixtures containing various humic and aromatic substances bhattacharya and osburn 2020 different components in dom would interact with each other changing the structure and natural properties liu et al 2021 shiu and lee 2017 therefore understanding the interactions between dom and pfaas in natural water particularly the key factors of dom in regulating dom pfaas binding and the role of dom self assembly in capturing pfaas is imperative the main objective of the present study is to provide insights into the interactions between dom and pfaas in natural rivers and lakes the northwest of taihu lake basin with two independent drainage systems having directional flows to taihu lake and variable land use land covered areas such as vegetation farmland and cities and towns provided an ideal setting to acquire various dom and pfaas in rivers and lakes therefore we systematically investigated the concentrations and compositions of both dom and pfaas in the northwest of taihu lake basin the specific objectives are as follows 1 interpreting the dom fluorescence characteristics and pfaa concentrations and compositions in the northwest of taihu lake basin 2 investigating the correlations between dom characteristics and pfaa variability and identifying the key factors 3 exploring the role of dom self assembly in capturing pfaas by laboratory experiments accordingly the interactive mechanisms between dom and pfaas in rivers and lakes were comprehensively discussed results of this study will be helpful to comprehensively understand the role of dom in absorbing pfaas and affecting the fate of pfaa in a natural aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a total of 12 pfaas purity 98 which included perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas with 3 11 perfluorinated carbons c3 11 and c4 6 8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas were used as external standards the isotope labeled perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos 98 were used as internal standards shoemaker and tettenhorst 2018 table s1 shows detailed information on analytical standards hplc grade reagents i e methanol acetonitrile ammonium hydroxide ammonium acetate and milli q water were used throughout the study 2 2 sampling campaign and laboratory experiments 2 2 1 investigation of dom and pfaas in the northwest of taihu lake basin there were 23 sampling sites in the major rivers and lakes in the northwest of taihu lake basin as shown in fig 1 the samplings sites were selected according to the river systems and the common land use land cover as rivers flow through there were 18 sampling sites in the rivers nine in the taoge river system and nine in the yili river system and five in the lakes three in the northwest of taihu lake one in tao lake and one in ge lake among these sites four sites s1 4 were in vegetations seven sites n1 7 were in farmlands seven sites c1 7 were in cities and towns and five sites h1 5 were in lakes furthermore according to the digital elevation model of the study area the terrain in the taoge river system is high in the west and low in the east and the terrain in the yili river system is high in the south the two river systems finally flow into taihu lake from west to east surface water 0 5 m below the water surface was collected and intensively mixed in high density polypropylene bottles water chemical properties were measured on sites simultaneously using a multiparameter water quality analyzer hq30d hash usa as shown in table s2 the water samples were stored in bubble chambers with ice bags and rapidly transported into a laboratory to measure the concentrations and compositions of dom and pfaas 2 2 2 resampling in typical sites and laboratory experiments to further understand the capacity of the dom in binding pfaas laboratory experiments were designed based on the self aggregation affinity of dom representative sites with distinguished dom and pfaas in the northwest of taihu lake basin were selected according to the results of the first samplings by combining field and laboratory experiments the interaction between dom and pfaas in natural rivers and lakes were explored in detail water samples in the representative sites were re collected then these samples were immediately passed through a 0 45 µm filter millipore usa half samples collected from each site were used for the analysis of dissolved organic carbon doc the excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy of dom several metal content ca mg cu and fe and pfaa concentrations the other half samples and procedure blanks were statically stored in the dark at 4 c to provide a stable environment for dom self assembly and to inhibit the microbial activity the aggregate size and zeta potential of dom were monitored at 25 c on days 0 0 5 1 3 5 7 and 10 using a malvern zetasizer nano zse uk based on dynamic light scattering dls after 10 days the samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm filter and the three dimensional spectra and the content of doc metals and pfaas were assayed the filters were dried in a vacuum freeze drier at 40 c for 48 h and were observed in scanning electron microscopy hitachi s 4800 japan table s2 shows the water parameters the particulate size zeta potential doc and metal contents in procedure blanks were all below the detection limits suggesting there were no microgel formed and background pollution occurred in the procedure blanks 2 3 dom analysis water samples were pretreated using 0 45 millipore usa before analysis the content of dom can be indicated via doc concentrations maizel et al 2017 and doc can be determined using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 3100 germany the eem spectroscopy was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 7000 fl spectrophotometer japan to assess the heterogeneity of dom composition six peaks including peak a c s t d and b were identified three indices including the fluorescence index fi index of recent biological productivity contribution bix and index of the relative degree of humification hix were calculated to indicate the source of humic substances autochthonous degree and humification degree respectively bhattacharya and osburn 2020 details of eem and these indices were summarized in table s3 and table s4 the parallel factor parafac analysis was suggested as an effective tool to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the specific fluorescence characteristics of dom because parafac can debase the dimension and decompose the complex eem spectroscopy into fluorescent components vera et al 2017 after the removal of raman and rayleigh scattering we computed two to seven component models with non negativity constraints for the eems derived from the samples obtained in the comprehensive investigation the relative levels of the derived components can be evaluated using the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax r u yang et al 2015 2 4 pfaa analysis the pfaa analysis in water samples was conducted based on our previous study li et al 2021 li and hua 2021 in brief the filtered water samples 0 45 µm extracted by using waters oasis wax cartridges 6 cc 150 mg usa the extracts were further analyzed using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms triple quad 4500 ab sciex singapore detailed information about the uhplc separation and mass spectrometer analyses are shown in text s1 and table s5 the quantification method of pfaas strictly followed the uepa method 537 1 shoemaker and tettenhorst 2018 the limits of detection and the limits of quantification loqs were defined as signal to noise s n ratios of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively then method detection limits mdls were calculated based on the mean concentration and standard deviation of the procedure blank mdl of individual pfaa ranged from 0 0326 to 0 172 ng l the detailed information of lod loq and mdls was summarized in table s6 field blank procedure blank solvent blank and membrane blank were assayed and all pfaa concentrations were below the loqs indicating that no background contamination occurred throughout the procedure the procedure recovery and matrix spike recovery tests were conducted and the recoveries were within acceptable intervals 88 6 106 table s6 2 5 statistical analysis data are shown as mean standard deviation n 3 variables were analyzed using one way anova fisher s least significant difference paired samples t test kolmogorov smirnov test and pearson spearman correlation analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca was used to profile the distribution of dom main components and pfaas the principal component analysis pca was used to identify the possible source of pfaas possible correlations between dom and pfaas were determined by mantel test key factors of dom affecting pfaas were excavated using the redundancy analysis rda the distribution coefficients of pfaas between microgel and water k m w l kg can be calculated as k m w c w t 0 c w t 10 m c w t 10 where c w t 0 and c w t 10 are the concentrations of pfaas in water on days 0 and 10 respectively ng l and m is the mass of microgel kg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfaa variability in surface water the spatial distribution of pfaas in surface water is depicted in fig 2 a and full details on the concentration ranges and detection frequencies in surface water are summarized in table s8 the most frequently detected pfaas were c3 7 pfcas and pfos 100 detected accounting for 86 1 18 7 of pfaa concentrations in total the highest pfaa level on average in surface water was that of pfba 100 detected concentration range of 17 0 80 6 ng l representing 33 0 10 0 of pfaas the following dominant pfaas were pfoa and pfpea contributing 25 9 7 17 and 5 97 3 36 of pfaas respectively the concentrations of pfaas ranged from 78 1 to 689 ng l in the taoge river system 73 4 175 2 ng l in the yili river system and 106 140 ng l in taihu lake the mean concentrations of pfaas in the aforementioned were 237 ng l 128 ng l and 120 ng l respectively which were comparable with those in previous observations 206 ng l in 2018 and 172 ng l in 2019 an et al 2021 furthermore table s8 summarizes the comparison of pfaa concentration with those in other rivers and lakes worldwide pca and hca were suggested as effective tools to further disclose the pfaa profiles and possible sources an et al 2021 li et al 2020 as shown in fig 2b pca axes 1 and 2 can be attributed to 82 0 and 6 40 of pfaa variability respectively the vectors of c3 7 pfcas positively stretched far along the pc1 axis whereas the vectors of c8 11 pfcas and pfhxs negatively stretched far along the pc1 axis the results indicated that c3 7 pfcas may have the similar sources the similarity of c8 11 pfcas and pfhxs suggested they had similar sources which were different from those of c3 7 pfcas the vectors of pfbs and pfos had larger projection values in the pc2 axis compared to those in pc1 axis indicating the other sources which were different from the sources of c3 7 pfcas may also have considerable contributions moreover two ratio indicators can be used to evaluate the effects of atmospheric deposition and nonpoint sources on the ratios of pfhpa pfoa 0 26 16 and pfoa pfna 2 15 armitage et al 2009 simcik and dorweiler 2005 the pfhpa pfoa ratios ranged from 0 0452 to 0 301 except in site c4 14 3 indicating the atmosphere deposition had slight contributions to pfaas in most sites the computable pfoa pfna ratios were higher than 100 and pfna was not detected in other sites implying the pfaas in this study were derived from the point sources moreover the hca ward s method performed on pfaas in surface water yielded five clusters of sizes 1 2 2 7 and 11 fig 2b cluster i only involved site c4 which had the highest pfaa load 689 11 5 ng l and was dominated by pfhpa 73 9 of pfaas the distinguished load and compositions of pfaas in site c4 may be related to their adjacency to the largest wastewater treatment plants and the electroplating factories in wujin an et al 2021 therefore we hypothesized that the high pfhpa pfoa ratio in site c4 can be attributed to the combined effect of point source emissions and atmospheric transport cluster ii grouped n1 and n4 owing to their comparable pfaas load 558 15 0 ng l for n1 377 52 6 ng l for n4 and similar high pfbs proportions 50 0 n1 is adjacent to plastic packing plants and n4 is located downstream of several facilities including hardware factories metal processing plants chemical plants plastics packing plants textile mills and so on pfbs related substances were used as substitutes of pfos related congeners zhou et al 2013 and were widely detected in environmental media around advanced electronic facilities metal related plants urban industrial and e waste dismantling areas kim et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 moreover the proximity of these facilities may be responsible for the relatively high levels of pfaas and pfbs cluster iii including n2 and s3 was characterized by high proportions of pfos 35 0 clusters iv and v grouped sites with high relative abundances of pfba and pfoa each group representing 20 0 55 0 of pfaas furthermore cluster iv differed from cluster v by the higher proportions of pfbs and pfos hence the pfaa profile in the northwest of taihu lake basin were dominated by c3 7 pfcas and pfos 3 2 dom characteristics in surface water the doc concentrations in water samples varied from 3 30 to 13 8 mg l table s2 the eem spectroscopy of dom was assayed fig s1 and the fluorescence indices of dom were corresponding calculated as shown in fig 3 a b the values of fi hix bix were 1 73 2 13 1 50 2 13 and 0 952 1 27 respectively most sites in taoge river systems except s1 s2 n2 and h1 and taihu lake had fi values higher than 1 90 indicating that the main source was autochthonously derived humic substances whereas yili river systems except n5 and c7 had fi values between 1 40 1 90 exhibiting both terrestrially and autochthonously derived characteristics mcknight et al 2001 the high values of hix indicate a high degree of humification bhattacharya and osburn 2020 the hix values in taoge river systems yili river systems and western taihu lake were 1 50 2 13 1 56 1 84 and 1 70 1 82 respectively suggesting dom in the taoge river system exhibited more variations in hix all samples except n1 h2 and s3 exhibited bix values higher than 1 0 implying that the dom in the present study area was predominantly autochthonous origin our findings revealed that the dom in the rivers and lakes in the northwest taihu lake basin was variable in the source of humic substances and humification degree and were mainly subjected to microbial metabolism three major components were further identified from complex eem spectroscopy by the parafac model as shown in fig 3c the three components included two protein like substances comp 1 and 3 and a fulvic like substance comp 2 table s7 summarizes the spectral characteristics of each component investigated in this study and the relevant data presented in the previous study comp 1 ex em 225 280 315 and comp 3 ex em 220 285 345 were identified as tyrosine like substance and tryptophan like substance respectively guo et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 they were suggested to be associated with the bioavailability as well as microbial activity and had simple molecular structures cui et al 2017 huang et al 2019 comp 2 ex em 250 310 440 was identified as fulvic like substance guo et al 2021 huang et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 comp 2 was associated with terrestrial organic matter as well as microbial reprocessing which represented organic substances with large molecular weight and complex molecular structures cui et al 2017 huang et al 2019 in general fluorescence peaks with em 380 nm represented polycyclic aromatic structure and peaks with em 380 nm indicated the fluorophores with electron denoting amino and hydroxyl groups li et al 2013 priyanka and saravanakumar 2022 furthermore parafac analysis can quantitatively reveal the distribution of each component in dom by fluorescence intensity fmax the ranges of fmax were 68 3 330 a u for comp 1 62 2 136 a u for comp 2 and 138 402 a u for comp 3 the hca of individual components break in a set of four clusters is depicted in fig s2 cluster 1 grouped sites with low fmax 300 a u in total and high relative abundances of comp 3 and 2 which accounted for 37 7 52 3 and 25 5 34 1 of dom respectively cluster 2 exhibited a high relative abundance of comp 3 34 9 55 1 and comp 2 23 0 41 5 but differed from cluster 1 by the higher fmax 300 450 a u in total cluster 3 was mainly dominated by comp 3 42 2 53 6 and comp 1 28 8 42 2 with relatively high total fmax 450 600 a u cluster 4 was characterized by a high relative abundance of comp 3 38 6 56 7 and low relative proportions of comp 2 20 0 the total fmax in cluster 4 was higher than 650 a u based on the terrain of the two river systems the upper taoge river system west of ge lake and the southern sites in yili river systems i e s3 c3 n3 and c2 were predominated by comp 3 and 2 58 0 however the other sites in both taoge and yili river systems and taihu lake were subjected to comp 3 and 1 80 0 the longitudinal transition of dom with less humic like substances from upstream to downstream may primarily be attributed by the transformation and production of dom bhattacharya and osburn 2020 cory and kling 2018 reitsema et al 2018 the results indicated that protein like substances were more abundant than humic like substances in northwest taihu lake as well as their receiving rivers and that tryptophan like substances were more abundant in dom 3 3 key factors of dom characteristics affecting pfaa variability the mantel test revealed significant positive correlation between dom and pfaas with a correlation coefficient of 0 355 p 0 0001 the results indicated that the dom would affect pfaa concentrations and compositions in surface water rda was performed to further quantify the relative contributions of dom indicators on the influence of pfaas and identify the key factors a total of seven dom indicators were considered and comp 1 3 as well as fi were identified as indicators with significant effects on pfaa concentrations and compositions p 0 05 as shown in fig 4 a and table s9 rda axes 1 and 2 can reflect 19 1 and 8 34 of the relationships between dom and pfaas respectively p 0 002 rda axis 1 best represented dom compositions with significant positive correlations with comp 2 p 0 002 rda axis 2 best represented the source of humic substances exhibiting significant positive correlations with fi vectors p 0 006 positive correlations were observed between comp 2 versus pfba pfpea pfbs and pfoa p 0 05 fig 4 fi was positively correlated with pfhxa and pfhpa p 0 01 long chained pfaas c8 11 pfaas except for pfunda did not exhibit any significant correlations with dom the insignificant correlations might have resulted from the rapid sedimentation of these long chained pfaas after emission song et al 2018 and their limited concentration in surface water furthermore the monte carlo permutation test revealed that humic like substances comp 2 fi and comp 1 explained 13 5 6 5 and 6 9 respectively of the variability in pfaa concentrations and compositions table s9 hence it is evident that the level of fulvic like substances was the most critical indicator for influencing pfaa concentrations and compositions in the surface water of taihu lake basin however pfaas as proteinophilic compounds were suggested to have greater potential to bind with proteins than with humic acids in previous studies liu et al 2021 wen et al 2016 xia et al 2015 a possible reason might be the influences of various ions ph and some coexisting pollutants in natural water on the binding campos pereira et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 showed that phenanthrene binding to dom complexes was much higher than its binding to individual dom substances these results indicated that dom rather than model dom are necessary to understand the interactions between dom and pfaas in natural water 3 4 role of dom self assembly in capturing pfaas considering the spontaneous aggregation potential of dom polymers shiu and lee 2017 the possible binding of dom with pfaas was further explored by laboratory experiments four sites in the taoge river system and taihu lake were selected based on the hc results of dom and pfaas and the spatial heterogeneity of dom was mainly considered pfaa removal in the process of dom self assembly into a microgel and their distribution between the aggregated dom and water were observed the hydrodynamic diameter zeta potential morphology of dom the shifts of metal levels in water and the characteristic peaks of dom were measured to investigate the role of dom self assembly in capturing pfaas 3 4 1 the capture of pfaas in the process of dom self assembly as shown in fig 5 a the hydrodynamic diameter of dom monitored by dls indicated the self assembly of dom relatively reached equilibrium after three days which was coincident with previous observations shiu et al 2018 2020 after 10 days sites s1 c4 and n2 had similar hydrodynamic diameters around 800 nm which were considerably smaller than that in n2 1268 52 0 nm moreover the decreasing zeta potentials of microgels fig 5b with time confirmed that dom was gradually aggregated to microgels fig 6 further provided visual evidence that dom polymers can spontaneously aggregate into microgels the length of the major axis of aggregated dom ranged from 10 1 to 5 µm the observed sizes were akin to previous studies in which the sizes of polymers were suggested to be less than 4 5 µm because the polymer chain length was rather limited gennes and liliane 1982 shiu and lee 2017 although the samples in the selected four sites had variable doc concentrations table s2 and the dom self assembly was suggested as a concentration dependent process chin et al 1998 samples in sites s1 0 633 0 0577 mg l and c4 1 57 0 503 mg l formed less microgels than those formed in n2 9 53 2 20 mg l and h5 9 80 1 08 mg l p 0 01 indicating that the compositions of dom may alter the microgel formation pfaa concentration in water on days 0 and 10 was observed as displayed in table s10 results from this study suggested that dom aggregation was capable of scavenging 19 1 50 9 of pfaas fig 5c indicating that the pfaas can be bound and removed in the aggregation of dom as shown in fig 5d the mean km w values of pfaas had a range of 4 69 5 58 l kg which were higher than the distribution coefficients of c7 11 pfaas between humic acid and water 4 21 4 98 l kg and were comparable with those between albumin and water 4 92 5 86 l kg xia et al 2015 the results suggested the natural dom have comparable absorption capacity of pfaas with albumin comparing the km w values can reveal the difference in affinity for pfaas the pearson s correlation analysis indicated a significant correlation of log km w of all pfaas except pfhxa between their perfluorinated carbon numbers r 0 975 p 0 001 the observations were in agreement with the sorption results in many previous studies chen et al 2019a nguyen et al 2020 vo et al 2022 the affinity characteristics of pfaas with microgels depended on perfluorinated carbon numbers indicating that the sequestering of these pfaas in dom self assembly was mainly subjected to hydrophobic bonding pfsas with a given perfluorinated carbon number had higher log km w values than their corresponding pfcas suggesting that the electrostatic interaction may also be involved in this process notably the highest mean log km w values were observed in pfhxa and the log km w values of pfbs were comparable with those of pfhxs and pfos this can be attributed to the extremely high absorption affinity of fulvic like substances to pfhxa and pfbs because they had similar molecular weights molecular weight fulvic acid 308 pfhxa 314 pfbs 300 furthermore this was supported by the major competitive sorption ability of dom with similar molecules for pfaas du et al 2014 yu et al 2012 3 4 2 possible interactions between the aggregated dom and pfaas the interactions between dom and pfaas can be understood based on dom self assembly free dom polymers are first assembled into nanogels and axially diffuse interpenetrate and anneal to larger gels verdugo and santschi 2010 the interpenetrating nanogel units of microgels were observed in the river and lake waters as shown in the partially enlarged drawings of fig 6 as shown in table 1 and fig s3 the fluorescence intensity of all characteristic peaks was significantly decreased p 0 05 in the samples which had fulvic like substances sites s1 and c4 peak a was more effectively attenuated than other peaks p 0 05 by contrast in the samples with more than two types of protein like substances sites n2 c4 and h5 their attenuation rates in each site were comparable p 0 05 the observations were accordant to previous studies shiu and lee 2017 verdugo and santschi 2010 the results indicated that fulvic like substances may be preferential to self assembly in aquatic environments because dom with larger molecules such as fulvic like substances was easier to aggregate than the smaller molecules i e protein like substances he et al 2016b a previous study suggested that humic acid can encapsulate proteins via hydrophobic attraction and increase the hydrophobicity of their complexes zhao et al 2014 the hydrophobic regions of the dom were responsible for their propensity to self assembly verdugo and santschi 2010 these observations confirmed the rda results that fulvic like substances were the key factor affecting the variability in pfaa concentration and composition fig 4 furthermore the amphiphilic moieties such as the hemimicelle of pfaas can induce the dom self assembly even at extremely low concentrations and the polymers would collapse into a dense nonporous array with the burial of hydrophobic domains chin et al 1998 du et al 2014 shiu et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 as presented in fig 6 moreover dom are negatively charged and amphiphilic owing to their various negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylate the aromatic side chains in proteins and the secluded hydrophobic domains and polar subunits in humic acids colombo et al 2015 shiu et al 2020 under natural conditions pfaas are negatively charged owing to deprotonation liu et al 2021 the negative surface charge may facilitate the crosslinking chelation between the polyanionic dom and cations as well as between cations and pfaas significant decrease in all observed metals including ca mg cu and fe and zeta potentials were observed after the microgel formation p 0 05 fig s4 fig 5b suggesting the participation of these metals in capturing pfaas by microgels ca ii cu ii and fe ii iii can act as the crosslinking agents to stabilize dom networks via bridging transition metal complexation and flocculation respectively he et al 2016b shiu and lee 2017 shiu et al 2018 verdugo and santschi 2010 cations including ca ii mg ii cu ii and fe ii iii can form a bridge between microgels and pfaas via cation bridging effect the covalent metal ligand bond or electrostatic interactions du et al 2014 oliver et al 2019 the quenched fluorescence of eem peaks may result from the electrostatic interaction and ligand and ion exchange between dom and pfaas mediated by cations therefore possible mechanisms between the aggregated dom and pfaas can be concluded as hydrophobic bonding interactions between amphipathic moieties and electrostatic bonding crosslinking bridge chelation by metals as conceptually presented in graphical abstract 3 5 implications dom acts as a mediator that determines the transport of contaminants with currents and their deposition into sediments in aquatic environments therefore understanding the interrelated processes of dom contaminants binding is crucial to the distribution transport and fate of contaminants previous studies have described the essential binding mechanisms of model dom with pfaas kothawala et al 2017 liu et al 2021 wen et al 2016 xia et al 2015 whereas the interactions between dom and pfaas under natural conditions are largely unexplored results of this study demonstrated that the pfaas as well as other organic inorganic substances were captured by the dom via coupling field observations with elaborately designed experiments indicating that dom polymers microgel are crucial in regulating the level of contaminants the transformations between dom polymers and microgel can be affected by the source and physicochemical properties of dom solution chemical properties such as ph cationic strength and pollutant level illumination intensity and hydrodynamic characteristics he et al 2016b shiu et al 2018 2020 the transformative balances may directly determine the mobility and sedimentation of dom binding contaminants in aquatic environments and further affect the bioaccumulation and environmental risks of higher trophic predators including filter feeders and even humans 4 conclusions this study provided comprehensive insights into the interaction between dom and pfaas in natural rivers and lakes by combining field and laboratory experiments the findings revealed that pfaas were dominated by c3 7 pfcas and pfos in the surface water of the northwest of taihu lake basin dom mainly comprised tyrosine like fulvic like and tryptophan like substances dom exhibited significant correlations with pfaas and fulvic acid like substances were identified as the dominant factor affecting pfaa distribution in natural rivers and lakes the laboratorial results further indicated that dom in river and lake waters could spontaneously form microgels and that pfaas can be effectively captured during this process the capture of pfaas in dom aggregation was through the combined effects of various substances which might be primarily fulvic like substances held together with proteins pfaas affinity with dom was largely dependent on the perfluorinated carbon numbers the hydrophobicity and the numbers of free negatively charged functional groups of the dom and pfaas were likely responsible for the hydrophobic binding and crosslinking with cations respectively our results highlighted the significance of dom pfaa binding which can be helpful to understand the multiphase distribution transport and fate of pfaas in a natural aquatic environment declaration of

16097,cupric oxide cuo is able to catalyze the reactions among disinfectant extracellular polymeric substances eps and bromide br in copper pipes which may deteriorate the water quality this study aimed to investigate the metabonomic and transcriptomic modulations of hepg2 cells caused by the cuo catalyzed formation of disinfection byproducts dbps from eps the presence of cuo favored the substitution reactions of chlorine and bromine with eps inducing a higher content of total organic halogen tox in addition dbps were shifted from chlorinated species to brominated species a total of 182 differential metabolites dms and 437 differentially expressed genes degs were identified which were jointly involved in 38 kegg pathways topology analysis indicates that glycerophospholipid and purine metabolism were disturbed most obviously during glycerophospholipid metabolism the differential expression of genes gpats agpats lpins and dgks impacted the conversion of glycerol 3 phosphate to 2 diacyl sn glycerol which further affected the conversion among phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine and phosphocholines during purine metabolism it was mainly the differential expression of genes polrs rpas rpbs rpcs entpds and cds that impacted the transformation of rna into guanine xanthosine inosine and adenosine monophosphate which were further successively transformed into their

drinking water transportation and household plumbing due to its bactericidal ability feng et al 1996 duan et al 2021 copper pipes are bound to corrode internally after a long time of contact with water and the main corrosion product on the surface is cupric oxide cuo li et al 2007 xiao et al 2007 in the corrosion scales of copper pipes delivering the tap water of beijing city the content of cuo was in the range of 28 3 57 1 li et al 2007 the formation of biofilm is always accompanied by the corrosion of water pipes despite a high dose of residual chlorine is often used to restrict the microbial growth in drinking water distribution systems dwdss lechevallier et al 1988 mathieu et al 2014 it occurs due to the proliferation of attached microbes and the strengthening of sessile structure favored by self secreted extracellular polymeric substances eps xue et al 2012 liu et al 2017 the eps is composed of proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids and lipids accounting for 85 of the biofilm wingender et al 1999 it was demonstrated that biofilm eps is a non negligible precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps in chlorinated waters because of its high nitrogen content than natural organic matter nom wang et al 2012 2013 the br concentration in dwdss can reach hundreds of µg l 1 d alessandro et al 2008 tan et al 2016 yu et al 2019 and can be oxidized to hypobromous acid hobr by hypochlorous acid hocl hu et al 2016 hobr can react rapidly with dissolved organic matter to yield brominated dbps br dbps pan and zhang 2013 which are more carcinogenic than their chlorinated analogues cl dbps nobukawa and sanukida 2000 in a study of wang et al 2012 biofilm eps was selected as a precursor to investigate the formation of cl and br dbps including trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans and halonitromethanes hnms during the chlorination of br containing waters however most of dbps are still unidentified thus total organic halogen tox including total organic chlorine bromine and iodine tocl tobr and toi is a more appropriate dbps indicator pipe corrosion products seriously impact the formation of dbps through catalytic oxidation or reduction possibly deteriorating water quality chun et al 2005 lin et al 2008 gallard et al 2009 liu and croue 2016 ding et al 2019 duan et al 2021 in the case of cuo it mainly acts as a heterogeneous catalyst in the dbps formation on the one hand the deprotonated hocl or hobr clo or bro can form a complex with cuo enhancing its reactivity with the slow reacting organic moieties hu et al 2016 huang et al 2019 one the other hand the cuo ocl or cuo obr complex reacts with hocl or hobr to form chlorate clo3 or bromate bro3 respectively accelerating the oxidant decay liu et al 2012 the dbps formation is enhanced by the former while inhibited by the latter hence the cuo induced catalysis should be taken into account when studying the tox generation from biofilm eps so far it remains uncertain for the potential adverse effects of the cuo catalyzed dbps formation in particular the metabolic and transcriptional endpoints may cause serious human health problems thus deserving a more comprehensive study in general classic toxicology investigations are based on mammalian cell exposure tests muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2008 while its speed and accuracy are restricted by substantial time and resources required yue et al 2019 in recent years the development in bioinformatics and high throughput sequencing provides new insights into the molecular

the toxicity assessment of pure chemicals and complex mixtures knasmüller et al 2004 marabini et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 yue et al 2019 to evaluate the toxicity of dbps hepg2 cells were exposed to the surface water treated with different disinfectants and their survival rates were recorded marabini et al 2006 in addition the dna damage of hepg2 cells exposed to 15 dbps species was compared by single cell gel electrophoresis assay zhang et al 2012 however to our knowledge there is lack of investigation with respect to the adverse impacts of dbps on human from the perspectives of metabolomics and transcriptomics of hepg2 cells the purpose of this study was to investigate the metabonomic and transcriptomic modulations of hepg2 cells caused by the cuo catalyzed dbp formation

and bromine species generally hocl is converted to tocl cl and clo3 while br is transformed to hobr tobr and bro3 in a hocl br cuo system with this in mind the above items were simultaneously monitored to explore the variation of chlorine and bromine species when eps existed in the hocl br cuo system the time dependent profiles of residual oxidants illustrate that oxidant decay was obviously promoted by cuo fig s1 after 4 h of reaction residual oxidants remained at a concentration of 65 6 μm in the absence of cuo while almost entirely decayed in the presence of cuo the cuo catalyzed oxidant decay was also observed in the hocl br cuo system containing nom hu et al 2016 among the residual oxidants hocl was dominant and hobr was minor fig 1 regardless of cuo existence hocl concentration decreased all the time while hobr concentration increased first and then decreased according to a study by langsa et al 2017 during the chlorination of bromide containing waters the formed hobr reacted with orgainc matters via two pathways one is electrophilic substitution to form tobr the other one is electron transfer to form br then the released br was re oxidized by excess hocl to hobr which resulted in an almost complete bromine incorporation to orgainc matters through further electrophilic substitution in this study the hobr peak may be ascribed to the higher rate of hobr formation than hobr consumption within 30 min obviously cuo promoted the decay of both hocl and hobr for example hobr achieved maximum concentrations of 1 5 and 1 2 μm and disappeared within 12 and 4 h in the absence and presence of cuo respectively as demonstrated in the introduction section the cuo catalyzed decay of hocl and hobr may be due to the enhanced reactions of chlorine and bromine with eps and accelerated decomposition through disproportionation reaction and oxygen generation liu et al 2012 zhang and andrews 2012 however the formation of clo3 and bro3 was not observed throughout the experiments suggesting that the decomposition of hocl and hobr via disproportionation reaction was negligible even under the catalysis of cuo it was reported that the cuo catalyzed decomposition rates of hocl and hobr via oxygen generation were 2 7 and 0 6 times of those via disproportionation reaction respectively liu et al 2012 therefore the decomposition of hobr through oxygen genereation had no significance for the interpretation of hobr decay catalyzed by cuo however the contribution of hocl decomposition through oxygen generation to cuo catalyzed hocl decay is uncertain since the products were halogen ions which were also generated in the reactions of hocl with organics in the absence and presence of cuo the concentrations of cl were 83 7 and 158 3 μm and those of br were 4 3 and 3 3 μm repectively after 24 h of reaction correspondingly based on the mass balance eqs 1 and 2 the contents of tocl and tobr were calculated to be 75 8 and 8 1 μm and 117 7 and 9 3 μm in the absence and presence of cuo repectively the result suggests that the presence of cuo facilitated the substitution reaction of chlorine and bromine with eps to form cl and br dbps 1 tocl 2 hocl 0 2 hocl c l clo 3 2 tobr b r 0 2 hobr b r bro 3 three classes of dbps thms haas and hans were chosen to investigate the substitution of bromine and chlorine on eps as shown in fig 2 the presence of cuo evidently promoted the formation of the three dbp classes from eps which is similar to the circumstance with nom as the precursor li et al 2007 zhang and andrews 2012 under the cuo catalysis the formation potentials of thms haas and hans from eps increased by 10 4 32 3 and 25 7 respectively bromine incorporation factor bif was used to characterize the effect of cuo on the species of dbps which refers to the proportion of br dbps partially or totally substituted by bromine text s11 in the presence of cuo the bif values of thms haas and hans increased from 1 6 to 1 8 1 1 to 1 3 and 0 6 to 0 8 respectively the result means that cuo shifted dbps from chlorinated to brominated species to some extent that is both the variation of dbps yield and species induced by cuo catalysis probably increased the toxicity of drinking water to choose a suitable dbps concentration for metabonomic and transcriptomic assays the growth of hepg2 cells in the filtered reaction solutions diluted at different ratios was tested the formed dbps showed a visible inhibition on cell growth at dilution ratios of 102 fig s2 a distinct but not excessive decrease in cell viability was observed only at a dilution ratio of 10 which is suitable to identify the dms and degs induced by the formed dbps under cuo catalysis 3 2 metabonomic modulations untargeted metabolites were identified by uplc tof ms and then unsupervised multivariate analysis was used to provide an initial evaluation of metabolic perturbations caused by the cuo catalyzed dbps formation the group treated by the cuo catalyzed solution group c was visually separated from that by non catalytic solution group nc by principal component analysis pca fig s3 next supervised multivariate analysis was used to discover the metabolic signatures that distinguish the two groups and orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis opls da was employed to minimize within group variations in fig 3 clear distinctions were observed between the two groups the opls da model was internally cross validated in which strong associations between the measured and predicted outputs were obtained furthermore the permutation testing confirmed that the opls da model was robust each dm contributing to the separation of the metabolic profiles was computed in the opls da model text s5 a total of 182 dms were identified and then mapped into biochemical pathways through metabolic enrichment and pathway analysis based on the keeg database as shown in fig 4 two obviously disturbed metabolic pathways glycerophospholipid metabolism id map00564 and purine metabolism id map00230 were screened by topology analysis the involved dms mainly consisted of guanosine guanine inosine xanthosine hypoxanthine adenosine diphosphate ribose 3 adenosine phosphate phosphocholine phosphatidylserine and 15 phosphatidylcholines the first two were up regulated while the others were down regulated table 1 3 3 transcriptomic modulations 3 3 1 transcriptome assembly and annotation to obtain an overview of the gene expression profile in hepg2 cells the cdna samples with three duplicates were collected from groups c and nc and sequenced by illumina hiseq xten novaseq 6000 sequencers the clean reads were assembled into 25 489 genes 120 276 of which exhibited annotations against databases go kegg cog nr swiss prot and pfam using blast and hmmer software fig s4 to further understand the functional features of the acquired genes the annotation and classification were conducted against the go and kegg databases for go 20 882 genes 81 93 were successfully annotated and then assigned to 20 functional terms fig s5 the go database usually divides genes into three different ontologies known as biological process bp molecular function mf and cellular component cc chai et al 2020 the go annotation analysis denoted that the bp categories consisting of 10 functional groups possessed the largest number of annotations with cellular process followed by biological regulation and metabolic process the mf categories contained 3 functional groups in which most genes were related to the term of binding in the cc categories 7 functional groups were predicted and the genes involving in cell part and organelle were highly represented in the kegg database 16 363 genes 64 2 were annotated and classified into 6 branches metabolism genetic information processing environmental information processing cellular processes human diseases organismal system involving 38 known kegg pathways fig s6 3 3 2 degs analysis to identify the degs a comparison was performed between groups c and nc by the deseq2 degseq edger method the pca plot shows that the two groups were clearly separated fig s7 a total of 437 degs were identified and the volcano plot illustrated that 40 and 397 degs were up and down regulated respectively fig s8 to gain insights into the biological roles of the degs go categories enrichment analysis was conducted in which the degs were classified into three major functional categories based on the criteria of p value 0 05 the numbers of go terms in bp cc and mf categories were 42 3 and 8 respectively fig 5 a shows the top 10 go terms which all belong to the bp category the kegg pathway enrichment analysis was also performed to evaluate the biological significance of the degs hypergeometric tests with a p value 0 05 were used as the criteria for pathway detection after mapping into the kegg database the degs were successfully annotated and assigned to 8 functional pathways for choline metabolism in cancer hepatitis b endocrine resistance c type lectin receptor signaling tgf beta signaling rna degradation rna transport and rna polymerase fig 5b the validity of gene expression patterns was confirmed by qrt pcr four degs were chosen which were related to the impact of cuo induced dbps on hepg2 cells as shown in fig s9 the expression level of the four degs exhibited the identical up regulated trend with the rna seq results thus the accuracy of rna seq data was verified to be confidential 3 4 conjoint analysis of metabonomics and transcriptomics the kegg pathways involved by metabolites and genes were compared to obtain the number of pathways jointly involved in the metabolome and transcriptome chen and boutros 2011 the venn diagram shows that 61 and 218 pathways were involved with the dms and degs respectively 38 of which were jointly involved by the dms and degs fig s10 the top 10 pathways involved in metabolome and transcriptome are shown in fig s11 to integrate the pathway data intuitively and comprehensively the dms and degs were simultaneously mapped into a diagram of kegg pathways next the dms and degs involved in the same pathway were labeled to visualize the kegg pathways luo and brouwer 2013 in the section 3 2 glycerophospholipid and purine metabolism were considered as the most obviously disturbed so the associated kegg pathways were chosen to perform the visualization analysis figs 6 and s12 shows the visualized pathway images of glycerophospholipid and purine metabolisms in which the dms and degs were clearly recorded during the glycerophospholipid metabolism glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase and 1 acylglycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase were expressed from genes gpats and agpats respectively lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase and diacylglycerol kinase were expressed from genes lpins and dgks fig 6 a illustrates that the differential expression of genes gpat3 agpat6 and agpat9 impacted the transformation from glycerol 3 phosphate into 1 2 diacyl sn glycerol 3 phosphate and that of genes lpins and dgks influenced the conversion between 1 2 diacyl sn glycerol 3 phosphate and 2 diacyl sn glycerol which further affected the conversion among phosphatidylcholine phosphatidyl l serine phosphocholine and 1 acyl sn glycerol 3 phosphocholine during the purine metabolism the rna polymerase is expressed from genes polrs pras prbs and prcs ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase is expressed from genes entpds and cds and phosphodiesterase is expressed from genes pdes as shown in fig 6b the differential expression of genes polr1b polr2b polr3b rpa2 rpb2 rpb11 rpc2 entpd1 and cd39 affected the conversion of rna via two pathways one is to yield guanine monophosphate gmp by guanine triphosphate gtp and guanine diphosphate gdp the other is to yield adenosine monophosphate amp by adenosine triphosphate atp and adenosine diphosphate adp afterwards amp can be transformed into gmp by inosine monophosphate imp and xanthosine monophosphate xmp finally the four nucleotides were converted to corresponding nucleosides and purines taking gmp as an example guanosine and guanine were formed successively in addition the differential expression of genes entpd1 and cd39 also impacted the transformation from inosine diphosphate idp and adp ribose into imp and that of genes pde7 and pde8 affected the conversion of 3 5 cyclic amp to amp to sum up the dbps yield and species were obviously altered under the catalysis of cuo which induced the metabonomic and transcriptomic modulations of hepg2 cells through the analysis of biochemical pathways involved by the identified dms and degs glycerophospholipid and purine metabolisms were deemed to be important modulations during glycerophospholipid metabolism the differential expression of genes gpats agpats lpins and dgks affected the transformation of glycerol 3 phosphate into 2 diacyl sn glycerol which further impacted the transformation among phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine and phosphocholines during purine metabolism it was mainly the differential expression of genes polrs rpas rpbs rpcs entpds and cds that impacted the transformation of rna into guanine xanthosine inosine and adenosine monophosphate which were further suceesively transformed into their corresponding nucleosides and purines 4 conclusions this study aimed to investigate the cuo catalyzed formation of tox from eps and the resulting metabonomic and transcriptomic modulations of hepg2 cells based on the experimental data the following conclusions are drawn the presence of cuo not only facilitated the substitution reaction of chlorine and bromine with eps to form tox but also shifted dbps species from chlorinated to brominated analogues the yield and species variations had an obvious inhibitory effect on the hepg2 cell growth a total of 182 dms were identified glycerophospholipid and purine metabolisms were most

16097,cupric oxide cuo is able to catalyze the reactions among disinfectant extracellular polymeric substances eps and bromide br in copper pipes which may deteriorate the water quality this study aimed to investigate the metabonomic and transcriptomic modulations of hepg2 cells caused by the cuo catalyzed formation of disinfection byproducts dbps from eps the presence of cuo favored the substitution reactions of chlorine and bromine with eps inducing a higher content of total organic halogen tox in addition dbps were shifted from chlorinated species to brominated species a total of 182 differential metabolites dms and 437 differentially expressed genes degs were identified which were jointly involved in 38 kegg pathways topology analysis indicates that glycerophospholipid and purine metabolism were disturbed most obviously during glycerophospholipid metabolism the differential expression of genes gpats agpats lpins and dgks impacted the conversion of glycerol 3 phosphate to 2 diacyl sn glycerol which further affected the conversion among phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine and phosphocholines during purine metabolism it was mainly the differential expression of genes polrs rpas rpbs rpcs entpds and cds that impacted the transformation of rna into guanine xanthosine inosine and adenosine monophosphate which were further successively transformed into their

abstract keywords cupric oxide extracellular polymeric substances total organic halogen hepg2 cells metabonomics and transcriptomics 1 introduction copper is considered as a preferred material for drinking water transportation and household plumbing due to its bactericidal ability feng et al 1996 duan et al 2021 copper pipes are bound to corrode internally after a long time of contact with water and the main corrosion product on the surface is cupric oxide cuo li et al 2007 xiao et al 2007 in the corrosion scales of copper pipes delivering the tap water of beijing city the content of cuo was in the range of 28 3 57 1 li et al 2007 the formation of biofilm is always accompanied by the corrosion of water pipes despite a high dose of residual chlorine is often used to restrict the microbial growth in drinking water distribution systems dwdss lechevallier et al 1988 mathieu et al 2014 it occurs due to the proliferation of attached microbes and the strengthening of sessile structure favored by self secreted extracellular polymeric substances eps xue et al 2012 liu et al 2017 the eps is composed of proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids and lipids accounting for 85 of the biofilm wingender et al 1999 it was demonstrated that biofilm eps is a non negligible precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps in chlorinated waters because of its high nitrogen content than natural organic matter nom wang et al 2012 2013 the br concentration in dwdss can reach hundreds of µg l 1 d alessandro et al 2008 tan et al 2016 yu et al 2019 and can be oxidized to hypobromous acid hobr by hypochlorous acid hocl hu et al 2016 hobr can react rapidly with dissolved organic matter to yield brominated dbps br dbps pan and zhang 2013 which are more carcinogenic than their chlorinated analogues cl dbps nobukawa and sanukida 2000 in a study of wang et al 2012 biofilm eps was selected as a precursor to investigate the formation of cl and br dbps including trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans and halonitromethanes hnms during the chlorination of br containing waters however most of dbps are still unidentified thus total organic halogen tox including total organic chlorine bromine and iodine tocl tobr and toi is a more appropriate dbps indicator pipe corrosion products seriously impact the formation of dbps through catalytic oxidation or reduction possibly deteriorating water quality chun et al 2005 lin et al 2008 gallard et al 2009 liu and croue 2016 ding et al 2019 duan et al 2021 in the case of cuo it mainly acts as a heterogeneous catalyst in the dbps formation on the one hand the deprotonated hocl or hobr clo or bro can form a complex with cuo enhancing its reactivity with the slow reacting organic moieties hu et al 2016 huang et al 2019 one the other hand the cuo ocl or cuo obr complex reacts with hocl or hobr to form chlorate clo3 or bromate bro3 respectively accelerating the oxidant decay liu et al 2012 the dbps formation is enhanced by the former while inhibited by the latter hence the cuo induced catalysis should be taken into account when studying the tox generation from biofilm eps so far it remains uncertain for the potential adverse effects of the cuo catalyzed dbps formation in particular the metabolic and transcriptional endpoints may cause serious human health problems thus deserving a more comprehensive study in general classic toxicology investigations are based on mammalian cell exposure tests muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2008 while its speed and accuracy are restricted by substantial time and resources required yue et al 2019 in recent years the development in bioinformatics and high throughput sequencing provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying toxicity zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2016 ji et al 2019 the adverse outcome pathway framework for describing the primary causal link from a direct molecular initiating event mie to a higher level of population responses was constructed to predict the way of chemicals acting on human kramer et al 2011 vinken 2013 the integration of emerging omics techniques metabolomics and transcriptomics provides a viable solution to discover the key mies responsible for potential adverse effects human hepatoma cell line hepg2 is not only easy to handle but also a sensitive tool for the toxicity assessment of pure chemicals and complex mixtures knasmüller et al 2004 marabini et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 yue et al 2019 to evaluate the toxicity of dbps hepg2 cells were exposed to the surface water treated with different disinfectants and their survival rates were recorded marabini et al 2006 in addition the dna damage of hepg2 cells exposed to 15 dbps species was compared by single cell gel electrophoresis assay zhang et al 2012 however to our knowledge there is lack of investigation with respect to the adverse impacts of dbps on human from the perspectives of metabolomics and transcriptomics of hepg2 cells the purpose of this study was to investigate the metabonomic and transcriptomic modulations of hepg2 cells caused by the cuo catalyzed dbp formation from eps the issues focused on 1 studying the conversion of chlorine and bromine species in the hocl br cuo system containing eps 2 identifying the differential metabolites dms and differentially

catalysis the formation potentials of thms haas and hans from eps increased by 10 4 32 3 and 25 7 respectively bromine incorporation factor bif was used to characterize the effect of cuo on the species of dbps which refers to the proportion of br dbps partially or totally substituted by bromine text s11 in the presence of cuo the bif values of thms haas and hans increased from 1 6 to 1 8 1 1 to 1 3 and 0 6 to 0 8 respectively the result means that cuo shifted dbps from chlorinated to brominated species to some extent that is both the variation of dbps yield and species induced by cuo catalysis probably increased the toxicity of drinking water to choose a suitable dbps concentration for metabonomic and transcriptomic assays the growth of hepg2 cells in the filtered reaction solutions diluted at different ratios was tested the formed dbps showed a visible inhibition on cell growth at dilution ratios of 102 fig s2 a distinct but not excessive decrease in cell viability was observed only at a dilution ratio of 10 which is suitable to identify the dms and degs induced by the formed dbps under cuo catalysis 3 2 metabonomic modulations untargeted metabolites were identified by uplc tof ms and then unsupervised multivariate analysis was used to provide an initial evaluation of metabolic perturbations caused by the cuo catalyzed dbps formation the group treated by the cuo catalyzed solution group c was visually separated from that by non catalytic solution group nc by principal component analysis pca fig s3 next supervised multivariate analysis was used to discover the metabolic signatures that distinguish the two groups and orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis opls da was employed to minimize within group variations in fig 3 clear distinctions were observed between the two groups the opls da model was internally cross validated in which strong associations between the measured and predicted outputs were obtained furthermore the permutation testing confirmed that the opls da model was robust each dm contributing to the separation of the metabolic profiles was computed in the opls da model text s5 a total of 182 dms were identified and then mapped into biochemical pathways through metabolic enrichment and pathway analysis based on the keeg database as shown in fig 4 two obviously disturbed metabolic pathways glycerophospholipid metabolism id map00564 and purine metabolism id map00230 were screened by topology analysis the involved dms mainly consisted of guanosine guanine inosine xanthosine hypoxanthine adenosine diphosphate ribose 3 adenosine phosphate phosphocholine phosphatidylserine and 15 phosphatidylcholines the first two were up regulated while the others were down regulated table 1 3 3 transcriptomic modulations 3 3 1 transcriptome assembly and annotation to obtain an overview of the gene expression profile in hepg2 cells the cdna samples with three duplicates were collected from groups c and nc and sequenced by illumina hiseq xten novaseq 6000 sequencers the clean reads were assembled into 25 489 genes 120 276 of which exhibited annotations against databases go kegg cog nr swiss prot and pfam using blast and hmmer software fig s4 to further understand the functional features of the acquired genes the annotation and classification were conducted against the go and kegg databases for go 20 882 genes 81 93 were successfully annotated and then assigned to 20 functional terms fig s5 the go database usually divides genes into three different ontologies known as biological process bp molecular function mf and cellular component cc chai et al 2020 the go annotation analysis denoted that the bp categories consisting of 10 functional groups possessed the largest number of annotations with cellular process followed by biological regulation and metabolic process the mf categories contained 3 functional groups in which most genes were related to the term of binding in the cc categories 7 functional groups were predicted and the genes involving in cell part and organelle were highly represented in the kegg database 16 363 genes 64 2 were annotated and classified into 6 branches metabolism genetic information processing environmental information processing cellular processes human diseases organismal system involving 38 known kegg pathways fig s6 3 3 2 degs analysis to identify the degs a comparison was performed between groups c and nc by the deseq2 degseq edger method the pca plot shows that the two groups were clearly separated fig s7 a total of 437 degs were identified and the volcano plot illustrated that 40 and 397 degs were up and down regulated respectively fig s8 to gain insights into the biological roles of the degs go categories enrichment analysis was conducted in which the degs were classified into three major functional categories based on the criteria of p value 0 05 the numbers of go terms in bp cc and mf categories were 42 3 and 8 respectively fig 5 a shows the top 10 go terms which all belong to the bp category the kegg pathway enrichment analysis was also performed to evaluate the biological significance of the degs hypergeometric tests with a p value 0 05 were used as the criteria for pathway detection after mapping into the kegg database the degs were successfully annotated and assigned to 8 functional pathways for choline metabolism in cancer hepatitis b endocrine resistance c type lectin receptor signaling tgf beta signaling rna degradation rna transport and rna polymerase fig 5b the validity of gene expression patterns was confirmed by qrt pcr four degs were chosen which were related to the impact of cuo induced dbps on hepg2 cells as shown in fig s9 the expression level of the four degs exhibited the identical up regulated trend with the rna seq results thus the accuracy of rna seq data was verified to be confidential 3 4 conjoint analysis of metabonomics and transcriptomics the kegg pathways involved by metabolites and genes were compared to obtain the number of pathways jointly involved in the metabolome and transcriptome chen and boutros 2011 the venn diagram shows that 61 and 218 pathways were involved with the dms and degs respectively 38 of which were jointly involved by the dms and degs fig s10 the top 10 pathways involved in metabolome and transcriptome are shown in fig s11 to integrate the pathway data intuitively and comprehensively the dms and degs were simultaneously mapped into a diagram of kegg pathways next the dms and degs involved in the same pathway were labeled to visualize the kegg pathways luo and brouwer 2013 in the section 3 2 glycerophospholipid and purine metabolism were considered as the most obviously disturbed so the associated kegg pathways were chosen to perform the visualization analysis figs 6 and s12 shows the visualized pathway images of glycerophospholipid and purine metabolisms in which the dms and degs were clearly recorded during the glycerophospholipid metabolism glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase and 1 acylglycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase were expressed from genes gpats and agpats respectively lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase and diacylglycerol kinase were expressed from genes lpins and dgks fig 6 a illustrates that the differential expression of genes gpat3 agpat6 and agpat9 impacted the transformation from glycerol 3 phosphate into 1 2 diacyl sn glycerol 3 phosphate and that of genes lpins and dgks influenced the conversion between 1 2 diacyl sn glycerol 3 phosphate and 2 diacyl sn glycerol which further affected the conversion among phosphatidylcholine phosphatidyl l serine phosphocholine and 1 acyl sn glycerol 3 phosphocholine during the purine metabolism the rna polymerase is expressed from genes polrs pras prbs and prcs ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase is expressed from genes entpds and cds and phosphodiesterase is expressed from genes pdes as shown in fig 6b the differential expression of genes polr1b polr2b polr3b rpa2 rpb2 rpb11 rpc2 entpd1 and cd39 affected the conversion of rna via two pathways one is to yield guanine monophosphate gmp by guanine triphosphate gtp and guanine diphosphate gdp the other is to yield adenosine monophosphate amp by adenosine triphosphate atp and adenosine diphosphate adp afterwards amp can be transformed into gmp by inosine monophosphate imp and xanthosine monophosphate xmp finally the four nucleotides were converted to corresponding nucleosides and purines taking gmp as an example guanosine and guanine were formed successively in addition the differential expression of genes entpd1 and cd39 also impacted the transformation from inosine diphosphate idp and adp ribose into imp and that of genes pde7 and pde8 affected the conversion of 3 5 cyclic amp to amp to sum up the dbps yield and species were obviously altered under the catalysis of cuo which induced the metabonomic and transcriptomic modulations of hepg2 cells through the analysis of biochemical pathways involved by the identified dms and degs glycerophospholipid and purine metabolisms were deemed to be important modulations during glycerophospholipid metabolism the differential expression of genes gpats agpats lpins and dgks affected the transformation of glycerol 3 phosphate into 2 diacyl sn glycerol which further impacted the transformation among phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine and phosphocholines during purine metabolism it was mainly the differential expression of genes polrs rpas rpbs rpcs entpds and cds that impacted the transformation of rna into guanine xanthosine inosine and adenosine monophosphate which were further suceesively transformed into their corresponding nucleosides and purines 4 conclusions this study aimed to investigate the cuo catalyzed formation of tox from eps and the resulting metabonomic and transcriptomic modulations of hepg2 cells based on the experimental data the following conclusions are drawn the presence of cuo not only facilitated the substitution reaction of chlorine and bromine with eps to form tox but also shifted dbps species from chlorinated to brominated analogues the yield and species variations had an obvious inhibitory effect on the hepg2 cell growth a total of 182 dms were identified glycerophospholipid and purine metabolisms were most obviously disturbed the involved dms consisted of guanine guanosine inosine xanthosine hypoxanthine 3 adenosine phosphate adenosine diphosphate ribose phosphocholine phosphatidylserine and 15 phosphatidylcholines the first two were up regulated while the others were down regulated of 437 degs 40 were up regulated while 397 were down regulated the degs were annotated and assigned to 8

16098,to make purple phototrophic bacteria ppb based technologies a reality for resource recovery research must be demonstrated outdoors using scaled reactors in this study a 10 m long ppb enriched flat plate photobioreactor fppbr with a volume of 0 95 m3 was operated for 253 days fed with poultry processing wastewater different operational strategies were tested including varying influent types retention times feeding strategies and anaerobic aerobic conditions in a novel mixed metabolic mode concept the overall results show that regardless of the fermented wastewater fed raw or after solid removal via dissolved air flotation and the varying environmental conditions e g light exposure and temperatures the fppbr provided effective volatile fatty acids vfas n and p removals average efficiencies of 90 34 77 and 28 45 respectively the removal of n and p was limited by the availability of biodegradable cod biomass c n and p could be harvested at 90 vs ts ratio 58 crude protein content and a suitable amino acid profile for potential feed applications during fully anaerobic operation with semicontinuous day only feeding the fppbr showed biomass productivities between 25 and 84 g vs m 2 d 1 high due to solid influx the productivities estimated from cod removal rates were 6 0 24 g vs m 2 d 1 conservative values and soluble cod removal rates of up to 1 0 g l 1 d 1 overall average of 0 34 0 16 g l 1 d 1 under these conditions the relative abundance of ppb in the harvested biomass was up to 56 a minimum overall hrt of 2 2 4 d 1 0 1 2 d when only fed during the day is recommended to avoid ppb washout assuming no biomass retention a combined daily illuminated anaerobic night aerobic operation supplying air during night time exploiting photoheterotrophy during the day and aerobic chemoheterotrophy of the same bacteria at night improved the overall removal performance avoiding vfa accumulation during the night however while enabling enhanced treatment this resulted in a lower relative abundance of ppb and reduced biomass productivities highlighting the need to balance resource recovery and treatment goals graphical abstract image graphical abstract

introduction purple phototrophic bacteria ppb have reappeared recently as a potential mediator for resource recovery from wastewater transforming its constituents into single cell proteins scp and several other products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha hydrogen carotenoids or fertilizers capson tojo et al 2020 recent literature has exploited their anaerobic photoheterotrophic metabolism which enables simultaneous removal and recovery of organics nitrogen and phosphorus at biomass yields close to 1 0 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 cod being chemical oxygen demand capson tojo et al 2020 high biomass yields during photoheterotrophic growth are enabled by the utilisation of light as energy source i e photophosphorylation and to a lesser extent phosphorylation ppb use mostly near infrared nir light to drive photoheterotrophic metabolism under anaerobic conditions a capability almost exclusive to ppb saer and blankenship 2017 nir light is harvested via bacteriochlorophylls bchls a and b with maximum absorption peaks between 780 and 1040 nm saer and blankenship 2017 ppb dominance in photoheterotrophic cultures artificially illuminated with nir light for resource recovery has been proven at lab scale in various reactors for a range of municipal and industrial wastewaters hülsen et al 2018a 2018b lópez serna et al 2019 the incident illumination intensities in these experiments varied between 2 0 and 270 w m 2 chitapornpan et al 2013 dalaei et al 2020 with even the lowest intensities being prohibitively expensive when considering a ppb process at scale capson tojo et al 2020 the most logical solution for this challenge is outdoors operation reducing the capital for lamps and frames and operational costs of illumination to zero due to natural light non nir wavelengths i e visible or ultraviolet uv vis can be eliminated with a low cost filter to date there are only a handful of articles reporting outdoors ppb reactor operation and most of them did not focus on wastewater treatment or nutrient recovery but on the generation of hydrogen and pha from artificial media adessi et al 2012 carlozzi et al 2006 carlozzi and sacchi 2001 while these studies exposed the ppb reactors to changing environmental conditions they are not relevant to wastewater treatment applications as artificial media and pure cultures were used in particular in wastewater applications influent contamination results in competition with non phototrophic heterotrophic microbes changing irradiances and temperatures including day and night fluctuations create very dynamic conditions that are expected to affect the wastewater treatment performance via kinetic microbial and metabolic changes as well as chemical and physiological changes due to varying wastewater characteristics so far only one study has assessed these factors in ppb outdoors reactors confirming the feasibility of this approach and the resilience of ppb to changing environmental conditions hülsen et al 2022 for ppb technology to emerge as a realistic resource recovery alternative outdoors implementation at scale and using real wastewater needs to be tested a general sense of design parameters including hydraulic retention time hrt sludge retention time srt organic loading rate olr as well as influent loads removal rates removal efficiencies and biomass productivities are also required this is crucial to advance the current infancy of ppb technology to the next level but also to avoid extrapolating unrealistically high performances from small lab scale reactors to scaled outdoor photobioreactors pbrs as previously experienced with microalgae richardson et al 2014 sensationalised productivities from the lab in algae systems e g 60 g m 2 d 1 or 220 tonnes ha 1 d 1 national research council 2012 attracted major interest and investment that could not be translated into the field at least not as annual daily average performance this is because photosynthetic efficiencies were lower and culture instabilities and grazers impacted productivities among several other issues day et al 2017 taiganides 1992 these problems apply mainly to open ponds which have lower cost compared with closed pbrs benemann et al 2018 closed pbrs for microalgae production were deemed too expensive capital and operational for wastewater treatment as production costs generally exceed the relatively low value of the product acién et al 2017 the main challenge in ppb reactor research is to identify an economic reactor design which allows reasonable translation of laboratory research and hence avoids the issues which have hindered uptake of algae systems this requires testing of pbrs in field relevant conditions early in the technology cycle preferably using natural light the metabolic diversity of ppb and mixed culture communities in addition offers the opportunity to operate photoheterotrophically at anaerobic illuminated conditions during the day phani and chemoheterotrophically under aerobic dark conditions during the night chaerd to the best of our knowledge this mixed metabolic mode 3m concept with ppb named 3mppb has not been tested to date both metabolic modes phani and chaerd have been studied separately with ppb rapidly outcompeted by non phototrophic aerobes under prolonged continuous aeration capson tojo et al 2021 however regular metabolic mode changes in day night coupled to anaerobic aerobic interval changes have not been studied and might offer the potential to polish or even treat wastewater at night at the expense of lower nutrient recovery efficiencies and biomass productivities due to oxidative losses this study aims to evaluate the performance of a 10 m long 950 l outdoor ppb flat plate photobioreactor fppbr for resource recovery from poultry processing wastewater for this purpose a scalable modular fppbr was operated for 253 days exposed to naturally varying environmental conditions various design and operational aspects were tested e g hrt olr feeding regimes etc to optimise the treatment performance and biomass productivities large quantities of ppb biomass were harvested to enable the value evaluation of the scp product finally the possibility of aerating at night in a mixed metabolic mode system 3mppb was assessed 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater origin pretreatments and characteristics poultry processing wastewater from a poultry processing facility in brisbane australia was used as feed the system was installed on site pumping the wastewater directly from its source grit trap outlet the raw wastewater was a mixture of water streams resulting from feather removal bird degutting and general cleaning due to the high solid contents in the raw wastewater solids accumulated at the bottom and the top of the pilot feed tank a 1000 l intermediate bulk container ibc which resulted in substantial variations in wastewater characteristics because of this issue after phase i the feed was subsequently taken from the outlet of the primary dissolved air flotation daf unit no polymers or flocculants were used the daf effluent was fermented in the feed tank to improve the bioavailability of organic matter and nutrients for the ppb table 1 presents the characteristics of the streams and shows a considerable increase of volatile fatty acids vfas nh3 n and po4 3 p after fermentation the data also show substantial fluctuations of all measured components a more extensive characterisation of the raw wastewater the daf effluent and the fermenter effluent as well as the variations of their compositions over time can be found in the supplementary material table s1 and figs s1 s3 2 2 flat plate photobioreactor fppbr set up depending on the operational phase either raw wastewater or daf effluent was used as feed to the fppbr as noted above the feed was fermented in an ibc with a volume of 1 m3 the fermenter was operated continuously at an hrt of 1 d and mixed intermittently 15 min every 2 h via internal liquid recycle provided by a positive displacement pump mono cp25 nov australia pty ltd victoria australia 25 l min 1 the same pump model was used to transfer raw wastewater to the ibc the high level in the fermenter was maintained via an overflow at the top and the bottom via a standpipe of the container the fppbr was fed from the fermenter using a positive displacement pump mono cp11 nov australia pty ltd victoria australia 11 l min 1 the fppbr consisted of 8 modules made from 15 mm clear acrylic the modules were 1220 mm 1220 mm 80 mm l h w intermediate modules were jointed by o rings while terminal modules had a single closed end the total length was 9 8 m with a volume of 953 l and operated at a working volume of 900 l the illuminated surface to volume ratio was 21 m2 m 3 to reinforce the acrylic and to avoid hydraulic distortion galvanized steel u frames l w h 50 50 130 mm were placed at regular intervals along the fppbr these were bolted across the top to set parallel geometry a plastic roof with a slope of 45 was placed on top of the steel bars to avoid contamination the roof was later changed due to a storm to a foam sheet cover neither cover provided a gastight seal hence the reactor was open to the atmosphere the reactor walls bottom and roof were covered with an uv vis absorbing foil lee filter nd 1 2 299 to limit light input from non nir wavelengths a schematic representation of the treatment train including the daf unit the fermenter and the pbr as well as two pictures of the plant are shown in fig 1 each module had a ball valve at the base for feed drain and sampling feed was provided via the bottom of the first two modules reactor mixing was achieved with a liquid recycle of 7 5 1 m3 m 3 and a hydro mechanical mixing device was also tested protected intellectual property the ph temperature t and dissolved oxygen concentration do only from phase vi on under aeration were measured continuously using a mettler toledo m200 transmitter coupled to an easysense ph 31 sensor and an easysense o2 21 probe mettler toledo limited port melbourne australia as of phase vii the do was controlled using a plc with an on off controller connected to a compressor 62 3 l min 1 during phase vi the aerator was a perforated pvc tube which was changed to a series of 90 cm air permeable rubber aquarium aerators ase rubber series during phases vii and viii effluent from the fppbr was drained into a second 1 0 m3 ibc which in turn was drained by gravity into the raw wastewater grit trap to harvest biomass the effluent from this ibc was sent to a centrifuge ic45 m interfil australia at feed flows of 6 10 l min 1 2 3 demonstration plant operation the fppbr was filled with raw wastewater to start the system composition shown in hülsen et al 2022 no inoculum was used once purple color developed 3 5 d 90 of the reactor volume was drained and topped up with fresh raw wastewater this was repeated 4 times over 2 weeks to achieve an intense purple color the plant operation was divided into 8 phases which are detailed in table 2 along the 253 days of operation the main changes included a change from raw wastewater to daf effluent after phase i from attached to suspended biomass growth after phase ii from continuous day and night feeding to daytime only feeding after phase iv from strict anaerobic operation to aeration at night after phase v and testing different aeration strategies during the night phases vi viii the change to daytime feeding essentially reduced the hrt by half because the influent was only pumped during daytime during phases vi to viii the daytime hrt ranged between 0 80 and 1 05 d while the total hrt increased to 2 1 and 1 6 d no feeding at night the reactor was not mixed at night except when aerated 2 4 sampling and analysis grab samples of the raw wastewater daf effluent fermenter effluent the fppbr content and occasionally

evaluated by comparing samples from the reactor content taken after manually mixing the reactor content prior to sampling with samples of the reactor effluent in addition to the samples taken to

from asv table py in qiime the asvs were processed according to hülsen et al 2018b 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance 3 1 1 treatment performance the characteristics of the fppbr effluent and the removal efficiencies only based on fppbr input and output during the whole operational period are presented in fig 2 a d the reactor achieved high vfa removal efficiencies in most of the phases 90 showing that ppb were able to photoheterotrophically assimilate the vfas in the wastewater at rates over 0 5 g scod l 1 d 1 mainly vfa cod with peaks up to 1 0 g scod l 1 d 1 table 3 noting a general vfa cod limitation this also indicates that light was not limiting the process was able to remove all the biodegradable scod leaving a baseline of around 500 700 mg cod l 1 which was non degradable see fig s3 for the difference between scod and vfa cod in the fermenter in the given time this residual slowly or hardly biodegradable scod was likely composed of complex proteins keratin residues from feather stream and lipids see section 3 2 2 for a detailed discussion and will be considered as non degradable under the given conditions the availability of degradable cod in the reactor also determined the n and p removals ppb have an uptake ratio of around 100 6 10 1 2 cod n p capson tojo et al 2020 puyol et al 2017 and although the reactor influent had a ratio of 100 6 7 1 5 see table 1 fermenter effluent the non degradable cod in the influent led to a lack of organic matter to support complete nutrient uptake therefore the concentrations of n and p in the reactor effluent exceeded common surface water discharge limits e g tn and tp concentrations of 10 and 1 0 mg l 1 the final effluent quality ultimately depends on the wastewater its cod n p ratios as well as potential pretreatment to adjust the ratios additional cod via dosing not desired economically or combining cod rich streams usually availabe in agri industrial processes would improve the treatment performance removing more of the available n and p e g as n nh4 and p po4 3 for comparison with other treatment processes the scod tn and tp removal efficiencies corresponding to the overall plant performance i e including the daf unit the fermenter and the fppbr were around 70 70 and 50 respectively fig s4 note we are not aware of a single biological step that would be able to treat this wastewater as described here generally conventional anaerobic technologies e g internal ciculation ic or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors uasb remove organics as cod but no nutrients and a phosphate precipation step would be required to recover p while nitrogen would be disspiated as n2 e g via nitricfication denitrification nitritation denitritation or anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox in additional downstream processing aerobic technologies capture less nutrients compared to ppb mediated systems e g high rate a stage where conventional aerobic treatment disspiates up to 97 of the nitrogen as n2 via nitrification and denitrification in any case various treatment concepts in a multitank system would be required to treat this wastewater to the efficiencies given above the removal efficiencies presented in fig 2c d average values for each phase shown in table 3 further confirm the lack of bioavailable scod for further n and p removal the vfa removal efficiencies were 85 100 during most of the reactor operation excluding phases iii and iv average scod removal efficiencies ranged between 33 and 72 with the remaining cod corresponding to the aforementioned non degradable fraction the tkn and tp removal efficiencies were between 34 77 and 28 45 respectively the tkn and tp removal efficiencies shown in fig 2d and table 3 were calculated by comparing the total n and p concentrations in the influent of the fppbr vs the soluble fractions rather than the total in the effluent the reason for this is that suspended ppb mediated systems do not remove total tkn tp or cod instead soluble cod tkn as nh4 n and tp as po4 3 p are assimilated into ppb biomass thus total components will still be measured in the reactor liquid total removal should be close to zero due to biomass yields close to unity nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies were not used because these compounds are both consumed and generated during the treatment process and therefore do not represent the actual n and p removals in the system although this approach might have caused slight overestimations of the removal efficiencies the presented values are useful to compare operational phases and to estimate the potential performance with effective biomass retention recovery using off the shelf technologies despite the variations in the influent characteristics see figs s1 s3 and substantial changes in environmental conditions over the operational phases daily irradiances and temperatures between 3 32 mj m 2 and maximum daily temperatures of 14 42 c figs s5 and s6 the fppbr performances were reasonably consistent over time see confidence intervals in table 3 we also point to significant daily temperatures fluctuations with day and night temperature fluctuations of up to 24 c fig s6 the consistency in removal efficiencies and effluent quality proves the resilience of the proposed system this does not consider daily changes e g day night cycles 3 1 2 resource recovery as biomass the biomass productivities are shown in table 3 and fig 3 in addition to the measured values a reference biomass productivity was also estimated from the scod removed directly attributable to ppb and calculated according to the amounts of scod removed assuming a biomass yield of 1 0 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 and considering that acetate was the predominant vfa with negligible vfa uptake by acetogens hülsen et al 2014 considering the high concentration of solids in the fppbr influent it was difficult to differentiate between the volatile solids from ppb biomass other bacteria and the wastewater itself therefore on the one hand the measured values overestimate the productivities corresponding to ppb biomass and on the other the estimated productivities assume that no solids are degraded and eventually transformed into ppb biomass which underestimates the ppb biomass productivities note fermenter effluent contains 1 0 g vs l 1 table 1 nevertheless both values are useful as the measured productivities correspond to the biomass that would be harvested in large scale installations e g via centrifuge and the estimated values correspond to the minimum achieved productivities which are useful for the comparison between the different operational phases depending on the reactor operation e g hrt the environmental conditions and the wastewater characteristics the measured biomass productivities ranged between 14 and 107 g vs m 2 d 1 the average values for each phase table 3 ranged between 25 and 84 g vs m 2 d 1 these estimated productivities based on scod removal were substantially lower average values of 6 0 24 g vs m 2 d 1 assuming a conversion ratio of 1 6 g cod g vs 1 clearly indicating the impact of the influent solids load the latter values are similar to those previously reported for indoor continuously illuminated ppb lab systems alloul et al 2021 delamare deboutteville et al 2019 hülsen et al 2018b these results are also similar to common microalgal productivities in open and closed pbrs 6 8 3 0 and 9 3 2 0 g ts m 2 d 1 richardson et al 2014 while microalgae pbrs occasionally achieve higher productivities e g 50 60 g m 2 d 1 realising 10 20 g ts m 2 d 1 on an annual basis has been proven very difficult national research council 2012 shen et al 2009 considering that the operational period of the ppb fppbr covered almost the entire year only missing november and december two very warm months in australia with high sunlight irradiance which would not result in a biomass productivity drop but in increased productivities it appears realistic to generate at least 15 g vs m 2 d 1 on solid free or almost free influents on an annual basis this value might be used as a lower limit productivity for the economic evaluation of a large scale plant where 24 g vs m 2 d 1 might be an upper limit for now to evaluate the quality of the generated biomass the reactor effluent was collected in an ibc with a volume of 1 0 m3 and centrifuged under the applied conditions feed flows of 6 10 l min 1 the average biomass recovery was 20 of the total ibc ts content data not shown despite the relatively low vs ts ratios measured in the fppbr 40 90 fig 3 the vs proportion in the harvested biomass was much higher average of 90 table 4 this was achieved by manually separating the clean biomass in the upper layer from the lower layer with heavier inerts in the centrifuge drum also harvested for fertiliser trials a high vs ts ratio 90 is crucial for the application of the biomass as feed and as feed trials were to be carried out using the harvested biomass special care was taken the cp content in the harvested biomass was 58 of the ts cp over total vs 49 protein content a value in agreement with the literature and confirming the applicability of the harvested ppb biomass as potential scp source capson tojo et al 2020 hülsen et al 2018a furthermore both the amino acid contents 466 g kg 1 and the amino acid profile of the biomass see table s2 were acceptable as scp but a potential product would likely require sterilisation the ash content below 10 was within acceptable ranges for this purpose regarding metal contents the al content was notable 2470 mg kg 1 table 4 albeit al containing flocculants were not used in the daf 3 1 3 microbial composition over time the total relative abundance of ppb in the biomass from the fppbr direct sampling not after centrifugation was always over 0 20 during stable operation with values up to 0 56 under optimal working conditions fig 4 the reason for the variations will be further explained in section 3 2 these values are in agreement with data from previous studies using artificially illuminated lab scale reactors hülsen et al 2018a 2018b 2016b and with results from sunlight illuminated pbrs fed with real wastewaters hülsen et al 2022 other than ppb anaerobic fermenters were the most abundant organisms in the fppbr these bacteria were mostly grown in the fermenter see fig s7 for microbial communities and without solid liquid separation directly fed into the pbr in addition fermenters particularly acetogens will also grow in the fppbr aerobic heterotrophs were also present in the reactor when oxygen was provided mostly when active aeration was installed phases vi viii finally fermenters and methanogens also grew in the fppbr during periods when solids accumulation occurred a phenomenon that was caused by improper reactor mixing mostly during the initial operational periods phases i iii see fig s8 for the microbial compositions of samples from the bottom of the fppbr this issue resulted in long srts of the bottom fraction in the reactor which allowed the effective growth of methanogenic archaea batstone et al 2002 the mixing problems can also be observed when looking at the tcod removal efficiencies in the fppbr fig s9 the tcod data together with the results from overall mass balances table s3 show that after phase iii the mixing system worked properly tcod removal stabilised around zero with balances of cod n and p close to 100 balances closed at 80 107 92 118 94 103 respectively 3 2 performance during the different operational phases 3 2 1 continuous reactor feeding reactor influent and importance of mixing the first phase served as start up period and for the development of a stable microbial community the duration of phase i of 32 d ensured that a pseudo steady state was reached the hrt in the fppbr was 4 4 5 7 d the stable performance of the reactor with removal efficiencies of vfa tkn and tp of practically 100 70 80 and 35 52 confirmed the proper functioning of the reactor fig 2 the development of a stable ppb community was further confirmed by the colour of the reactor see fig 1 established after only 1 week although the performance of the reactor was satisfactory the high solids content in the raw wastewater around 3 0 g ts l 1 see table s1 led to solids accumulation in both the fermenter and the bottom of the fppbr 4 7 g ts l 1 table s1 which led to inconsistent mass balances and a considerable apparent removal of tcod see table s3 and fig s9 during phase ii the fermenter was fed with pretreated wastewater after partial solid removal in an existing daf unit part of the wastewater treatment process at the factory to solve this issue this together with modifications of the mixing system improved the performance and solved the issue of solid accumulation in the fermenter and reactor particularly after phase iii see table s3 and fig s9 for the corresponding tcod removal efficiencies and mass balances in phase ii the growth strategy was also changed from suspended to attached growth by simply letting the biofilm grow on the reactor walls and wiping the walls every 3 4 days this was practically challenging and made the estimation of biomass productivities difficult from phase iii on this approach was no longer used and the suspended growth approach was re applied mechanically wiping the walls few times a day the slightly lower removal efficiencies and higher productivities in phase ii compared to phase i cannot directly be attributed to biofilm formation as the hrt was also reduced to 2 d from 4 4 5 7 d in phase i in fact the performances of phases ii and iii with equal operational conditions but different growth strategy i e attached vs suspended were very similar in average removal efficiencies in phase ii of 91 for vfa 46 for tkn and 30 for tp and measured biomass productivities of 38 g vs m 2 d 1 table 3 this suggests that attached growth does not jeopardise the removal efficiencies nor the biomass productivities this should be further investigated as attached and suspended growth operation provide different advantages in phase iii stable continuous operation was achieved at an hrt of 2 d initially efficient removal of vfas was achieved up to 100 with biomass productivities up to 60 g vs m 2 d 1 estimated values of up to 25 g vs m 2 d 1 nevertheless as aforementioned malfunctioning of the mixing system still resulted in solid accumulation during this phase which eventually worsened the system performance after the first half of phase iii see fig 2 vfa cod removal efficiencies dropped to 70 days 83 117 and the vfa concentration in the effluent increased up to 292 mg l 1 this clearly showed the relevance of a properly functioning mixing system to enable a homogeneous reactor content mainly to control the srt here srt should equal hrt and to minimise the growth of potential microbial competitors e g methanogens further modifications of the mixing system solved this problem with much better mixing performances from phase iv onwards table s3 and fig s9 with proper mixing and stable operation in place a similar operational strategy was maintained during phase iv but the hrt was further decreased to 1 d aiming to enhance the removal rates and biomass productivities it must be considered that in continuously fed outdoors ppb reactors the effective illuminated hrt is actually halved as natural daily cycles limit light supply to daytime periods the applied 1 d hrt during phase iv with an effective illuminated hrt of 0 5 d resulted in a decrease of the reactor performance with average vfa removal efficiencies going down to 67 and with a concomitant reduction of the removal efficiencies of n and p as vfa availability was the factor limiting nutrient removal therefore it was concluded that while an hrt of 2 d 1 d of illuminated hrt was effective early phase iii further hrt reduction to 1 d 0 5 illuminated resulted in a performance decrease due to biomass washout ppb growth rates of around 2 4 d 1 at 20 25 c have been reported for enriched cultures puyol et al 2017 therefore the overall hrt was again increased in the coming phases 2 4 d in phase v the possibility of biomass retention e g using membranes or cloth filtration as a cheaper alternative could solve this problem as biomass retention can reduce the applicable hrts by increasing the biomass concentration however this will also create additional problems of shading and ir attenuation and requires further research outdoors and at scale 3 2 2 continuous vs discontinuous anaerobic illuminated operation despite the generally satisfactory performance during the continuously fed phases i e phases i iv complete vfa removal achieved in phases i iii daily cycle studies revealed the main issue of this approach the lack of light during night time naturally resulted in a pause of phototrophic activity which lead to the discharge of basically untreated wastewater especially at low hrts the results from daily cycle studies performed during phases ii and iii illustrate this issue fig 5 the lack of light resulted in increasing scod and vfa concentrations during the night fermentation which in turn lead to a ph drop the same behavior was observed in all the cycles studies carried out during these periods see fig s10 to solve this problem the feeding strategy in phase v was changed from continuous feeding to semi continuous feeding only during daytime hours the overall hrt during this phase was 2 4 d hrt meaning that the effective illuminated hrt was 1 2 d the reactor was only fed during daytime this strategy resulted in a less pronounced vfa accumulation and ph drop during the night see phase vi daily cycle study in fig 6 in addition this modification clearly enhanced the performance of the fppbr with vfa removal efficiencies over 95 tkn removal efficiencies 58 and tp 30 again depending of the fermenter performance and the cod n p ratio of the substrate fig 2 and much higher biomass productivities than those achieved previously average values of 84 g vs m 2 d 1 measured and 24 g vs m 2 d 1 estimated vs values of 41 and 12 g vs m 2 d 1 in phase iii with the same overall hrt the highest productivities in this study were achieved during this period with maximum values of 107 and 42 g vs m 2 d 1 measured and estimated respectively in addition feeding only during the day resulted in doubled ppb relative abundances compared to previous phases from 0 23 0 26 in phases ii iv to 0 54 in phase v fig 4 these results clearly show that operation of the fppbr at an illuminated hrt of 1 2 d is feasible several reasons can explain the improved performances when feeding only during daytime first of all this avoided the discharge of untreated effluent while maintaining similar overall hrts to those working under continuous feeding i e 2 d in phase iii this also minimised the accumulation of vs during the night and favoured fermentation of residual organic matter which are available for ppb at the first sunbeams secondly as rapidly degradable cod such as vfa was only available during daytime period when ppb were dominant due to sunlight ppb had a competitive advantage over non phototrophic organisms such as methanogens if solids accumulation occurs aerobes that might grow if residual oxygen is present or acetogenic anaerobes indeed the increase in ppb relative abundance in phase v was at the expense of aerobic heterotrophs anaerobic fermenters and methanogens fig 4 thirdly seasonal factors might play a role noting that phase v occurred during april and may australian autumn corresponding to some of the lowest recorded irradiances and temperatures outside and in the reactor see figs s5 and s6 suggesting that these aspects were not limiting the fppbr performance we further note that even at low vfa cod concentrations in the effluent the scod content was on average 726 mg cod l 1 during phases i v with 574 mg cod l 1 corresponding to non vfa scod reason why there is a scod baseline in fig 5 the nature of this non biodegradable scod was not elucidated but we suspect non degradable residues from for example the feather stream and exclude products from ppb degradation this is underlined by a similar non degradable scod fraction in the fermenter effluent during phase v average non vfa scod of 488 mg l 1 from a total scod of 1260 mg cod l 1 see baseline in fig s3 as well as non degraded filtered tkn 3 2 3 combined anaerobic illuminated aerobic dark operation to enhance the wastewater treatment performance during night hours we aimed to exploit the metabolic versatility of ppb by supplying oxygen during night time it has been demonstrated that the oxidative conditions resulting from the presence of oxygen result in the suppression of photoheterotrophic growth and in the out competition of ppb if oxygen supply is continuous capson tojo et al 2021 nevertheless the aerobic capabilities of ppb give them some resilience which opens the door for a mixed metabolic mode 3mppb operation exploiting ppbs photoheterotrophic metabolism under anaerobic illuminated conditions during the day phani and chemoheterotrophy of the same ppb under aerobic dark conditions at night chaerd the 3mppb approach was tested in phases vi viii aiming to extend ppb treatment from the day to the night by continuing to remove cod and thus avoiding vfa accumulation during night time during phase vi a initial pulsed aeration through a perforated pipe from day 130 to day 160 9 16 min on off at 62 3 l min 1 did not result in continuously measurable do fig s6 after day 160 phase vi b the aeration was supplied continuously resulting in a substantial increase in the do concentrations up to saturation levels in some days fig s6 this means that phase vi a was mostly anaerobic until day 160 with some do spikes at night the corresponding cycle study was performed before day 160 and the trends corresponding to phase vi a fig 6 therefore represent an anaerobic system the scod and vfa in phase vi increased slightly in the dark with a concomitant ph drop even without feeding at night resembling albeit to a lower extent the trends of fig 5 phases ii iii these trends were related to the hydrolysis and fermentation of complex organics already present in the reactor in fact the performances microbial communities and measured biomass productivities were very similar between phase v and phase vi a figs 2 4 the estimated productivities were different due to failures in the fermenter during the beginning of phase vi from phase vii do was controlled using a dedicated plc and flexible air diffusers to increase the oxygen transfer efficiency this resulted in effective aeration during night time and in a reduction of the scod concentrations during the night enhancing the quality of the discharged effluent night aeration not only avoided scod accumulation but also reduced the scod baseline from around 700 mg cod l 1 down to 320 410 mg cod l 1 this suggests that the biodegradable extent of the influent cod was enhanced under aerobic conditions indeed the highest scod tkn and tp removal efficiencies using fermented daf effluent were reported during phase vii 67 53 and 45 respectively this confirms the positive effect of oxygen supply on the system performance at least in terms of pollutant removal and discharge savings this operation also circumvented the ph drop observed during strictly anaerobic operation fig s6c the same behavior was observed in a cycle study from phase vii fig s11 the enhanced performance observed in phases vii viii was not observed in phase vi as aforementioned the operation during the first half of phase vi a until day 160 was practically anaerobic as the air supply did not result in increased do concentrations in the reactor nor scod removal at night after this phase the increasing do concentrations resulted in a sudden reduction in the ppb relative abundances from 0 45 on day 161 to 0 08 in day 175 fig 4 this was accompanied by a decrease in the measured biomass productivities from 55 g vs m 2 d 1 on day 165 down to 34 g vs m 2 d 1 in days 170 172 most likely related to the lower biomass yields of other bacteria compared to ppb growing photoheterotrophically the decrease in ppb proportions can be observed in phases vi viii fig 4 at the beginning of phase vi the relative abundance of ppb was above 50 with rhodopseudomonas sp accounting for over 70 of the total ppb in all the samples days 125 136 150 and 161 after implementing continuous aeration in day 160 the ppb community collapsed to relative abundances below 10 clearly caused by the condition change day 175 unfortunately there was an accidental naoh addition between days 183 and 189 into the wastewater which led to a sharp increase in the reactor ph average daily value of 10 5 and reactor failure because of this the reactor was restarted on day 192 using 100 l of an enriched ppb culture from a backup reactor as starting inoculum the ppb community dynamics remain unclear as rhodobacter sp dominated after the restart with over 67 of the total ppb in phase vii fig 4 days 208 218 a redistribution of ppb representatives in phase viii makes us believe that rhodopseudomonas sp might have re emerged given more time at this stage we cannot state that the shift from a rhodopseudomonas dominated system anaerobically to a rhodobacter dominated reactor community was caused by aeration similar redistributions were observed in other publications especially after shocks such as aeration hülsen et al 2019 and parameter change e g srt alloul et al 2019 hülsen et al 2020 while we cannot make claims around the events in phase vi based on the following phases vii and viii it becomes evident that ppb can be maintained in a 3mppb concept these phases were characterised by enhanced wastewater treatment capabilities under night aeration operation with lower overall ppb abundance compared to purely anaerobic operation down to 0 2 0 3 in phases vii viii vs over 0 5 in phase v or the beginning of phase vi fig 4 this is a consequence of aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth of ppb and non phototrophic aerobes during night time biomass yields around 0 5 g cod g cod 1 with the latter representing up to 28 of the microbial population in phase vii fig 4 reducing the hrt in phase viii to 1 6 d helped to minimise the presence of aerobic heterotrophs but did not result in increased ppb proportions as ppb were also washed out the system would benefit from biomass retention to separate the hrt from the srt so hrt srt control is not the way to control common aerobes oxygen control appears as the way forward but the success depends on the substrate affinities of ppb vs common aerobes more research is required to optimise the system during night time which also requires an understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms finally during night time aeration the hrt was reduced from 2 1 d in phase vii to 1 6 d in phase viii illuminated hrt of 0 8 d the reactor performed properly but lower vfa removal efficiencies were obtained 67 100 furthermore the reduction of the hrt did lower the removal efficiencies the ppb proportions and did not increase the biomass productivities see table 3 and fig 4 therefore if biomass retention is not provided we recommend a minimum overall hrt of 2 2 4 d illuminated hrt of 1 1 2 d 3 3 implications for industrial application this work describes a modular scalable fppbr for ppb mediated wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the form of ppb biomass the reactor was functional removing almost all the vfa in the influent at rates around 0 5 g scod l 1 d 1 with peaks up to 1 0 g scod l 1 d 1 this was achieved without biomass retention in a flowthrough system at total hrts equal to srt of 1 6 2 4 d or illuminated hrts of 0 8 1 2 d the olr can theoretically be higher but the effects on the ph have to be considered particularly if feeding fermented wastewater i e reduced ph due to high vfa concentrations will inhibit ppb in subtropical regions at a light path of 40 mm 80 mm reactor width the pbr effluent had ts concentrations of around 1 5 2 0 g l 1 with up to 50 of native solids from the wastewater this resulted in estimated conservative estimates not measured values biomass productivities between 6 0 and 24 g vs m 2 d 1 where 24 g vs m 2 d 1 were achieved during stable operation in the australian autumn at a low light intensity and low temperature period in consideration of the underestimation of this productivity as explained above we take this value as a conservative estimate of realisable biomass production throughout the year corresponding to 504 g vs m 3 d 1 for poultry processing wastewater the corresponding cod vfa cod tn and tp removal efficiencies were around 67 12 87 7 5 53 0 and 45 6 0 respectively e g phase vii for mixed anaerobic day and aerobic night operation in a 3mppb system additional aeration costs will occur e g to realise 0 1 mg do l 1 during the night the latter depends on the standard oxygen transfer efficiency of the aerators and the height of the water column here around 900 mm a detailed economic analysis including the capital costs of a scaled plant must be done in a follow up study this study has shown that the reactor operation is robust and that it can handle temperature and irradiance fluctuations throughout the year this includes day and night temperature fluctuations of up to 24 c with peak lows of 6 0 c and peak highs over 45 c confirming results from lab studies hülsen et al 2016a and a recent outdoor study hülsen et al 2022 the system was operated without a plc and did not require detailed controls expect for the latter phases where do concentration was controlled however for prefermented wastewater as feed ph control is desirable and for aeration at night a do sensor would optimise the oxygen supply without the aerobic step at night the ppb plant performance is limited to a semi continuous feed regime during daytime hours the 3mppb concept might enable continuous day and night operation at higher olr and higher volumetric conversions but the microbial competition has to be determined the overall resource recovery would likely be reduced due to lower biomass yields under predominant chemoheterotrophic growth tchobanoglous et al 2003 the latter would depend on the volumetric conversion at night relative to the conversion during the day more research is required to assess this option and its effects on the microbial community however we showed that effluent polishing is feasible nevertheless this approach requires an aeration system and strict microbial community control the cost benefit comparison has to be made to evaluate this concept one major option to enhance the reactor performance in strict anaerobic or in mixed metabolic mode is to provide biomass retention via membranes or cloth filtration which has the potential to increase the ppb biomass in the reactor and increase the volumetric and areal removal efficiencies and productivities while shortening the hrts this has to be combined with continuous harvesting of biomass from the reactor to maintain a srt of 2 4 d hülsen et al 2018b 2016b this will also impact the light supply via increased shading and light attenuation of the infrared light which requires detailed analysis the options of attached biofilm or even the use of ppb granules stegman et al 2021 are perceivable but require more research from this work we can further outline some major differences of fppbrs for algal and ppb biomass production for strictly anaerobic operation photoheterotrophy a ppb fppbr does not require a distribution system for co2 supply and o2 stripping no product inhibition a ppb fppbr does likely not require cooling or heating subject to local conditions and the impact of aerobic grazers can be neglected another argument is the doubling of the light path relative to a pond due to two sided light supply which should enable less shading higher biomass concentrations higher volumetric removal and productivities biomass productivity is further independent from co2 supply as cod in a secondary treatment step is the main driver for n and p removal in combination with lower light requirements of ppb this might result in higher annual productivities especially on vfa rich wastewaters e g after prefermentation theoretically ppb can be used to treat any wastewater with sufficient bioavailable cod as shown in several publications capson tojo et al 2020 as presented here this includes wastewater with fats proteins or other inert solids which however might affect the biomass quality and its use as valuable product e g scp as feed the here achieved results can be extrapolated to other wastewaters especially easy degradable wastewater e g from food processing which would likely result in improved performances finally the ppb biomass was tested as fish and prawn feed where up to 66 and 100 of fishmeal in commercial feed have been successfully substituted with ppb biomass delamare deboutteville et al 2019 prawn feed data are not published at the moment fertiliser trials were also performed on various crops data not shown the product testing further enables addition of a potential price tag on the biomass which can be used for economic feasibility studies which will be key to evaluate the viability of this technology 4 conclusion the ppb demonstration plant provided consistent performance i e removal efficiencies of vfas tkn and tp of 90 34 77 and 28 45 and estimated conservative biomass productivities of 6 24 g vs m 2 d 1 under varying wastewater characteristics and environmental conditions the removal of n and p was limited by the availability of biodegradable cod a property of the feed wastewater the harvested biomass had a vs ts ratio over 90 a cp content of 58 and a compatible amino acid profile on average the fppbr showed average biomass productivities of 15 g vs m 2 d 1 and scod removal rates 500 mg l 1 d 1 working at an hrt of 2 4 d and with semicontinuous day only feeding under these conditions the relative abundance of ppb was 0 56 during continuous day night feeding vfa peaked during the night particularly at low retention times a minimum overall hrt of 1 6 2 4 d is recommended to avoid ppb washout finally a combined daily illuminated anaerobic night aerobic operation supplying air during night time called the 3mppb concept improved the removal performances avoiding vfa accumulation and a concomitant ph drop during the night nevertheless this approach resulted in lower ppb abundances and biomass productivities and would add extra infrastructure and operational costs declaration of

16098,to make purple phototrophic bacteria ppb based technologies a reality for resource recovery research must be demonstrated outdoors using scaled reactors in this study a 10 m long ppb enriched flat plate photobioreactor fppbr with a volume of 0 95 m3 was operated for 253 days fed with poultry processing wastewater different operational strategies were tested including varying influent types retention times feeding strategies and anaerobic aerobic conditions in a novel mixed metabolic mode concept the overall results show that regardless of the fermented wastewater fed raw or after solid removal via dissolved air flotation and the varying environmental conditions e g light exposure and temperatures the fppbr provided effective volatile fatty acids vfas n and p removals average efficiencies of 90 34 77 and 28 45 respectively the removal of n and p was limited by the availability of biodegradable cod biomass c n and p could be harvested at 90 vs ts ratio 58 crude protein content and a suitable amino acid profile for potential feed applications during fully anaerobic operation with semicontinuous day only feeding the fppbr showed biomass productivities between 25 and 84 g vs m 2 d 1 high due to solid influx the productivities estimated from cod removal rates were 6 0 24 g vs m 2 d 1 conservative values and soluble cod removal rates of up to 1 0 g l 1 d 1 overall average of 0 34 0 16 g l 1 d 1 under these conditions the relative abundance of ppb in the harvested biomass was up to 56 a minimum overall hrt of 2 2 4 d 1 0 1 2 d when only fed during the day is recommended to avoid ppb washout assuming no biomass retention a combined daily illuminated anaerobic night aerobic operation supplying air during night time exploiting photoheterotrophy during the day and aerobic chemoheterotrophy of the same bacteria at night improved the overall removal performance avoiding vfa accumulation during the night however while enabling enhanced treatment this

introduction purple phototrophic bacteria ppb have reappeared recently as a potential mediator for resource recovery from wastewater transforming its constituents into single cell proteins scp and several other products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha hydrogen carotenoids or fertilizers capson tojo et al 2020 recent literature has exploited their anaerobic photoheterotrophic metabolism which enables simultaneous removal and recovery of organics nitrogen and phosphorus at biomass yields close to 1 0 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 cod being chemical oxygen demand capson tojo et al 2020 high biomass yields during photoheterotrophic growth are enabled by the utilisation of light as energy source i e photophosphorylation and to a lesser extent phosphorylation ppb use mostly near infrared nir light to drive photoheterotrophic metabolism under anaerobic conditions a capability almost exclusive to ppb saer and blankenship 2017 nir light is harvested via bacteriochlorophylls bchls a and b with maximum absorption peaks between 780 and 1040 nm saer and blankenship 2017 ppb dominance in photoheterotrophic cultures artificially illuminated with nir light for resource recovery has been proven at lab scale in various reactors for a range of municipal and industrial wastewaters hülsen et al 2018a 2018b lópez serna et al 2019 the incident illumination intensities in these experiments varied between 2 0 and 270 w m 2 chitapornpan et al 2013 dalaei et al 2020 with even the lowest intensities being prohibitively expensive when considering a ppb process at scale capson tojo et al 2020 the most logical solution for this challenge is outdoors operation reducing the capital for lamps and frames and operational costs of illumination to zero due to natural light non nir wavelengths i e visible or ultraviolet uv vis can be eliminated with a low cost filter to date there are only a handful of articles reporting outdoors ppb reactor operation and most of them did not focus on wastewater treatment or nutrient recovery but on the generation of hydrogen and pha from artificial media adessi et al 2012 carlozzi et al 2006 carlozzi and sacchi 2001 while these studies exposed the ppb reactors to changing environmental conditions they are not relevant to wastewater treatment applications as artificial media and pure cultures were used in particular in wastewater applications influent contamination results in competition with non phototrophic heterotrophic microbes changing irradiances and temperatures including day and night fluctuations create very dynamic conditions that are expected to affect the wastewater treatment performance via kinetic microbial and metabolic changes as well as chemical and physiological changes due to varying wastewater characteristics so far only one study has assessed these factors in ppb outdoors reactors confirming the feasibility of this approach and the resilience of ppb to changing environmental conditions hülsen et al 2022 for ppb technology to emerge as a realistic resource recovery alternative outdoors implementation at scale and using real wastewater needs to be tested a general sense of design parameters including hydraulic retention time hrt sludge retention time srt organic loading rate olr as well as influent loads removal rates removal efficiencies and biomass productivities are also required this is crucial to advance the current infancy of ppb technology to the next level but also to avoid extrapolating unrealistically high performances from small lab scale reactors to scaled outdoor photobioreactors pbrs as previously experienced with microalgae richardson et al 2014 sensationalised productivities from the lab in algae systems e g 60 g m 2 d 1 or 220 tonnes ha 1 d 1 national research council 2012 attracted major interest and investment that could not be translated into the field at least not as annual daily average performance this is because photosynthetic efficiencies were lower and culture instabilities and grazers impacted productivities among several other issues day et al 2017 taiganides 1992 these problems apply mainly to open ponds which have lower cost compared with closed pbrs benemann et al 2018 closed pbrs for microalgae production were deemed too expensive capital and operational for wastewater treatment as production costs generally exceed the relatively low value of the product acién et al 2017 the main challenge in ppb reactor research is to identify an economic reactor design which allows reasonable translation of laboratory research and hence avoids the issues which have hindered uptake of algae systems this requires testing of pbrs in field relevant conditions early in the technology cycle preferably using natural light the metabolic diversity of ppb and mixed culture communities in addition offers the opportunity to operate photoheterotrophically at anaerobic illuminated conditions during the day phani and chemoheterotrophically under aerobic dark conditions during the night chaerd to the best of our knowledge this mixed metabolic mode 3m concept with ppb named 3mppb has not been tested to date both metabolic modes phani and chaerd have been studied separately with ppb rapidly outcompeted by non phototrophic aerobes under prolonged continuous aeration capson tojo et al 2021 however regular metabolic mode changes in day night coupled to anaerobic aerobic interval changes have not been studied and might offer the potential to polish or even treat wastewater at night at the expense of lower nutrient recovery efficiencies and biomass productivities due to oxidative losses this study aims to evaluate the performance of a 10 m long 950 l outdoor ppb flat plate photobioreactor fppbr for resource recovery from poultry processing wastewater for this purpose a scalable modular fppbr was operated for 253 days exposed to naturally varying environmental conditions various design and operational aspects were tested e g hrt olr feeding regimes etc to optimise the treatment performance and biomass productivities large quantities of ppb biomass were harvested to enable the value evaluation of the scp product finally the possibility of aerating at night in a mixed metabolic mode system 3mppb was assessed 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater origin pretreatments and characteristics poultry processing wastewater from a poultry processing facility in brisbane australia was used as feed the system was installed on site pumping the wastewater directly from its source grit trap outlet the raw wastewater was a mixture of water streams resulting from feather removal bird degutting and general cleaning due to the high solid contents in the raw wastewater solids accumulated at the bottom and the top of the pilot feed tank a 1000 l intermediate bulk container ibc which resulted in substantial variations in wastewater characteristics because of this issue after phase i the feed was subsequently taken from the outlet of the primary dissolved air flotation daf unit no polymers or flocculants were used the daf effluent was fermented in the feed tank to improve the bioavailability of organic matter and nutrients for the ppb table 1 presents the characteristics of the streams and shows a considerable increase of volatile fatty acids vfas nh3 n and po4 3 p after fermentation the data also show substantial fluctuations of all measured components a more extensive characterisation of the raw wastewater the daf effluent and the fermenter effluent as well as the variations of their compositions over time can be found in the supplementary material table s1 and figs s1 s3 2 2 flat plate photobioreactor fppbr set up depending on the operational phase either raw wastewater or daf effluent was used as feed to the fppbr as noted above the feed was fermented in an ibc with a volume of 1 m3 the fermenter was operated continuously at an hrt of 1 d and mixed intermittently 15 min every 2 h via internal liquid recycle provided by a positive displacement pump mono cp25 nov australia pty ltd victoria australia 25 l min 1 the same pump model was used to transfer raw wastewater to the ibc the high level in the fermenter was maintained via an overflow at the top and the bottom via a standpipe of the container the fppbr was fed from the fermenter using a positive displacement pump mono cp11 nov australia pty ltd victoria australia 11 l min 1 the fppbr consisted of 8 modules made from 15 mm clear acrylic the modules were 1220 mm 1220 mm 80 mm l h w intermediate modules were jointed by o rings while terminal modules had a single closed end the total length was 9 8 m with a volume of 953 l and operated at a working volume of 900 l the illuminated surface to volume ratio was 21 m2 m 3 to reinforce the acrylic and to avoid hydraulic distortion galvanized steel u frames l w h 50 50 130 mm were placed at regular intervals along the fppbr these were bolted across the top to set parallel geometry a plastic roof with a slope of 45 was placed on top of the steel bars to avoid contamination the roof was later changed due to a storm to a foam sheet cover neither cover provided a gastight seal hence the reactor was open to the atmosphere the reactor walls bottom and roof were covered with an uv vis absorbing foil lee filter nd 1 2 299 to limit light input from non nir wavelengths a schematic representation of the treatment train including the daf unit the fermenter and the pbr as well as two pictures of the plant are shown in fig 1 each module had a ball valve at the base for feed drain and sampling feed was provided via the bottom of the first two modules reactor mixing was achieved with a liquid recycle of 7 5 1 m3 m 3 and a hydro mechanical mixing device was also tested protected intellectual property the ph temperature t and dissolved oxygen concentration do only from phase vi on under aeration were measured

controlled using a plc with an on off controller connected to a compressor 62 3 l min 1 during phase vi the aerator was a perforated pvc tube which was changed to a series of 90 cm air permeable rubber aquarium aerators ase rubber series during phases vii and viii effluent from the fppbr was drained into a second 1 0 m3 ibc which in turn was drained by gravity into the raw wastewater grit trap to harvest biomass the effluent from this ibc was sent to a centrifuge ic45 m interfil australia at feed flows of 6 10 l min 1 2 3 demonstration plant operation the fppbr was filled with raw wastewater to start the system composition shown in hülsen et al 2022 no inoculum was used once purple color developed 3 5 d 90 of the reactor volume was drained and topped up with fresh raw wastewater this was repeated 4 times over 2 weeks to achieve an intense purple color the plant operation was divided into 8 phases which are detailed in table 2 along the 253 days of operation the main changes included a change from raw wastewater to daf effluent after phase i from attached to suspended biomass growth after phase ii from continuous day and night feeding to daytime only feeding after phase iv from strict anaerobic operation to aeration at night after phase v and testing different aeration strategies during the night phases vi viii the change to daytime feeding essentially reduced the hrt by half because the influent was only pumped during daytime during phases vi to viii the daytime hrt ranged between 0 80 and 1 05 d while the total hrt increased to 2 1 and 1 6 d no feeding at night the reactor was not mixed at night except when aerated 2 4 sampling and analysis grab samples of the raw wastewater daf effluent fermenter effluent the fppbr content and occasionally

from asv table py in qiime the asvs were processed according to hülsen et al 2018b 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance 3 1 1 treatment performance the characteristics of the fppbr effluent and the removal efficiencies only based on fppbr input and output during the whole operational period are presented in fig 2 a d the reactor achieved high vfa removal efficiencies in most of the phases 90 showing that ppb were able to photoheterotrophically assimilate the vfas in the wastewater at rates over 0 5 g scod l 1 d 1 mainly vfa cod with peaks up to 1 0 g scod l 1 d 1 table 3 noting a general vfa cod limitation this also indicates that light was not limiting the process was able to remove all the biodegradable scod leaving a baseline of around 500 700 mg cod l 1 which was non degradable see fig s3 for the difference between scod and vfa cod in the fermenter in the given time this residual slowly or hardly biodegradable scod was likely composed of complex proteins keratin residues from feather stream and lipids see section 3 2 2 for a detailed discussion and will be considered as non degradable under the given conditions the availability of degradable cod in the reactor also determined the n and p removals ppb have an uptake ratio of around 100 6 10 1 2 cod n p capson tojo et al 2020 puyol et al 2017 and although the reactor influent had a ratio of 100 6 7 1 5 see table 1 fermenter effluent the non degradable cod in the influent led to a lack of organic matter to support complete nutrient uptake therefore the concentrations of n and p in the reactor effluent exceeded common surface water discharge limits e g tn and tp concentrations of 10 and 1 0 mg l 1 the final effluent quality ultimately depends on the wastewater its cod n p ratios as well as potential pretreatment to adjust the ratios additional cod via dosing not desired economically or combining cod rich streams usually availabe in agri industrial processes would improve the treatment performance removing more of the available n and p e g as n nh4 and p po4 3 for comparison with other treatment processes the scod tn and tp removal efficiencies corresponding to the overall plant performance i e including the daf unit the fermenter and the fppbr were around 70 70 and 50 respectively fig s4 note we are not aware of a single biological step that would be able to treat this wastewater as described here generally conventional anaerobic technologies e g internal ciculation ic or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors uasb remove organics as cod but no nutrients and a phosphate precipation step would be required to recover p while nitrogen would be disspiated as n2 e g via nitricfication denitrification nitritation denitritation or anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox in additional downstream processing aerobic technologies capture less nutrients compared to ppb mediated systems e g high rate a stage where conventional aerobic treatment disspiates up to 97 of the nitrogen as n2 via nitrification and denitrification in any case various treatment concepts in a multitank system would be required to treat this wastewater to the efficiencies given above the removal efficiencies presented in fig 2c d average values for each phase shown in table 3 further confirm the lack of bioavailable scod for further n and p removal the vfa removal efficiencies were 85 100 during most of the reactor operation excluding phases iii and iv average scod removal efficiencies ranged between 33 and 72 with the remaining cod corresponding to the aforementioned non degradable fraction the tkn and tp removal efficiencies were between 34 77 and 28 45 respectively the tkn and tp removal efficiencies shown in fig 2d and table 3 were calculated by comparing the total n and p concentrations in the influent of the fppbr vs the soluble fractions rather than the total in the effluent the reason for this is that suspended ppb mediated systems do not remove total tkn tp or cod instead soluble cod tkn as nh4 n and tp as po4 3 p are assimilated into ppb biomass thus total components will still be measured in the reactor liquid total removal should be close to zero due to biomass yields close to unity nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies were not used because these compounds are both consumed and generated during the treatment process and therefore do not represent the actual n and p removals in the system although this approach might have caused slight overestimations of the removal efficiencies the presented values are useful to compare operational phases and to estimate the potential performance with effective biomass retention recovery using off the shelf technologies despite the variations in the influent characteristics see figs s1 s3 and substantial changes in environmental conditions over the operational phases daily irradiances and temperatures between 3 32 mj m 2 and maximum daily temperatures of 14 42 c figs s5 and s6 the fppbr performances were reasonably consistent over time see confidence intervals in table 3 we also point to significant daily temperatures fluctuations with day and night temperature fluctuations of up to 24 c fig s6 the consistency in removal efficiencies and effluent quality proves the resilience of the proposed system this does not consider daily changes e g day night cycles 3 1 2 resource recovery as biomass the biomass productivities are shown in table 3 and fig 3 in addition to the measured values a reference biomass productivity was also estimated from the scod removed directly attributable to ppb and calculated according to the amounts of scod removed assuming a biomass yield of 1 0 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 and considering that acetate was the predominant vfa with negligible vfa uptake by acetogens hülsen et al 2014 considering the high concentration of solids in the fppbr influent it was difficult to differentiate between the volatile solids from ppb biomass other bacteria and the wastewater itself therefore on the one hand the measured values overestimate the productivities corresponding to ppb biomass and on the other the estimated productivities assume that no solids are degraded and eventually transformed into ppb biomass which underestimates the ppb biomass productivities note fermenter effluent contains 1 0 g vs l 1 table 1 nevertheless both values are useful as the measured productivities correspond to the biomass that would be harvested in large scale installations e g via centrifuge and the estimated values correspond to the minimum achieved productivities which are useful for the comparison between the different operational phases depending on the reactor operation e g hrt the environmental conditions and the wastewater characteristics the measured biomass productivities ranged between 14 and 107 g vs m 2 d 1 the average values for each phase table 3 ranged between 25 and 84 g vs m 2 d 1 these estimated productivities based on scod removal were substantially lower average values of 6 0 24 g vs m 2 d 1 assuming a conversion ratio of 1 6 g cod g vs 1 clearly indicating the impact of the influent solids load the latter values are similar to those previously reported for indoor continuously illuminated ppb lab systems alloul et al 2021 delamare deboutteville et al 2019 hülsen et al 2018b these results are also similar to common microalgal productivities in open and closed pbrs 6 8 3 0 and 9 3 2 0 g ts m 2 d 1 richardson et al 2014 while microalgae pbrs occasionally achieve higher productivities e g 50 60 g m 2 d 1 realising 10 20 g ts m 2 d 1 on an annual basis has been proven very difficult national research council 2012 shen et al 2009 considering that the operational period of the ppb fppbr covered almost the entire year only missing november and december two very warm months in australia with high sunlight irradiance which would not result in a biomass productivity drop but in increased productivities it appears realistic to generate at least 15 g vs m 2 d 1 on solid free or almost free influents on an annual basis this value might be used as a lower limit productivity for the economic evaluation of a large scale plant where 24 g vs m 2 d 1 might be an upper limit for now to evaluate the quality of the generated biomass the reactor effluent was collected in an ibc with a volume of 1 0 m3 and centrifuged under the applied conditions feed flows of 6 10 l min 1 the average biomass recovery was 20 of the total ibc ts content data not shown despite the relatively low vs ts ratios measured in the fppbr 40 90 fig 3 the vs proportion in the harvested biomass was much higher average of 90 table 4 this was achieved by manually separating the clean biomass in the upper layer from the lower layer with heavier inerts in the centrifuge drum also harvested for fertiliser trials a high vs ts ratio 90 is crucial for the application of the biomass as feed and as feed trials were to be carried out using the harvested biomass special care was taken the cp content in the harvested biomass was 58 of the ts cp over total vs 49 protein content a value in agreement with the literature and confirming the applicability of the harvested ppb biomass as potential scp source capson tojo et al 2020 hülsen et al 2018a furthermore both the amino acid contents 466 g kg 1 and the amino acid profile of the biomass see table s2 were acceptable as scp but a potential product would likely require sterilisation the ash content below 10 was within acceptable ranges for this purpose regarding metal contents the al content was notable 2470 mg kg 1 table 4 albeit al containing flocculants were not used in the daf 3 1 3 microbial composition over time the total relative abundance of ppb in the biomass from the fppbr direct sampling not after centrifugation was always over 0 20 during stable operation with values up to 0 56 under optimal working conditions fig 4 the reason for the variations will be further explained in section 3 2 these values are in agreement with data from previous studies using artificially illuminated lab scale reactors hülsen et al 2018a 2018b 2016b and with results from sunlight illuminated pbrs fed with real wastewaters hülsen et al 2022 other than ppb anaerobic fermenters were the most abundant organisms in the fppbr these bacteria were mostly grown in the fermenter see fig s7 for microbial communities and without solid liquid separation directly fed into the pbr in addition fermenters particularly acetogens will also grow in the fppbr aerobic heterotrophs were also present in the reactor when oxygen was provided mostly when active aeration was installed phases vi viii finally fermenters and methanogens also grew in the fppbr during periods when solids accumulation occurred a phenomenon that was caused by improper reactor mixing mostly during the initial operational periods phases i iii see fig s8 for the microbial compositions of samples from the bottom of the fppbr this issue resulted in long srts of the bottom fraction in the reactor which allowed the effective growth of methanogenic archaea batstone et al 2002 the mixing problems can also be observed when looking at the tcod removal efficiencies in the fppbr fig s9 the tcod data together with the results from overall mass balances table s3 show that after phase iii the mixing system worked properly tcod removal stabilised around zero with balances of cod n and p close to 100 balances closed at 80 107 92 118 94 103 respectively 3 2 performance during the different operational phases 3 2 1 continuous reactor feeding reactor influent and importance of mixing the first phase served as start up period and for the development of a stable microbial community the duration of phase i of 32 d ensured that a pseudo steady state was reached the hrt in the fppbr was 4 4 5 7 d the stable performance of the reactor with removal efficiencies of vfa tkn and tp of practically 100 70 80 and 35 52 confirmed the proper functioning of the reactor fig 2 the development of a stable ppb community was further confirmed by the colour of the reactor see fig 1 established after only 1 week although the performance of the reactor was satisfactory the high solids content in the raw wastewater around 3 0 g ts l 1 see table s1 led to solids accumulation in both the fermenter and the bottom of the fppbr 4 7 g ts l 1 table s1 which led to inconsistent mass balances and a considerable apparent removal of tcod see table s3 and fig s9 during phase ii the fermenter was fed with pretreated wastewater after partial solid removal in an existing daf unit part of the wastewater treatment process at the factory to solve this issue this together with modifications of the mixing system improved the performance and solved the issue of solid accumulation in the fermenter and reactor particularly after phase iii see table s3 and fig s9 for the corresponding tcod removal efficiencies and mass balances in phase ii the growth strategy was also changed from suspended to attached growth by simply letting the biofilm grow on the reactor walls and wiping the walls every 3 4 days this was practically challenging and made the estimation of biomass productivities difficult from phase iii on this approach was no longer used and the suspended growth approach was re applied mechanically wiping the walls few times a day the slightly lower removal efficiencies and higher productivities in phase ii compared to phase i cannot directly be attributed to biofilm formation as the hrt was also reduced to 2 d from 4 4 5 7 d in phase i in fact the performances of phases ii and iii with equal operational conditions but different growth strategy i e attached vs suspended were very similar in average removal efficiencies in phase ii of 91 for vfa 46 for tkn and 30 for tp and measured biomass productivities of 38 g vs m 2 d 1 table 3 this suggests that attached growth does not jeopardise the removal efficiencies nor the biomass productivities this should be further investigated as attached and suspended growth operation provide different advantages in phase iii stable continuous operation was achieved at an hrt of 2 d initially efficient removal of vfas was achieved up to 100 with biomass productivities up to 60 g vs m 2 d 1 estimated values of up to 25 g vs m 2 d 1 nevertheless as aforementioned malfunctioning of the mixing system still resulted in solid accumulation during this phase which eventually worsened the system performance after the first half of phase iii see fig 2 vfa cod removal efficiencies dropped to 70 days 83 117 and the vfa concentration in the effluent increased up to 292 mg l 1 this clearly showed the relevance of a properly functioning mixing system to enable a homogeneous reactor content mainly to control the srt here srt should equal hrt and to minimise the growth of potential microbial competitors e g methanogens further modifications of the mixing system solved this problem with much better mixing performances from phase iv onwards table s3 and fig s9 with proper mixing and stable operation in place a similar operational strategy was maintained during phase iv but the hrt was further decreased to 1 d aiming to enhance the removal rates and biomass productivities it must be considered that in continuously fed outdoors ppb reactors the effective illuminated hrt is actually halved as natural daily cycles limit light supply to daytime periods the applied 1 d hrt during phase iv with an effective illuminated hrt of 0 5 d resulted in a decrease of the reactor performance with average vfa removal efficiencies going down to 67 and with a concomitant reduction of the removal efficiencies of n and p as vfa availability was the factor limiting nutrient removal therefore it was concluded that while an hrt of 2 d 1 d of illuminated hrt was effective early phase iii further hrt reduction to 1 d 0 5 illuminated resulted in a performance decrease due to biomass washout ppb growth rates of around 2 4 d 1 at 20 25 c have been reported for enriched cultures puyol et al 2017 therefore the overall hrt was again increased in the coming phases 2 4 d in phase v the possibility of biomass retention e g using membranes or cloth filtration as a cheaper alternative could solve this problem as biomass retention can reduce the applicable hrts by increasing the biomass concentration however this will also create additional problems of shading and ir attenuation and requires further research outdoors and at scale 3 2 2 continuous vs discontinuous anaerobic illuminated operation despite the generally satisfactory performance during the continuously fed phases i e phases i iv complete vfa removal achieved in phases i iii daily cycle studies revealed the main issue of this approach the lack of light during night time naturally resulted in a pause of phototrophic activity which lead to the discharge of basically untreated wastewater especially at low hrts the results from daily cycle studies performed during phases ii and iii illustrate this issue fig 5 the lack of light resulted in increasing scod and vfa concentrations during the night fermentation which in turn lead to a ph drop the same behavior was observed in all the cycles studies carried out during these periods see fig s10 to solve this problem the feeding strategy in phase v was changed from continuous feeding to semi continuous feeding only during daytime hours the overall hrt during this phase was 2 4 d hrt meaning that the effective illuminated hrt was 1 2 d the reactor was only fed during daytime this strategy resulted in a less pronounced vfa accumulation and ph drop during the night see phase vi daily cycle study in fig 6 in addition this modification clearly enhanced the performance of the fppbr with vfa removal efficiencies over 95 tkn removal efficiencies 58 and tp 30 again depending of the fermenter performance and the cod n p ratio of the substrate fig 2 and much higher biomass productivities than those achieved previously average values of 84 g vs m 2 d 1 measured and 24 g vs m 2 d 1 estimated vs values of 41 and 12 g vs m 2 d 1 in phase iii with the same overall hrt the highest productivities in this study were achieved during this period with maximum values of 107 and 42 g vs m 2 d 1 measured and estimated respectively in addition feeding only during the day resulted in doubled ppb relative abundances compared to previous phases from 0 23 0 26 in phases ii iv to 0 54 in phase v fig 4 these results clearly show that operation of the fppbr at an illuminated hrt of 1 2 d is feasible several reasons can explain the improved performances when feeding only during daytime first of all this avoided the discharge of untreated effluent while maintaining similar overall hrts to those working under continuous feeding i e 2 d in phase iii this also minimised the accumulation of vs during the night and favoured fermentation of residual organic matter which are available for ppb at the first sunbeams secondly as rapidly degradable cod such as vfa was only available during daytime period when ppb were dominant due to sunlight ppb had a competitive advantage over non phototrophic organisms such as methanogens if solids accumulation occurs aerobes that might grow if residual oxygen is present or acetogenic anaerobes indeed the increase in ppb relative abundance in phase v was at the expense of aerobic heterotrophs anaerobic fermenters and methanogens fig 4 thirdly seasonal factors might play a role noting that phase v occurred during april and may australian autumn corresponding to some of the lowest recorded irradiances and temperatures outside and in the reactor see figs s5 and s6 suggesting that these aspects were not limiting the fppbr performance we further note that even at low vfa cod concentrations in the effluent the scod content was on average 726 mg cod l 1 during phases i v with 574 mg cod l 1 corresponding to non vfa scod reason why there is a scod baseline in fig 5 the nature of this non biodegradable scod was not elucidated but we suspect non degradable residues from for example the feather stream and exclude products from ppb degradation this is underlined by a similar non degradable scod fraction in the fermenter effluent during phase v average non vfa scod of 488 mg l 1 from a total scod of 1260 mg cod l 1 see baseline in fig s3 as well as non degraded filtered tkn 3 2 3 combined anaerobic illuminated aerobic dark operation to enhance the wastewater treatment performance during night hours we aimed to exploit the metabolic versatility of ppb by supplying oxygen during night time it has been demonstrated that the oxidative conditions resulting from the presence of oxygen result in the suppression of photoheterotrophic growth and in the out competition of ppb if oxygen supply is continuous capson tojo et al 2021 nevertheless the aerobic capabilities of ppb give them some resilience which opens the door for a mixed metabolic mode 3mppb operation exploiting ppbs photoheterotrophic metabolism under anaerobic illuminated conditions during the day phani and chemoheterotrophy of the same ppb under aerobic dark conditions at night chaerd the 3mppb approach was tested in phases vi viii aiming to extend ppb treatment from the day to the night by continuing to remove cod and thus avoiding vfa accumulation during night time during phase vi a initial pulsed aeration through a perforated pipe from day 130 to day 160 9 16 min on off at 62 3 l min 1 did not result in continuously measurable do fig s6 after day 160 phase vi b the aeration was supplied continuously resulting in a substantial increase in the do concentrations up to saturation levels in some days fig s6 this means that phase vi a was mostly anaerobic until day 160 with some do spikes at night the corresponding cycle study was performed before day 160 and the trends corresponding to phase vi a fig 6 therefore represent an anaerobic system the scod and vfa in phase vi increased slightly in the dark with a concomitant ph drop even without feeding at night resembling albeit to a lower extent the trends of fig 5 phases ii iii these trends were related to the hydrolysis and fermentation of complex organics already present in the reactor in fact the performances microbial communities and measured biomass productivities were very similar between phase v and phase vi a figs 2 4 the estimated productivities were different due to failures in the fermenter during the beginning of phase vi from phase vii do was controlled using a dedicated plc and flexible air diffusers to increase the oxygen transfer efficiency this resulted in effective aeration during night time and in a reduction of the scod concentrations during the night enhancing the quality of the discharged effluent night aeration not only avoided scod accumulation but also reduced the scod baseline from around 700 mg cod l 1 down to 320 410 mg cod l 1 this suggests that the biodegradable extent of the influent cod was enhanced under aerobic conditions indeed the highest scod tkn and tp removal efficiencies using fermented daf effluent were reported during phase vii 67 53 and 45 respectively this confirms the positive effect of oxygen supply on the system performance at least in terms of pollutant removal and discharge savings this operation also circumvented the ph drop observed during strictly anaerobic operation fig s6c the same behavior was observed in a cycle study from phase vii fig s11 the enhanced performance observed in phases vii viii was not observed in phase vi as aforementioned the operation during the first half of phase vi a until day 160 was practically anaerobic as the air supply did not result in increased do concentrations in the reactor nor scod removal at night after this phase the increasing do concentrations resulted in a sudden reduction in the ppb relative abundances from 0 45 on day 161 to 0 08 in day 175 fig 4 this was accompanied by a decrease in the measured biomass productivities from 55 g vs m 2 d 1 on day 165 down to 34 g vs m 2 d 1 in days 170 172 most likely related to the lower biomass yields of other bacteria compared to ppb growing photoheterotrophically the decrease in ppb proportions can be observed in phases vi viii fig 4 at the beginning of phase vi the relative abundance of ppb was above 50 with rhodopseudomonas sp accounting for over 70 of the total ppb in all the samples days 125 136 150 and 161 after implementing continuous aeration in day 160 the ppb community collapsed to relative abundances below 10 clearly caused by the condition change day 175 unfortunately there was an accidental naoh addition between days 183 and 189 into the wastewater which led to a sharp increase in the reactor ph average daily value of 10 5 and reactor failure because of this the reactor was restarted on day 192 using 100 l of an enriched ppb culture from a backup reactor as starting inoculum the ppb community dynamics remain unclear as rhodobacter sp dominated after the restart with over 67 of the total ppb in phase vii fig 4 days 208 218 a redistribution of ppb representatives in phase viii makes us believe that rhodopseudomonas sp might have re emerged given more time at this stage we cannot state that the shift from a rhodopseudomonas dominated system anaerobically to a rhodobacter dominated reactor community was caused by aeration similar redistributions were observed in other publications especially after shocks such as aeration hülsen et al 2019 and parameter change e g srt alloul et al 2019 hülsen et al 2020 while we cannot make claims around the events in phase vi based on the following phases vii and viii it becomes evident that ppb can be maintained in a 3mppb concept these phases were characterised by enhanced wastewater treatment capabilities under night aeration operation with lower overall ppb abundance compared to purely anaerobic operation down to 0 2 0 3 in phases vii viii vs over 0 5 in phase v or the beginning of phase vi fig 4 this is a consequence of aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth of ppb and non phototrophic aerobes during night time biomass yields around 0 5 g cod g cod 1 with the latter representing up to 28 of the microbial population in phase vii fig 4 reducing the hrt in phase viii to 1 6 d helped to minimise the presence of aerobic heterotrophs but did not result in increased ppb proportions as ppb were also washed out the system would benefit from biomass retention to separate the hrt from the srt so hrt srt control is not the way to control common aerobes oxygen control appears as the way forward but the success depends on the substrate affinities of ppb vs common aerobes more research is required to optimise the system during night time which also requires an understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms finally during night time aeration the hrt was reduced from 2 1 d in phase vii to 1 6 d in phase viii illuminated hrt of 0 8 d the reactor performed properly but lower vfa removal efficiencies were obtained 67 100 furthermore the reduction of the hrt did lower the removal efficiencies the ppb proportions and did not increase the biomass productivities see table 3 and fig 4 therefore if biomass retention is not provided we recommend a minimum overall hrt of 2 2 4 d illuminated hrt of 1 1 2 d 3 3 implications for industrial application this work describes a modular scalable fppbr for ppb mediated wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the form of ppb biomass the reactor was functional removing almost all the vfa in the influent at rates around 0 5 g scod l 1 d 1 with peaks up to 1 0 g scod l 1 d 1 this was achieved without biomass retention in a flowthrough system at total hrts equal to srt of 1 6 2 4 d or illuminated hrts of 0 8 1 2 d the olr can theoretically be higher but the effects on the ph have to be considered particularly if feeding fermented wastewater i e reduced ph due to high vfa concentrations will inhibit ppb in subtropical regions at a light path of 40 mm 80 mm reactor width the pbr effluent had ts concentrations of around 1 5 2 0 g l 1 with up to 50 of native solids from the wastewater this resulted in estimated conservative estimates not measured values biomass productivities between 6 0 and 24 g vs m 2 d 1 where 24 g vs m 2 d 1 were achieved during stable operation in the australian autumn at a low light intensity and low temperature period in consideration of the underestimation of this productivity as explained above we take this value as a conservative estimate of realisable biomass production throughout the year corresponding to 504 g vs m 3 d 1 for poultry processing wastewater the corresponding cod vfa cod tn and tp removal efficiencies were around 67 12 87 7 5 53 0 and 45 6 0 respectively e g phase vii for mixed anaerobic day and aerobic night operation in a 3mppb system additional aeration costs will occur e g to realise 0 1 mg do l 1 during the night the latter depends on the standard oxygen transfer efficiency of the aerators and the height of the water column here around 900 mm a detailed economic analysis including the capital costs of a scaled plant must be done in a follow up study this study has shown that the reactor operation is robust and that it can handle temperature and irradiance fluctuations throughout the year this includes day and night temperature fluctuations of up to 24 c with peak lows of 6 0 c and peak highs over 45 c confirming results from lab studies hülsen et al 2016a and a recent outdoor study hülsen et al 2022 the system was operated without a plc and did not require detailed controls expect for the latter phases where do concentration was controlled however for prefermented wastewater as feed ph control is desirable and for aeration at night a do sensor would optimise the oxygen supply without the aerobic step at night the ppb plant performance is limited to a semi continuous feed regime during daytime hours the 3mppb concept might enable continuous day and night operation at higher olr and higher volumetric conversions but the microbial competition has to be determined the overall resource recovery would likely be reduced due to lower biomass yields under predominant chemoheterotrophic growth tchobanoglous et al 2003 the latter would depend on the volumetric conversion at night relative to the conversion during the day more research is required to assess this option and its effects on the microbial community however we showed that effluent polishing is feasible nevertheless this approach requires an aeration system and strict microbial community control the cost benefit comparison has to be made to evaluate this concept one major option to enhance the reactor performance in strict anaerobic or in mixed metabolic mode is to provide biomass retention via membranes or cloth filtration which has the potential to increase the ppb biomass in the reactor and increase the volumetric and areal removal efficiencies and productivities while shortening the hrts this has to be combined with continuous harvesting of biomass from the reactor to maintain a srt of 2 4 d hülsen et al 2018b 2016b this will also impact the light supply via increased shading and light attenuation of the infrared light which requires detailed analysis the options of attached biofilm or even the use of ppb granules stegman et al 2021 are perceivable but require more research from this work we can further outline some major differences of fppbrs for algal and ppb biomass production for strictly anaerobic operation photoheterotrophy a ppb fppbr does not require a distribution system for co2 supply and o2 stripping no product inhibition a ppb fppbr does likely not require cooling or heating subject to local conditions and the impact of aerobic grazers can be neglected another argument is the doubling of the light path relative to a pond due to two sided light supply which should enable less shading higher biomass concentrations higher volumetric removal and productivities biomass productivity is further independent from co2 supply as cod in a secondary treatment step is the main driver for n and p removal in combination with lower light requirements of ppb this might result in higher annual productivities especially on vfa rich wastewaters e g after prefermentation theoretically ppb can be used to treat any wastewater with sufficient bioavailable cod as shown in several publications capson tojo et al 2020 as presented here this includes wastewater with fats proteins or other inert solids which however might affect the biomass quality and its use as valuable product e g scp as feed the here achieved results can be extrapolated to other wastewaters especially easy degradable wastewater e g from food processing which would likely result in improved performances finally the ppb biomass was tested as fish and prawn feed where up to 66 and 100 of fishmeal in commercial feed have been successfully substituted with ppb biomass delamare deboutteville et al 2019 prawn feed data are not published at the moment fertiliser trials were also performed on various crops data not shown the product testing further enables addition of a potential price tag on the biomass which can be used for economic feasibility studies which will be key to evaluate the viability of this technology 4 conclusion the ppb demonstration plant provided consistent performance i e removal efficiencies of vfas tkn and tp of 90 34 77 and 28 45 and estimated conservative biomass productivities of 6 24 g vs m 2 d 1 under varying wastewater characteristics and environmental conditions the removal of n and p was limited by the availability of biodegradable cod a property of the feed wastewater the harvested biomass had a vs ts ratio over 90 a cp content of 58 and a compatible amino acid profile on average the fppbr showed average biomass productivities of 15 g vs m 2 d 1 and scod removal rates 500 mg l 1 d 1 working at an hrt of 2 4 d and with semicontinuous day only feeding under these conditions the relative abundance of ppb was 0 56 during continuous day night feeding vfa peaked during the night particularly at low retention times a minimum overall hrt of 1 6 2 4 d is recommended to avoid ppb washout finally a combined daily illuminated anaerobic night aerobic operation supplying air during night time called the 3mppb concept improved the removal performances avoiding vfa accumulation and a concomitant ph drop during the night nevertheless this approach resulted in lower ppb abundances and biomass productivities and would add extra infrastructure and operational costs declaration of

16099,while flow anodic oxidation systems can efficiently generate hydroxyl radicals oh and significantly enhance direct electron transfer det processes that result in the oxidation of target contaminants via the charge percolating network of flow anode particles challenges remain in constructing a flow anodic oxidation system that can be operated continuously with stable performance here we incorporate an ultrafiltration uf membrane module into the flow anodic oxidation system and achieve the continuous defluorination of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa for 12 days with high efficiency 94 1 and reasonable energy consumption 38 1 wh mg 1 compared to other advanced oxidation processes by using a mixture of conducting tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles as the flow anode the results indicate that det oh mediated oxidation and adsorption processes play critical roles in the degradation of pfoa during the flow anodic oxidation processes the synergistic effect of the tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles enhances the defluorination efficiency by 3 2 times at 4 5 v vs ag agcl compared to the control experiment no flow anode particles present and promotes the release of f into solution while other intermediate products remain adsorbed to the surface of the pd cnt particles although the pd cnt particles were oxidized after the long term operation no obvious pd ion leakage into solution was observed results of this study support the feasibility of continuous operation of a flow anode uf system with stable performance and pave the way for the translation of this advanced oxidation technology to practical application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow anode continuous operation tixo2x 1 pd cnt 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos exhibit useful surfactant properties as well as dual water and oil repellency and as such have previously been used in a wide variety of both consumer products and industrial chemical processes kissa 2001 however these chemicals have gained notoriety in recent years due to their persistence in the environment and association to adverse health effects including certain types of cancers cardiovascular problems and birth defects schulz et al 2020 various treatment technologies have been explored to transform pfoa into harmless species deng et al 2021 however conventional methods such as biodegradation and chemical oxidation are unable to effectively transform pfoa and pfos to nontoxic products due to the effects of perfluorination in reducing the oxidizability of the ionic headgroup co2 for pfas and so3 for pfos vecitis et al 2009 and the high bond energy of the c f bonds 116 kcal mol 1 zhao et al 2013 in addition nondestructive techniques such as physical adsorption and reverse osmosis ro result in a concentrated pfas residual which needs further treatment therefore the development of effective water treatment technologies to degrade pfoa is necessary electrochemical oxidation techniques based on anodic oxidation appear promising due to their ability to transform pfoa to nontoxic products without additional chemical consumption and high energy efficiency exceptional performance has been observed with anodes such as mixed metal oxides e g sno2 pbo2 and tixo2x 1 le et al 2019 zhuo et al 2017 and boron doped diamond bdd pierpaoli et al 2021 for instance le et al 2019 utilized a magnéli phase ti4o7 reactive electrochemical membrane to oxidize pfoa achieving a removal rate of 3415 203 μmol m 2 h 1 with an energy consumption of only 5 1 kwh m 3 meng et al 2019 designed a b n co doped diamond electrode for electrochemical degradation of pfoa via sulfate activation and obtained a first order rate constant for pfoa removal of 2 4 h 1 with a total organic carbon removal efficiency of 77 4 3 h at relatively low current density of 4 ma cm 2 it should be noted that the electrochemical reduction of pfoa may also be an effective method gao et al 2015 liu et al 2021a however the exact degradation mechanism of pfoa in electrochemical systems is still under debate huang et al 2020 indicated that reactive oxygen species were not involved in the oxidation of pfoa at the surface of a novel ti4o7 based electrode loaded with amorphous pd clusters while many studies showed that both direct electron transfer det and oh mediated oxidation processes played important roles in the oxidation of pfoa in addition zhuo et al 2016 confirmed the participation of water via either oh or h2o itself in the oxidation of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos a similar organic compound to pfoa with the use of 18o labeled h2o resulting in the formation of intermediate products containing 18o flow anode systems which can facilitate both det and oh mediated oxidation processes via the charge percolating network present in the anode tank have recently been shown to be particularly effective in inducing the oxidation of target compounds at relatively low energy we have shown that a high steady state oh concentration 5 4 10 12 mol m 2 a comparable value to that generated in flow through cells exhibiting enhanced mass transfer liu et al 2020b xie et al 2021b may be generated at 1 5 v vs she in a flow anode system with magnéli phase titanium suboxide tixo2x 1 particles as the anode material xie et al 2021b we have also shown that inclusion of carbon black as the flow anode material enhances the det processes by as much as 20 times at 1 0 v vs ag agcl compared to a control experiment without suspended conducting particles xie et al 2021a although we have investigated the mechanisms of det and oh mediated contaminant degradation in our previous studies these have been relatively short term investigations with no consideration given to the possibility of continuous operation for extended periods a critical issue if this technology is to be applied to real world problems at full scale in this study the continuous operation of a flow anode system is achieved by coupling it to a tubular ceramic ultrafiltration uf module and systematically investigated for 12 days a mixture of tixo2x 1 particles and carbon nanotube cnt supported pd nanoparticles was prepared and used as the anode materials due to the excellent electrochemical performance of tixo2x 1 xie et al 2020 and pd particles huang et al 2020 in oxidizing pfoa and the superior adsorptive capacity of cnt for pfoa and the intermediate products formed during the oxidation processes the overarching goal of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a continuously operated flow anodic oxidation system and the degradation processes of pfoa in the flow anodic oxidation system with a view to development of viable electrochemical oxidation process for the degradation of pfoa 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials boron doped diamond bdd plate electrode purchased from neocoat co ltd swaziland and ti

cathode chambers is 5 5 6 cm a mixture of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles was added to the anode tank as the flow anode with mass and volume solid to liquid ratios ranging from 1 to 10 to 51 and 53 respectively the electrochemical rector was composed of a bdd plate electrode as the anode current collector with an effective area of 10 cm2 a ti mesh electrode as the cathode with an effective area of 16 cm2 and a cation exchange membrane fujifilm europe which was used to separate the anode tank and the cathode tank and to act as a salt bridge meng et al 2019 the primary process occurring at the cathode is hydrogen generation a tubular tio2 ceramic uf membrane with a length of 40 mm outer diameter of 10 mm inner diameter of 7 mm and pore size of 30 nm was immersed vertically into the anode tank and located 5 cm away from the anode current collector clear water without any particles can flow through the uf membrane with no additional pressure all experiments were conducted in a three electrode system with the electrical field provided by a chi 660e electrochemical workstation an ag agcl reference electrode 196 mv vs she was located 0 5 cm away from the anode current collector in the anode tank magnetic stirring was used to maintain the anode particles in suspension with the stirring rate set to 250 rpm 2 3 characterization of the electrodes field transmission electron microscopy tem philips cm200 and scanning electron microscopy sem fei nova nanosem 230 was used to characterize the surface morphology structure and size of the tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles the x ray

specific surface area and the pore size distribution of the tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles via a bjh model a perkin elmer frontier ir spectrophotometer was used to collect ftir spectra at a rate of 0 2

of 10 3 106 hz in a 5 mm kh2po4 solution at open circuit potential ocp the obtained impedance data was fitted using z view software according to the model circuit shown in fig s1 where w 1 is the warburg diffusion resistance cpe1 is the double layer capacitance r ct is the equivalent polarization resistance and r s is the equivalent series resistance all the electrochemical tests in this work were corrected with ir compensation 2 4 calculations and analyses the concentration of f clo3 and clo4 in samples extracted from the anode chamber was measured by ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex and the concentration of pd ions determined by icp oes analysis agilent series 700 the concentrations of pfoa and dta were measured using high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a c18 column and a uv detector wavelength 210 nm for pfoa and wavelength 254 nm for dta the mobile phases consisted of methanol 20 mm kh2po4 at 80 20 v v for pfoa bao et al 2018 and methanol 0 1 formic acid in di water at 60 40 v v for dta jing and chaplin 2017 with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 pfoa and short chain intermediates extracted from pd cnt by methanol were measured by hplc ms ms api 4000 triple quadrupole usa the solution conductivity was measured via a conductivity meter con bta vernier dta was used as the oh probe to characterize the oh generation ability of tixo2x 1 pd cnt and bdd electrodes since dta is resistant to det processes and has a high second order reaction rate constant for reaction with oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 the geometric area normalized steady state oh concentration generated at the electrode surface can be estimated according to eq 1 gayen et al 2018 1 oh k d t a s k d t a o h where k dta oh is the second order rate constant for the reaction between dta and oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 s is the geometric area of the electrodes 16 cm2 for the pd cnt and tixo2x 1 electrodes and 10 cm2 for the bdd electrode and k dta is the first order apparent rate constant for dta oxidation assuming that oh is at steady state pseudo first order rate constants for reaction of dta with oh can be obtained using eq 2 2 c d t a t c d t a 0 exp k d t a t where t is the time and c dta

the integration of the corresponding current i over time t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the flow anode materials pd cnt is an effective defluorination catalyst and adsorbent towards pfoa due to the unique catalytic properties of pd nanoparticles long et al 2021 and the high specific surface area 112 5 m2 g 1 of the assemblage fig 2 a liu et al 2020a while tixo2x 1 is unable to significantly adsorb pfoa due to its low specific surface area 0 82 m2 g 1 fig 2a in contrast tixo2x 1 can efficiently generate oh an important pfoa oxidant due to its high oer potential 2 58 v vs ag agcl fig 2b lin et al 2021 while pd cnt has limited ability to generate oh as a result of its low oer potential 1 71 v vs ag agcl fig 2b a higher oer potential is usually representative of a stronger ability to generate hydroxyl radicals and higher oxidation power further evidence can be seen in the geometric area normalized oh concentrations generated at the tixo2x 1 and pd cnt electrode surfaces which were compared using dta as the oh probe since dta is resistant to det processes and has a high reaction rate constant with oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 as expected the geometric area normalized steady state oh concentration of the tixo2x 1 solid electrode 4 69 10 11 mol m 2 was 3 75 times higher than that of the pd cnt solid electrode 1 25 10 11 mol m 2 fig s2 the small extent of adsorption of dta on the solid pd cnt electrode may result in slight overestimation of the quantity of oh generated fig s3 which further indicates that the solid tixo2x 1 electrode is superior to the solid pd cnt electrode with regard to hydroxyl radical generation therefore a mixture of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt was used as the flow anode in order to incorporate the positive attributes of both materials with respect to the oxidation of pfoa xrd measurements were conducted to characterize the phase components of tixo2x 1 with results showing that ti4o7 was the main component 92 together with a small amount of ti3o5 8 fig 2c sem and tem were further used to investigate the surface morphologies and structures of the tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles pd nanoparticles with a diameter of 4 10 nm were firmly attached on the surface of cnts which exhibited a diameter of 16 7 nm fig 2d and a length in the order of microns fig 2f the presence of pd nanoparticles on the surface of the cnt was further confirmed by eds measurement with results showing that the pd elements red dots were scattered on the mapping region fig s4 with a clear pd characteristic peak located at 2 83 kev fig s4 according to the xps results 5 18 wt of pd was present in the pd cnt assemblages table s1 the size of the tixo2x 1 particles was in the range from 5 1 to 12 4 μm fig 2e which provided sufficient space for the attachment of pd cnt on the surface of the tixo2x 1 particles fig 2f 3 2 evaluation of the pfoa oxidation process in the flow anode system the experimental data for adsorption of pfoa on pd cnt were fitted by a freundlich isotherm model eq 4 4 q e k c e 1 n where q e is the amount of pfoa adsorbed on a unit weight of pd cnt mg g 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 and k and 1 n are the freundlich constants k is an empirical constant equal to the intercept at c e 1 mg l 1 and 1 n is the slope of the line on a log log plot according to the freundlich equation fig 3 a the adsorption amount of pd cnt was calculated to be 7 7 mg g 1 in a 5 mm kh2po4 solution containing 10 mg l 1 pfoa therefore the 1 g of pd cnt present in the anode tank enabled the complete adsorption of the 1 mg pfoa in 100 ml of 5 mm kh2po4 solution with the concentration of pfoa remaining in solution found to be below the detection limit of the hplc method used 0 1 mg l 1 in addition the shorter chain poly and perfluoroalkyl substances formed during the pfoa oxidation processes can also be adsorbed on the surface of pd cnt long et al 2021 radjenovic et al 2020 resulting in undetectable concentrations of pfoa and shorter chain poly and perfluoroalkyl substances in solution during pfoa oxidation ftir and xps measurements were conducted in an attempt to confirm that pfoa degradation occurred on the surface of the pd cnt particles however the characteristic peaks of the c f bond respectively located at 1396 cm 1 in the ftir spectra liu et al 2021b and 290 6 ev in the xps spectra xie et al 2020 were not observed due to the low content of pfoa 1 mg g 1 on the surface of pd cnt fig s5 and fig s6 the degradation of pfoa was characterized by measuring the concentrations of f released into solutions since f can be easily detected by ic measurement time course results of f generation in the flow anode reactor and the control i e no flow anode materials in the anolyte are shown in fig 3b the method of calculating defluorination efficacy is provided in section s2 the addition of pd cnt decreased the defluorination efficacy of pfoa from 30 2 to 13 5 compared to the control i e no tixo2x 1 and pd cnt with results showing that the adsorbed pfoa on the surface of pd cnt was unable to be oxidized efficiently due to the low oh generation ability of pd cnt 1 25 10 11 mol m 2 fig s2 compared to that of the bdd electrodes anode current collector 5 0 10 11 mol m 2 fig s2 in comparison the addition of 200 g l 1 tixo2x 1 only enhanced the defluorination efficacy of pfoa to 51 1 fig 3b presumably as a result of the higher concentration of oh generated at the surface of tixo2x 1 particles during the pfoa oxidation process however pfoa is not extensively adsorbed on the surface of tixo2x 1 particles since these particles are relatively hydrophilic radjenovic et al 2020 with effective adsorption of pfoa recognized to facilitate the defluorination of pfoa su et al 2019 the addition of cnt into the anode tank did not result in the degradation of pfoa fig 3b indicating the unique catalytic properties of pd nanoparticles towards pfoa oxidation long et al 2021 in addition the defluorination efficacy of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt is much higher that of tixo2x 1 and cnt fig 3b with these results providing further evidence of the critical role of pd nanoparticles in the oxidation of pfoa therefore a mixture of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt was added to the anode tank and the joint effect of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt found to result in a significantly increased pfoa defluorination efficacy of 95 7 fig 3b the particle size of tixo2x 1 was much larger than that of pd cnt which enabled the attachment of pd cnt to the surface of tixo2x 1 the oh generated at the surface of tixo2x 1 was able to react with the pfoa and or intermediate products adsorbed at the surface of pd cnt since oh is recognized to be able diffuse some nanometres from the point of generation before being consumed either by self reaction or by other scavengers chen et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the effect of stirring rate on the oxidation of pfoa has been investigated using an overhead paddle stirrer fig s7 the results showed that there is a little change in the defluorination rate when the stirring rate exceeds 150 rpm while a decrease of defluorination rate at stirring rates of 100 rpm and below is observed since the 200 g l 1 tixo2x 1 and 10 g l 1 pd cnt particles cannot be maintained in suspension at these low stirring rates this result indicates that the quantity of conducting particles present in the suspension is a key determinant of rate of pfoa oxidation but that rate of contact of the particles with the anode is not a critical factor in brief and as suggested previously xie et al 2021a 2021b the flow anode particles can be charged via both contact with the bdd current collector and by contact with each other as a result of charge transfer through the percolating network of flow anode particles the effects of the mass ratio of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt were systematically investigated at 4 5 v in 5 mm kh2po4 solutions containing 10 mg l 1 pfoa fig 3c with results showing that a mixing mass ratio of 20 1 200 g l 1 tixo2x 1 and 10 g l 1 pd cnt is the most appropriate ratio with a fluoride production rate of 17 3 μmol h 1 the presence of f was not detected until the anode potential was set at 3 5 v vs ag agcl fig s8 and fig 3d as oh can be generated at the surface of tixo2x 1 at 2 58 v vs ag agcl fig 2b this suggests that the det process rather than the oh mediated oxidation process was the initial step of pfoa degradation a result also supported by dft simulations carter and farrell 2008 besides the second order rate constants of parent pfoa with oh are very low 105 106 l mol 1 s 1 radjenovic et al 2020 while the pfoa radicals formed by det processes have a much higher reaction rate with oh radjenovic et al 2020 further proving that the initial oxidation of pfoa should be a det mediated process the flow anode system enhanced the defluorination rates by 289 303 317 and 176 compared to controls at 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 v vs ag agcl respectively fig 3d therefore the following experiments were conducted at 4 5 v vs ag agcl in 5 mm kh2po4 solution containing 200 g l 1 tixo2x 1 and 10 g l 1 pd cnt if not otherwise stated the defluorination rates were also investigated in different electrolytes with the same concentration in each case fig 4 a the addition of flow anode particles increased the solution conductivities of kh2po4 kclo4 and k2so4 electrolytes from 555 4 1 523 8 1 and 1391 5 1 µs cm 1 to 896 8 4 879 8 3 and 2064 8 4 µs cm 1 respectively with these increases expected to facilitate charge transfer to the tixo2x 1 liu et al 2021c and pd cnt oshima et al 2020 particles although perphosphate could be generated at the bdd electrode polarized at 2 4 v or more vs she weiss et al 2008 the defluorination rate in kh2po4 solution 19 8 0 8 μmol h 1 was similar to that in kclo4 solution 20 1 0 7 μmol h 1 fig 4a besides the solution conductivity of kh2po4 896 8 4 µs cm 1 was also slightly higher than that of kclo4 879 8 3 µs cm 1 fig 4b indicating that perphosphate should have a little effect on the degradation of pfoa in comparison the defluorination rate in k2so4 solution 22 2 1 1 μmol h 1 fig 4a was higher than that in kh2po4 with this likely due to the higher solution conductivity of the k2so4 solution 2065 4 µs cm 1 fig 4b the formation and subsequent participation of so4 a powerful oxidant with a redox potential of 2 6 ev lee et al 2020 in the defluorination of pfoa in the flow anode system at 4 5 v vs ag agcl is also a possibility with previous studies showing that so4 is able to degrade pfoa efficiently via electron transfer lee et al 2010 yang et al 2020 besides the solution conductivity of 5 mm kh2po4 555 4 1 µs cm 1 is comparable to the conductivity typical of urban wastewater 500 1400 µs cm 1 golet et al 2001 rodrigo et al 2010 drinking water below 150 µs cm 1 mustonen et al 2008 and industrial wastewaters 500 20 000 µs cm 1 kadirvelu et al 2001 saja et al 2018 in order to further investigate the role of hydroxyl radicals in the degradation of pfoa three hydroxyl radical scavengers were used in the flow anode system though it should be recognized that the mechanisms of action of these scavengers are still under debate for instance zhao et al 2017 suggested that t butanol can be easily adsorbed on the surface of znfe2o4 cu3 particles and therefore used as the surface bound oh scavenger in contrast barazesh et al 2016 indicated that the surface bound oh present at the bdd anode surface was unable to be scavenged by saturated t butanol in addition ling et al 2016 indicated that methanol can be used as a quencher for oh both in bulk solution and on the surface of tio2 while wu et al 2019 and liang et al 2013 suggested that methanol may not accumulate on the surface of catalyst and can only be used as an oh aq scavenger despite the fact that the functional mechanisms of these additives are still unclear the addition of t butanol and methanol resulted in a decrease in the defluorination rate from 19 8 0 8 μmol h 1 to 9 7 1 2 and 6 3 0 4 μmol h 1 respectively fig 4a indicating that hydroxyl radicals surface bound oh and or oh aq played an important role in the degradation of pfoa the addition of ki almost completely suppressed the defluorination of pfoa with a low defluorination rate of 1 1 0 1 μmol h 1 obtained fig 4a since i ion can be easily adsorbed at the surface of the anodically polarized flow electrode and oxidized to i2 aq at 0 621 v vs she xu et al 2017 the addition of ki likely not only depressed the oh mediated oxidation process but also the det process leading to a substantial reduction in pfoa defluorination rate in the flow anodic oxidation system in light of the effects of these various additives we suggest that both oh mediated oxidation and det processes are critical to the degradation of pfoa in the flow anodic oxidation system in order to further clarify the factors contributing to the enhanced rate of pfoa degradation in the flow anode system compared to the control nyquist plots fig 4c and potential distributions fig 4d of the anodic compartment were measured r s and r ct values of the flow anode system decreased from 11 29 to 21 32 ω to 9 85 and 11 43 ω compared to the control fig 4c in addition the potential distributions in the anode tank were measured using two chi 660e systems with ag agcl electrodes as the working electrode in each case one was used for polarization of the anode current collector and the other to measure the potentials in the solutions by using an ag agcl electrode as the working electrode the solution potentials directly adjacent to the bdd current collector were 4 03 and 4 11 v vs ag agcl respectively in the control and the flow anode system fig 4d and decreased more rapidly with distance from the current collector in the control 0 075 v cm 1 compared to the rate of decrease 0 052 v cm 1 in the flow anode system fig 4d the rate of potential decrease with distance from the electrode 0 070 v cm 1 in the 8 6 mm kh2po4 solution with a conductivity of 900 2 µs cm 1 similar to that of the 5 mm kh2po4 solution containing flow anode particles 896 8 4 µs cm 1 was also measured fig s9 these results are in accord with the expected lower ohmic resistance in the solution containing the flow anode particles with this suspension exhibiting higher electrical conductivity compared to the control fig 4b in regard to the obtained results the enhanced defluorination rates are most likely related to the substantial increase in active surface sites provided by the presence of the pd cnt particles the larger amount of oh generated by tixo2x 1 particles and the higher solution conductivity in the flow anode oxidation system a schematic of the likely degradation pathway of pfoa in the flow anode system is shown in fig 5 with pfoa firstly adsorbed on the surface of the pd cnt particles attached to the surface of the tixo2x 1 particles the initial det oxidation of pfoa to form pfoa radicals would be expected to occur once the anode potential reached 3 5 v vs ag agcl finally the formed pfoa radicals constantly reacted with oh generated by flow anode particles mainly from tixo2x 1 particles to form the adsorbed intermediate products and the final products of f evidence of the nature of these adsorbed products was obtained by methanol extraction of organic compounds adsorbed to the pd cnt particles with subsequent hplc ms ms analysis of the extracted solution revealing the presence of short chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas c2 c6 fig s10 with these degradation products typical of a classical pfoa oxidation process in which the headgroup is cleaved and shorter chain perfluorinated carboxylates are formed radjenovic et al 2020 3 3 long term evaluation of flow anodic oxidation performance for pfoa removal the feasibility of continuous use of the flow anode uf integrated system was further evaluated over a 12 day period of operation based on the optimized parameters obtained in section 3 2 fig 6 a the initial pfoa concentration in the feed water was 10 mg l 1 and the feed stream flow rate was set at 0 83 ml min 1 the permeate flux was set at 19 82 l m 2 h 1 and the treated wastewater stored in the permeate tank the pfoa concentrations in ground waters and synthetic wastewaters of labs range from pg l 1 to mg l 1 and from μg l 1 to hundreds of mg l 1 respectively cheng et al 2010 radjenovic et al 2020 therefore 10 mg l 1 should be a reasonable value compared to the pfoa concentration in the contaminated ground waters and synthetic wastewaters in labs a potential of 4 5 v vs ag agcl was constantly applied at the anode and the concentrations of f pfoa and pd ions measured at scheduled times as can be seen from fig 6a the flow anode uf system reached a relatively stable status after about 18 h meanwhile the concentration of f at the outlet rapidly increased to 0 44 mm and then gradually decreased to a fairly stable value 0 34 mm fig 6a in comparison the concentration of f in the permeate tank quickly increased to a relatively stable value during the long term operation no pfoa or other intermediate products were detected at the outlet according to hplc and toc results and the total concentration of pd ions pb2 and pd4 in the permeate tank only slightly increased from 5 3 to 13 9 μg l 1 fig 6a with results indicating that the flow anode uf system was capable of continuous operation for 12 days with high stability in addition the total defluorination efficiency of this long term continuous experiment was calculated to be 94 1 although the energy consumption per order of pfoa removal was unable to be calculated due to the unmeasurable concentration of pfoa on the flow anode particle surfaces fig s5 and fig s6 the energy consumption per unit mass eeu of f of the flow anode uf system and some other pfoa treatment technologies with similar initial pfoa concentrations was compared indicating that the eeu of the flow anode uf system 38 1 wh mg 1 was comparable to other pfoa treatment technologies huang et al 2020 2016 li et al 2012 lou et al 2021 ochiai et al 2011 schaefer et al 2017 wang and zhang 2011 zhuo et al 2011 the flow anode system was further tested to treat a synthetic wastewater containing 2 mm kcl 2 mm k2so4 2 mm kh2po4 10 μm pfoa 100 μm phenol and 100 μm oxalate a defluorination efficacy of 71 6 was achieved at 4 5 v when treating the synthetic wastewater with this result indicating the potential of the flow anode system for pfoa degradation in a complex matrix fig s11 however the formation of clo3 and clo4 is problematic and attention needs to be given to investigation of approaches to eliminating formation of these troublesome byproducts fig s11 lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 the pressure drop across the tio2 uf membrane was measured using a differential pressure meter with no obvious variation of the pressure drop observed with results indicating that membrane fouling was minor over the extended period of operation fig s12 tio2 has been used extensively in heterogeneous photocatalysis systems not just because its excellent catalytic properties but also because of its high electrochemical stability towards hydroxyl radicals guo et al 2019 although hydroxyl radicals are generated in the flow anode system the tio2 ceramic membrane should be able to operate for extended periods without any obvious damage considering its high electrochemical stability xps was further used to investigate any changes in flow anode materials over the long term operation fig 7 the peaks of the ti 2p spectra located at 458 8 and 457 1 ev are related to the presence of ti4 and ti3 in tixo2x 1 particles respectively xie et al 2020 with results showing that the change of the ratio of ti4 and ti3 was not significant over the 12 days of operation fig 7 additionally no obvious changes were observed in the xrd pattern of tixo2x 1 after the long term operation fig s13 in comparison pd cnt particles was extensively oxidized the characteristic peaks of pd0 at 335 5 and 340 5 ev and pd2 at 336 5 and 341 5 ev decreased xu et al 2021 fig 7 while two new peaks at 338 1 and 343 1 ev were observed and associated with pd4 from the pdo2 phase velinova et al 2019 after the long term operation fig 7 indicating that pd nanoparticles attached on the surface of cnt were oxidized during the pfoa degradation process it should be noted that pd oxides are relatively stable even in acidic environments with this stability potentially the reason why few pd ions were released into solution fig 6a only 0 2 mg pd was lost during the long term operation the peaks located at 284 5 285 3 286 3 287 5 and 288 8 ev of the c 1 s spectra are related to cc c c c oh co and o co bonds respectively li et al 2021 fig 7 the intensity of the cc peak significantly decreased while the intensities of the peaks relating to oxygen containing functional groups obviously increased fig 7 suggesting that cnt was also unstable at high anode potentials the quantitative change of the pd and c oxidation states can be seen in table s1 although the electrochemical stability of pd cnt was unsatisfactory 1 g suspension of pd cnt successfully supported continuous operation of the flow anode uf system for 12 days with consistent removal of pfoa fig 6a the continuous oxidation of pd cnt may lead to the loss and or deactivation of the flow anode particles an advantage however of the flow anode system is that the suspended electrode particles can be easily replaced when the oxidized flow anode particles become ineffective the evident oxidation of the pd cnt assemblages however highlights the need for the development of anode materials with high electrochemical stability if this type of system is to find practical application as a viable advanced oxidation process conclusions in this study the degradation processes of pfoa in a continuously operated flow anode system using a mixture of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles as the flow anode were systematically investigated our results indicated that both det oh mediated oxidation and adsorption processes play an important role in the oxidation of pfoa with the synergistic effect of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt significantly enhancing the defluorination efficiency of pfoa from 30 2 to 95 7 at 4 5 v vs ag agcl in a dilute matrix in addition a continuously operated flow anode system was achieved by coupling a uf module and successfully maintained a high pfoa degradation performance for 12 days with a comparable energy consumption 38 1 wh mg 1 to other technologies and a relatively high defluorination efficiency 94 1 although the pd cnt particles were extensively oxidized after the long term operation no obvious amounts of pd ions were released into solution if need be the flow anode particles can be easily replaced via the uf located in the anode tank in conclusion results of this study confirm the feasibility of continuous operation of a flow anode system with high stability

16099,while flow anodic oxidation systems can efficiently generate hydroxyl radicals oh and significantly enhance direct electron transfer det processes that result in the oxidation of target contaminants via the charge percolating network of flow anode particles challenges remain in constructing a flow anodic oxidation system that can be operated continuously with stable performance here we incorporate an ultrafiltration uf membrane module into the flow anodic oxidation system and achieve the continuous defluorination of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa for 12 days with high efficiency 94 1 and reasonable energy consumption 38 1 wh mg 1 compared to other advanced oxidation processes by using a mixture of conducting tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles as the flow anode the results indicate that det oh mediated oxidation and adsorption processes play critical roles in the degradation of pfoa during the flow anodic oxidation processes the synergistic effect of the tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles enhances the defluorination efficiency by 3 2 times at 4 5 v vs ag agcl compared to the control experiment no flow anode particles present and promotes the release of f into solution while other intermediate products remain adsorbed to the surface of the pd cnt particles although the pd cnt particles were oxidized after the long term operation no obvious pd ion leakage into solution was observed results of this study support the feasibility of continuous operation of a flow anode uf system with stable performance and pave the way for the translation of this advanced oxidation technology to practical application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow anode continuous operation tixo2x 1 pd cnt 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos exhibit useful surfactant properties as well as dual water and oil repellency and as such have previously been used in a wide variety of both consumer products and industrial chemical processes kissa 2001 however these chemicals have gained notoriety in recent years due to their persistence in the environment and association to adverse health effects including certain types of cancers cardiovascular problems and birth defects schulz et al 2020 various treatment technologies have been explored to transform pfoa into harmless species deng et al 2021 however conventional methods such as biodegradation and chemical oxidation are unable to effectively transform pfoa and pfos to nontoxic products due to the effects of perfluorination in reducing the oxidizability of the ionic headgroup co2 for pfas and so3 for pfos vecitis et al 2009 and the high bond energy of the c f bonds 116 kcal mol 1 zhao et al 2013 in addition nondestructive techniques such as physical adsorption and reverse osmosis ro result in a concentrated pfas residual which needs further treatment therefore the development of effective water treatment technologies to degrade pfoa is necessary electrochemical oxidation techniques based on anodic oxidation appear promising due to their ability to transform pfoa to nontoxic products without additional chemical consumption and high energy efficiency exceptional performance has been observed with anodes such as mixed metal oxides e g sno2 pbo2 and tixo2x 1 le et al 2019 zhuo et al 2017 and boron doped diamond bdd pierpaoli et al 2021 for instance le et al 2019 utilized a magnéli phase ti4o7 reactive electrochemical membrane to oxidize pfoa achieving a removal rate of 3415 203 μmol m 2 h 1 with an energy consumption of only 5 1 kwh m 3 meng et al 2019 designed a b n co doped diamond electrode for electrochemical degradation of pfoa via sulfate activation and obtained a first order rate constant for pfoa removal of 2 4 h 1 with a total organic carbon removal efficiency of 77 4 3 h at relatively low current density of 4 ma cm 2 it should be noted that the electrochemical reduction of pfoa may also be an effective method gao et al 2015 liu et al 2021a however the exact degradation mechanism of pfoa in electrochemical systems is still under debate huang et al 2020 indicated that reactive oxygen species were not involved in the oxidation of pfoa at the surface of a novel ti4o7 based electrode loaded with amorphous pd clusters while many studies showed that both direct electron transfer det and oh mediated oxidation processes played important roles in the oxidation of pfoa in addition zhuo et al 2016 confirmed the participation of water via either oh or h2o itself in the oxidation of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos a similar organic compound to pfoa with the use of 18o labeled h2o resulting in the formation of intermediate products containing 18o flow anode systems which can facilitate both det and oh mediated oxidation processes via the charge percolating network present in the anode tank have recently been shown to be particularly effective in inducing the oxidation of target compounds at relatively low energy we have shown that a high steady state oh concentration 5 4 10 12 mol m 2 a comparable value to that generated in flow through cells exhibiting enhanced mass transfer liu et al 2020b xie et al 2021b may be generated at 1 5 v vs she in a flow anode system with magnéli phase titanium suboxide tixo2x 1 particles as the anode material xie et al 2021b we have also shown that inclusion of carbon black as the flow anode material enhances the det processes by as much as 20 times at 1 0 v vs ag agcl compared to a control experiment without suspended conducting particles xie et al 2021a although we have investigated the mechanisms of det and oh mediated contaminant degradation in our previous studies these have been relatively short term investigations with no consideration given to the possibility of continuous operation for extended periods a critical issue if this technology is to be applied to real world problems at full scale in this study the continuous operation of a flow anode system is achieved by coupling it to a tubular ceramic ultrafiltration uf module and systematically investigated for 12 days a mixture of tixo2x 1 particles and carbon nanotube cnt supported pd nanoparticles was prepared and used as the anode materials due to the excellent electrochemical performance of tixo2x 1 xie et al 2020 and pd particles huang et al 2020 in oxidizing pfoa and the superior adsorptive capacity of cnt for pfoa and the intermediate products formed during the oxidation processes the overarching goal of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a continuously operated flow anodic oxidation system and the degradation processes of pfoa in the flow anodic oxidation system with a view to development of viable electrochemical oxidation process for the degradation of pfoa 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials boron doped diamond bdd plate electrode purchased from neocoat co ltd swaziland and ti

cathode chambers is 5 5 6 cm a mixture of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles was added to the anode tank as the flow anode with mass and volume solid to liquid ratios ranging from 1 to 10 to 51 and 53 respectively the electrochemical rector was composed of a bdd plate electrode as the anode current collector with an effective area of 10 cm2 a ti mesh electrode as the cathode with an effective area of 16 cm2 and a cation exchange membrane fujifilm europe which was used to separate the anode tank and the cathode tank and to act as a salt bridge meng et al 2019 the primary process occurring at the cathode is hydrogen generation a tubular tio2 ceramic uf membrane with a length of 40 mm outer diameter of 10 mm inner diameter of 7 mm and pore size of 30 nm was immersed vertically into the anode tank and located 5 cm away from the anode current collector clear water without any particles can flow through the uf membrane with no additional pressure all experiments were conducted in a three electrode system with the electrical field provided by a chi 660e electrochemical workstation an ag agcl reference electrode 196 mv vs she was located 0 5 cm away from the anode current collector in the anode tank magnetic stirring was used to maintain the anode particles in suspension with the stirring rate set to 250 rpm 2 3 characterization of the electrodes field transmission electron microscopy tem philips cm200 and scanning electron microscopy sem fei nova nanosem 230 was used to characterize the surface morphology structure and size of the tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles the x ray

specific surface area and the pore size distribution of the tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles via a bjh model a perkin elmer frontier ir spectrophotometer was used to collect ftir spectra at a rate of 0 2

warburg diffusion resistance cpe1 is the double layer capacitance r ct is the equivalent polarization resistance and r s is the equivalent series resistance all the electrochemical tests in this work were corrected with ir compensation 2 4 calculations and analyses the concentration of f clo3 and clo4 in samples extracted from the anode chamber was measured by ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex and the concentration of pd ions determined by icp oes analysis agilent series 700 the concentrations of pfoa and dta were measured using high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a c18 column and a uv detector wavelength 210 nm for pfoa and wavelength 254 nm for dta the mobile phases consisted of methanol 20 mm kh2po4 at 80 20 v v for pfoa bao et al 2018 and methanol 0 1 formic acid in di water at 60 40 v v for dta jing and chaplin 2017 with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 pfoa and short chain intermediates extracted from pd cnt by methanol were measured by hplc ms ms api 4000 triple quadrupole usa the solution conductivity was measured via a conductivity meter con bta vernier dta was used as the oh probe to characterize the oh generation ability of tixo2x 1 pd cnt and bdd electrodes since dta is resistant to det processes and has a high second order reaction rate constant for reaction with oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 the geometric area normalized steady state oh concentration generated at the electrode surface can be estimated according to eq 1 gayen et al 2018 1 oh k d t a s k d t a o h where k dta oh is the second order rate constant for the reaction between dta and oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 s is the geometric area of the electrodes 16 cm2 for the pd cnt and tixo2x 1 electrodes and 10 cm2 for the bdd electrode and k dta is the first order apparent rate constant for dta oxidation assuming that oh is at steady state pseudo first order rate constants for reaction of dta with oh can be obtained using eq 2 2 c d t a t c d t a 0 exp k d t a t where t is the time and c dta

the integration of the corresponding current i over time t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the flow anode materials pd cnt is an effective defluorination catalyst and adsorbent towards pfoa due to the unique catalytic properties of pd nanoparticles long et al 2021 and the high specific surface area 112 5 m2 g 1 of the assemblage fig 2 a liu et al 2020a while tixo2x 1 is unable to significantly adsorb pfoa due to its low specific surface area 0 82 m2 g 1 fig 2a in contrast tixo2x 1 can efficiently generate oh an important pfoa oxidant due to its high oer potential 2 58 v vs ag agcl fig 2b lin et al 2021 while pd cnt has limited ability to generate oh as a result of its low oer potential 1 71 v vs ag agcl fig 2b a higher oer potential is usually representative of a stronger ability to generate hydroxyl radicals and higher oxidation power further evidence can be seen in the geometric area normalized oh concentrations generated at the tixo2x 1 and pd cnt electrode surfaces which were compared using dta as the oh probe since dta is resistant to det processes and has a high reaction rate constant with oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 as expected the geometric area normalized steady state oh concentration of the tixo2x 1 solid electrode 4 69 10 11 mol m 2 was 3 75 times higher than that of the pd cnt solid electrode 1 25 10 11 mol m 2 fig s2 the small extent of adsorption of dta on the solid pd cnt electrode may result in slight overestimation of the quantity of oh generated fig s3 which further indicates that the solid tixo2x 1 electrode is superior to the solid pd cnt electrode with regard to hydroxyl radical generation therefore a mixture of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt was used as the flow anode in order to incorporate the positive attributes of both materials with respect to the oxidation of pfoa xrd measurements were conducted to characterize the phase components of tixo2x 1 with results showing that ti4o7 was the main component 92 together with a small amount of ti3o5 8 fig 2c sem and tem were further used to investigate the surface morphologies and structures of the tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles pd nanoparticles with a diameter of 4 10 nm were firmly attached on the surface of cnts which exhibited a diameter of 16 7 nm fig 2d and a length in the order of microns fig 2f the presence of pd nanoparticles on the surface of the cnt was further confirmed by eds measurement with results showing that the pd elements red dots were scattered on the mapping region fig s4 with a clear pd characteristic peak located at 2 83 kev fig s4 according to the xps results 5 18 wt of pd was present in the pd cnt assemblages table s1 the size of the tixo2x 1 particles was in the range from 5 1 to 12 4 μm fig 2e which provided sufficient space for the attachment of pd cnt on the surface of the tixo2x 1 particles fig 2f 3 2 evaluation of the pfoa oxidation process in the flow anode system the experimental data for adsorption of pfoa on pd cnt were fitted by a freundlich isotherm model eq 4 4 q e k c e 1 n where q e is the amount of pfoa adsorbed on a unit weight of pd cnt mg g 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 and k and 1 n are the freundlich constants k is an empirical constant equal to the intercept at c e 1 mg l 1 and 1 n is the slope of the line on a log log plot according to the freundlich equation fig 3 a the adsorption amount of pd cnt was calculated to be 7 7 mg g 1 in a 5 mm kh2po4 solution containing 10 mg l 1 pfoa therefore the 1 g of pd cnt present in the anode tank enabled the complete adsorption of the 1 mg pfoa in 100 ml of 5 mm kh2po4 solution with the concentration of pfoa remaining in solution found to be below the detection limit of the hplc method used 0 1 mg l 1 in addition the shorter chain poly and perfluoroalkyl substances formed during the pfoa oxidation processes can also be adsorbed on the surface of pd cnt long et al 2021 radjenovic et al 2020 resulting in undetectable concentrations of pfoa and shorter chain poly and perfluoroalkyl substances in solution during pfoa oxidation ftir and xps measurements were conducted in an attempt to confirm that pfoa degradation occurred on the surface of the pd cnt particles however the characteristic peaks of the c f bond respectively located at 1396 cm 1 in the ftir spectra liu et al 2021b and 290 6 ev in the xps spectra xie et al 2020 were not observed due to the low content of pfoa 1 mg g 1 on the surface of pd cnt fig s5 and fig s6 the degradation of pfoa was characterized by measuring the concentrations of f released into solutions since f can be easily detected by ic measurement time course results of f generation in the flow anode reactor and the control i e no flow anode materials in the anolyte are shown in fig 3b the method of calculating defluorination efficacy is provided in section s2 the addition of pd cnt decreased the defluorination efficacy of pfoa from 30 2 to 13 5 compared to the control i e no tixo2x 1 and pd cnt with results showing that the adsorbed pfoa on the surface of pd cnt was unable to be oxidized efficiently due to the low oh generation ability of pd cnt 1 25 10 11 mol m 2 fig s2 compared to that of the bdd electrodes anode current collector 5 0 10 11 mol m 2 fig s2 in comparison the addition of 200 g l 1 tixo2x 1 only enhanced the defluorination efficacy of pfoa to 51 1 fig 3b presumably as a result of the higher concentration of oh generated at the surface of tixo2x 1 particles during the pfoa oxidation process however pfoa is not extensively adsorbed on the surface of tixo2x 1 particles since these particles are relatively hydrophilic radjenovic et al 2020 with effective adsorption of pfoa recognized to facilitate the defluorination of pfoa su et al 2019 the addition of cnt into the anode tank did not result in the degradation of pfoa fig 3b indicating the unique catalytic properties of pd nanoparticles towards pfoa oxidation long et al 2021 in addition the defluorination efficacy of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt is much higher that of tixo2x 1 and cnt fig 3b with these results providing further evidence of the critical role of pd nanoparticles in the oxidation of pfoa therefore a mixture of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt was added to the anode tank and the joint effect of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt found to result in a significantly increased pfoa defluorination efficacy of 95 7 fig 3b the particle size of tixo2x 1 was much larger than that of pd cnt which enabled the attachment of pd cnt to the surface of tixo2x 1 the oh generated at the surface of tixo2x 1 was able to react with the pfoa and or intermediate products adsorbed at the surface of pd cnt since oh is recognized to be able diffuse some nanometres from the point of generation before being consumed either by self reaction or by other scavengers chen et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the effect of stirring rate on the oxidation of pfoa has been investigated using an overhead paddle stirrer fig s7 the results showed that there is a little change in the defluorination rate when the stirring rate exceeds 150 rpm while a decrease of defluorination rate at stirring rates of 100 rpm and below is observed since the 200 g l 1 tixo2x 1 and 10 g l 1 pd cnt particles cannot be maintained in suspension at these low stirring rates this result indicates that the quantity of conducting particles present in the suspension is a key determinant of rate of pfoa oxidation but that rate of contact of the particles with the anode is not a critical factor in brief and as suggested previously xie et al 2021a 2021b the flow anode particles can be charged via both contact with the bdd current collector and by contact with each other as a result of charge transfer through the percolating network of flow anode particles the effects of the mass ratio of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt were systematically investigated at 4 5 v in 5 mm kh2po4 solutions containing 10 mg l 1 pfoa fig 3c with results showing that a mixing mass ratio of 20 1 200 g l 1 tixo2x 1 and 10 g l 1 pd cnt is the most appropriate ratio with a fluoride production rate of 17 3 μmol h 1 the presence of f was not detected until the anode potential was set at 3 5 v vs ag agcl fig s8 and fig 3d as oh can be generated at the surface of tixo2x 1 at 2 58 v vs ag agcl fig 2b this suggests that the det process rather than the oh mediated oxidation process was the initial step of pfoa degradation a result also supported by dft simulations carter and farrell 2008 besides the second order rate constants of parent pfoa with oh are very low 105 106 l mol 1 s 1 radjenovic et al 2020 while the pfoa radicals formed by det processes have a much higher reaction rate with oh radjenovic et al 2020 further proving that the initial oxidation of pfoa should be a det mediated process the flow anode system enhanced the defluorination rates by 289 303 317 and 176 compared to controls at 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 v vs ag agcl respectively fig 3d therefore the following experiments were conducted at 4 5 v vs ag agcl in 5 mm kh2po4 solution containing 200 g l 1 tixo2x 1 and 10 g l 1 pd cnt if not otherwise stated the defluorination rates were also investigated in different electrolytes with the same concentration in each case fig 4 a the addition of flow anode particles increased the solution conductivities of kh2po4 kclo4 and k2so4 electrolytes from 555 4 1 523 8 1 and 1391 5 1 µs cm 1 to 896 8 4 879 8 3 and 2064 8 4 µs cm 1 respectively with these increases expected to facilitate charge transfer to the tixo2x 1 liu et al 2021c and pd cnt oshima et al 2020 particles although perphosphate could be generated at the bdd electrode polarized at 2 4 v or more vs she weiss et al 2008 the defluorination rate in kh2po4 solution 19 8 0 8 μmol h 1 was similar to that in kclo4 solution 20 1 0 7 μmol h 1 fig 4a besides the solution conductivity of kh2po4 896 8 4 µs cm 1 was also slightly higher than that of kclo4 879 8 3 µs cm 1 fig 4b indicating that perphosphate should have a little effect on the degradation of pfoa in comparison the defluorination rate in k2so4 solution 22 2 1 1 μmol h 1 fig 4a was higher than that in kh2po4 with this likely due to the higher solution conductivity of the k2so4 solution 2065 4 µs cm 1 fig 4b the formation and subsequent participation of so4 a powerful oxidant with a redox potential of 2 6 ev lee et al 2020 in the defluorination of pfoa in the flow anode system at 4 5 v vs ag agcl is also a possibility with previous studies showing that so4 is able to degrade pfoa efficiently via electron transfer lee et al 2010 yang et al 2020 besides the solution conductivity of 5 mm kh2po4 555 4 1 µs cm 1 is comparable to the conductivity typical of urban wastewater 500 1400 µs cm 1 golet et al 2001 rodrigo et al 2010 drinking water below 150 µs cm 1 mustonen et al 2008 and industrial wastewaters 500 20 000 µs cm 1 kadirvelu et al 2001 saja et al 2018 in order to further investigate the role of hydroxyl radicals in the degradation of pfoa three hydroxyl radical scavengers were used in the flow anode system though it should be recognized that the mechanisms of action of these scavengers are still under debate for instance zhao et al 2017 suggested that t butanol can be easily adsorbed on the surface of znfe2o4 cu3 particles and therefore used as the surface bound oh scavenger in contrast barazesh et al 2016 indicated that the surface bound oh present at the bdd anode surface was unable to be scavenged by saturated t butanol in addition ling et al 2016 indicated that methanol can be used as a quencher for oh both in bulk solution and on the surface of tio2 while wu et al 2019 and liang et al 2013 suggested that methanol may not accumulate on the surface of catalyst and can only be used as an oh aq scavenger despite the fact that the functional mechanisms of these additives are still unclear the addition of t butanol and methanol resulted in a decrease in the defluorination rate from 19 8 0 8 μmol h 1 to 9 7 1 2 and 6 3 0 4 μmol h 1 respectively fig 4a indicating that hydroxyl radicals surface bound oh and or oh aq played an important role in the degradation of pfoa the addition of ki almost completely suppressed the defluorination of pfoa with a low defluorination rate of 1 1 0 1 μmol h 1 obtained fig 4a since i ion can be easily adsorbed at the surface of the anodically polarized flow electrode and oxidized to i2 aq at 0 621 v vs she xu et al 2017 the addition of ki likely not only depressed the oh mediated oxidation process but also the det process leading to a substantial reduction in pfoa defluorination rate in the flow anodic oxidation system in light of the effects of these various additives we suggest that both oh mediated oxidation and det processes are critical to the degradation of pfoa in the flow anodic oxidation system in order to further clarify the factors contributing to the enhanced rate of pfoa degradation in the flow anode system compared to the control nyquist plots fig 4c and potential distributions fig 4d of the anodic compartment were measured r s and r ct values of the flow anode system decreased from 11 29 to 21 32 ω to 9 85 and 11 43 ω compared to the control fig 4c in addition the potential distributions in the anode tank were measured using two chi 660e systems with ag agcl electrodes as the working electrode in each case one was used for polarization of the anode current collector and the other to measure the potentials in the solutions by using an ag agcl electrode as the working electrode the solution potentials directly adjacent to the bdd current collector were 4 03 and 4 11 v vs ag agcl respectively in the control and the flow anode system fig 4d and decreased more rapidly with distance from the current collector in the control 0 075 v cm 1 compared to the rate of decrease 0 052 v cm 1 in the flow anode system fig 4d the rate of potential decrease with distance from the electrode 0 070 v cm 1 in the 8 6 mm kh2po4 solution with a conductivity of 900 2 µs cm 1 similar to that of the 5 mm kh2po4 solution containing flow anode particles 896 8 4 µs cm 1 was also measured fig s9 these results are in accord with the expected lower ohmic resistance in the solution containing the flow anode particles with this suspension exhibiting higher electrical conductivity compared to the control fig 4b in regard to the obtained results the enhanced defluorination rates are most likely related to the substantial increase in active surface sites provided by the presence of the pd cnt particles the larger amount of oh generated by tixo2x 1 particles and the higher solution conductivity in the flow anode oxidation system a schematic of the likely degradation pathway of pfoa in the flow anode system is shown in fig 5 with pfoa firstly adsorbed on the surface of the pd cnt particles attached to the surface of the tixo2x 1 particles the initial det oxidation of pfoa to form pfoa radicals would be expected to occur once the anode potential reached 3 5 v vs ag agcl finally the formed pfoa radicals constantly reacted with oh generated by flow anode particles mainly from tixo2x 1 particles to form the adsorbed intermediate products and the final products of f evidence of the nature of these adsorbed products was obtained by methanol extraction of organic compounds adsorbed to the pd cnt particles with subsequent hplc ms ms analysis of the extracted solution revealing the presence of short chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas c2 c6 fig s10 with these degradation products typical of a classical pfoa oxidation process in which the headgroup is cleaved and shorter chain perfluorinated carboxylates are formed radjenovic et al 2020 3 3 long term evaluation of flow anodic oxidation performance for pfoa removal the feasibility of continuous use of the flow anode uf integrated system was further evaluated over a 12 day period of operation based on the optimized parameters obtained in section 3 2 fig 6 a the initial pfoa concentration in the feed water was 10 mg l 1 and the feed stream flow rate was set at 0 83 ml min 1 the permeate flux was set at 19 82 l m 2 h 1 and the treated wastewater stored in the permeate tank the pfoa concentrations in ground waters and synthetic wastewaters of labs range from pg l 1 to mg l 1 and from μg l 1 to hundreds of mg l 1 respectively cheng et al 2010 radjenovic et al 2020 therefore 10 mg l 1 should be a reasonable value compared to the pfoa concentration in the contaminated ground waters and synthetic wastewaters in labs a potential of 4 5 v vs ag agcl was constantly applied at the anode and the concentrations of f pfoa and pd ions measured at scheduled times as can be seen from fig 6a the flow anode uf system reached a relatively stable status after about 18 h meanwhile the concentration of f at the outlet rapidly increased to 0 44 mm and then gradually decreased to a fairly stable value 0 34 mm fig 6a in comparison the concentration of f in the permeate tank quickly increased to a relatively stable value during the long term operation no pfoa or other intermediate products were detected at the outlet according to hplc and toc results and the total concentration of pd ions pb2 and pd4 in the permeate tank only slightly increased from 5 3 to 13 9 μg l 1 fig 6a with results indicating that the flow anode uf system was capable of continuous operation for 12 days with high stability in addition the total defluorination efficiency of this long term continuous experiment was calculated to be 94 1 although the energy consumption per order of pfoa removal was unable to be calculated due to the unmeasurable concentration of pfoa on the flow anode particle surfaces fig s5 and fig s6 the energy consumption per unit mass eeu of f of the flow anode uf system and some other pfoa treatment technologies with similar initial pfoa concentrations was compared indicating that the eeu of the flow anode uf system 38 1 wh mg 1 was comparable to other pfoa treatment technologies huang et al 2020 2016 li et al 2012 lou et al 2021 ochiai et al 2011 schaefer et al 2017 wang and zhang 2011 zhuo et al 2011 the flow anode system was further tested to treat a synthetic wastewater containing 2 mm kcl 2 mm k2so4 2 mm kh2po4 10 μm pfoa 100 μm phenol and 100 μm oxalate a defluorination efficacy of 71 6 was achieved at 4 5 v when treating the synthetic wastewater with this result indicating the potential of the flow anode system for pfoa degradation in a complex matrix fig s11 however the formation of clo3 and clo4 is problematic and attention needs to be given to investigation of approaches to eliminating formation of these troublesome byproducts fig s11 lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 the pressure drop across the tio2 uf membrane was measured using a differential pressure meter with no obvious variation of the pressure drop observed with results indicating that membrane fouling was minor over the extended period of operation fig s12 tio2 has been used extensively in heterogeneous photocatalysis systems not just because its excellent catalytic properties but also because of its high electrochemical stability towards hydroxyl radicals guo et al 2019 although hydroxyl radicals are generated in the flow anode system the tio2 ceramic membrane should be able to operate for extended periods without any obvious damage considering its high electrochemical stability xps was further used to investigate any changes in flow anode materials over the long term operation fig 7 the peaks of the ti 2p spectra located at 458 8 and 457 1 ev are related to the presence of ti4 and ti3 in tixo2x 1 particles respectively xie et al 2020 with results showing that the change of the ratio of ti4 and ti3 was not significant over the 12 days of operation fig 7 additionally no obvious changes were observed in the xrd pattern of tixo2x 1 after the long term operation fig s13 in comparison pd cnt particles was extensively oxidized the characteristic peaks of pd0 at 335 5 and 340 5 ev and pd2 at 336 5 and 341 5 ev decreased xu et al 2021 fig 7 while two new peaks at 338 1 and 343 1 ev were observed and associated with pd4 from the pdo2 phase velinova et al 2019 after the long term operation fig 7 indicating that pd nanoparticles attached on the surface of cnt were oxidized during the pfoa degradation process it should be noted that pd oxides are relatively stable even in acidic environments with this stability potentially the reason why few pd ions were released into solution fig 6a only 0 2 mg pd was lost during the long term operation the peaks located at 284 5 285 3 286 3 287 5 and 288 8 ev of the c 1 s spectra are related to cc c c c oh co and o co bonds respectively li et al 2021 fig 7 the intensity of the cc peak significantly decreased while the intensities of the peaks relating to oxygen containing functional groups obviously increased fig 7 suggesting that cnt was also unstable at high anode potentials the quantitative change of the pd and c oxidation states can be seen in table s1 although the electrochemical stability of pd cnt was unsatisfactory 1 g suspension of pd cnt successfully supported continuous operation of the flow anode uf system for 12 days with consistent removal of pfoa fig 6a the continuous oxidation of pd cnt may lead to the loss and or deactivation of the flow anode particles an advantage however of the flow anode system is that the suspended electrode particles can be easily replaced when the oxidized flow anode particles become ineffective the evident oxidation of the pd cnt assemblages however highlights the need for the development of anode materials with high electrochemical stability if this type of system is to find practical application as a viable advanced oxidation process conclusions in this study the degradation processes of pfoa in a continuously operated flow anode system using a mixture of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt particles as the flow anode were systematically investigated our results indicated that both det oh mediated oxidation and adsorption processes play an important role in the oxidation of pfoa with the synergistic effect of tixo2x 1 and pd cnt significantly enhancing the defluorination efficiency of pfoa from 30 2 to 95 7 at 4 5 v vs ag agcl in a dilute matrix in addition a continuously operated flow anode system was achieved by coupling a uf module and successfully maintained a high pfoa degradation performance for 12 days with a comparable energy consumption 38 1 wh mg 1 to other technologies and a relatively high defluorination efficiency 94 1 although the pd cnt particles were extensively oxidized after the long term operation no obvious amounts of pd ions were released into solution if need be the flow anode particles can be easily replaced via the uf located in the anode tank in conclusion results of this study confirm the feasibility of continuous operation of a flow anode system with high stability
